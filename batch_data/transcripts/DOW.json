Unless otherwise specified, all of our comparisons presented today will be on a year-over-year basis. Sales comparisons excluding divestitures, EBITDA, EBITDA margins, and earnings comparisons exclude certain items. The agenda for today's call is on Slide 3. I'll now hand the call over to Andrew. Andrew Liveris : Thank you, Doug and good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. As you have seen from our report this morning Dow delivered another quarter of earnings growth representing in fact our sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year increases. We delivered these results even in the midst of substantial weather and transport-related issues in the quarter and direct result of our relentless focus on operating discipline and execution, what we call self-help. That represent the latest and the steady drumbeat of performance on our march to north of $10 billion of EBITDA. If you look Slide 3, you will see that these results were illustrative of our clear strategic priorities that are shown on this slide. We are focused on delivering on our large investments such as Sadara, the U.S. Gulf Coast projects and our new project launches. But all the while driving on productivity and cost and cash control targets so as to ensure, we meet our earnings milestones and continue to grow our shareholder remuneration, and not to forget the large carve out on other divestments we have announced. These priorities align our entire organization as do a serious of execution steps many of which you are familiar with and some that is still to be revealed. They set the tone for delivering this year's earnings targets with a view to the large value and earnings drivers coming on stream next year. We will update you on all of these priorities later in this presentation. But for now, let me turn it over to Bill, who will discuss this quarter's financials. Bill Weideman : Thank you, Andrew. Let me begin by providing an overview of the quarter on Slide 5. We delivered earnings per share of $0.79 a 14% increase year-over-year and our net income increased to $964 million as a result of our cost and operating discipline. We increased sales to $14.5 billion with growth in most of our key segments led by performance plastics, coatings and infrastructure solutions and agricultural sciences where our top line growth continues to outpace the market. From a geographic perspective, we reported volume growth in nearly all regions most notably Asia Pacific led by growth in China. EBITDA grew to $2.4 billion and importantly we continued to make progress on achieving our margin targets across key businesses with margins expanding at the company level. Further on a trailing 12-month basis, we show steady improvement in ROC delivering the fifth sequential quarter of improvement against this key metric. We continued our strict management of cost and cash evidenced by nearly 30% increase in cash flow from operations year-over-year. And finally, with our stated priorities, we continued to reward shareholders returning $1.7 billion in the first quarter including the repurchase of $1.25 billion of our stock as part of our $4.5 billion share repurchase program, which we expect to complete in 2014. Slide 6, shows the key drivers of our financial performance this quarter. We can see the benefit of the targeted actions we took across our portfolio. We controlled what we could in a slow growth business environment focusing on productivity and driving growth through our global reach despite a $300 million increase of feedstock and energy costs, we reduced our cost of sales as a percentage of revenue reflecting our ongoing improvement actions. Before I turn the call back over to Andrew, let me provide you a few assumptions for modeling purposes as we head into the second quarter. While we see normal seasonality fluctuations in the second quarter specific to turnaround activity overall market trends remain favorable, which Andrew will speak to in a moment. Plan turnaround spending will be up approximately $150 million sequentially, but essentially flat year-over-year with the majority of the expense in performance plastics, performance materials and coatings and infrastructure. Additionally, we expect a higher seasonal turnaround activity will result in a 3 to 4 percentage points sequential reduction in the company's operating rate. And finally, as feedstock process have moderated, we expect feedstock and energy cost to be approximately $100 million lower sequentially still $150 million higher than the second quarter of 2013. With that I will turn the call back over to Andrew. Andrew Liveris : Thank you, Bill. We achieved margin expansion in all key operating segments and this is a solid proof point of the work we have done across our portfolio. Let me now update you on how the segments performed in the quarter and their outlook. Turning to Slide 8, growth in Dow Electronic Materials has been driven by increasing demand for connectivity and brighter, more powerful devices. This resulted in substantial sales growth in OLED materials and interconnect technologies as well as materials that address high-speed and temperature needs for cloud computing in the quarter. Additionally, our close to customer strategy will enable further margin expansion through its positive impact for the businesses operational productivity, including asset rationalizations in the United States and Europe. We expect full year and market in Dow growth to exceed that up 2013. In functional materials, we are seeing continued solid demand in targeted sectors of energy, water, food and home and personal care despite lower sales on weather impacts during the first quarter. Looking ahead, we see the trend towards unit dose in both fabric and dishwashing applications driving growth within the homecare sector. Additionally, sales in Dow Microbial Control also aligned to these key sectors continues to outpace the market. The positive trend in consumer driven solutions should see year-on-year growth in this business as well. On Slide 9 moving to Coatings and Infrastructure Solutions, strengthening global construction activity, North America, Europe and Asia Pacific was a key driver behind first quarter sales increases in architectural coatings. Further Dow Coating Materials reported its fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year sales growth bolstered by share gains resulting from sales of novel Dow Technologies such as VOC, in fact the first vinyl acrylic VOC launched in Europe in the first quarter. In Water, demand for industrial water applications is increasing and Dow expects to realize the benefit of these increases particularly in key regions such as Asia Pacific. Growth will be positive in 2014 versus 2013. In Dow Building & Construction, we noted strong demand for innovative materials in insulation, roofing and tile applications in North America, despite the adverse winter in this region. Japan and Europe, Middle East Africa also demonstrated signs of strength in the first quarter. This unit will see the same uptick from the same drivers as Dow Coating Materials. Collectively these increases drove profitable year-over-year growth for the business and served as a clear reflection of improving fundamentals in the construction sector. Additionally results in Dow Building & Construction are further supported by the benefit from previously announced productivity measures such as reduced structural costs and asset closures in Europe. Turning to Slide 10, in Agricultural Sciences, which continues to be the important growth market for Dow. Record first quarter sales in crop protection reflect increasing farmer demand for innovative new molecules to combat resistance. Looking ahead, sales from new crop protection products are on track to exceed $1 billion by 2015 as technology launches ramp up. We are positive on demand in the second quarter, although this confidence is tempered slightly by higher than normal channel inventories in North America. We have a positive outlook for top and bottom line growth in 2014. The same can be said for our Seeds business where we expect to continue to outpace the market on the strength of our differentiated technologies including SmartStax, Refuge Advanced and PowerCore as farmer demand for stacked traits accelerates importantly our Enlist launch plans progressed and remained on a firm trajectory for U.S. launch in 2015. We expect to receive the U.S. Regulatory approvals for this highly anticipated technology during the next few months. Turning to Slide 11, in Polyurethanes and Dow Formulated Systems we are seeing signs of recovery in Europe particularly as a result of higher furniture and bedding demand as well as increased consumer confidence in the region. In the first quarter, demand in industrial and energy efficiency markets also improved globally. Overall, we are well positioned to improve profitability as a result of our increased emphasis on higher value market sectors together with business specific productivity efforts, including the six asset shutdowns completed to-date. As we look ahead, we expect market demand to grow in the second quarter from increased construction activity in North America and EMEA while we anticipate Asia Pacific will benefit from the typical peak season in footwear. Severe cold temperatures impacted first quarter demand in North America across the Specialty Chemicals businesses. However, fundamentals remain healthy, as favorable trends in homecare products are driving growth for Dow Technologies aligned to this key end market. Additionally, fundamentals remain robust within Dow Oil, Gas & Mining as major project fills, increased geographical scale and positive market outlook are driving growth for this business. Looking forward, we expect to see a positive impact resulting from seasonal strength in construction, coatings and agriculture. And Dow Automotive Systems healthy transportation fundamentals are enabling growth in Asia Pacific and North America while Europe is realizing pent up demand and Dow specific technologies such as BETAMATE are driving additional share gains. We will see above industry growth rates in this unit in 2014. Turning to Slide 12, in Performance Plastics. Across this segment, we have and we will continue to focus on margin management to address feedstock fluctuations and deliver operational improvements. The opportunity to maximize margin with a price volume bounce is improving as their operating rates are very high and the industry operating rates continue to climb with the improving demand. Specifically in Dow Packaging & Specialty Plastics, we are driving growth in select high margin end markets such as flexible food and specialty packaging, hygiene and medical and pipe. Asia Pacific and North America delivered double-digit sales growth in the first quarter and we expect to see continued strong demand with increased per capita demand driving growth in emerging geographies over the near term. The outlook is strongly positive for this unit. In Dow Elastomers, global demand increases in the transportation sector and improving infrastructure markets in Europe were offset by cold weather impacts in operations in North America. Looking forward, U.S. Gulf Coast investments in the 2015, 2016 timeframe will drive growth for AFFINITY, a next generation nodal enabling share gain from substitute technologies in key sectors. For example, AFFINITY GA is delivering greater performance in hot melt adhesives allowing displacement of EVA in packaging and hygiene applications. And in Dow Electrical & Telecommunications increased demand in the power and telecommunication markets in Asia Pacific fueled first quarter growth driven by power in China and 4G network investments. Dow captured additional margin expansion in this business as a result of increased asset efficiency together with our exit from our non-strategic joint venture. Strong demand will continue in 2014. Turning to Slide 13, all of our segments are showing positive earnings momentum with self-help measures overcoming known headwinds. The last six months of improvement in EBITDA margins in all key segments is evident on this Slide. All of our collective actions are taking hold and showing positive trends from a range of 5% to 25% improvement. And on Slide 14, all these actions are cumulative, product and functional materials; growth in display technologies has been and will continue to be a key driver in innovation led growth for the Dow Electronic Materials business. Across the segment, we expect to utilize a combination of innovation and productivity measures to drive 100 to 150 basis points of margin improvement as we entered to adjacent markets and further expand key brand owner relationships. In Coatings and Infrastructure Solutions, margins are expanding as a result of ongoing productivity measures, share gains and increased sales of Dow Technologies, which collectively reflect the increasing recovery of the construction market. We expect to realize an additional 300 basis points of margin growth in this segment over the near term as these actions could continue to take hold. This margin expansion will include a significant benefit from the integration of our PDH unit in Texas. Agricultural Sciences has also expanded margins on the back of its technology innovations and productivity aligned measures. And looking ahead, these plans are expected to contribute to additional margin expansion of 300 to 400 basis points over the near term as a result of the ongoing commercialization of the segments robust R&D pipeline together with the achievement of scale efficiency in seeds. In Performance Materials, we expect to realize the most significant improvement with 400 basis points of margin expansion expected in the near term, the largest portion of these improvements will be driven by the integration of our PDH asset together with ongoing productivity improvements across the segment. Prioritize innovations in the oil and gas, automotive and adhesive sectors will also drive a component of this anticipated margin growth. And finally, in performance plastics currently our highest margin segment, we expect to realize near term margin uplift of 200 to 400 basis points on our key integration investments on the U.S. Gulf Coast as well as through innovation and productivity. All of these drivers are embedded in the previously shown strategic priorities, which brings me back to these priorities. And first let me remind you that we introduced Slide 16 first during our most recent webcast in March, which took place in Saudi Arabia at the site of our world-scale joint venture Sadara. We are making tremendous headway with this key investment and we are proud to join our value partner Saudi Aramco in providing an update regarding the status and timeline for this project all of which remained very much on track. In fact, we are now more than 50% complete and slated for start-up on time and on budget in mid-2015. Of course, this is just one the key near term strategic priorities we are driving to fuel our performance and returns higher. In our U.S. Gulf Coast investment program, we continue to achieve major milestones. For example, our PDH asset is now more than 20% complete with all major equipment on site and we continue to feel confident about its timing and its financials. I'm going to have more to say on that in a moment. As you saw in the quarter, our cost reduction of working capital focus continues to produce results and enabling increased earnings and strong cash flow and our plain carve out of our commodity chlorine business remains on track with an update later in this deck. Dow steady drum beat of progress is the direct outcome of our focus on these priorities as we move this strategy forward and turning to Slide 17. It's a strategy that leverages Dow's unique business model. We integrated vertically and horizontally. We are low cost across the chain shown here plus value-add as we approach markets with unique technologies. We have scaled in inputs, intermediates, and downstream products. We have scale in R&D as well as in geographic breadth. And we are relentlessly focused on EVA and capital allocation growing high ROC businesses and exiting our low ROC businesses. Importantly, we grow by winning across these chains. We will update you regularly on all of these chains with simple and transparent metrics. And today, we will highlight the propylene value chain where over the past six months we have realized higher returns as a result of our focus on margin management and operational excellence. This is particularly clear as you look at the significant progress achieved within our coatings and infrastructure solutions and performance materials operating segments during this timeframe. We laid our plans to improve these segments, our two largest propylene consuming segments. And we have made solid progress against these plans yet we recognize, we have more work to do. And on top of these actions, we expect to achieve EBITDA growth as a result of our near term investments with the Sadara as well as the aforementioned PDH unit on the U.S. Gulf Coast. In short, we are improving our ability to compete in the value chain for that has compelling growth proposition over both near and longer term. Now let me provide more granularity on Slide 18, here the propylene value chain serves several key sectors and Dow is focused narrowly on several of these targeted end markets, markets with an addressable size of $80 billion and growing faster than GDP. We are taking key actions to improve our integration advantage, drive further operating discipline and prioritizing our technology investments to preferentially invest in attractive end markets such as adhesives, automotive, and energy efficiency to name a few, no way this more evident that in the polyurethanes business. And turning to Slide 19, let me highlight this. We have achieved notable improvements through the following actions reducing costs, idling facilities, narrowing our market focus and launching new products and technologies that are shown on the slide. But let me use one example, BETAMATE, Dow Automotive Systems is directly aligned with the market trends of light weighting to improve energy efficiency and deliver safer, high performing products to the industry. This solution allows bonding of dissimilar materials with aluminum, plastic and carbon fiber notably nearly 50% of revenue of Dow Automotive Systems comes from sales of products launched within these last five years. Taken as a whole, we will continue to reap benefits from our collective actions and we expect our innovative products and technologies, couple with our productivity actions and our strategic integration investments to drive significant margin uplift within this value chain. But further, let me highlight our key integration investment in this chain, our PDH facility on Slide 20. First, a word on the fundamentals of this project, Dow's current outlook on the propane to propylene spread remains consistent with our regional economics and reinforces why as we see our PDH facility as delivering a further attractive value to this chain. Propane prices have moderated again after significant volatility during one of the worst winters in the United States in over 30 years. The United States is now a net exporter of propane, and we believe the U.S. propane price must remain structurally lower than the world market price to facilitate these exports. Add to this fact, the propylene availability from refineries is coming down and the propylene value will trend towards outlook value. We expect propylene to be an attractive spread over propane. And this is precisely why our PDH unit in Freeport, Texas represent such an important part of our strategy in this value chain, once online, this project will improve integration significantly reduce third party purchases and improve our raw materials costs to Dow's derivative businesses in this value chain. Today construction on this unit is 20% complete, we have approximately 1600 workers and 90% of the equipment onsite. Mechanical completion is on track for the end of first quarter 2015 with full run rate expected by mid-2015. In short, our long-term view on this project is unchanged and we expect the propane to propylene spread will provide an attractive returns for our PDH project, expect to contribute more than $450 million annual EBITDA at full run rate. Turning to Slide 21, the propylene chain is just one example of how we are leveraging our strong operational focus, coupled with significant enterprise wide catalysts within our control to drive EBITDA well north of $10 billion when all are fully implemented. We have key growth catalysts, such as our investments in Sadara and on the U.S. Gulf Coast as well our innovation agenda, which collectively are positioning Dow to achieve EBITDA well north of $10 billion in the near term on our way to $13 billion and beyond. The math of the slide shows 2014 and 2017 actions that grow to more than $13 billion in EBITDA from our current base. Items such as lower pension expense, more operating leverage and further productivity efforts are all extras to these value drivers. In addition, we are focused laser-like on delivery against our divestment targets, so they can grow ROC. So we can grow ROC by liberating capital allocation to these businesses and putting it to better use. And turning to Slide 22, as you know, in 2013 alone we realized $850 million in proceeds from divestitures exceeding our year end goal. And in March, we broadened scope of our already aggressive targets bringing our expected total to $4.5 billion to $6 billion within the 2014-2015 timeframe. Of course, our largest share of activity is the plant curved out of our commodity chlorine businesses. We reviewed to you in December that you can think about a 12 to 24 month timeline for this project and after just 4 months of progress the preparation period is really already well underway. Initial market response to our announcement has been positive with strong early interest with double-digit numbers of strategic parties who want to go to the next step. Additionally, we now have our pre-marketing actions started and our team has made great progress on the separation of these business units from Dow. In fact, we expect to be in the market by third quarter of this year. And looking at our overall program given the magnitude of our divestiture program going forward, our portfolio will continue to change and upgrade. As such, we will continue to provide increased transparency on our earnings as a result of these actions. And as we move forward, you can expect to see additional clarity on our targets, revised metrics and updated business alignments and segments that will reflect our accelerated market driven strategy with more transparent metrics yet this year. Turning to Slide 23, the final priority I wish to speak to is the most important to all \u2013 for us that are rewarding our shareholders, an area in which we have demonstrated consistent and increasing actions over the last many quarters accommodating in the $1.7 billion return by declared dividends and share repurchases in the first quarter alone. We remain committed to our share buyback target of $4.5 billion in total all to be completed by the end of this year. Taken on the whole, these actions clearly reinforce our commitment to accelerating returns now and as our earnings increase going forward. Lastly on Slide 24, back to our near term strategic priorities. These remain our compass as we move ahead. Each priority is integral to the acceleration of our strategy and serves a critical step in our part to shareholder value growth. Let me be clear, Dow's performance in the first quarter represents more than a continuation of the trend of consecutive quarters of earnings growth. In our view, it's the sum of the quality of our earnings the consistency of the performance and the strength of our trajectory that we are focused on and we will continue to deliver on as we move ahead. We are driving our actions independent of any tailwinds that exist out there which we are treating as a complete bonus. The summary is, we intend to continue to deliver. With that Doug let's turn to Q&A. Doug May : Thank you, Andrew. Now we'll move to your questions. First, however, I would like to remind you that my comments regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. Lauren, would you mind going through the Q&A procedure? Operator : Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs. Robert Koort : Thank you and good morning. Andrew Liveris : Good morning. Robert Koort : Andrew I noticed on the income statement there was a quite reduction in your R&D this quarter year-on-year, can you give us some clarity around what drove that and what we should expect looking forward? Andrew Liveris : I will let Bill answer that question, if don't mind Bob. Go ahead. Bill Weideman : Yes, Bob. So you are right. Overall R&D expense was down $40 million quarter-over-quarter or around 10% that's really reflective of a couple of things. One, the ongoing savings from previously announced restructuring program that we announced last year. As you know from an overall company standpoint not just R&D, we said we get a couple of $100 million of additional savings this year over the last year. In addition to that, we also have reprioritized our spending on growth projects with R&D focusing our spending specifically on those projects that Andrew has laid out. It's really a combination of both of those, ongoing savings and the prioritization of our growth projects. Robert Koort : All right. If I might follow-up Andrew, one of your major raw material suppliers announced on ethane export facility that's somewhere around the order of 25% of current ethane production. Just wondering if you might update us, you talked to propane already but what your views on ethane and is there going to be a big escalation in prices somewhere out in the horizon when all the crackers get built and these export projects are delivered? Andrew Liveris : Yes. We saw the announcement Bob. And we believe it's still early to put definitive answers out there. Other than to say that there is a huge material cost to export ethane. As you know a very different to propane it needs capital like energy, it needs capital to the export side, the shipping side and the receiving side. And to put these contracts in place for ethane consumers they are going to have to commit capital. And it all comes down to a view to the oil and company arbitrage. And current arbitrage is at probably its highest is roughly 24 something around that right now. Our assumptions are being that that arbitrage will close with time and that's oil to gas and therefore naphtha to ethane. And as it closes, the economics change and the prices that people can get to export ethane will drop. So it's actually in our view a strong message of ethane length, which we believe is beyond 2020 at this point in time. Operator : Our next question comes from John McNulty with Credit Suisse. John McNulty : Yes. Good morning thanks for taking my question. So I believe it was in Bill's comments, one of the geographies, actually the geography you highlighted is being the strongest that you are seeing was actually China and Asia kind of more broadly, which is I guess a little bit surprising. So can you walk us through what you are seeing there and maybe which end markets in particular maybe showing the greatest signs of strength? Andrew Liveris : If you look, I think John there is no question that China is not our previous China. So I believe the current China we are seeing in our results speak to it is the China of less growth, it's on a bigger number obviously. But they have changed their consumption drivers to solve their issues. And the reform agenda they have and I have been to China twice this year already. It's very clear they are committed to it and smart urbanization is creating different needs affordable housing, affordable transportation, clean \u2013 everything clean from food safety to pollution control et cetera. So we are seeing growth in high value add sectors, so its targeted growth, our growth was 9%. And our positioning in China is really being ever sense we into China in the big way in the last 10 years. As being in the high value add sector, almost anticipating this new China. We had volume gains in ag 65%, performance plastics 22% growth, coatings up 13%, electronic and functional materials up 6%. This is all high value-add area. They are decommoditizing their economy but we are not exposed to the commodity sector in China. The new Dow's in place in China actually is always a consequence of that its targeted growth. I don't think it's a go-go growth of the previous China. It's not export led. And I do think this pivot disappearing is smart targeted growth. John McNulty : Great. Thanks very much and then just as a follow up with regard to weather in particular, there were some negatives obviously in the U.S. You also highlighted some positives around ag and potentially some of the other businesses out of Europe just because of the \u2013 they kind of unseasonally warm side. I guess, when we net them out, how should we think about how weather impacts during the quarter and then how that kind of reserves itself as we look to the rest of the year. Bill Weideman : Sure, John. This is Bill. So from an overall standpoint, you are right, I mean the weather was very cold in North America, but it was partially offset by warmer weather in Europe. From an overall standpoint, the overall impact in our sales is a little over $100 million and the impact on our earnings per share this quarter was like $0.03 to $0.04 in total. Another thing I would like to highlight in North America, one of the things we did very quickly is, we implemented a crisis team as these carrier issues came in. And so we were able to mitigate some of that impact versus some of the other numbers maybe seen in the market. But overall, the answer to your question, it added about $0.03 to $0.04 negative impact on our earnings this quarter. Andrew Liveris : With Europe's positive slightly overcoming that so Europe strong oversized early spring, there is obviously a pull forward there that's occurred in first quarter that won't be there in the second quarter Europe, but the North American seeds is delayed. So that should start to bounce. So the first half on average will be what we expect on year-on-year growth. Operator : Our next question comes from Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo Securities. Frank Mitsch : Good morning, gentlemen. Hey, Andrew. Just want to take the opportunity, thank you again for the hospitality on the Sadara trip certainly a great learning experience that we had there. And obviously, a large of the Sadara is obviously tied into the whole ethylene chain and so froth, which becks the question you really didn't spend a lot of time talking about the feedstocks and energy segment here this morning. Should we start thinking about that as discontinued operations, can you help us other? Andrew Liveris : Well, you are foreshadowing one of the comments I had in the script, which is really all about Dow's market focus in feedstocks and energy is the last segment that's out there that's very commodity exposed. You know these chemicals in there, some of the -- MEGlobal for examples in there. And clearly, our hydrocarbon byproduct, co-product sales are in there, which are highly volatile and highly commoditized and frankly don't serve the purpose of being market-based. So as we go forward, recasting about metrics in those segments, I think you will foreshadowing something that we are very way much of the way we report in the future. It's not a market segment at the end of the day Frank and certainly not one that we are focused on. It's all about low cost inputs and value-add, which is that slide that shows integration. And thank you for the compliment on Sadara, our team did a bang up job and partner was extraordinary. Frank Mitsch : Okay, great. And then, just coming back on the ag side obviously, record earnings there. Crop protections seem to be very strong. Should we be thinking about this is a new normal, I mean, it seem like you are also implying that some of the new products happening in that segment, you are seeing nothing but growth there. So are we seeing crop protection establish a new bottom here? Andrew Liveris : I believe that crop protection and certainly our crop protection business is a story that's unfolding around new projects. Five, ten years ago most of us including Dow, would have said crop protection was going to plateau at the expense of seeds and traits growing and that hasn't happened. I think you are seeing targeted niche products, whether they are being cereal herbicides, rice herbicides our two launches, even insecticides and of course fungicides which were not as big in, but some of our competitors are. And I do think you are seeing a new type of crop protection chemical, some of it of course made through fermentation processes like our families of new crop protection chemicals. Our R&D efforts never really subsided here and frankly its one of the jewels in our integration if you like of Dow's R&D with ag chemical R&D. Season traits will obviously still be a growth business and for Dow very hinged on our stacking capabilities and clearly enlist launch. But no, I think you are dead right, and I'm using that same term with our business, a new norm. Operator : Our next question comes from Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial. Don Carson : Andrew a question on ag and that's not in Enlist. You are talking about a 2015 approval and I know that your licensees have also licensed a competing technology. So it's really two questions. One, what's your expectation of Enlist versus Dicamba market share where you think that's going to play out. And then from a portfolio standpoint is, once you have seen the market acceptance of Enlist, is that really the catalysts to perhaps separate a business with essentially little fit with, with the rest of Dow? Andrew Liveris : Well, firstly on the point on approval in your question. Don, it's actually approval this year for full launch next year 2015. On your competitive question, we believe Enlist has a much wider window of application timing and broad spectrum of control that actually aligns with how growers use glycoside today. We are getting a lots of farmer sanction on the product because of this incredible wide window and broad spectra. And actually of course the other big advantage which comes with the Colex-D Technology which has reduced potential for drift and volatility. It's really a combo of very user friendly application call abilities that are causing this product be a potential blockbuster. Look, your second question, at the end of the day, we have said, we are always have various business on the table at Dow and that includes Dow Sciences, one that gets asked about quite a lot. I wand to refer to the previous question that was asked which is Dow ag chem is very integrated into Dow proper. It gives a lot of leverage from co-R&D in chemistry. So Dow seeds is a little different but it shares similar channels to Dow crop chem. So it's not an easy \u2013 as easy as you indicated in your question but that doesn't defy your question. In fact, a very user friendly as its entire board and management team of Dow to look at value creation and its happening separation at the right moment in time that will be what we will do. Operator : Our question comes from P.J. Juvekar with Citi. P.J. Juvekar: Yes. Good morning Andrew. Andrew Liveris : Good morning. P.J. Juvekar: And you discussed some of your bigger joint ventures like Dow Corning, it seems like you are seeing a recovery there with some solar trends and all that. So can you discuss that? And then related to that is, would you consider monetizing any joint ventures to capture value? Bill Weideman : P.J. let me answer the first question on Dow Corning and you can ask the second question. From Dow Corning, you are right. Overall equity earnings were I think \u2013 if I recall about $251 million this quarter up $22 million versus the same quarter a year ago. That was all driven from Dow Corning actually Dow Corning was up more than that because there partial offset by lower equity earnings and MEGlobal as Andrew mentioned in his comments. We are seeing a polysilicone as bottom and we are actually seeing some price increases in polysilicone. And so we are starting to see a recovery in our Dow Corning earnings and we expect that to continue. Andrew Liveris : Cleanup of our very large joint venture portfolio is a big driver of our strategic priorities, you will see it listed on there and that's not code for any specific joint venture. But it is code for cleaning it up, making the results more transparent to all of you such is the first question you just asked. So you understand that drivers and that they fit the strategy or they don't. Today's Dow portfolio management is all about going deeper and narrower not staying wide and that includes a joint venture portfolio P.J. P.J. Juvekar: Yes. Secondly in performance in materials, you talked about improving polyurethanes, can you also just talk about isocyanates like MDI and then in epoxies do you think you are seeing some kind of a rebound? Andrew Liveris : Definitely in epoxies to answer that first the Chinese are going to shut capacity but they are not going to shut epoxies. They have chosen their path to fundamentally glove the market with epichlorohydrin and before that caustic soda. We believe it's a structural change in the entire market. Some of the value added epoxies will earn money in the niche application but we don't have scale there. We are mostly are LER, liquid epoxy resin provider of intermediate to end use. We don't believe it's a good use of Dow capital to do the value-add. So therefore we made our announcements. We are improving the business. We are running it very lean and mean. So it can actually be on sold to someone who can see value in completing the entire value chain but it's a value chain that we are voting on as you have seen in our announcements. Look, MDI is different, MDI is the restructural of over capacity especially in Asia but the growth fundamentals are much, much more sound for isocyanates especially the platform called polyurethane formulation systems in rigid polyols in particular. Without new facilities in Sadara, we will be a grower of how isocyanates position especially in the emerging markets. And over time, we look at the competitiveness of our assets use in United States and Europe. But right now, PU is a business that we believe is on a solid rebound as witnessed by the Q1 results. Operator : Our next question comes from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. David Begleiter : Thank you. Andrew, in performance materials given the severe weather in Q1, how should we think about the normal decline in Q2 versus Q1 given maybe some bounce back in Q2? Andrew Liveris : Well, I mean at the end of the day, performance materials and polyurethanes within performance materials and some of the specialty chemicals until PDH comes on, we are going to see volatility in their numbers quarter-to-quarter because of propylene. The unfortunate situation is being in the last many years propylene dynamic between U.S. and the rest of the world changed dramatic especially to Asia. And this propylene arbitrage it was on one of my slides that was solving for PDH is the game changer in less volatility quarter-to-quarter. While we get the acolyte value effect on less and less propylene coming out of U.S. refineries, you are going to see chemical grade propylene bouncing around a lot. We are the elastic demand to the inelastic demand on the transportation side as you get summer driving, the winter heat-cooling or summer heating, summer cooling, winter heating, you are going to get these effects. So we think that's a normal pattern that you are going to see a repeat of in Q2. Bill do you want to add to me? Bill Weideman : Yes. I was saying as Andrew mentioned we set some volatility. We do believe second quarter though will be up year-over-year and the primary reason for that is the fact that this performance material was impacted in the first quarter due to some carrier issues. So we do expect in the second quarter year-over-year improvement versus second quarter a year ago. David Begleiter : Very good. Andrew same thing on sequential in ag given a normal decline but given some of the dynamics there as well. How do you look at that sequential decline in Q2 versus Q1 this year? Andrew Liveris : We will definitely see a sequential decline. I mean the sequential earnings drop off of couple of hundred million dollars is probably what you should be expecting based on normal seasonality. You do have this effect of the weather in Q1 that can be a slight mitigator to that. So it could be on the lower side of the drop off versus what it\u2019s been in traditional seasons because obviously but you guys probably getting decent weather in that part of the world now. So that means people are planting. And so that's good and they obviously have to make up for what happened in Q1. But look at the end of the day, there is also the crop commodity price effect. They are in healthy levels. They are providing the incentive for yield maximizing inputs. Farmers are less sensitive spending when it maximized yield. So you know we may see some mitigating effect based on the fact that we have got good seeds that go to that area. But, I think you are going to still see the drop off. Operator : Our next question comes from Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Duffy Fischer : Yes. Good morning. Andrew Liveris : Good morning. Duffy Fischer : Andrew I think in your commentary you mentioned some excessive inventory in the ag channel. Andrew Liveris : Yes. Duffy Fischer : Can you talk about which of the pesticides you are seeing that in most of the pesticides, herbicides, fungicides and then two, why would we be seeing that as we still got a relatively a healthy ag market today? Andrew Liveris : Yes. I mean look I think there is no question that the carrier and warehousing impact due to weather in March affected this chain as well. As you will know this is a very long lead time chain. So if you get the seasons and the plantings wrong, I'm not going to call this a once in a decade type winter, but boy, as I said earlier, that was a very unusual effect on transportation. So late application that was missed in 2013 as stacked up into 2014 plus the weather impacts in March as given in particular to answer the first part of your question, more inventory in crop protection areas for herbicides in particular, but mostly in the Midwest. Duffy Fischer : And then, on the Chlor-Alkali front, where are you guys that with operating rates with the Dow Mitsui joint venture. And then how should we think about the timing of the 800 KT that you guys have indicated you are going to take down on the back end of bringing up that new capacity? Andrew Liveris : Started up on March 31, successful, reliable within our start up window very, very much running now, very reliably its very important investment for replacing those aged assets that you just referred to. We have begun the shut down of those aged assets right now, we were in the early stages of it. But you can expect it over the next six to nine months. Operator : Our next question comes from Kevin McCarty with Bank of America. Kevin McCarty : Yes. Good morning. Andrew on Slide 20, you show the propane and propylene spread, the bearish argument that we sometimes hear is that propane exports will rise and propylene will get longer as you and others start up PDH units domestically. Can you elaborate on why your view is more bullish in that and how would you expect future spreads to compare to the recent range of 36 in the older range of 25 that you showed? Andrew Liveris : Well, at the end of the day the long propane and export phenomena has to be matched against long propane and export phenomena from other countries. And whether it would be Qatar or Australia or Indonesia, everyone is long propane. So where is all this propane going to go rather than a drop in global propane prices. So as new LNG facilities in particular those that are LPG rich come on, you are going to find that the historic relationship between propane to Brent which is being 65 to 70. There will be some pressure into that relationship. And the propane price is going to come down and Brent will go down with it as you get share will come in into place. So there is a lot of moving parts here to suggest at the end of the day that U.S. propane exports aren't going to be the bonanza everyone thinks they are going to be in terms of returns. In fact the U.S. propane price will need to be about $200 a ton by our calculation, $0.35 to $0.30 a gallon lower than the European price to facilitate these exports. On the other side of the coin, propylene availability is going to be an issue in our view because the refineries coming down and FCC units are being shutdown due to long gasoline. And at the end of the day, propylene value as I said earlier will move to outlet value. So propylene is going to stay up. So our PDH economics are very conservative in their assumptions don't have the current arbitrage that exists. And as I said early on ethane, on the earlier question, I do believe it implies a propane to propylene spread of $0.30 to $0.35 which supports our $450 million a year of EBITDA that I talked about. That spread today has averaged from $0.36 to currently around $0.40. Kevin McCarty : I appreciate the color there. As a follow-up, Bill, can you speak to the diluted share count as a bit of a surprise to see the elevations sequentially? What was your carry out at the end of the quarter and what might be a good number for 2Q? Bill Weideman : You get to continue to see that going down obviously, as you know that's an average, so that's an average for the quarter. And so but given our significant share repurchase in the first quarter the $1.250 billion, you will see, starting to see that track down pretty quickly. I don't have the exact share count for the second quarter. But \u2013 Operator : Our next question comes from John Roberts with UBS. John Roberts : Good morning. Andrew Liveris : Good morning John. John Roberts : I'm looking at Slide 19 on the polyurethanes business, I remember the last bubble chart we saw I think headed at 7% or around 7% EBITDA margin. So it would seem to you need multiples of that 200 bps improvement to get this to your targets? Andrew Liveris : Well, yes. And I have talked to exactly one of those big multiples right which is the PDH. So that's as I said that's why we gave you a lot of color on PDH on this call is that this time next year, we are in the throws of getting that ready to start up. And so that's a big part of the polyurethanes rehab story to make your observation act. The other thing that's going on, in the early question, is it some market rebound, which is suits our type of polyurethanes especially with Europe coming back remember with a long and exposed in Europe and last but not least is the cost controls and the way Glenn Wright and his team are managing that business very focused on execution against cost and cash. And all those things and the CFO and I spend a lot of time on this business, how to take it away from a yellow into a green. John Roberts : Okay. And then as a follow-up on the chlorine carve out, have you set the chlorine cost of contract terms yet for your internal needs longer term? Andrew Liveris : Bill? Bill Weideman : No. Looking into a detailed negotiation going forward as Andrew mentioned in his prepared comments to tell you where we are at. We are targeting how to carve out completed this quarter and then we will get into detailed discussions in the third quarter. So we get into the discussions in the third quarter that's when we will start getting into those detail discussions. Doug May : Lauren maybe time for one or two more questions. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global Advisors. Hassan Ahmed : Good morning, Andrew. Andrew Liveris : Good morning, Hassan. Hassan Ahmed : I was taking a look at the performance plastic segment and completely, completely understand that we had the weather related sort of spike in ethane prices in particular and gas obviously as well. But, I'm just trying to understand the sort of sequential down take in EBITDA and EBITDA margins because I sort of at least run my numbers. Integrated polyethylene margins despite the spike seen to be up sequentially. So I'm just trying to understand what the sort of sequential down take was caused by, was it Asia, was it Europe, any color around that will be appreciated? Andrew Liveris : Well, I mean there are several you mentioned one of the factors, so I won't repeat it. But certainly the cold winter propane impact was for the propane part of the crack was a big impact Hassan. And the other one was the reduced margins in Europe in particular due to the naphtha and what was going on in lower selling prices causing a down drop. I haven't said it on the call yet. But I have said in other interviews that you can't ignore what's going on with Russia and the Ukraine and the effect it had on hydrocarbons in that part of the world. And so that was another reason. At the end of the day, we believe there is a set in the pool, we have got good momentum in plastics and margins going up this year for the reasons you know. So I think you shouldn't read too much in the Q4 to Q1 numbers. Hassan Ahmed : Fair enough. And as a follow-up, you highlighted obviously in the presentation the polyurethane side of the business and you are talking about things call it cycling up. There is obviously a fair bit of capacity coming on line over the next couple of years. Could you speak a bit about the supply/demand dynamic did you see over the next two, three years? Andrew Liveris : Oh, yes. I mean this part of the question it came early on isocyanates. There is going to be length in isocyanates and MDI and that's going to have to be consumed. The good news is, this ubiquitous market needs for polyurethanes especially those by isocyanates and MDI in particular and this growth is going to be above GDP. And so if you got the low cost position which we believe our unit in Sadara is low cost. We are going to be able to grow above at or above market for our polyurethanes franchise. The other bigger name of course the polyols positioned here in North America gets enhanced by PDH. But on isocyanates, I think this is all about moving to higher value markets as I said on the call. And the team has done a very good job of getting out of the low end markets and fine tuning where we point the low cost assets too. The value-add piece here distinguishes it from the Epoxy business. Doug May : Great. Time for one more question. Operator : Our final question comes from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Vincent Andrews : Thanks very much for squeezing me in. Bill just, could you tell us about the operating rate in the quarter versus the fourth quarter and versus the year ago? And then I also just wanted to clarify your comments on the operating rate for the second quarter whether you were talking about the entire company or just the specifics segments of it? Bill Weideman : So the operating rate for the company in the third quarter was 83% and that's versus 82 and the same quarter a year ago and 82% prior quarter. So we are up 1 percentage point at a company level versus both the same quarter a year ago and prior quarter. Yes. And the comments that I made in terms of expect that 3 to 4 percentage points decrease second versus first due to turnaround is very much inline is at a company level, is very much inline at the same reduction we saw a year ago from first to second and its all just \u2013 its just turnaround driven it's not demand driven. And so it\u2019s at a company level. Vincent Andrews : Okay. This is a follow-up maybe Andrew. Could you talk a bit about your expectations from an acreage perspective for Enlist, if you are able to launch it in 2015, how many acres you are going to target and what that ramp could look like over the first three or four years? Andrew Liveris : We are not giving that sorry to end up the call on question, I got one answer. But, we are not giving that piece of information yet. But, let the year roll by. Let's get our approvals behind us and we will give you a lot of granularity as times goes by. We are very confident on this technology obviously as I answered a previous question. Doug May : Great. Thank you, Andrew. Do you want to make a couple of wrap up comments here? Andrew Liveris : Well, I think we will go back to what this quarter was, which is a strong beat based on self-help. And the last many quarters, six quarters in a row year-on-year earnings increase is a trend that we intend to continue. And we intend to continue no matter what the economy throws at us. I think there are no questions that we have got the divestitures in front of us and there is going to be execution there. We will have a lot more to say about transparency on metrics as the year rolls by. But, you should expect Dow to continue execute against its portfolio and release value and then increase shareholder remuneration and notably the share buyback that you saw quite a lot of action on in the quarter will continue throughout the year as we have already talked about. And that's more to come basically we cycled upside in plastics and ethylene still in front of us. Doug May : Great. Thank you. Thank you everyone for your questions and joining us this morning. We appreciate your interest in Dow. For your reference, a copy of the prepared comments will be posted on Dow's website later today. This concludes our call and we look forward to speaking with you again soon. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation.",

You may signal to ask a question by pressing star, one at any time during today\u2019s presentation. Also, today\u2019s call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Doug May, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Doug May : Thank you, Lauren. Good morning everyone and welcome. As usual, we\u2019re making this call available to investors and the media via webcast. The call is the property of the Dow Chemical Company. Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without Dow\u2019s written consent is strictly prohibited. On the call with me today are Andrew Liveris, Dow\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Bill Weideman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Around 7 :00 am this morning, July 23, our earnings release went out on business wire and was posted on the internet on dow.com. We have prepared slides to supplement our comments on this conference call. These slides are posted on our website and through the link to our webcast. Some of our comments today include statements about our expectations for the future. Those expectations involve risks and uncertainties. We cannot guarantee the accuracy of any forecast or estimates, and we don\u2019t plan to update any forward-looking statements during the quarter. If you\u2019d like more information on the risks involved in forward-looking statements, please see our SEC filings. In addition, some of our comments reference non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures are contained in our earnings release and on our website. Unless otherwise specified, al comparisons presented today will be on a year-over-year basis. Sales comparisons exclude divestitures, EBITDA, EBITDA margin, return on capital, and earnings comparisons exclude certain items. The agenda for today\u2019s call is on Slide 3. I will now hand the call over to Andrew. Andrew Liveris : Thank you, Doug. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. As you noted from our release this morning, Dow delivered another quarter of earnings growth, achieving impressive results on both the top and bottom line. Our foundation is solid. We\u2019re delivering consistent earnings growth, driving strong cash flow from operations, improving return on capital, and aggressively pursuing portfolio rationalization, all the while increasingly rewarding our shareholders. Specifically on Slide 3, you\u2019ll see that earnings per share grew 16% year-over-year; in fact, this represents our seventh consecutive quarter of EPS, EBITDA and EBITDA margin growth. On the top line, we delivered sales increases across all operating segments, and this included a first half sales and EBITDA record in Dow Agricultural Sciences. When coupled with the company\u2019s ongoing productivity improvements, these sales gains drove EBITDA margin expansion of 40 basis points, reaching 15%. In particular, we delivered a significant improvement in performance materials. EBITDA was up 36%, a strong example of our productivity actions taking hold. We also achieved EBITDA increases in other key segments such as electronic and functional materials and performance plastics. Importantly, we achieved the results even in the midst of a continued slow growth environment and with some meaningful headwinds from purchase feedstocks and energy costs as well as planned and unplanned outages. Our results this quarter represent steady and continuous improvement in return on capital and illustrate progress against our strategic priorities which are clearly focused on rewarding shareholders. We\u2019re delivering our results as promised \u2013 this is our commitment and our top priority. We\u2019ll update you on all these priorities later in the presentation. For now, let me turn it over to Bill Weideman who will discuss this quarter\u2019s financials. Bill? Bill Weideman : Thank you, Andrew. Let me begin on Slide 5 with the highlights for the second quarter. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.74 per share. This compares with $0.64 per share in the same quarter last year. Earnings grew 16% as a result of increased sales and lower costs. Sales were up 3% to $14.9 billion. Increases were reported in all operating segments led by performance plastics, as well as sales gains in electronic and functional materials and ag. EBITDA was $2.2 billion. EBITDA gains were led by performance materials with notable increases also reported in electronic and functional materials and performance plastics, reflecting our business-by-business approach to driving both growth and productivity. I will now turn to Slide 6 where you can see the drivers of our performance this quarter where we increased margins and drove sales growth in all operating segments. The company also benefited from ongoing productivity measures which enabled higher asset utilization and additional cost reductions. These efforts overcame the headwinds Andrew mentioned earlier in the call, including more than $100 million from the outages in Plaquemine. Further, we remain on track with our commitment to associate with our restructuring actions. Before turning the call back to Andrew, I will close with some insights regarding what we expect to see in the third quarter. Overall, we are not planning on any meaningful macroeconomic improvement in the back half of the year. We expect ag sales to decline sequentially in line with typical seasonal patterns, and we expect ongoing market demand and positive pricing dynamics to drive continued strong results in performance plastics. Planned turnaround spending will decline about $50 million versus the second quarter levels; however, these costs will increase about $75 million to $100 million versus the third quarter of last year with the planned turnarounds. The majority of this increased spend is expected to impact feedstock and energy, performance plastics, and performance materials. Capital expenditures for the year are estimated to be between $3.4 billion and $3.6 billion, reflecting a deliberate effort to accelerate the start-up of our key growth projects. Now I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Andrew. Andrew Liveris : Thank you, Bill. In summary, the second quarter is another solid proof point of Dow\u2019s progress and the outcome of focused actions we continue to take on the top and bottom line to drive earnings increases across our portfolio. We are delivering on our strategic priorities, which are shown on Slide 8. These priorities are bridging our near-term execution in 2014 with our near-term strategy of generating sustainable returns once our key projects start up in 2015. I will now describe how we are tracking on priorities 1, 2 and 3 by segment, then I\u2019ll update you on priorities 4 through 6. So turning to Slide 9, by driving productivity actions across the businesses, targeting certain businesses for growth, being strict stewards of capital, and driving EVA and ROC, we are growing margins in all of our segments. For example, in electronic and functional materials and performance plastics, businesses that we have committed to grow, we are growing and our EBITDA margins are expanding as we continue to further penetrate attractive markets such as the ones shown on this slide. In performance materials, a segment that we have committed to improve, our consistent actions over the last many quarters continue to gain traction, resulting in significant EBITDA increases this quarter. We are taking aggressive cost actions and implementing a broader productivity focus to enhance results, particularly in polyurethanes and epoxy. We are seeing the benefit of these collective actions which we put in place 12 months ago now, and with more upside to come. Our polyurethanes and epoxy teams are hard at work delivering new EBITDA despite business-specific and industry challenges, and when coupled with the upcoming start-up of our PDH investment and our Sadara joint venture, we are well positioned to further restore and enhance our earnings profile across performance materials. In other words, we said we would improve, and we are. We said we would grow, and we are. We are doing all the things we said and more, and through this combination of operational, financial and strategic priorities, we are overcoming known headwinds to deliver stronger year-over-year results. Let me give you some deeper insights into what we are seeing in our key segments and markets. Turning to Slide 10, beginning with Dow Electronic Materials, strong customer relationships and differentiated technology platforms are driving growth for this business. We delivered increased sales in Asia Pacific in the second quarter and drove gains in interconnect technologies on higher demand for printed circuit boards in smartphones and automobiles. Looking forward, we expect mid to high single digit revenue growth from semiconductors and foundry demand, coupled with higher MSI growth, giving us ongoing optimism for this business through the end of 2014 into 2015. In functional materials, our businesses are benefiting from above-market growth in key attractive market sectors such as energy and pharmaceuticals. For example, in the second quarter Dow Microbial Control delivered double-digit sales gains growth in North America on increased sales of customized solutions aligned with the energy sector. On top of this growth, our outlook on functional materials continues to be positive as food, pharmaceutical and personal care market sectors also trend upwards, further supporting increased demand for Dow technologies. On Slide 11, in Dow Coating Materials top line gains coupled with cost and productivity actions remain our focus. In the second quarter, the business delivered above-market sales increases in both architectural and industrial coatings in nearly all regions. When coupled with ongoing enhancements to productivity, we expect this business to grow margins year-over-year, however, this will be partially tempered by costs related to short-term supply constraints in monomers. In Dow Water and Process Solutions, technology-driven growth continues on increasing demand. For example, we are bringing in-home water purification to consumers in water scarce regions through the Dow Filmtec RO System. In addition, Dow\u2019s Tequatic Plus fine particle filter is a groundbreaking solution for treating difficult high-solids water and helping reduce industry costs and waste. Overall, our demand remains strong for this sector will Dow positioned as the leading technology provider. In Dow Building and Construction, market growth remains somewhat tepid, although we are seeing encouraging signs as year-to-date growth is indeed outpacing the market. With conditions varying by region, we maintain a tight focus on productivity gains, particularly in Europe where we have seen dramatic improvements in our profitability. Further, our material science expertise is enabling access to new applications in insulation, roofing and tile. Shifting to agricultural sciences on Slide 12 and our market outlook for this important source of momentum for our company, we continue to deliver strong top line performance illustrated by record sales in both the quarter as well as year-to-date. Our market outlook for this segment remains positive with overall industry growth expected in the mid single digit range. This business, as highlighted in this quarter\u2019s results, continues to outperform its competitors based on its strong linkages to Dow\u2019s manufacturing and R&D engines. Sales of new crop protection products increased 18% in the first half, demonstrating that our technology leadership and manufacturing expertise in this sector continues to serve as a solid foundation for ongoing growth. Dow is also capturing the benefit of strong fundamentals in the global seeds industry, growth that is projected at 4% to 6% in the near term. Notably within the quarter, Dow\u2019s seeds business drove growth in both corn and soybeans in North America and Latin America. With Dow as the owner, we have doubled the value of this business over the past five to seven years and have clear plans in place to do it again over the same time frame, leveraging the strengths of Dow\u2019s chemical and material sciences expertise in manufacturing and R&D to create new molecules and novel traits that would drive growth across this franchise, and to produce them at a low cost to serve. Shifting to performance materials on Slide 13 where cost reductions and productivity have been our operating mantra for well over a year, sales were up year-over-year and fundamentals continue to improve for market sectors aligned to our polyurethanes value chain, notably in consumer comfort and industrial. Improving adoption of new energy regulations is also driving increased energy efficiency demand. Our cost reduction efforts have yielded results as well with significant margin expansion year-over-year in the polyurethanes value chain. Looking at the specialty chemicals portion of this portfolio, Dow oil & gas and mining grew sales double digits on continued strength from increased project fills in Europe, Middle East and Africa, and increased exploration and production demand in North America. We are also seeing demand growth in Amines, particularly in the consumer, industrial and construction markets. We expect these trends to continue in the second half. Fundamentals in the automotive sector also remain solid as demand in North America, China and Europe continues to be positive. Sales in Dow automotive reflect upward trends in this sector, evidenced by above market growth in the business on customer adoption of differentiated technologies such as Betamate structural adhesives, which are enabling lighter weight vehicles to improve fuel efficiency. We expect the automotive sector to remain a source of positive growth for this business and for the performance materials segment overall. Turning to performance plastics on Slide 14 where we continue to deliver growth in attractive end markets such as packaging, hygiene, and medical. For example, in Dow packaging and specialty plastics, application development remains strong. As the market drives towards comfort and convenience, Dow is innovating around flexibility and durability. We grew sales in the target markets I just mentioned and are pointing our resources directly at these attractive sectors with industry-leading R&D that is differentiated and unique to Dow versus our pure commodity competitors, and our new capital investments on the U.S. Gulf Coast and in Sadara position us well to continue long-term growth in this high margin business. On Slide15, you can see that we are driving near-term margin expansion and growth as we continue to drive segment-specific actions. As you know, we have defined near-term margin expansion targets by segment and we have outlined the impact of each strategic value driver to you before, as shown on this slide, and we are investing in our high growth, high margin businesses. This quarter demonstrated that we can selectively grow on the top line while also maintaining an intense focus on productivity on the bottom line, and this balanced approach to value creation is yielding increasing sustainable returns across our enterprise. Very few companies can do both productivity and growth well. Dow has the unique capability to succeed in both arenas, maximizing return on capital. I\u2019m going to now turn to our near-term priorities, which you can see on Slide 17, and review aspects of priorities 1 and 2 as well as 4 through 6. On Slide 18, you can see on the priority we call Priority 1 \u2013 Successful Start-up of Sadara and U.S. Gulf Coast Investments, a few comments first on Sadara. We said we would leverage our technology and scale to enable cost advantaged growth aligned to attractive markets and regions, and we are delivering via this once-in-a-generation project. Let me be clear \u2013 the unique nature of Dow\u2019s technology prowess and expertise coupled with Saudi Aramco\u2019s tremendous capabilities, have enabled us to create the world\u2019s largest chemical complex ever built in a single phase. Only through this unique partnership will this be one of the very few projects in the region completed on time and on budget. The first units are slated for operations in mid-2015 with full start-up in 2016. We have more than 55,000 contractors on site and 800 Dow project experts with engineering finalized and construction more than 65% complete. On the U.S. Gulf Coast, we said that we would capitalize on positive shale gas and NOG fundamentals to connect low-cost feedstocks to downstream technology-based growth, and we are delivering. Our investments in the region are progressing well, evidenced clearly by the June groundbreaking on our world-scale ethylene production facility in Freeport, Texas, which will start up in mid-2017. Our PVH investment is on track for start-up in mid-2015 with 1,600 workers on site, 90% of the equipment on location, and more than 30% of construction already complete. In Louisiana, the timing of our ethane flexibility project remains as planned with a 2015 start-up. Cost inflation on the U.S. Gulf Coast is real; however, we planned for inflationary pressures and it has not caught us by surprise. These projects remain on budget, and through our scale and first mover advantage, we are mitigating these pressures. Looking across the program, we continue to carefully monitor the economics of these projects. We are leveraging equipment design and sourcing across our global supply chain to remain ahead of the cost curve Further, we are capitalizing on our early mover advantage to secure and retain a skilled labor workforce, keeping costs as tight as possible. These growth catalysts are a key priority for our company, as are our accretive innovation investments which are part of Priority 2 on Slide 19. In fact, innovation is essential in markets where it is rewarded to stay ahead of product commoditization life cycles. On our sales from patent advantaged products in 2013, we delivered an average of 13% higher margins versus sales from non-patent advantaged products. This depth and breadth of our innovation pipeline was highlighted in July as five Dow technologies were recognized by R&D Magazine. These technologies span the sectors of our key markets \u2013 water, food, energy, automotive \u2013 with solutions that are solving global challenges and driving sustainable and profitable growth for Dow. Let me also dwell on one of our key product launches for 2015, Enlist. Through the combination of novel traits and Dow\u2019s proprietary herbicide technology, our Enlist weed control system is a fundamental example of how our innovations and expertise in chemistry and biology are enabling differentiated solutions that farmers need now. Our current feedback confirms that this innovation remains on track for a 2015 launch. The upside from these innovations together with the growth expected from our strategic investments in Priority No. 1 are collectively positioning Dow well over the near and long term for earnings growth and increased cash flow. So now turning to another of our key priorities, our announced divestiture program, where we continue to make significant headway, which is of course included in Priority No. 4. As you can see on Slide 20, we have identified a target of $4.5 billion to $6 billion in proceeds from shedding non-strategic assets and businesses. We maintain our commitment to achieving this target by year-end 2015. One key transaction, of course, is our chlorine carve out. Market response to our announcement has been positive with strong early interest, and we have a dedicated team of more than 100 professionals working diligently on every aspect of this seminal project. We are currently fine-tuning the scope to maximize preserved integration benefits and ensure we mitigate stranded costs, which is very complex work and involves hundreds of product and utility streams. As we look ahead, we\u2019re making critical operating model shifts for Dow as well as for any perspective partner or buyer to ensure we maximize the full benefit of this completed transaction. We will not trade future earnings for one-time transaction value and thereby render downstream businesses uncompetitive. On Slide 21, utilizing our best earner lens, we have also examined potential alternative uses for the capital currently allocated to our assets such as rail cars, real estate, terminals, and other infrastructure; and through this process we identified nearly $1 billion in expected proceeds from assets we believe are better suited for more strategic owners or in different financial structures, and we believe we can complete more than half of these by year-end. This includes our rail car fleet, where we expect to release more than $500 million in value over the next six months. We are also reviewing every aspect of our joint venture portfolio, identifying opportunities to release even further value and returning this value to our shareholders, especially from our large joint ventures. In sum, our full divestiture program is accelerating on track and moving forward as outlined on this slide, with 12 corporate teams fully engaged and driving this process forward, directly accountable to our executive committee. On Slide 22, collectively our projects in Priority together with our cost savings and productivity ramp-up and the upcoming launch of accretive innovations such as Enlist are positioning Dow to achieve EBITDA north of $10 billion in the near term. Items such as lower pension expense, greater operating leverage, and further productivity efforts will serve as upside on top of the growth from these catalysts and our business-specific actions embedded in our strategic priorities. Our sixth priority is actually our number one priority, which can be summarized on Slide 24. Our unrelenting focus remains on generating returns that exceed the cost of capital, generating cash and rewarding our shareholders. Our performance this quarter underscores the intensity with which we are executing through our focus on both growth and productivity, and using EVA momentum to drive improvements on return on capital, illustrated by our 150 basis point increase in ROC year-over-year. We have described a number of near-term growth catalysts in our portfolio, including an industry-leading performance plastics franchise with best-in-industry R&D and a low cost position which is being further enhanced in 2015 with our Sadara and U.S. Gulf Coast investments; our strong set of integrated franchise businesses such as Dow AgriSciences, electronic materials, professional materials and coatings that will yield results from key investments; and a recovering set of value-driving businesses such as polyurethanes all contributing to the bottom line, plus the investments made in the 2010-2014 time frame will begin benefiting these investments in 2015 and beyond. All of these catalysts plus our focused productivity actions would generate strong cash flows in 2015 and beyond. Simply put, the early stages of this cash flow have been put to use to accelerate our cash flow story in the back half of this decade. In the meantime, we have aggressively returned cash to you, our shareholders, with $3 billion in the first half of 2014 alone through declared dividends and share repurchases, and another $2.1 billion in share buyback due yet this year. In summary, our six strategic priorities are in full execution mode with near-term cash generation fully committed to these organic investments and to shareholder remuneration. We are constantly reviewing our cash flow to increasingly focus on rewarding our shareholders. That is our commitment. With that, Doug, let\u2019s turn to Q&A. Doug May : Thank you, Andrew. Now we\u2019ll move you to questions. First, however, I\u2019d like to remind you that my comments regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures apply both to our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. Lauren, would you please walk through the Q&A procedure? Operator : [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from PJ Juvekar with Citi. PJ Juvekar : Yes, thank you and good morning. In coating and infrastructure, your results were kind of flattish while your customers are reporting some really good numbers, so it seems that they are getting a disproportionate amount of value while the suppliers are not getting that. So what can you do about that and what kind of discussions are you having with them? Andrew Liveris : Yes PJ, actually Dow coatings and materials has now had several consecutive quarters of good revenue growth; in fact, this particular quarter, plus 5%. If you look at some of our downstreams, they have revenue growth of 5%, 7%, and one had actually a bang-up quarter at double digits. They have a different operating model \u2013 I think there was newspaper article about that yesterday in the Wall Street Journal. Each of their operating models vary \u2013 some are heavy industrial, some are heavy architectural, some are in stores, some are not in stores with OEMs, some at the discount stores, some are not. What we\u2019ve got is a group of customers that are actually in all of those, and what we\u2019re doing with them is two things to get our share of the value. One is innovation, clearly, and our launch of Formashield is a good example of that. Formashield, as you may know, is to take formaldehyde out of the air to improve indoor air quality. That gives us premium pricing at customers accounts who want to pay for that based on their brand promise. A very notable paint company on the west coast has a premium brand just purely based on brand promise of quality, including air quality. But it\u2019s not just innovation. It also has to be low cost to serve, and there we are really, if you like, working hard on the input costs. Now, we\u2019ve had some issues on monomers in terms of outages, and that hurt the results a little bit in this past quarter for coatings and monomers \u2013 I indicated that in my script. But we are fixing those \u2013 Deer Park has been quite a challenge these last many years to operate with consistency, but it\u2019s getting there; and of course SAMCo, our JV in Saudi Arabia, is really helping our position in the Far East and the Middle East. Europe has been a drag, but it\u2019s now starting to improve. All of that to tell you between innovation and lower cost to serve, we believe we can get our piece of the value pie; but we\u2019ll never be a paint company, and of course just like every downstream from us, whether it\u2019s a consumer goods company like Procter and Gamble, they have their value proposition, we have ours. We need to improve our ROC, and we\u2019re doing that in our part of the envelope. Bill Weideman : PJ, this is Bill. Just to add one thing on the bottom line, as Andrew alluded to, this is a big turnaround quarter also for chemicals, for coatings and infrastructure, and our turnaround expense there year-over-year was up about $20 million due to planned turnaround, so that affected the bottom line. PJ Juvekar : Thank you. Andrew, quickly on ag, you\u2019ve said in the past that the real (indiscernible) value, you would think about expanding or a combination. Any further thoughts on that? Andrew Liveris : Yes, look \u2013 we\u2019ve indicated multiple times\u2014well firstly, let me start from the top of the headline. There are no sacred cows here \u2013 we\u2019re not keeping a business for the sake of keeping it. There is none of that. We are growing this business, as I indicated with the quarterly report here. This quarter, this half there\u2019s been incredible launches of new products. We outperformed the market for a reason. We are developing new products at a pace which is outpacing our competitors, especially in crop protection, but notably even in seeds and traits. So crop protection is outpacing growth here with that 18% increase that I indicated, and as we increase value, this becomes a more valuable property. What we\u2019re doing is shedding from the other end of the Dow enterprise, the low ROC businesses, the businesses we can\u2019t grow; and if we ever did do a deal that releases one-time value, we need to ensure that we can replace it with higher value inside the enterprise. In other words, we\u2019ll upgrade value for value, not for a one-time transaction. But we are open to any sorts of conversations, and I can tell you that this industry probably has one more round of it in the future. We\u2019re an open book, open discussion to anyone who has a good idea. Operator : Our next question comes from John Roberts with UBS. John Roberts : Good morning. Your stock is bouncing around the conversion level for the preferred shares, and it was hard to tell if there was much net share reduction sequentially when I look at the share count that\u2019s out there. Maybe you could give us a comment on your plans on how you plan to deal with the conversion event and neutralizing those shares with buyback. Bill Weideman : Yes John, this is Bill. I\u2019ll give you a little bit of numbers here on the share repurchase program. So as you know, we really ramped that up, if you will, the first of the year, so if you see a comparison versus same quarter a year ago, our shares are up. But if you look at versus this year and you look at prior quarter, our actual share count is down. So in the quarter, second quarter, we purchased about 17 million shares, as you know, at a total cost of about $850 million, and the total program we\u2019ve bought back about 51 million shares now for $2.4 billion. Our share count actually, the average share count for the EPS calculation, as you know, went down 10 million shares this quarter, and you should expect that to continue to occur going forward. The reason is not the full impact, it\u2019s the share is an average number at the beginning of the period and it\u2019s a weighted average, so that\u2019s the reason. But you\u2019ll continue to see that going down. Yes, you are true \u2013 our share price is getting close to the conversion price, and as you know, that is the most value-creating option there for us for our shareholders, so our desire there obviously is for our share price to continue to appreciate and then convert those into common. John Roberts : And then on the chlorine carve-out, your text says by the year end \u201915 close the deal. Is the plan still to have a definitive deal announced by the end of \u201914? Andrew Liveris : Yes John, we would aim to do that. Again, we\u2019re not going to run to the wrong answer here because of the stranded cost issue that I mentioned in my remarks. This is a complex carve-out \u2013 I can\u2019t emphasize that enough. I made enough comments in the script to let you know how complex it is; but yes, that would be the intent. There\u2019s nothing that tells us right now we can\u2019t do that. Operator : Our next question comes from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Bob Koort : Thank you, good morning. Andrew, I guess you\u2019re on the cusp here of the next ag season, selling your Enlist product. I was wondering if you could talk about the challenges farmers have today with herbicide resistance, and then what sort of costs are you able to save them from using a seed-contained product as opposed to a secondary herbicide treatment. Andrew Liveris : Yes, this is a very granular question, Bob, so I\u2019ll try and give a couple of quick punchlines here, and of course I\u2019ll follow up with you and anyone else that wants to know more detail. Clearly the efficacy of Enlist Duo, which is the combo, which is of course 2,4-D resistance as well as glyphosate resistance, has embedded in it quite a lot of user-friendliness for the farmer, including the reduction of cost. We have not shared farmer economics with anyone right now, but clearly 2,4-D is so widely used, so ubiquitous, they see it as a solution that they want; but of course, doing this with choline chemistry takes out the VOC issue and the drift issue and any of the issues with 2,4-D, which is why this is such a great introduction. It really is a better, friendlier version of 2,4-D chemistry with, of course, the tolerance and the resistance that you would get from glyphosate as well. Glyphosate resistance is a big issue for farmers and they\u2019re working very hard on finding a reformulation. They are screaming for this one because of their knowledge of 2,4-D chemistry. Clearly the other part of this is that it\u2019s a combo. The fact that we can apply it to soybeans as well as corn is a massive, massive positive for them, and clearly they\u2019ve used 2,4-D for these purposes for over 60 years in more than 70 countries worldwide with thousands of pages of scientific studies, hundreds and hundreds of agencies and regulators giving it its approval, so it really is an in-place substitution for them. So frankly, the farmer economics both on refuge in a bag as well as efficacy of (indiscernible) is very compelling. I won\u2019t speak specifically to pricing. Bob Koort : And you mentioned monetizing some corporate and maybe some JV interest. I think you even implied especially your larger JVs. I was wondering if you could give us an update or assessment on how Dow Corning and maybe how the petrochemical JVs you have are performing and what the outlook there is. Andrew Liveris : Yes, look \u2013 I would say QHJVs in general have been Kuwait JVs in general have been good, steady earners for Dow. They\u2019ve got a low-cost position, whether it\u2019s in Kuwait or Canada, and as a consequence of that, they\u2019ve been contributing to our equity earnings quite handily here these last\u2014well actually, over a decade but certainly these last five years. Dow Corning has gone through its major bump with polysilicon \u2013 that obviously was a mess of recalibration of their earnings capability. They\u2019re doing the best in the polysilicon world because they are the low-cost producer. They don\u2019t have the margins they used to have, so Hemlock is not doing as well as it did a few years ago. Now if you look at both of those sets of JVs and you look at my statement, the product mix in the Kuwait JVs is a commodity product mix in the main. Dow Corning is a downstream value-add company that needs low cost to serve. What we need to do is get very transparent on how you see those results so they don\u2019t get lost in our reporting, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re working on \u2013 trying to figure out ways to do that and of course be value creating and accretive. So our focus is on both of those; and Bill, I don\u2019t know if you want to add anything. Bill Weideman : Yes, overall\u2014just to add, overall our equity earnings, as you know, were flat year-over-year; but as Andrew alluded, the greater Kuwait JVs earnings are up year-over-year, Dow Corning earnings are up year-over-year, and then those are offset in terms of increased cost in Sadara as we ramp for production here next year. So overall, our base joint ventures continue to drive earnings increases, including Dow Corning. Operator : Our next question comes from Peter Butler with Glen Hill Investments. Peter Butler : Yes, good morning. Do you have\u2014have there been any significant developments in your Dow AgroSciences research pipeline, looking beyond the Enlist coming next year? Andrew Liveris : Absolutely, Peter. One of the things I implied in the answer to PJ\u2019s question is we have Enlist, but we have a strong pipeline of other products being launched as we speak. I would tell you that our launches in the crop protection side have been as impressive as anything on the trait side. Having said that, we just had a novel USDA deregulation of a novel insect-resistant trait, and this is going to provide soybean farmers with a broad spectrum for insect control against something called lepidopteran. I want you to understand that \u2013 that\u2019s a pest, okay, so a bad thing. So this is now being part of our comprehensive soybean strategy, and this is really the key thing I want to say, that apart from our crop protection, new herbicides and new insecticides, our focus on soybeans and between Enlist and this new novel insecticide technology (indiscernible) just mentioned, these are massive new products and will enable us to double the value of Dow AgroScience these next few years. These are broad spectra weed control as well as pest control, lower drift, lower volatility with Enlist, and user friendly to the farmer. We\u2019ve never been as excited about our pipeline in Dow AgroScience. This has been actually an eight-year effort that is bearing fruit today, and you saw it in the first half results of AgroScience. Peter Butler : Andrew, you\u2019ve been discussing this possible next consolidation step for it seems like several years now. Is anything coming into view? Andrew Liveris : Yes, I mean look \u2013 I\u2019d say there is quite a few things coming into view. One is that the European market and its maybe acceptance of GMO is an accelerator with 28 countries now potentially looking at listing, allowing GMO. That\u2019s going to change the landscape and really bring North America and Europe more in line and create new value for the in-place players that have the technology. European standards will be very strict, so\u2014and we\u2019ll say that you\u2019ve got to have a combination of crop protection strength and trait strength, and the single-line players, they\u2019re going to realize that with time they just can\u2019t rely on one or the other. I think the mythology of everything moving to biology is gone. I think it\u2019s a combination of biology and chemistry that\u2019s going to play, and we\u2019re very proud of the fact that we have both crop protection and biology, that combo, and the crop protection is truly based on Dow\u2019s strengths. So look \u2013 you can see that what\u2019s going to happen here is the five or six top guys are going to look at ways to combine. Obviously, the early way to do that is through licensing and exclusive licenses, but clearly there\u2019s a model out there for releasing value through consolidation and bulking up on both sides of the house. Operator : Our next question comes from Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo Securities. Frank Mitsch : Hey, good morning gentlemen. Obviously the performance plastics business was a star here in the quarter despite the $100 million outage from Plaquemine. Bill, I think when you were talking about the business, it was sounding like third quarter could even be better. Can you talk about the sequential price increase \u2013 I know price was up 7% year-over-year. Can you talk about the sequential price increase and what sort of momentum you\u2019re carrying in that business into Q3? Bill Weideman : Yes Frank, so you\u2019re exactly right. Plastics, as you pointed out, performance plastics overcame $100 million headwind on the two outages we had in the crackers in Plaquemine. From an overall performance plastics standpoint, industry dynamics are very strong. There is very low inventory levels. There is pricing momentum \u2013 you saw that in this quarter. It\u2019s our belief that will continue. On top of that, you\u2019re seeing ethane costs down now around $0.23, $0.24, so we expect margins going into the third quarter to remain very strong. Frank Mitsch : Terrific, thanks so much. Andrew, when you\u2019re talking about Priority 5 on Slide 21, you mentioned that to release value in rail cars over the next six months. Frankly, that\u2019s a faster timeline than I would have anticipated, given the fact that you guys are involved so much in the chlor-alkali carve-out. I think you also mentioned other financial structures as a possibility. Was that a nod to possible MLP-ing of those assets, and just more broadly, where do you stand on the whole topic of MLP? Andrew Liveris : Yes, I think one more data point that we provided you on this call, Frank, that partly answers your first question on speed and timelines, and that is we have 12 corporate teams actively engaged. I mentioned we have 100 people on the chlorine carve-out. This is a company that\u2019s paralleling execution on the operating side as well as execution on the transaction side to release value and to become more transparent where it makes money, and as a consequence we\u2019re dropping lower ROC activities or activities that are best in the hands of other ownership models. Then to the second part of your question, we believe rail cars can go to another model. We also believe that we\u2019d be quite open to structures that are tax advantaged, such as MLP; but implied in your question is, is there a big MLP structure of the Westlake kind in our future? Probably not, because we\u2019re a very different type of upstream assets operator. We operate 18 upstream assets integrated around machine, and maybe the new assets can be\u2014we can look at them, for example PDH. We are examining all those, but we don\u2019t see any silver bullet in some of these structures for our mainstream businesses yet. But for sure ancillary assets, we\u2019d be definitely looking at them. Operator : Our next question comes from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. David Begleiter : Thank you. Andrew, looking at Slide 18, Priority 1, you\u2019re obviously very, very busy; but what\u2019s beyond 2017 as we go through these next couple years? Can you talk a little bit about what drives Dow in the last two, three years of this decade in terms of new projects or innovation, et cetera? Andrew Liveris : It\u2019s very good to first acknowledge that we\u2019re very busy, and secondly to put us into that timeframe because, quite rightly David, we\u2019ve had 18 months of strategic reviews with our board and we\u2019ve done a five-year plan, we\u2019ve done a 10-year plan, as most companies do. When you put a stake in the ground for years like 2025, you obviously are thinking about projects in 2018, 2020, 2022. We\u2019re not going to disclose those plans to the market quite right now. We have a lot of work to do to get to 2015, 2016, 2017, and I\u2019ve already implied that we\u2019re going to generate a lot of cash and that cash is going to our shareholders. So we\u2019re going through a massive capex bubble right now, we\u2019re using that cash obviously from operations, which has been pretty good and getting better with our productivity focus, and we\u2019re putting that into organic growth such as these big facilities that we\u2019ll be starting up in the first part of this back half of this decade. The second part of the decade, we have a very robust R&D pipeline where we can make choices to go narrower and deeper, and we\u2019ve implied over time that there are markets we want to go deeper in and we\u2019ve given you the five or six that we\u2019re concentrating on. We\u2019ll be looking at ways to keep bulking up and becoming more significant to customers in that part of the marketplace, not all parts of the market. In that sense, the Dow model of if you build it, they will come, or tons-r-us, or build a facility and move rail cars and move pallets, is behind us. We are in the value side of the conversation, which is a bit like the question I got on coatings from PJ \u2013 where is the biggest value in the value chains? Where is the biggest ROC in those value chains, and put scarce capital against those. So going narrower, going deeper, making choices in the back half of the decade off of our robust R&D pipeline. We will be looking at projects on an ongoing basis. There is no big M&A in our future \u2013 I\u2019ve said that over and over. We are looking at bolt-on M&As to improve capabilities, whether it be in electronics or ag or even some of the businesses like water. These are the sorts of things you can expect from us in the back half of the decade. David Begleiter : And just on Sadara, Andrew, how should we think about the ramp-up in the back half of next year in terms of the ethylene and polyethylene units coming on stream and modeling that for our numbers for next year? Andrew Liveris : So firstly to get this thing to 70% complete, as you well know, is pretty impressive, and I can\u2019t speak highly enough about the JV, the people in the JV, the project teams in the Dow and Aramco people who are working seamlessly together. Having 55,000 contractors on one site is unimaginable to most, and so as we look at the start-up of these units, it\u2019s complex. I mean, you\u2019ve got all these units being constructed, and in the middle of it you\u2019re going to start up a cracker and you\u2019re going to start up polyethylene units to get early revenues and get early profits, obviously. But those are the right ones to start up first, because obviously they\u2019re off the low-cost inputs that are available in the kingdom and we can see that the EBITDA that will come from those in the 2015-2016 timeframe will help make this project very accretive in a much faster fashion. But we haven\u2019t given you enough information yet to model the earnings, other than you can expect average annual equity earnings contribution to us of half a billion dollars in the first 10 years of operation. I\u2019ll let Bill add anything he wants here, but I would wait another six to 12 months before we get into any specific guidance there, David. Bill Weideman : Yeah, I\u2019ll leave it at that. Operator : Our next question comes from Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial. Don Carson : Hi Andrew. A question on ag, more the near term. You\u2019re one of the few players in seed that\u2019s actually talked about better first half results, given that corn was down in the Americas. I know you\u2019ve got a small position in the U.S. but a big position down in Brazil, so what is it that\u2019s enabled you to grow your corn seed business? You seem pretty optimistic on the second half outlook despite what appears to be some real headwinds in South America, specifically down corn acreage, so just wondering if you could reconcile some of those conflicting data points. Andrew Liveris : Yes, it\u2019s a great insight, Don, and something I\u2019d expect from you following ag so closely. I mean, we definitely are beating competition in Latin America corn despite some of the issues that are going on there, mostly and totally because of our technology. It\u2019s the multiple stack, it\u2019s Powercore, and frankly it\u2019s Powercore multiple stack that\u2019s overcoming the issue on one particular trait that\u2019s down there. I think we\u2019ve been able to gain share as a result, and consequently our positioning going forward is that we will continue to be winners down there on corn, even though you mentioned of course the outlook you do, which we of course agree with. But we also not only have that, but we also have bodads (ph) in general \u2013 broad spectrum crop protection capabilities, and this is of course pre-Enlist \u2013 we\u2019re not totally Enlist yet. As a consequence of that, the combination of Powercore and the broad spectra herbicides we have has made us a winner. Don Carson : Then moving to a different area, you\u2019ve maintained very good innovation despite R&D being cut \u2013 I think this is the first quarter in the last few quarters that R&D has stabilized. So where did you make cuts in R&D, and how were you able to make those cuts and still maintain that innovation track record? Andrew Liveris : Are you talking in ag particularly or\u2014 Don Carson : No, just R&D overall. It\u2019s been six months flat to year-over-year this quarter for the first time in a long time. Andrew Liveris : Well very simply, it\u2019s what we\u2019re doing for the entire enterprise, which is bang for the buck. We said about a year ago \u2013 I\u2019ve lost track of the time \u2013 where we did start to make cuts in the spend of far out projects. We also made cuts in the spend of a lot of alternative energy projects, so we took some bets there and some of those bets were just too far out. I mean, yeah, you could see that out there in the future, alternative energy will have a role, whether it be batteries or biofuels or you name it; but it\u2019s too far out for us, and we were all for R&D but we want to be able to count the R&D productivity just like we count any cost input here at Dow. So near-term MPVs, things that are touchable and visible in terms of the commercialization of the pipeline, working closely with marketing, that\u2019s been the way we\u2019ve prioritized, and I think our pipeline hasn\u2019t suffered as a result. The risk-adjusted MPV is still double-digit billions of dollars - $10 billion or so. A few years ago, that might have been $12 billion, so we haven\u2019t really cut, and that\u2019s all near-term now, the realization of EBITDA from that spend. Bill, did you want to add anything? Bill Weideman : It\u2019s re-prioritization, as Andrew mentioned. It\u2019s prioritizing our investments in electronics and ag and performance packaging, and reprioritization of resources. Doug May : Lauren, there may be time for one to two more questions. Operator : Our next question comes from Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Duffy Fischer : Good morning, guys. Question back on the chlorine carve-out, or a couple questions around it. One, do you think it\u2019s going to be one deal, or should we expect a series of deals to solve that issue for you? And then two, obviously this gets around multiple a little bit, but how should we think about dilution from carving off this asset at the end of the day? Bill Weideman : Duffy, this is Bill. We\u2019re open and we\u2019re looking at all different structures \u2013 one deal, multiple deals, and those could take different forms, so we haven\u2019t nailed that down. We\u2019ll take whatever structure creates the most value. From a dilutive impact, we\u2019re not expecting any dilution on this at all. We\u2019re very focused on stranded costs from a standpoint of making sure we don\u2019t have any stranded costs, and so as Andrew also mentioned in his prepared comments, we are very focused on getting the right structure to maintain our integration in the go-forward. So hopefully that answers your question. Duffy Fischer : Fair enough. This is a little bit of a rifle shot, but I think Andrew, you had mentioned tangentially kind of the issue that Herculex has had, or at least one version of Herculex has had in Brazil over the last year. Do you see that kind of damaging the Herculex franchise and potentially hitting the revenue there, or was that just kind of a one-off, one-year issue? Andrew Liveris : Hard to say if it\u2019s one-year, one-off, Duffy. It could be consistent, it could continue on. It could be pest management practices on single-mode products like Herculex 1 that will be impacted first, but we\u2019re very confident, to kind of get at your point, that our stacked trait product, Powercore, will provide resistance. So even if there\u2019s some erosion there, I think we\u2019ll more than make up for it through the stacks. Operator : Our next question comes from John McNulty with Credit Suisse. John McNulty : Yes, thanks for taking my question. So with regard to your U.S. Gulf Coast projects, it sounds like you\u2019ve prepared enough so that you expect them to come up on time. Can you give us some color as to how you\u2019re thinking about the industry and the huge amounts of capacity coming on and the talks of labor shortages, et cetera, and how that may impact the cycle specifically? Andrew Liveris : We\u2019ve been pretty consistent on the supply-demand balances in the timeframe of these projects being announced in the United States. On the slow GDP growth pace, which is a global GDP of 2.5 to 3.5, and one might argue we\u2019re on the lower edge of that right now, then the cycle will start to manifest itself in the late \u201914, \u201915 timeframe. And by the way, with outages this last quarter, you saw what the effect of tightening could happen very fast on pricing, so to the question we got on pricing earlier in the call. But all of that to tell you that if you look at the world at that sort of growth rate, then you\u2019re going to need world-scale crackers to be built on a ratio, picking your favorite growth rate, of one to three a year, and there\u2019s been, let\u2019s say, seven or eight announced, five to six very likely spread over a five-year timeframe. That five-year timeframe is a five-year timeframe because you\u2019re going to get, to your point, slowing some of them down. So some will come on pretty much like ours \u2013 \u201916, \u201917, probably best is \u201917, really \u2013 and then you\u2019re going to start seeing a couple more in \u201918, \u201919, but that\u2019s it. There really isn\u2019t a whole lot more that are going to be built because of the point you made on capital and on labor; and frankly, these are out years now so they\u2019re not going to affect the cycle that you just asked about. So we\u2019re very confident that independent of low-cost imports \u2013 you know, the whole point on ethane \u2013 that the ethylene cycle and the coincidence of this new capacity are going to be quite well synchronized to advantage companies like ours. John McNulty : Great, and then just a quick follow-up on the comments around some of the larger JVs. It sounds like you are looking for ways to unlock some value there, and certainly implied in that it may be that some get shaken out of the portfolio. But I\u2019m guess I\u2019m wondering, are there assets of relative size that you have JV partners with where, if the partner was willing to sell, you\u2019d actually be a buyer of assets as opposed to a seller of assets? Andrew Liveris : Yes, look \u2013 we\u2019re working this portfolio to keep bulking up the value-add part of the portfolio, because at the end of the day a commodity is a commodity is a commodity, and if you\u2019re going to run a commodity company, you\u2019re going to run a cycle and that cycle is going to be up and down based on your low-cost position. Nation states are pretty hard to beat, so they\u2019re going to have policies that you can\u2019t have as a private enterprise, so our strategy has been to join them and joint venture with them. But over timeframes, those nation states are more natural owners of those JVs, and we recognize that; so then you say, well, what do we do? Well, you\u2019ve got to take your innovation and then bulk up your market value-add position and still be low cost, so that kind of gives you strategically the answer. There are some more likely to come inside the shop and some more likely to go outside the shop, and we\u2019re not foreshadowing any particular transaction any time soon, but the answer to your question is yes. Doug May : Great. Andrew, do you want to maybe wrap up? Andrew Liveris : Yes, I do. Firstly, I think you\u2019ve now seen now three quarters of execution where execution is our mantra. It\u2019s another strong, solid quarter for Dow across our enterprise. Productivity played a huge role. I want to point performance materials and polyurethanes and epoxy \u2013 they delivered. We\u2019ve had an intense amount of pressure on those teams, and they\u2019ve delivered in a fairly difficult market environment. They\u2019re getting it through productivity and cost controls, and you can expect that across our entire enterprise. We\u2019re operating as if that\u2019s condition normal for all our businesses. But having said that, we\u2019re putting a lot of effort into growing, and the projects that you asked about on the call are clear examples of that. The innovations you asked about on the call are other examples of that, all of that moving to improving ROC \u2013 150 basis point increase in ROC year-on-year is going to continue at Dow. All of that to drive shareholder returns and provide more cash remuneration to you, our shareholders. I believe we\u2019re running the best set of integrated businesses on the planet and they will perform to the top of the house expectations on shareholder returns and ROC \u2013 that\u2019s our commitment. Doug May : Thank you, Andrew. Before we conclude the call, I\u2019d like to give you an update on our investor forum. Due to venue availability conflicts, we\u2019ve moved the date to November 12 and 13. The event will still take place in the Houston-Freeport area, and we\u2019ll have more information coming shortly. In the meantime, please mark your calendars. As always, we appreciate your interest in the Dow Chemical Company. For your reference, a copy of our prepared comments will be posted on Dow\u2019s website later today. This concludes our call, and we look forward to speaking with you again soon. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation.",

I will now hand the call over to Andrew. Andrew Liveris : Thank you, Jack and good morning everyone and thank you all for joining us. This is another strong quarter for Dow and our results on the top and bottom line and they reflect deliberate actions we have taken, and continue to take, to focus on execution, control what we can control, and drive a full array of productivity measures, what we\u2019ve called our self-help measures. These actions demonstrate the advantage of our integrated and diversified business model and how we are successfully leveraging our scale, geographic reach, technology expertise and physical integration to achieve targeted growth at our priority market sectors, especially in times of great volatility. It\u2019s with great pleasure that I introduce, not one but two CFOs and two investor relations VPs in the room with me today. With the luxury of having both Howard and Bill present, I will be handling over a substantial portion of the commentary over to the two of them to address this quarter's outstanding results. The first, Bill, I know I speak on behalf of our colleagues, when I extend my sincere appreciation for your service to Dow, notably your leadership in the company\u2019s Chief Financial Officer role. We have achieved many financial milestones during your tenure in the seat. Thank you for your leadership and for your values. Howard, welcome. You\u2019ve demonstrated significant leadership as a member of my core leadership team over these past many years. I have strong confidence with you in this critical role for Dow. Bill, you\u2019re first. Bill Weideman : Thank you, Andrew. Turning to Slides 4 and 5 where I will review the highlights \u2013 financial highlights for the quarter. Earnings per share rose to $0.72 on an adjusted basis, up 44% versus the same quarter last year. This represents the eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth in earnings-per-share. We delivered broad-based revenue gains, particularly in performance plastics, performance materials and electronic and functional materials, demonstrating the value of our integrated value chains. In a volatile global environment that we\u2019ve faced again this quarter, our global footprint shine as sales rose in all geographic areas. Most notable was our strength in the Americas, where we are further investing in our industry-leading feedstock advantage and deep integration in downstream value-added products. The benefits of our sharp productivity focus drove EBITDA up 24% to $2.3 billion. Also, adjusted EBITDA margins expanded again this quarter, up more than 240 basis points. In fact, both performance plastics and electronic and functional materials achieved a record third quarter EBITDA. While continued productivity actions and improving market fundamentals across performance materials resulted in a year-over-year EBITDA increase of 61% in this segment, demonstrated the continued positive impact of the company's self-help actions. These factors more than offset the impact of a decline in equity earnings due to higher Sadara spending and the negative impact associated with our ethylene production facility outage in Fort Saskatchewan as we previously announced. Our advantaged positions, our drive for productivity and our geographic diversification, all helped to drive our operating rate to 88% this quarter, a level not seen since 2007. All of this enabled us to return value to you, our shareholders, evidenced by the 4.4 billion in declared dividends and share repurchases we have completed year-to-date. In short, we are focused on maintaining our momentum of further enhancing our OC [ph], increasing profitability, generating cash and maximizing shareholder value. Before I turn the call over to Howard, I\u2019d like to pause for a moment. As you know and as Andrew already mentioned, I have announced my plans to retire from Dow after 38 years of wonderful experience at the company. Howard and I will continue the transition process through the end of the year, but today represents my final earnings call as CFO. I'm very pleased to transition the CFO responsibilities to Howard. Howard\u2019s strong business leadership experience and passion for finance will be a great asset. It has truly been my pleasure to work for such a great company and to work with Andrew and with the other leadership members, Jim, Joe and Howard and all my Dow colleagues. I have been extremely fortunate and I have built lifelong relationships at Dow that I will cherish forever. With that, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Howard. Howard Ungerleider : Thank you very much, Bill and thank you for your leadership as our CFO but also thank you for the many significant contributions that you\u2019ve added so much value over the decades to Dow. I gladly but humbly accept the baton. It's been a real pleasure of getting the opportunity to work with you over the many years and please know that we will all miss you a great deal. Good morning everyone. Now let's walk through some of the insights and what we expect to see in the fourth quarter. We are not planning for any improvement in the macroeconomic environment. That said, we\u2019re positive on fundamentals in performance plastics, even with the headwinds of lower oil. In performance materials, we expect our ongoing focus on self-help actions to enable continued steady improvements for the segment versus the same quarter last year. On a sequential basis, we expect typical downward seasonality within both electronic and functional materials and coatings and infrastructure. While seasonality in ag sciences picks up, we expect full year growth in ag despite weak seed prices. Turnarounds are expected to be higher by approximately 50 million versus the prior quarter and approximately 75 million versus the year ago period. Sequentially, equity earnings are expected to be lower associated with turnarounds at our Kuwait and Prentiss and in addition, we\u2019re expecting higher spending in Fedora [ph] as the joint venture ramps toward first product in the second half of next year. We continue to carefully monitor the current hydrocarbon pricing environment and will leverage our feedstock flexibility to mitigate pricing volatility. Over the long term our view on oil remains constructive and we'll talk about that in a few minutes. In the near-term, however, the situation is volatile and we are well prepared to adapt as needed. On 2015, we will be providing our modeling assumptions at our upcoming investor forum in November in Houston. So yet one more reason to join us in Texas, next month. As you can see in our results, Dow delivered another solid performance, another proof point of our ongoing execution and the outcome of focused actions we continued to take on the top and the bottom line to drive higher profitability, leveraging our integrated value chains. The targeted actions we continue to drive across our portfolio are firmly rooted in this value chain focus. By applying a combination of best owner mindset, capturing opportunities for organic growth, taking advantage of the differentiation enabled by our integration and our geographic reach, and importantly, driving higher returns on capital, we\u2019re leveraging Dow\u2019s capabilities segment by segment and business by business to deliver higher returns. We\u2019re consistently seeing the results of this focus, as you can see on Slide 7, even in a quarter where macroeconomic volatility was amplified. This is most notable in performance materials, a segment where we have committed to improve and where our actions over the last many quarters continue to gain traction. Particularly in polyurethanes and epoxy, here we\u2019ve implemented a broader productivity focus, running a leaner, more efficient model and reducing costs. During the quarter, these actions led to higher volume and increased utilization, enabling stronger results. In areas of our portfolio where fundamentals remain strong, our productivity mindset is providing an additional source of upside on top of end market growth. For example, in electronic and functional materials and in performance plastics, the company achieved record quarterly EBITDA as higher revenues in key businesses were bolstered by aggressive actions we took to capture growing demand. In ag sciences, we achieved a major milestone in the quarter with back-to-back approvals for our Enlist weed control system. Results reflect softening market conditions in a seasonally weak quarter. However our technology investments and our commercialization of new molecules position us well for future growth in this attractive sector. Collectively we continue to pull strategic, operational and financial levers to navigate market uncertainty and to deliver increasing year-over-year results, all while reinforcing our foundation to strengthen returns over the long term. So what are we seeing in our segments? Beginning with electronic materials on Slide 8. While demand for Dow solutions in this sector remained strong, revenues declined slightly versus the year ago period. This was driven primarily by lower sales in films and filters and OLED materials. We do see continued upside on strength [ph] in semiconductor materials, particularly associated with our CMP pads and slurries. Looking forward, we expect market fundamentals in our electronic materials business to remain strong as consumer demand for continuous connectivity and brighter displays and widespread applications ranging from automobiles to homes drive ongoing innovation and growth into 2015. In functional materials, our businesses are delivering customized solutions built on close customer relationships. Dow Microbial Control and Dow Pharma and Food Solutions, both delivered double-digit growth with innovative products targeted at key sectors, including water, energy and pharmaceuticals. Moving forward we expect increased global demand for high-value solutions that require science-driven expertise. Turning to coatings and infrastructure solutions. In Dow Coating Materials, broad-based sales gains reflected the outcome of a combination of operational and strategic actions. This quarter also represented the seventh consecutive quarter of sales gains for this business. In epoxy coatings, for example, ongoing self-help enabled improved results. And while overall coatings market growth has slowed marginally in the third quarter, we do expect positive momentum for the full-year compared with 2013. This, of course, will be tempered slightly by the typical seasonal reduction in demand in the fourth quarter. In Dow Water and Process Solutions, we continue to see strong demand for reverse osmosis and ion exchange technologies. Our outlook for this business remains positive as we expect our leading technology position in this sector to enable top and bottom line growth for 2014 and into next year. Turning to Dow Building and Construction, self-help remains a key area focus and an important driver looking ahead, particularly in Europe, for example, where we have delivered multiple quarters of cost improvement despite lower demand. Shifting now to ag sciences on Slide 10. Our growth fundamentals remained solid and although sales in the quarter were flat, the segment reported record year-to-date sales. EBITDA performance was down versus the same quarter last year due to lower commodity pricing, resulting in fewer ag can [ph] applications. Our advances in innovation are helping to mitigate these current challenging market conditions. For example, year-to-date our sales of new crop protection products were up 18%, led by Isoclast insecticide. Seeds achieved record sales for the third quarter, led by soybeans and sunflower growth in North America and Latin America. Looking forward, North America acres are expected to shift to soybeans, while record acres and inventories are anticipated in the sector. Shifting to performance materials, where our productivity mindset and our ongoing focus on key end markets, such as transportation and oil and gas continues to strengthen this portfolio. For example, polyurethane achieved double-digit sales growth, driven by demand in key sectors, such as consumer comfort, appliance and industrial applications. In the specialty areas of this portfolio, Dow Oil, Gas and Mining delivered record sales due to double-digit growth on strong shale dynamics in North America, as well as project-related demand. And sales gains in Dow Automotive were driven by the adoption of innovative adhesive products, such as our breakthrough BETAMATE technology. Turning to performance materials where we continue to deliver growth across the value chain. In this segment, our low-cost advantage, coupled with higher demand in key sectors, enabled strong sales. Upstream supply tightened on the US Gulf Coast due primarily to scheduled turnarounds and strong derivative demand. Downstream, market demand in packaging, transportation and in hot melt adhesives drove increased sales all of which contributed to record profitability in this segment. Turning now to our six area of strategic focus. They have served as our compass, none more important than maximizing value for you, our shareholders. We have demonstrated over the last many quarters our firm commitment to these plans and factoring the previous three-months we have updated you on each one of these priorities. A critical part of this drive to return value includes our ongoing focus on productivity. By taking actions to reduce our structural costs and streamline our operations we have reduced fixed costs by 3% per year since 2012 compared to the impact of inflation. Additionally, this productivity drive has enabled us to increase operating rates to a level not seen since 2007, as Bill noted earlier. Our focus moving forward leverages our scale and our low-cost production, resulting in increasing sales to the market driven by higher productivity on our assets. We will have much more to say on this at our upcoming investor forum. Looking ahead into 2015, you can think about these priorities moving into the next phase; expanding our view toward longer-term accelerators of value while delivering our results in the short-term. To build upon the offering discussion, I\u2019d like to pause for a moment and step through the performance plastics dynamics, the foundation of which serves as a key source of momentum for our company and addresses several of the priorities on this list. So turning to slide 15, we have best-in-class flexibility and advantaged low-cost positions in the Americas and in Europe. Despite the recent market correction to declining oil prices, lower oil on the whole should help the world economy, particularly in the US, the UK, Japan and China and we would expect this positive impact to become more apparent as we move through 2015. Lower oil prices will certainly to some degree trigger margin compression for the world\u2019s ethane-based crackers. However modeling indicates that even at $80 oil, ethane-based crackers in the Americas will maintain their advantage cost status, as well as their first and second quartile low-cost positions. Lower oil is also a positive for our highly flexible crackers integrated complexes in Europe, where our best-in-class flexibility supports a regional advantaged low-cost position. From a global growth perspective, global GDP is forecast to be 3.4% or perhaps higher in 2015, up from 2.8% this year. Based on this, ethylene operating rates reach pricing power levels in the 2015 and 2016 timeframe. Reflecting this global growth, operating rates are improving, rising from just over 88% at the beginning of this year and heading toward 90% in 2015. Operating rates have been growing about 1% per year. Barring a global slowdown and with industry balances where they are, we would expect this trend to continue, taking operating rates above 91% as we move into 2016, continuing the march toward increasing pricing power for producers. The bottom line is this : we\u2019ve consistently said that feedstock flexibility remains an important aspect of our capabilities, and with high volatility in the oil market, our investments on the US Gulf Coast and our capabilities in Europe have historically and, I expect will again, prove to be a strong structured hedge protecting our low-cost advantages. The benefits of our strength are evident in our performance plastics results where tight supply and demand fundamentals for our advantaged product portfolio in North America, Latin America and Europe are delivering significant profitability. Moving to Slide 16, we continue to apply a best owner lens across our portfolio, driving progress and are committed to actions as a means to enable maximum value creation. Earlier this month we announced that our ANGUS Chemical Company, Sodium Borohydride and AgroFresh businesses are being actively marketed for divestment. As indicated, we expect to complete signing of these transactions by year-end 2014 and close early next year. Collectively these businesses are expected to yield proceeds of approximately $2 billion. In addition, during the quarter we completed the sale of a substantial portion of our North America railcar fleet, an action we committed to last quarter. This strategic step generated more than $400 million in cash proceeds and further, it firmly reinforces the company's commitment to deploy capital to areas where we can generate higher returns. We also continued to make steady progress on the planned carve-out of our chlorine chain, which as we have indicated is expected to generate EBITDA in the range of $500 million annually on a standalone basis. We've taken a number of actions to streamline this value chain and the businesses are demonstrating rising profitability as a result. We have received strong interest and are engaging directly with buyers. In fact, financials are now in the market. The project team is working diligently to stand up the carveout within a separate structure and remains firmly on track to have signed agreements in place by the second quarter of 2015. In all cases, transaction options will be examined to ensure Dow generates maximum value for the businesses and for our shareholders. As we have indicated, we will not sacrifice long-term returns for short-term gains. On top of all these actions, we continue to assess our opportunities to enhance the value created through our major joint ventures, either consolidating or deconsolidating to optimize the value these properties bring for our shareholders. The first step in this drive included the announcement we made earlier this month on our definitive agreement with ExxonMobil which will result in Univation Technologies becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dow. A valuable high-margin business, Univation will enhance our industry-leading performance plastics franchise and further strengthen our leadership position with the UNIPOL PE process which is a high demand technology. To date, our completed divestiture actions totaled $1.3 billion and the expected proceeds of the entire program will now be at the higher end of our $4.5 billion to $6 billion range. Turning to cash on Slide 17. We continue generating returns that exceed the cost of capital. In fact, the return on capital has increased by more than 150 basis points versus the same quarter last year. We\u2019re using this cash to fund our organic growth investment and reward shareholders. Case in point, we rewarded shareholders with $1.3 billion in declared dividends already this year and $3.4 billion in share repurchases in our current program to date. We\u2019re on track to complete this program by the end of this year. Dow\u2019s balance sheet is solid and our capital investments are on track. These investments once completed will serve as a significant new source of cash, allowing us to fund more organic growth and further enhance our ability to reward shareholders. And on that note, I'd like to turn the call back over to Andrew. Andrew Liveris : Thank you, Howard and if you look at Slide 18, we obviously are going to be talking about our investor forum but before that, it\u2019s been a terrific quarter with our self-help programs delivering in the face of extreme volatility. The market actually is showing us what it's been showing us for several years, that geopolitical unpredictability, speculation, and a jobless recovery are here to stay. That companies need to be agile to respond and they should respond by doing the basic blocking and tackling and doing it faster than their competition. And that the world is commoditizing and to meet this head on, we need to be aggressive portfolio managers, reliable and efficient operators and focus on our strengths while delivering cash for future growth and shareholder remuneration. Our superior integrated global low-cost manufacturing position in chemicals and plastics, with advantaged products in key markets, whether they be in plastics packaging, agriculture, or electronics with presence in key geographies is enviable, because it delivers both short and long-term value. We are relentless in our focus on cost and productivity, where we will sell out our efforts and sell up their product value with innovation. We have a strong balance sheet, getting stronger as our large projects start up next year. So next month, on November 12 and 13 at our investor forum in Freeport and Houston, we will unpack the next phase of Dow strategic execution. We will discuss and reveal increased transparency with our segments, our next phase of productivity, so further to Howard\u2019s comments, we\u2019ve reduced underlying fixed costs enabling us to invest in growth to the tune of more than $1 billion, while reducing overall cost by 3% per year versus inflation since 2012. So today we are announcing that we are committing to a further 1 billion productivity target over the next three years. And we\u2019re going to provide granularity on what this program will look like at our investor forum. We also will discuss our continued address to joint ventures and their future. A sharpened and more targeted market focus, especially in advanced materials and with the resultant decisions on R&D. Granularity on our key divestments, as well as on our growth programs, including but not limited to our Enlist launch. Details on our view of the ethylene cycle and how much cash we will generate in these next few years, and our next phase of shareholder remuneration. We will show our aligned team, organized to execute. We will discuss our metrics and how we are and will continue to be accountable to deliver short and long-term value creation. This is a company where with eight straight quarters of execution behind us, there is no gap between what we say and what we do. Come join us in Houston and Freeport, we will continue that drumbeat. With that, Jack, let's turn to Q&A. Jack Broodo : Thank you, Andrew. Now we will move on to your questions. But however I would like to remind you that my comments regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. Lauren, would you please explain the Q&A procedure? Operator : (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Cooley May with Macquarie. Cooley May : Now despite an operating line result that beat expectations, equity earnings were down 30% year-over-year and corporate costs were up 35% year-over-year, which combined you cut 170 million out of your consolidated profit, if I am looking at it correctly. Howard, how do you think each of [indiscernible] footprint in the 2015 and what do you view as a normal level for corporate costs? Howard Ungerleider : Hi Cooley, you\u2019re not going to throw that to Bill, uh? It\u2019s his last call. Now just kidding Cooley, good to talk to you. I would say that look, on corporate, yeah, corporate was a little bit higher than usual. There was really \u2013 the primary reason was some insurance operations which was a benefit a year ago and there was a cost in the quarter. There was also some divestiture expenses and a couple of one-time litigation issues. I would say for modeling purposes going forward on corporate, our guidance remains in the $250 million a quarter range and we will have more to say about corporate at investor day. In terms of equity earnings, I would say that the equity earnings were down, a couple of drivers -- Dow Corning actually increased on improved volumes across both polysilicon and silicon but that was more than offset with the higher spending in Sadara as well as our Kuwait JVs decreased due to lower Kuwait volumes and an impact to MEG in Canada because of a mechanical failure that we had. So those are the two big issues. Cooley May : Okay. Andrew, my question is for you. Looking out two years, what part of Dow\u2019s business do you think is currently being ignored and offers the most upside potential to your profit base relative to investor expectations at this point? Andrew Liveris : Well, I think these last few weeks of oil price decline one more time showed \u2013 and just a little footnote on oil price, Cooley, if you look at the Brent, actually Brent had a steeper decline, was steeper decline from June to September as it did in the last few weeks. But the fact that we\u2019ve got into the 80s is spooking people. When people do look at us, and then look to next year and the year following, they are not seeing the ethane cycle upside and it\u2019s not being reflected yet in our equity price. I mean that to me is the biggest myth and what people seem to be confusing often is we're making record margins, we just had record margin in this quarter, but that\u2019s off a low-cost base. US shale did not exist in the previous cycle and so we are all making more money, it doesn\u2019t mean that the cycle isn\u2019t here to come based on demand \u2013 based on supply demand and therefore price uplift, and as Slide 15 showed, we\u2019ve been having price uplift now for some time based on outages. And outages tell you a lot about what\u2019s going to happen here as demand continues to improve. Low oil price means more demand in the GDP. That actually will help the cycle and they are missing that, only are they missing that, they\u2019re not counting in the big start-ups next year of Sadara, okay that will feed our ability to make more money off a low-cost base with pricing power. Of course they also don\u2019t \u2013 and this is of course a problem with everyone, innovation is a hard thing to factor in, and what we're doing and what we\u2019ll do at investor forum is unpack some of our innovation especially around Agro Sciences and especially around Enlist and last but not least, this ongoing productivity self-help drive, I think people are now starting to see it and this announcement that I just made five minutes ago is our relentless drive on productivity will continue and that should be a factor in our ability to continue to expand earnings. Operator : Our next question comes from [Hasan Amit with Allenbacks Global] Unidentified Analyst : You know, a nice bump-up in sort of company like operating rates, good 6% year on year. My question is \u2013 and I know it\u2019s a bit broad question but how much of that uplift was a result of sort of declining non-ethane-based feedstock cost through the quarter? So let me ask it slightly differently. So let\u2019s say that if oil prices were at $90 a barrel, or a $100 a barrel, in the next coming quarters, would you still have these elevated operating rates? Andrew Liveris : Yeah, I mean yes, I think the Americas, for us, are firing on all cylinders. I mean I think our low-cost base in the US, Canada and Argentina, we shouldn't ignore Argentina, is meaning that those operating rates \u2013 I mean we\u2019re running a pretty much sold out engine based on low-cost. And so the rest of the world has had to catch up, a low naphtha cost is actually going to help our European and our small exposure in Asia. So now the only foreshadowing again that it\u2019s just going to help our competition as well, but back to my demand point I made on the previous answer to Cooley, ultimately that will help. It\u2019s just something that people aren\u2019t really noticing is what\u2019s happening in propane and what's going to \u2013 that\u2019s going to mean a PDH, for example and propane is about to enter our crack slate based on pricing comparative. So much for export terminals, Hasan, I mean and for that matter so much for ethane export terminals. It just takes two weeks of low oil price to get everyone to re-evaluate where low-cost is. Our flexibility on the crack slate is everything and it comes to play right this moment, so advantage those who have got flexible furnaces which is us. Unidentified Analyst : Now obviously say that the currency moves, dollar strengthening and the like, as you think about the net and targets, call it, 10 billion in EBITDA, how should we be thinking about the FX side of things? Bill Weideman : Really, from a currency impact, it doesn\u2019t have a significant impact on us, so that\u2019s why we don\u2019t spend a lot of time talking about currency. Actually this quarter there were some movements as you know and the dollar strengthened throughout this quarter but actually the currency impact on our sales line was fairly small. Don't forget that the currency move impacts the both the top line but also your cost. And so the net impact is not very resizable. It did have a little bit of impact on our equity this quarter \u2013 on our balance sheet, I am sorry because of the translation impact but really from an income statement not a lot of impact. Howard Ungerleider : Just to add on to Bill\u2019s point, I would say that the headwind was about $0.04 a share versus the prior quarter. So you could expect it to also be a headwind as we head into the fourth quarter here with the move. But hopefully I will continue in Bill\u2019s tradition and the long-standing CFO tradition that we don't really talk about currency as a headwind or a tailwind. Operator : Our next question comes from John Roberts with UBS. John Roberts : I would agree with low oil prices should help stimulate demand in the intermediate term but in the short-term do you think we have an inventory correction especially around year-end that might depress volume temporarily? Andrew Liveris : John, that\u2019s a fair point. I mean I think Howard said it in his remarks, when we were dwelling on Slide 15, and again \u2013 who is perfect in the forecasting world here but as far as we see the supply-chains and value chains, given that year-end, given that people look at December in a certain way, we always see this O shaped quarters and inventory is a big factor in all of these conversations. People do in fact clear the books in December; factories do come down, inventory clearing does happen. But you remember inventory is a very low across the value chains right now. And so that\u2019s at the polymer end, and at the monomer end too. So look, I think your point is fair in the very short term but again you got to look at 2015 and start feeling confident about cycle. I want to keep reminding all of us as you ask these sort of questions, we\u2019ve been working on this for eight straight quarters, as sustainable profits. This isn\u2019t come in this quarter and the fact that there\u2019s some margin expansion going on, that\u2019s actually a sustained margin expansion conversation and we've always talked about self-help as the tailwind but then adds another tailwind called margin expansion based on the product cycle, and I think one quarter, this next quarter, I think there will be some maybe slight depression or compression based on the fact that there may be slower demand and the oil price effect. But it will rewrite itself next year. John Roberts : And at the investor day do you think you'll know the structure of the chlorine transaction whether it's one or more deals and whether it involves JVs? Andrew Liveris : As our slide said that financials are in the market, we've always said strong interest, people are now receiving their books and \u2013 but it\u2019s too early point but they do unpack to that degree but we will unpack as much as we can. We know everyone like you is hungry for more details on that. We are quite confident on our upper end of that target because of what we\u2019re seeing is very strong buyer interest. Operator : Our next question comes from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Bob Koort : Andrew, you mentioned when you come down here to Houston, you\u2019re going to have, one of the discussion topics would be increased transparency within the segments; can you give us a better sense of what you mean and what you expect or hope to achieve from doing that? Andrew Liveris : So why don\u2019t I let Howard have a shot at it and then I will add as required. Go ahead, Howard. Howard Ungerleider : Hey Bob, hopefully you get the weather good for us down there because we\u2019re definitely heading into the colder season here in Michigan. It's really all about improving our transparency and improving our granularity and trying to really line it up based on markets and based on value chains and based on our integration. So that\u2019s how we are thinking about it and we will have a lot more to say when we see you next month. Bill Weideman : We will show you more information in terms of the \u2013 our view of those segments going forward, in terms of what our expectations are. So again with this drumbeat in terms of delivering what we say we are going to deliver. Andrew Liveris : I would add \u2013 look, Bob, I am very conscious of the other side of your question, what you did not ask, which is companies like ours and competitive sets, we want to be as good as our competitors are and slightly better at transparency but not a whole lot better because we don't want to give away competitive information. And we get a lot of inventory feedback on this question by the way. We have been out in the road a lot this year, asking exactly the question you are asking. Bob Koort : I guess maybe the heard of my question is the revelation of this additional detail is going to result in some inspiration for your shareholders, will there be things they learn that put Dow on a better light or that show more effective management of the business, or what do you expect to get from that granularity and transparency? Andrew Liveris : Well, I will tell you what we are not looking for. We\u2019re not looking to confuse you or anyone. We\u2019re not looking to make it harder for you to follow-ups, so in the spirit of moving in the right direction we want transparency but not to a fault, so people understand how and where we make money, about how and where we make money over a cycle. Bill Weideman : And add to that, Bob, so, and to really give you more information so you can understand the company. So we will plan to show you more level of detail in our corporate segment, what\u2019s in there, how do our costs and allocation work, how do we assign cost to businesses, how do we transfer, our transfer pricing etc. So with the spirit of trying to give you more information to understand, you understand the company. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Jeff Zekauskas : When you sell your assets and hopefully next year you will get your $6 billion, what do you plan to do with it and I guess there are two cases if you can buyback your preferred or if you can\u2019t, so in the case of being able to buy back the preferred, what do you do with the extra 2 billion, do you contract the company by buying shares or do you acquire? And if you can\u2019t buy back the preferred what do you do with 6 billion? Howard Ungerleider : I would say \u2013 the first priorities remain shareholder remuneration, you can think about that both in dividend growth as well as continued stock buyback. I would also say organic growth in finishing our projects and getting those projects up to speed. Obviously the preferreds have been on Bill\u2019s mind, they will continue to be on my mind and you know we\u2019re going to continue to try to find a path where those -- we can take those out of the structure at the right moment for a fair value for all of our shareholders and then fundamentally \u2013 I think the last question where you were leading is Andrew said repeatedly there is going to be no major M&A in our near-term future. Andrew Liveris : Shareholder remuneration through share buyback, start to \u2013 you saw the slide, if you get the number out, the next of the last slide that had this last 12 months profitable quarters, slide number 17, you should think about that way. We are very shareholder remuneration oriented, the way we\u2019re going to give money back to the holders as the preferred, not the financials \u2013 because fundamentally we believe that improvement in ROC, improvement in EBA, improvement in ROE, and Howard and I are going to be working very hard on talking about financial goals going forward. This is a cash machine that\u2019s going to be rewarding shareholders, so we\u2019ve got plenty of growth, that we\u2019re spending quite a lot on investment for future earnings growth. The US Gulf Coast investments, EnList in case in point but shareholder -- friendly shareholder remuneration, that\u2019s the drumbeat. Jeff Zekauskas : I know that there's been so much controversy over whether the ag business should be monetized but should the ag business be grown via acquisition, or do you think that that's not something \u2013 it doesn't need that extra strength or scale? Andrew Liveris : It\u2019s got an scale of being part of Dow Chemical Company, 40% of R&D goes to ag. They\u2019ve proven their worth, they have proven to double the business the last five years, the pipeline is rich, very robust, soon to generate much more EBITDA at both cross protection and seeds and traits, and next year or two very key. So I think we\u2019ve got the time to answer your question, I think there's a lot of what I call internal \u2013 this is why I say, what Howard said, we don\u2019t need external M&A, we\u2019ve got plenty of internal M&A, which is to acquire more revenue streams by funding \u2013 funding electronics, on funding plastic packaging, we\u2019re going deeper and more vertical into markets and businesses that we can grow. Ag has earned its right to play to do out scale in their innovation. Operator : Our next question comes from Peter Butler with Glen Hill Investments. Peter Butler : On the same topic, Andrew, you have been predicting for some time at least one more major consolidation step in the ag chemical sector, do you think Dow would be a player in this and if so, how much does the Enlist approval enhance your negotiations? Andrew Liveris : Thanks Peter. Yeah Enlist does enhance our leverage on any value creation because its approval which of course is a key approval of the last few weeks have been \u2013 to know what we consider the launch, and the launch is next year and this launch is a controlled launch leading to bigger year, the following year in \u201816 as we go into soybeans etc. This is a very big step for our future pipeline value manifesting itself in the current EBITDA. We are no talking NPVs \u2013 we are talking about EBITDA coming next year and the following year not just from Enlist but also all the crop protection launches that they have got going on. So these things would transfer now from a pipeline to actual EBITDA stream, the consequence of that means that the value of [dazz] increases substantially and that means \u2013 and we\u2019ve always said these two points, no sacred cows, if the future value can be brought to current numbers, then you know we would look at all options and if it is around the consolidation, we would love to be a part of that for more value creation than owning it ourselves. So the best owner mindset applies. Having said that we\u2019ve got pipeline going to EBITDA. We\u2019d like to get that value. Okay. And that\u2019s why we\u2019ve always said what we\u2019ve said. If there is a round of consolidation out there, you can count us being at the table. Peter Butler : In regard to-- we\u2019re getting creeping closer and closer to the uptake on this ethylene cycle and when you look back at some of the previous cycles starting with the one in 1973, a lot of the analysts that follow your stock today weren\u2019t even born probably during that period, before that period. Could you maybe summarize what happens as operating rates edge towards the 90% zone and your customer start getting nervous and start adding the pipeline inventory? Has this process started where are we and what you see happening? Andrew Liveris : Yeah, the process and there is always a lead indicator called the outages, when outages start affecting pricing as they\u2019re having now and Howard showed at the slide 15, that\u2019s the harbinger of upcoming operating rate that hits the 90s for the industry and as we\u2019ve already indicated Dow\u2019s already there in the Americas. And so it\u2019s really the rest of world getting up there. Predicting the cycle based on outages is a fools darn because if it\u2019s just outages driving up prices temporary, the resiliency of those price increases really comes back to demand and lack of supply. The lack of supply is well documented but there is no fear factor based on supply demand studies that we\u2019ve done and others have done including our competitors that the capacity coming on the U.S. will be enough and soon enough to interrupt that cycle, the cycle that we will see a 15-16 cycle who knows what we would call the cycle whether it be as big as the one in the late 80s or the one that happened a decade ago in \u201905 which was shorter. This one looks a little longer. The area under the curve looks quite big based on supply shortage and that because of outages we might get it earlier than maybe otherwise and it could start earlier. We\u2019re not particularly forecasting that. In general low oil, if it impacts positive demand, there may be some price margin compression the very near term John Roberts\u2019 question, but that\u2019s just the head fact. Oil price should go up from here based on healthy economic demand out there whether it be China or Japan or the U.S. or the U.K. needing as that\u2019s a tax break for them, so that will help consumption. So we think this cycle is going to be quite a good cycle and we\u2019re very positioned to get price powers we have been getting based on the outages. Howard Ungerleider : Hi, Peter. This is Howard. I would just say that two other things \u2013 one on the supply side and one on the demand side. As we head into an ethylene up cycle uptick, the assets tend to run harder and then they tend to break. I mean every year further the grid becomes a year older and so when you try to run assets really hard to maximize production across the industry, you tend to see more outages as you head in and then on the demand side, the people in the industry spend a lot of time in plastics over the years. You talked about 11-month years. From a demand standpoint you talked about 13-month years and so in an up-cycle where people expect prices to be higher tomorrow, you tend to get 13-month years and maybe one or two or three in a row depending on all the other variables that Andrew talked about. Operator : Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Kevin McCarthy : Yes, good morning. Andrew, propane is down about $0.20 a gallon on the U.S. Gulf for over the last 20 days. Can you discuss how much of your feedstock mix you\u2019re able to shift in to propane trying to get a handle on how much you might be able to hammer down U.S. cost to preserve your margins if the high-end of the curve does indeed come down on the back of Brent crude oil? Andrew Liveris : Propane flexed in the U.S. in terms of substitutability of ethane slate. As you know we\u2019ve all been heavy ethane and very low naphtha, we believe that we can get up to 30%, 40%, as a company 60% in Europe which is a very big one. And from memory, I\u2019m just looking over to Jack over here. I think it\u2019s a little low in the United States. It\u2019s a low 60% as well Jack tells me. That\u2019s a handiness of having the previous hydrocarbon guy. That\u2019s a very helpful question because that actually speaks to what\u2019s going to happen here on low oil price. Bill Weideman : I would also say that \u2013 you raised a key point because a lot of people in the industry talk about feedstock flexibility and what they really mean is they are switching from propane or other feed to ethane only. We have very much been focused on feedstock flexibility for many, many years. I think we have leading edge flexibility versus the industry on propane and as we do our additional ethane projects, we are not losing or giving up any other flexibility propane or other. Kevin McCarthy : Then you know as a follow-up on the financial side, we\u2019re about two and half months away from the end of the year and presumably completion of your existing share repurchase authorization. When you take into account your prospect of the divestiture proceeds and the progress you have made on the balance sheet, how would it handicap a new authorization at this juncture? Andrew Liveris : Howard? Howard Ungerleider : We\u2019ll have a lot more to say, Kevin, about that at investor day. I mean as our earnings ramped, we have historically talked about the 45%, 50% payout ratio. And I think as we get these divestiture proceeds you should think about shareholder remuneration being a key part of that. That is our top priority and that you should think about it both from additional stock buyback as well as dividends. Operator : Our next question comes from-- Andrew Liveris : Kevin, thank you. We got time for one or two more calls -- one or two more questions on the call. Operator : Thank you, Sir. Our next question comes from PJ Juvekar with Citi. PJ Juvekar : Yes, hi, good morning. Andrew Liveris : Good morning, PJ. PJ Juvekar : Andrew, if oil space even declines from here, do you think some of the announced ethylene projects in the outer year in 2018 and \u201919? Do you think they are at the risks of getting pushed out or even cancelled? Andrew Liveris : Look, I don\u2019t think so, PJ. I think firstly we\u2019d given you a view on oil as we see it. I do think the journey for oil through \u201980 down into the 70s will find its way back to the 100s. I think this is why I think everyone is looking at this from the point of view of supply and demand. It\u2019s being well written. The breakeven price in Middle East and produces, the incremental cost of the marginal producers to produce like tar sands or for that matter U.S. shale. You\u2019ve got to look at this and say look, U.S. ethane advantage is here to stay, it\u2019s going to be here a decade or more based on supply. It could affect LNG projects, though. I think that will be the bigger effect and for that matter ethane exports. I do think that\u2019s the more likely effect, PJ. PJ Juvekar : Okay. And then secondly you are seeing some declines in crop protection sales. Can you talk about the dynamic going into next year? Do you think with low green prices that crop protection pricing could go down? Thank you. Andrew Liveris : Yes, look I think there is a-- the crop\u2014camaraderie price of this crop-- this corn harvest, the fact that we\u2019ve had the weather issues. I mean weather are almost impossible to predict. But look we\u2019re watching the prices very, very closely. There is some corn acreage decrease, soy acreage increase. So there\u2019s a rotation going on. Lower prices will result in fewer planted acres and loss of some marginal application volume. So we\u2019re not overly concerned about it right now, but we are watching it very closely. What we get help by is all about new product launches which obviously on patent and it will give us margin expansion even if there is in the more what I would call generic word some price compression. Operator : And our final question comes from Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo Securities. Frank Mitsch : Good morning. Hi. Just respond to Peter\u2019s comment, I was actually around in 1973 and I don\u2019t remember the chemical cycle but I do remember the Mets dropped Game 7 of the World Series and I was very upset about that. Hey, congrats to Bill on your pending retirement and obviously to the other gentleman on their new positions. Andrew, you said earlier that we\u2019re not paying enough attention to the self-help and some of the projects that you have coming on and I was wondering if you could give an update on the timing as well as the potential cost versus expectations for the Freeport PDH project, the ethane flexibility project and of course Sadara. Andrew Liveris : Yes. So mid-2015 port PDH is on track, on schedule, on budget. Feel very, very good about that projects, very close now. LA3, the ethane flexibility project will be Q4 and Sadara is the early start up shale will be as you know that will come in phases. It will be mid-2015, probably the tail end of the Q2, Q3 timeframe. So, very big start-ups for us, a very big impact of the EBITDA lines given this dynamic that we\u2019ve been describing. Frank Mitsch : Let's keep it in the two-question mode. And look, on the last call, I believe the topic of MLPs came up. And there was some discussion about railcar or pipeline infrastructure. Obviously, you did the sale lease back on the railcar. Where do you stand on the whole MLP discussion? Andrew Liveris : Well it\u2019s very interesting to see what\u2019s going on now with one of our competitors right now and their MLP float price and where they are. So look as everything tax efficient structures have pluses and minuses, it does for companies like ours pretty limit you much to the new projects, if you now look at them, we\u2019ve looked at the new projects quite a lot and frankly we're not a huge fan -- I mean I think it's going to create complications and it is going to make it very much more difficult especially with all this volatility. So Bill, do you want to \u2013 Bill Weideman : Yes, we have looked at those Frank, Howard will continue to look at those, there is obviously pros and cons, but you also need to understand also the best ones are to fix return ones but it add more volatility back in your base earnings. Having said that, we are open mind we will continue to look at those as we go forward but as Andrew mentioned they need to -- it would only make sense as some of our new assets that are -- that have a high tax basis. Jack Broodo : That ends our question period, we\u2019re going to turn the call over to Andrew for some closing comments. Andrew Liveris : Yes, so I think in close, a strong for us, eight quarters in a row now. Strong cash flows in the quarter, more to come, the cycle question is a great question in terms of the cash coming and we are already starting to see it, more productivity come, the divestiture questions, we will have lot more granularity at investor day and all of that portfolio moves of the get out of low ROC businesses and bulk up in the organic growth programs that some of the questions were asking about finding ways to continue to grow through internal M&A, no big M&A of the outside type, we don't have any need for it, we have plenty of growth in this company, shareholder enumeration -- remuneration we are going to be very shareholder friendly, have been, we will continue to be and that\u2019s where our cash is going to go. We are listening to our investors and we'd love for you all to come to our investor forum to hear more about how our cash story is going to benefit our investors for the short, medium and long-term. Jack Broodo : Thank you everyone for your questions today. As always we appreciate your interest in the Dow Chemical Company. For your reference a copy of our prepared comments will be posted on Dow\u2019s website later today. This concludes our call for today. We look forward to speaking with you again soon. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day and welcome to the Dow Chemical Company\u2019s Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jack Broodo, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Jack Broodo : Good morning and welcome. I am Jack Broodo, Vice President of Investor Relations. As usual, we are making this call available to investors and the media via webcast. This call is the property of the Dow Chemical Company. Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without Dow\u2019s express written consent is strictly prohibited. On the call with me today are Andrew Liveris, Dow\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Howard Ungerleider, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Around 7 :00 am this morning, January 29, our earnings release went out on business wire and was posted on the internet on dow.com. We have prepared slides to supplement our comments on this conference call. These slides are posted on our website and through the link to our website. Some of our comments today include statements about our expectations for the future. Those expectations involve risks and uncertainties. We cannot guarantee the accuracy of any forecast or estimates, and we don\u2019t plan to update any forward-looking statements during the quarter. If you\u2019d like more information on the risks involved with forward-looking statements, please see our SEC filings. In addition, some of our comments reference non-GAAP financial measures, a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures are contained in our earnings release and on our website. Unless otherwise specified, all comparisons presented today will be on a year-over-year basis. Sales comparisons exclude divestitures, EBITDA, EBITDA margins, return on capital, and earnings comparisons exclude certain items. The agenda for today call is on slide three. I will now hand the call over to Howard. Howard Ungerleider : Thank you, Jack. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. 2014 proved to be a great year for Dow. We ended with a very strong fourth quarter and even with currency and oil uncertainty are moving toward a solid start to 2015. We achieved record results, thanks to our decisive and disciplined approach to executing on our priorities. In the midst of a challenging operating environment Dow once again delivered. The fourth quarter is our ninth consecutive quarter of year-over-year EPS, EBITDA and EBITDA margin growth. These results demonstrates our focus in driving targeted self-help, executing on our strategic actions, increasing return on capital and maximizing our returns. As a result, earnings per share rose to $0.85 on an adjusted basis, a $0.20 per share increased year-over-year. EBITDA increased to $2.4 billion on an adjusted basis representing a new fourth quarter record with gains across all operating segments. We delivered broad-based EBITDA margin expansion, up nearly 220 basis points on an adjusted basis, thanks to our integration, our end market diversification and our global market access, and we continued our strong focus on working capital efficiency. Cash flow from operations was up $500 million versus the prior period. All of these actions enabled us to finish 2014 with strength, which brings me to our full year results. Earnings per share grew to $3.11 on an adjusted basis, a 25% increase versus 2013. EBITDA rose nearly $1 billion achieving a full year record of $9.3 billion on an adjusted basis. We expanded EBITDA margins and improved return on capital. We also accelerated our portfolio management actions and we made excellent progress on our key growth projects that are on track to startup this year. And we delivered a second consecutive year of record cash flow from operations. These results enabled us to continue to increasingly reward our shareholders. $4.5 billion in share buybacks completed with the launch of another $5 billion trance and two dividend increases put into motion. In total we returned nearly $6 billion to shareholders in 2014 representing an all time record. Earnings, cash flow and shareholders remuneration are each an all-time high. Our strategic decisions have created a portfolio that is less volatile and has lower risk due to our integration, global scale and product market diversity delivering an earnings base much higher than previous economic cycles with significant financial flexibility. Coupled with our self-help and productivity actions which continue to deliver cash and lower our costs, we are well positioned to continue to maximize returns in this uncertain environment. Those were the headlines. Now let me provide more detail on the company\u2019s operating performance, market trends, strategic agenda and outlook. Moving to slide five, sales were $14.4 billion. Our team delivered 4% volume growth overall with growth across all operating segments except infrastructure solutions. Our price decline was 4% driven by Western Europe with half of the total decline due to currency. Our productivity actions including our volume growth was a key driver behind our EBITDA margin expansion this quarter, as well as our intense focus on our day-to-day commercial and operational metrics such as price margin and inventory. Revenue highlights for the quarter include Ag Sciences which grew sales $82 million, resulting in a fourth quarter record for this segment. Performance materials and chemicals increased sales a $172 million with sales growth driven primarily by Epoxy and Polyurethanes, which reported double-digit growth, both businesses showing firm improvement in 2014. On the bottom line record fourth quarter EBITDA gains were driven primarily by Ag on an increased sales of differentiated products and technologies. Performance materials and chemicals also drove EBITDA increases through its ongoing productivity actions and performance plastics achieved its 10th quarter in a row of year-over-year EBITDA growth. Let\u2019s take a closer look at each segment beginning on slide seven. Ag Sciences delivered a record quarter. Fourth quarter sales were up 5% and adjusted EBITDA was up $63 million, reaching $222 million. EBITDA margin improvement was driven by broad-based sales gains of our innovation driven technology platforms and sales from new crop protection products increased 23% year-over-year. From a macro perspective, global projections for food and crop demand highlights the need for significantly higher yields. Dow Agrosciences and our technologies focused on delivering products that help growers meet these expectations. And we\u2019re working to commercialize our new products as quickly as possible. A key example Enlist, there is real enthusiasm among the grower community for this top performing system, and in 2014 we made great strides and bringing it to market by gaining USDA regulation and U.S. EPA registration. We\u2019re actively working with the Chinese government agencies and expect approval for Enlist corn in 2015. We\u2019re moving forward to ensure a successful stewarded launch in United Stated for corn in 2015 and a full commercial launch in 2016. Mix upgrades and the ramp up of new technologies are expected to drive earnings growth above markets, some examples in our crop protection business are Arylex, spinetoram and Isoclast. These new products help farmers address resistance issues and deliver 20% to 30% higher margins than our base crop protection products. Dow AgroSciences innovation engine combined with our growing presence in seeds, our ongoing focus to both improved working capital and optimized costs will enable ongoing margin expansion. Turning to consumer solutions on slide eight, adjusted EBITDA grew by $31 million to $243 million for the quarter on flat sales, as increases in automotive volume offset currency headwinds. Margin expansion was driven by higher volume in North America and Europe. We do expect growth and margin expansion driven by increasing demand in Dow Electronic materials, Dow automotive and consumer care. 2014 was a record year for Dow automotive. Demand for larger and premium vehicles with better fuel economy and lower emission is a key growth trend. Our BETAMATE brand of structural adhesives are enabling light weighting by bonding dissimilar materials such as aluminum and plastics and is now in use in about 12% of new cars today supplying 60% of this new and rapidly growing application. Consumer care delivered EBITDA margin growth in 2014 as well. Here brand owners are focused on delivering innovative products that differentiate their brands while increasing their returns. Dow is working alongside our customers collaborating to innovate customized profitable solutions via enabling chemistry. Margins also expanded in Dow electronic materials in 2014 primarily due to mix upgrades. Consumers rapidly escalating expectations for electronics is driving the need for lighter, brighter and more powerful devices. We\u2019re excited about these trends as we enter 2015. Semiconductor content and display technology demand is also on the rise as consumers require computing power in their mobile devices. The rapid shift to phablets and hybrid PCs which have higher turnover than traditional PCs is requiring faster innovation cycles. Moving to infrastructure solutions on slide nine, adjusted EBITDA was up $31 million to $244 million and we delivered margin expansion on self-help productivity actions and improve business conditions at Dow Corning despite sales declines of 4%, which were due primarily to currency headwinds and from a weaker construction market in Europe. Energy and water solutions is delivering consistent growth, customer across the sector are demanding close collaboration and Dow\u2019s close to customer strategy placing experts to work hand in hand with our customers continues to gain traction and has enabled multiple quarters of double-digit increases in demand for our microbial controlled technologies. In the water section, Dow\u2019s separation technologies are necessary to address the need for sustainable water solutions. We expect that water technology markets will remain robust and should see an acceleration in growth as global GDP continues to improve. We\u2019ve also increase the profitability of Dow Building & Construction with significant improvement in Europe, thanks to our focused efforts to reduce our structural cost. The U.S. construction market continues to improve as evidence by December housing starts. We\u2019re launching new products and construction chemicals and insulation and enhancing our cost position to drive further earnings improvements. In Dow Coating Materials we delivered top and bottom line growth in 2014. We\u2019re capitalizing on trends in the architectural coating space, innovating to drive adoption of high quality paints and expanding our vinyl acrylic emulsions is part of our tier in product offering strategy. This will enable us to expand our reach in emerging markets as well as the U.S. contractor market. Turning to slide 10, performance materials and chemical sales grew 5% and adjusted EBITDA was up $98 million to $636 million for the quarter. Significant EBITDA margin increases are result of ongoing sell out and productivity actions resulting in higher operating rates and lower more advantage costs. In Polyurethanes these actions resulted in a completion of the $100 million productivity program we began in 2013. We have also increased production by more than 15% over the last two years. We\u2019re now operating more locally than before to allow more agile responses to market dynamics as well as selling into the most profitable regions. For Epoxy we have completed more than half of our productivity target and expect to complete the full program in 2015. The quality of our business continues to improve as we implement to mitigate the impact of continued industry pressures from oversupply in Asia-Pacific. Further actions to enhanced efficiency and performance materials and chemicals should continue to provide tailwinds for this segment. Turning now to performance plastics on slide 11, adjusted EBITDA was up $66 million to $1.2 billion, representing a fourth quarter record which culminated in a sequential full year EBITDA record. We deliver this achievement even as sales decline 3%, falling energy cost, higher volumes and tight supply demand dynamics combined to create margin expansion in the fourth quarter. On the topline demand is steady and our assets are running hard in United States and globally. Sales were actually flat year-over-year when we exclude hydrocarbons and energy co-product values which decline with oil. Our strategy for this segment has been purposely build on differentiation eliminating lower margin and/or commoditizing portions of the segments and pursuing higher margin, differentiated product lines and markets. As a result we have built a portfolio that has been delivering higher and more consistent returns through a variety of economic conditions. Looking ahead well there is clearly pricing pressures, demand fundamentals have not changed. Our sales volumes actually look slightly better than last as customers orders remains steady before the late February through June seasonal typical demand strengths. Dow sales in resin markets around the world and [indiscernible] highest return opportunities, that enabled us to hold fourth quarter non-hydrocarbon sales flat year-on-year in the segment. For example, margins are improving in our [Indiscernible] as we sell in to the strengthening automotive market. Similarly higher demand in the high voltage power cable market as more money is freed up for new infrastructure projects is helping our electrical and telecommunications business. 2014 was another year which Dow progressed in our strategic growth initiatives and 2015 will be a major milestone year for Dow with the startup of several of our major investments. Let me give you a quick updates on these investments on slide 13. Our projects on the U.S. Gulf Coast and the Middle East remained on schedule. Sadara will establish a foundation that we will leverage to compete in the Asian and Middle Eastern markets for the next many decades. Over construction is approximately 85% complete with construction for first product assets in polyurethane value chain approximately 95% complete. Falling propylene prices United States are improving the competitiveness of our U.S. based propylene derivative businesses. While at the same time expanding our integration advantage in our market-facing businesses. Our new PDH unit comes on stream in the second half of 2015 capturing the propane to propylene spread for one-third of Dow\u2019s U.S. propylene needs expanding the earnings power of Dow\u2019s integrated business model. I discussed Enlist and Stewarded introduction in 2015, we remained enthusiastic about Enlist along with the entire suite of Ag Science innovations that continue their steady pace of launches. This business continues to outperform because it\u2019s integrated into Dow\u2019s manufacturing and R&D platforms and we remain on track to once again double the value of Dow ArgoSciences in the next five to seven years. All of these projects are high return investments and strengthen Dow\u2019s income growth trajectory even during volatile commodity environments. However, we\u2019re not sitting back resting on the returns these investments are bringing and will bring. We\u2019re continuing our drive to take cost out of the organization and maximize the opportunities from the existing assets. With that lens in mind, let\u2019s turn to our productivity actions on slide 14. We produced and sold more than 3.5 billion incremental pounds in 2014 versus 2013, and we continue to drive to higher operating rates across the company yielding lower unit cost all what remaining leader in environmental health and safety performance. In the fourth quarter Dow achieved an 86% operating rate, an increase of 400 basis points versus the fourth quarter of 2013 and the highest fourth quarter in the last five years. We also ended the year with strength. December 2014 came in at 84% versus 79% in December 2013. 2015 has similar opportunity. In fact while we\u2019ve seen a decade of heavy investment in exploration and production which is now resulting in lower oil and gas price. Those investments significantly outpace the number of petrochemical investment. Dow has now experienced accelerating operating rates for five quarters in a row. When you consider our operating leverage of more than $200 million for every 1% improvement in operating rates it\u2019s clear that Dow is well positioned to capture significant upside in our operating income as we continue to see demand response to low oil Low oil price will be a tailwind for global demand and for our products. We\u2019re also maintaining a constant productivity focus so that we can continue to deliver in a low oil price world. We have now done this for many years and our new next enterprise systems architecture is enabling even more opportunity for further improvements in cost reductions and efficiencies. This focus was a key source of momentum in our results this quarter and will also be an important tool for Dow in 2015 and 2016. One of the other mechanisms to improve productivity is to divest businesses that fall outside of our ROC targets or our long term strategic direction. So let\u2019s move to slide 16 for a brief update on our portfolio of commitments and actions. Our focus on working capital efficiency and proceeds from portfolio management actions are generating strong cash flows. At the same time we\u2019re driving targeted actions across our portfolio, divesting non-strategic assets and businesses such as the Angus Chemical Company and sodium or hydrate divestments which we announced in November and the carve-out of our chlorine chain which remains on track for close at the end of this year. We\u2019re also redirecting resources toward more strategic uses and we have been clear on our priorities for uses of cash. We are and we will continue to invest in our future through organic growth investments and to reward our shareholders as shown on this slide. We achieved another record number of patents granted with 20% of our sales yielding margin differential greater than a 1,000 basis points above our non-patent advantage products notably nearly 35% of Dow\u2019s revenue now comes from new products. We delivered $6 billion to shareholders and declared dividends and share repurchases. We completed our $4.5 billion share repurchase program and launched an additional $5 billion trench and we announced two dividend increases in the year. Dow interventions over these last five years have build more resilient, more stable higher margin portfolio enabling us to more consistently reward and remunerate our shareholders. Now let\u2019s talk about what to expect for the first quarter of 2015 and the year. We see volume growth continuing with year-over-year growth expected coupled with steady demand. We anticipate performance plastics margins will remain strong although moderated by lower oil and gas. And we see further margin expansion in performance materials and chemicals driven by ongoing improvement in Polyurethanes and Epoxy. Equity earnings are expected to be down as Sadara cost ramp up and MEG prices fall. We anticipate an increase in turnaround cost in a range of $150 million sequentially in year-over-year. Our previously announced productivity program will continue to gain traction and we expect to generate approximately $300 million, improvements by year end offsetting the impact of inflation. We expect pension be a headwind in 2015, up more than a $100 million on full year basis. And as our growth projects come on line we expect capital expenditures to peak at around $3.9 billion for the year. We anticipate continued near term currency headwinds and expect the range of between 15% to 30% of the change in revenue to translate to an EBITDA impact. And finally on tax rate, it\u2019s expected to be in the 25% to 28% range for the year. Dow had an exceptional 2014 ending the year with a record fourth quarter delivering a ninth quarter of year-over-year EPS, EBITDA and EBITDA margin growth, growing demand for our products, increasing our operating rates, executing on our strategic initiatives, enhancing our financial discipline, increasing our return on capital and delivering significant value to our shareholders. Historically, when Dow have seen escalating rates, favorable energy markets, and increasing GDP, it has bode well for our company\u2019s performance in the years that follow. I\u2019m excited about where the company is today and its future. So with that I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Andrew for a full year review on Dow\u2019s performance as well as our outlook for 2015. Andrew Liveris : Thank you, Howard. And we\u2019ll turn to slide 19, I\u2019ll begin with our vision, our core, the tenant that underscore each and every action that we take optimizing long term value per share. This singular focus was the few behind our record performance in 2014 and we prepared us in 2015 and beyond. Put simply, we are creating short, medium and long term value firmly in line with the strategic actions we have taken and the results that we have delivered over these previous nine quarters. Moving into 2015 the value and resiliency of our strategy are clear. We are integrated products company build on low cost manufacturing positions with interlinked businesses align to attractive end markets and geographies with decisive growth strategies. We are interdependent portfolio of assets and it is through our integrated portfolio in volatile time such as these that our real strength and our real value are evident. Leveraging up cycles to capitalize in cash engines upstream and delivering returns through our differentiated end market aligned businesses downstream and throughout the cycle. We are proving wide is best to own the full value chain. We need to only look to the last three months as an example where markets were volatile and moving fast and creating uncertainty around 2015 performance. And yet these dynamics emphasize the advantages of the Dow modeling strategy. Pure-play North American ethylene produces have face headwinds from falling oil. That same headwind which of course we fuel to a much more limited extent, largely represents a tailwind in our businesses aligned to consumer, infrastructure, performance materials and chemical sectors and indeed performance plastics. In addition the slow oil price environment is further mitigated by our flexible feedstock position in the United States and Europe and has made this new energy environment a net competitive position for Dow. Our European plastics businesses in fourth quarter show this is one clear proof point. Other examples that balance each other to the positive for Dow\u2019s unique business model in this environment is the propylene effect even though of lower propylene prices in the United States is a small headwind our PDH investment, it is a stronger tailwind where Arylex and Polyurethanes business as it enables margin expansion in an improved competitive position. For further illustration the value of our strategy just look at our record fourth quarter results, despite plunging oil we reported a 15%, $314 million increase in operating EBITDA with growth in every segment. Let me be clear, I\u2019m not here to state that there will be no challenges from low oil. However we believe the energy supply dynamic that is ongoing will lead to a long term low volatility scenario where our underlying structural position. The long term low volatility of both oil and natural gas will reduce cyclicality of what had been historically cyclical businesses and more effectively leverage the potentials of our integrated model to deliver value to our shareholders. Turning to slide 20 and in this context we are demonstrating that our strategy maximizes value. It leverages our strength, advantages, rooted in our integration to help mitigate macro economic pressures and enable Dow to deliver long term sustainable return. In 2014 we committed to achieving a series of near term priorities focused on adding value across our integrated value chains by advancing our key growth catalyst launching new products, driving productivity actions, divesting non-strategic assets and businesses and delivering stronger returns. We said we will do these things and we did. They are fully listed on this slide, but let me highlight a few. We have boosted output from our existing asset base more than 4% behind solid demand and innovation and we\u2019re prime to bring our key growth projects such as a first unit in Sadara and the PDH unit in Texas online this year together with the Stewarded introduction of our Enlist program. We accelerated actions across our portfolio with $2 billion in proceeds expected from divestitures signed were completed in 2014. We announced expanded three-year $1 billion productivity program. We delivered record adjusted cash flow from operations, and a record $6 billion shareholders remuneration by declared dividends and share repurchases. We achieved, exceeded and most importantly we executed against the commitments we\u2019ve made. And this is not deviation from previous quarters or even years. We have build the right model for volatile times and we have the culture and agility to move fast to maximize value in all cycles navigating near term dynamics with our unrelenting focus on streamlining costs and accelerating productivity. Turning to slide 21, our priorities for 2015 remained consistent and as we navigate, anticipate headwinds such as ongoing market uncertainty we are doing so with the recognition of the value of our investments and our leadership position in the markets in which we participate. Our team has driven significant and strategic enhancement to our portfolio to mitigate challenging energy markets in line with those we are seeing today. 2015 is a major milestone year for Dow. With our PDH and Sadara coming on line operating rates remaining high in the plastics businesses and with new product introductions in Agriculture Sciences electronic materials amongst others and maintaining the drive for more production at lower costs the full value of our entire integrated portfolio will once again be very evident. The market and world economy will be volatile, although still growing especially in the United States and increasingly in China. We believe we have the portfolio that will continue to win even in this sort of global marketplace as we clear have demonstrated in 2014. In short, our integrated diversified strategy will continue to deliver higher cash flows, more consistent earnings and most importantly increased shareholders rewards to you as shareholders our singular and driving focus. With that Jack, let\u2019s turn to Q&A Jack Broodo : Thank you, Andrew. Now we\u2019ll move on to your question. First however I would like to remind you that my comments regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. Rochelle [ph] would you please explain the Q&A procedure? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question we\u2019ll hear from Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo Securities. Frank Mitsch : Good morning gentlemen. And Andrew, do you need to give Andy Grove a royalty every time you use Intel Inside? Andrew Liveris : I know you heard it on the TV and I don\u2019t know, but if someone can find out for me... Frank Mitsch : I think you\u2019re fine there. Hey, I appreciate you pointing out that you\u2019re not immune to - that there is no challenges from low oil, but I really didn\u2019t hear too much destocking and the expectations are obviously no impact \u2013 not a lot of impact in Q4. What are your thoughts on customer destocking impact on Dow here in Q1? Andrew Liveris : Well, thanks Frank. We obviously watch this very closely. We have our weekly meetings and our product managers and marketing managers, geographic managers. We clearly were watching for customer buying behavior as low oil kept occurring through the quarter. And yes, there were some I actually mentioned it on TV today, there were some delays in purchasing but it wasn\u2019t due to demand destruction. People just anticipating lower prices. We\u2019re seeing January orders in line with our expected growth. Demand for February is firming as we enter the month. We believe inventories in the industrial engines are at lows, and that\u2019s basically pent-up demand based on the view that prices could drop even further. Howard Ungerleider : I would also say, Frank good morning, that when you look at plastics, the industry operating rates in polyethylene was at 88% in the fourth quarter and we were running well above that number. Frank Mitsch : That\u2019s very helpful. And just sticking on the plastics side, you mentioned that margins are remaining strong in that business, and that\u2019s your expectation for 2015. But where do you think that they may decline to 2013 levels? What are your thoughts on how the impact of oil might compress plastics margins? Howard Ungerleider : Yes. I would say clearly in the natural gas liquid world, so the North America world and the Middle East you\u2019re going to see margins decline and we saw some of that happen in the fourth quarter for sure, and the pressure is going to continue into 2015. But remember the naphtha world, we have our European assets as well as our Asian joint ventures and even in Latin America we\u2019re doing very well and we saw margins expand as well as demand strength in both Latin America as well as significant strengths even in the fourth quarter in Europe. Andrew Liveris : And I think Frank, just to elaborate, this is key question. Remember 2015 with demand growth still there as for your earlier question. As you get into the back half of this year we believe low oil price is very good for world demand. And as you get global growth coming back through low oil prices, you will start to see the beginning of peak economics in the plastics engine going into 2016 and 2017. So we do believe with tight operating rates there\u2019s a lot of operating leverage here and our value add strategy actually gives us margin that we would just get on the feedstock, we get it in the packaging, elastomers, and E&T business. Operator : And next, we\u2019ll move on to David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. David Begleiter : Good morning. Andrew, I know you don\u2019t give guidance, but given the challenges you and Howard mentioned for 2015, do you think Dow Chemical can grow earnings in 2015 versus 2014? Andrew Liveris : I thank you for your question. And clearly the path the company is on with a record EBITDA performance last year I want you to note how we got there. We had a $900 million increase in EBITDA on about $1.1 billion increase in sales. That tells you that we have a resilient portfolio, but we also have the right mindset around innovation and productivity. Howard in his script talked about the innovation in general across the company. Just look at Ag. Q4 on Q4 year-on-year Ag 23% of their revenues were based on new product introduced just in that one year. So we have an ability to go after earnings growth independent of commodity environments, we\u2019re not a commodity company, but we use commodity inputs to add value. I think what you\u2019ll see from us a continued drumbeat. We will have margin pressure across some of the portfolio based on low oil price. In the back half of this year as demand gets tighter, I think we have an opportunity to certainly match last year\u2019s performance. David Begleiter : And lastly, Andrew just on Sadara at the current oil price what\u2019s the impact on $0.5 billion of equity earnings you put out there for Sadara longer term by 2018? Andrew Liveris : Yes. So you now look the old view of forecasting five years out almost seems to be out the door, we couldn\u2019t forecast all of us a year ago what would happen to oil today, right. So, it\u2019s a very hesitant forecast to hear that talks about the impact on Sadara. Just remember that Sadara is more than just a gas cracker, ethane cracker, it\u2019s a mix feeds cracker that also uses other refinery streams from Aramco, not just naphtha, so please remember we got ways to get from here to there even in a low oil environment. Howard Ungerleider : David I would also add, this is Howard, that $500 million with a ten-year average run rate over the first ten years, so we\u2019re not stepping away from that number. Operator : And next, we\u2019ll move on to Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Bob Koort : Thank you. Good morning. Howard Ungerleider : Good morning. Bob Koort : Could you help us, I may have missed it, but the size of the Pioneer contract adjustment and then does that impair at all your view of the ability to get more than 50 million acres of available market for Enlist? How should we think about any ramification on the value of Enlist from a very large potential customer? Andrew Liveris : We didn\u2019t declare it Bob, so that\u2019s your first answer, but the answer your question, second question, in short is a firm no. We did not need that agreement and we have our own channels as well as other channels to more than make up anything that might have been pushed out as a lost in that contract. Howard Ungerleider : Yes. I would also say that don\u2019t forget we\u2019re in the process of closing on Coodetec acquisition in Brazil and that\u2019s going to really help our ability in Latin America to grow soybean as well as the regional players here in North America. Bob Koort : And Andrew, I was wondering if you might give a perspective we've had this reset of oil prices, I think you\u2019ve made - rightly bragged about your operating rates, but as an industry if we look over the next year for those crackers that weren\u2019t advantaged on U.S. ethane, you think margin structure for the non-U.S. ethane crackers of the world will be higher over the next year than it\u2019s been in the past year. Do you think the depressed oil price will just flow through to the customers ultimately? Andrew Liveris : We don\u2019t believe so, we believe that there\u2019s apples and oranges in a question like that, you got to go through cracker by cracker, restarting a cracker that\u2019s based on naphtha just because of this current oil price naphtha scenario is not a given, in fact we don\u2019t believe many of them will restart at all. To restart an idle cracker takes a lot of money and it\u2019s a big bet in this sort of environment. So we believe supply tightness is in our imminent future operating rates are high across the entire plastics chain. Those that are advantaged, remember Bob, 70% of our cracker fleet is in advantaged jurisdictions under all oil gas scenarios and we\u2019re flexible. So we\u2019re advantaged even in disadvantaged regions like Europe and in fact we\u2019ve had margin expansion in Europe based on our ability to be cracking propane there and that\u2019s also true in North America. So we really believe that what\u2019s going on out here is a net positive and you\u2019re seeing in our operating rates, you\u2019re seeing in our leverage. We\u2019ve returned to operating rates as a company that we had in 2007. How we\u2019ve done that? We\u2019ve taken out low end assets. We\u2019ve taken out uncompetitive assets and the rest of the industry has done the same. So we believe that this is all tailwind as you get into the back half of this year. Howard Ungerleider : I would also add just on Andrew\u2019s propane or LPG point rather. In Europe we\u2019ve improved that capability from the low 40% range to mid 50s, around 55% in Europe. And in North America I mean from a propane standpoint we do have the most feedstock flexible propane cracking of anyone else in the industry. Operator : And next, we\u2019ll move on to PJ Juvekar with Citi. PJ Juvekar : Yes. Hi, good morning. Andrew Liveris : Good morning. PJ Juvekar : Andrew, it seems like you got a big benefit from lower energy complex in some of your specialties. So is it a give back this year meaning if the specialty complex declines with the lag in the first half? Andrew Liveris : Well, so the portfolio we built has obviously low input prices and as you go the propane point is a great example of that with flexibility we can take advantage of any input no matter what the situation is, whether it\u2019s naphtha, whether oil refinery led streams of propane or ethane. But your main point is we have a portfolio that\u2019s doing value add and the value add in our strategy we\u2019ve been saying its over and over, we don\u2019t have your vanilla grade plastics business. We have a plastics businesses as packaging value add, elastomers value add, E&T, Electrical and Telecommunications value add. We make money in that part of the chain and that\u2019s a specialty effect if you like, because those customers are asking for the price decrease at the pace of the feedstock decrease because they don\u2019t see the correlation. But that\u2019s especially true in electronic materials, in our water business, in some of our downstream businesses in building construction. So that is the portfolio we build. We think we have in essence an opportunity here versus a challenge. Everyone knows that\u2019s expose to the price effect, we\u2019ll have margin challenges, but we are not that type of company because of the portfolio we build. We have excellent commodity businesses that have that volatility effect. So there is a dampened effect in our specialties portfolio which is two-thirds of the company and it\u2019s integrated to the low cost feedstock. So it\u2019s a win-win for us. Howard Ungerleider : PJ I think, this is Howard. Good morning. I just want to add on this innovation point. I know you guys don\u2019t typically give us credit for innovation, but we\u2019ve got a track record now on patents. 2014 was the fifth year in a row where we applied for over 900 patents. It was another record year of patent application granted by the U.S. patent office. From our finance perspective, I don\u2019t like patents because of the plaque on the wall. Reason why I\u2019m so focused on as we get and I referenced that I think in the prepared remarks we get a 1000 basis points additional margin on a pattern advantage sales versus a non-patent advantage sales. So I think you\u2019re also starting to see that help our stickiness in price. But I agree with Andrew we\u2019re not going to immune to it but we should be able to a relative outperformer in that space. PJ Juvekar : Thank you for that. And then, Europe seems like it\u2019s not growing. You got FX headwinds. What further steps can you take in Europe to adjust your cost structure and maybe can Howard hedge out some currencies here? Howard Ungerleider : Well, in terms of Europe, I mean, you\u2019ve seen some of the improvements in profitability continue to show itself through 2014. We had higher operating rates in the quarter. We\u2019ve been taking out. We completed the 2012 restructuring program in 2014, a significant number of those 28 assets were in the European area. So we\u2019ve done that. From a currency PJ it\u2019s definitely going to be a headwind. There was a headwind in the fourth quarter, our price was down 4% in the quarter, 2% of that was currency if you drive that to the EBITDA line it was probably around a $75 million EBITDA headwind in the fourth quarter. And so you\u2019ll see that still happen in 2015, but I think it\u2019s really important to note that we have our assets in the regions where we sell our products fundamentally. And many of our raw material and many of our end products are either tied to dollars or heavily influenced in dollars. So, most of our currency impact is really going to be around translation back to the U.S dollar on the income statement. And then of course you are going to see some balance sheet impact which you certainly saw in the fourth quarter where we have assets in Europe that gets translated back on the balance sheet. And that\u2019s why the net debt to cap moved up a little bit primarily because of that in our pension. Operator : And next, we\u2019ll move on to Aleksey Yefremov with Nomura. Aleksey Yefremov : Good morning. Andrew, could you update us on your view on supply of natural gas liquids in the U.S. in the new oil price environment? Andrew Liveris : Yes, so thank you for your question. The \u2013 we obviously [Indiscernible] and rejection economics are playing in the west fields and certainly the NGO production at $3 gas is much more economic for those guys who are producing wet gas. So you are going to keep getting production of ethane and propane as it applies. So that\u2019s all advantage to the guys like us who are buying. We don\u2019t see that changing anytime soon and depending on the oil price. Clearly the oil price has had an effect on new rigs and new rig counts and that\u2019s all dropped off well reported and clearly if you got dry gas you\u2019ve been shut in for a while so that doesn\u2019t help you all that much. But it\u2019s your question that plays here and NGOs continue to be rejected but are still the most profitable part of the producers of wet gas. Aleksey Yefremov : And thank you. And as a follow up do you have any update on the status of Dow Corning JV were there any additional discussions since the Investor Day? Andrew Liveris : So Dow Corning as much as all of our JV clean up our strategy, we talked about at our investor day and clearly we are looking quite long and hard as who are natural owners of their JVs, you\u2019ve asked for transparency and how we report our businesses. So going narrower in number of JVs is our clear strategy. There is nothing to update you or nothing sort to say, other than clearly that\u2019s one of our strategies and clearly our partners at Corning have to make their own statements. Operator : And we\u2019ll move on to Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Arun Viswanathan : Thanks guys. I guess the first question I had was just on the NGL side. You\u2019ve stated in past presentations that you can go up to 60% propane and 55% and a similar number on LPG in Europe, but what is the realistic number, is there anything that precludes you from getting that high. I mean is there enough supply in those regions to actually get to 60% or you will be cracking 30%, 35%? Howard Ungerleider : There\u2019s nothing that precludes us going that high other than. We run a group Jack used to run it, so maybe we should let Jack answer. But in essence what the whole strategy is we look at our furnace crack on a daily basis and we pivot around appropriately where we have the flex capabilities and nothing stops us from taking it those numbers. Right Jack. Jack Broodo : Yes Arun I mean in Europe we continue to expand our capability to crack LPGs both propane and butane and then the length of the season where propane is much cheaper than naptha continues to grow as U.S. continues to expand more and more LPG. So U.S. LPG expansions help Europe and there are also firm price in the U.S. which helps production in the U.S. and so it\u2019s a double win for us and strategically structurally helps us. Arun Viswanathan : Okay. Thanks and I guess the other question was just a quick update on the chlorine sale, are you still sticking to the $3 billion to $4 billion in your targeted proceeds and the $500 million in EBITDA in light of recent declines in EDC and TVC? Thanks. Andrew Liveris : Yes the short answer good morning is the as we are still on the trajectory that we laid out at Investor Day that for closed at the end of \u2013 before the end of this year 2015 and we\u2019re still sticking to all those numbers, actually we are in the data room. It\u2019s a robust option, there are strategic buyers as well as financial buyers and we feel very good about where we are. Operator : And next we\u2019ll move onto John Roberts with UBS. John Roberts : Thank you. Just first a follow up on that, could you tell us yet whether it\u2019s going to be one transaction or multiple transactions or whether Dow will retain any interest in any of the transactions? Andrew Liveris : The short answer is no. We\u2019re looking at it from what\u2019s going to maximize value for Dow shareholders short as well as long term so there is still an option for it to be two transactions or one transaction, so that will depend really on who the ultimate buyer will turn out to be based on value. John Roberts : And then second I was thinking the discussions with your partners and equate in any [ph] global could go quickly since you are dealing with a limited number of potential buyers as your JV interest. But now with the drop in oil prices do you think it might take longer to come down on your agreements there? Andrew Liveris : Well clearly drop in oil prices affected all the oil producing nations and Kuwait is not immune to them. Its less about that John and more about the strategic rationale that our partners have for expansion in the value add which in their case is Petrochemicals , it\u2019s a big deal for them equate and our presence in equate. So frankly this is not a one month, two month conversation, it never has been. It\u2019s more what are they going to do with a expansion needs. They want to expand it to liquids cracking for example. They have announced that, they have announced projects in Vietnam and China. So they have a holistic view to their strategy and more Kuwait ownership with time on our JVs is something that interest them. So look, it\u2019s going at a good pace, nothing to report and just a little footnote. MEGlobal is different than the Kuwait based adventures and can beat to its own drum. Operator : And next we\u2019ll hear from Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America Kevin McCarthy : A couple of questions on cash deployment. And looking at your balance sheet it looks like your pension in OPEB [ph] liability increases, assume that\u2019s on discount rate and it\u2019s mortality. Can you comment as for the cash required for pension in 2015 as well as the likely pace of execution against your remaining $5 billion authorization on repurchases? Andrew Liveris : Yes sure, good morning Kevin. You are exactly right. I mean the Pension liability increased by about $3 billion, about 75% of that was because of the lower discount rate. It was down about 90 basis point; about 25% was the new mortality tables that got put in. Your second question was on the stock buyback and what\u2019s worse we\u2019re still on the same trajectory of what I laid out at investor day which is a couple of points that we expect it to be roughly $2 billion of stock buy back in 2015 timed with the divestitures from our portfolio moves. Kevin McCarthy : And then a second question if I may on polyurethanes, quite strong results in the quarter, can you speak to your outlook volumetrically as well as from a price perspective and comment on how you would expect pricing to differ in lets say a merchant sales of intermediate process systems, how much sticky your systems might be? Andrew Liveris : Yes so the noted value creation of polyurethanes that you pointed out really started a couple of years ago when you remember we put that [Indiscernible] together and said, do you had to be fixed as did epoxy. Glen Roth [ph] and his team have done a sensational job repositioning the value chain. It\u2019s occurred at all parts of the value chain to have advance to your question. It\u2019s occurred at the Propylene oxide end, it\u2019s occurred in the polyurethane components end and it\u2019s occurred at the systems end and it\u2019s been a repositioning plus a productivity drive. They have achieved their productivity goals, but they have also repositioned to end use growth markets like energy efficiency for example. High end durables, high end furniture embedding. So they have got a technology driven program that\u2019s very focused on the value add and of course the lower input cost. This should be further enhanced this year when PDH starts off. So we\u2019re quite proud of the turnaround in polyurethanes and has been both point, productivity and repositioning. Operator : And next, we\u2019ll move to Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global. Hassan Ahmed : Good morning, Andrew. Andrew Liveris : Good morning. Hassan Ahmed : Quite a few comments made on flexibility and the whole ethane, propane side of things. I guess a lot of them were directed to the European side of things. So my question is more specific to the U.S. side of things. I mean, obviously the markets are bit [indiscernible] that ethane based margins have come down, call it $0.06, $0.07 a pound relative to 2014 averages. But if I take a look at U.S. propane based ethylene margin they\u2019re actually up even sort of higher than where ethane based margins were last year. So my question is how high could you take your propane buyers in the U.S. and could you actually come up with the scenario that if we would mark everything to market to current pricing, year on year we could actually had higher margins this year than last year? Andrew Liveris : Well, I mean firstly we can go up to 70% of our crack slide here in the U.S. So if you look at the propane dynamic you just talked about than clearly there\u2019s a scenario here that has us not feeling the effect of the oil and gas or naphtha retain arbitrage as much as others. That clearly is further enhanced by propane dehydrogenation as I already implied in my script. I\u2019m not going to foreshadow repeat in our plastics record profits in Q last year and frankly the year before they been expanding profits quite considerably but our feedstock flex as propylene weakens there could be some effective margins coming down on some of our businesses. But as far as Polyethylene and plastics is concern, mark-to-market advantage Dow on propane crack. Hassan Ahmed : And as a follow-up, I mean, we\u2019ve begun to hear about some projects cancellations I mean, I know you talked about on the Dow side of things, the projects being on track in the like, but recently we heard about Shell project cancellation out in Qatar [ph], and recently Sasol canceling one of their GTL facilities. What you view about some of these newer Greenfield ethylene facilities in the U.S.? Do you think there will be more cancellations going forward? And part and parcel with that where do you stand today in terms of your cycle view? Andrew Liveris : Second question first. We haven\u2019t changed our view on the cycle and since low oil started last quarter we\u2019ve been very clear that we think ultimately six to nine months low oil price foreshadow\u2019s increase demand so this should help the world economy not hurt it, which I know is a view that not many others talk about but I think our result should show that, so we don\u2019t have to talk about it, we can just show our results. So that then says, demand is there, operating leverage there to Bob Koort\u2019s earlier question. So then you see the cycle playing out in 2016, 2017 with the back half of this year creating further tightening opportunities based on demand. In terms of supply, we don\u2019t think any of the big ethane crack projects will be affected. I think those economics are still sound based on excess NGLs as per an earlier question I got. I do think as you\u2019re seeing with some of the projects even one yesterday on Sasol, GTL, anything oil related, anything directly connected to the oil molecule, will definitely be delayed missing a ton of those being delayed. But that\u2019s less about what the U.S. projects will do. I think those U.S. projects the ones that we all foreshadow at the 2017/2018 startups will be relatively unaffected. Operator : And next, we\u2019ll move on to John McNulty with Credit Suisse. John McNulty : Yes. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So looking back historically when we start big commodity moves down and/or oil prices moves down there was the benefit of pretty significant working capital benefits for even the past, but admittedly that was \u2013 most of those were during weak economic periods. We don\u2019t have that this time around. So I guess how you\u2019re thinking about the potential for working capital to really drive significant cash flow for you in 2015? Howard Ungerleider : Yes. I mean, overall it should be a nice tailwind to our cash flow and I think you started to see that show already in the fourth quarter, I mean, we\u2019re working not only on the raw material or the price cost side of the equation, but also on the volume unit side with our efficiency programs. So I mean our DSI was down by four days in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter, 60% of that drop was volume and 40% of that was based on price cost. So it would be a tailwind in 2015. John McNulty : Great. And then just with regard to the run rate EBITDA for the products coming up in 2015, looks like they\u2019ve been tweaked a little bit lower from the Investor Day, is that in oil reflection are you kind of marking things to the market right now or do you have other assumptions that may we should think about in those numbers? Andrew Liveris : No, John. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve actually come off in terms of our public position on any of those projects. I think if you look at where this specific margins were in the fall, they\u2019ve come off a bit just from a market standpoint, but they\u2019re still well above what we\u2019ve originally laid out, so the PDH unit of $450 million. You look at the implied spread on propane or propylene, that still well within our guidance that we\u2019ve given. Howard Ungerleider : John, at our investor forum we had an example of the prompt value of those projects, but we did not said that wasn\u2019t changing, what we expected from the run rate number we have published. Operator : And next we\u2019ll move on Debbie Fisher [ph] with Barclays. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, good morning. Question on Ag, your commentary seems to be a little bit more optimistic than what we\u2019ve heard from others where folks have talked about a decent amount inventory in the system probably needs to get work down and scenarios where you\u2019re seeing pricing pressure. So can you just go through \u2013 would you expect or do you see too much inventory in some of your product change in Ag. And then would you expect some pricing pressure across your portfolio this year? Andrew Liveris : Clearly we see the same effect on corn and corn inventories. I mean, there\u2019s no question at the low commodity prices and farmer economics have changed and corn which is causing the rotation of soy and clearly we see that same effect, so that isn\u2019t any different. But the think that differentiates us from our competitors is our product pipeline and what Howard talked about. Bugs don\u2019t see falling corn prices, infectious is still being used. We\u2019ve launched two major classes of insecticides in this last little while, Isoclast and Spinetoram both sales are up year-on-year. New product sales year-on-year Q4 to Q4 up 23% in one year. This is Dow\u2019s AgroSciences product pipeline coming through big time. Arylex service side, broad-spectrum herbicide, cereal fungicide, these are not affected by farmer corn economic. So that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing in our results. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And then just back on the petchem side, if we remain in this type of an oil environment throughout the year do you think the more marginal production in Asia is MTO or would it be naphtha based the way you would look at it? Andrew Liveris : Well, I don\u2019t think \u2013 firstly there\u2019s whole scenario about MTO not coming on at the pace anyone think it\u2019s going to come on. I think there\u2019s a whole recalibration going on because of oil and coal. Remember that methanol is coming from coal. And so that\u2019s going to change a lot in terms of when those projects come on line, which therefore defaults to your question being answered by saying, its incremental naphtha, but I\u2019ve already answer the previous question about there\u2019s not many of that is come on line. The way we view it is Asia is going stay high cost under any scenario. The beneficiary to this low oil scenario is mostly in Europe especially those that can NGL crack like propane. Howard Ungerleider : Thank you for your question. With that we\u2019re going to stop the questions and we appreciate all of your questions. Andrew, would you like to make a few final comments. Andrew Liveris : Well yes, I would like to say that last year it was a record year for Dow and this is a design. We have a strategy that\u2019s working. We have built our business to be tend to be high margin and high return in most economic environment. The key to those is been the progression of actions these last many years, the sale of our most commoditize high margin product. We\u2019ve locked in low cost competitive inflexible feedstock capacity. And we have technology advantage high margin products. These changes are in place now and are producing and creating a sustainable business model that gives us much opportunity in 2015 versus challenge. We remind you that the driver of volume and price is demand far more than just feedstock input price. Demand for our products and in particular our advantage products is very strong. We are very confident our strength will continue this year. Howard Ungerleider : Thank you, Andrew. As always we appreciate your interest in the Dow Chemical company. For your reference a copy of our prepared comments will be posted on Dow\u2019s website later today. This concludes our call for today. We look forward to speaking with you again soon. Operator : And that will conclude today\u2019s conference. We thank you for your participation.",

Sales comparisons exclude divestitures and hydrocarbons and energy, EBITDA, EBITDA margins, return on capital, and earnings comparisons exclude certain items. On Slide 3, some of our comments may also contains statements about our announced agreement to separate a substantial portion of our chlor-alkali and downstream derivatives business and merger with a subsidiary of Olin Corporation. In connection with that transaction Dow and Olin will be filing with the SEC filing materials with the SEC that will contain important information and we advice you read them. These filings will be available free of charge from the SEC or Dow or Olin is applicable. The agenda for today\u2019s call is on Slide 4. I will now turn the call over to Howard Ungerleider. Howard Ungerleider : Thank you, Jack, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 5, the first quarter of 2015 proved to be yet another strong quarter for Dow. Our results clearly demonstrate the consistency with which our strategic agenda and our focus on execution are driving higher and more predictable earnings. We remained firmly on our growth trajectory or fact that you can see across multiple fronts. This marks our 10th consecutive quarter of year-over-year operating EPS, EBITDA and margin growth. The strength of our portfolio enabled Dow to deliver operating earnings of $0.84 a share. Operating EBITDA was $2.4 billion, four out of our five operating segments delivered earnings growth in the quarter. Dow automotive systems achieved an all time EBITDA record and Dow electronic materials, our energy and water, our Polyurethanes and our packaging and specialty plastics businesses each achieved first quarter EBITDA records. EBITDA margins expanded to the highest levels since 2005 its up 284 basis point versus the year-ago period. Performance plastics, performance materials and chemicals, infrastructure solutions and consumer solutions all drove margin expansion in the quarter. Our results illustrate that we were focused and we executed. We delivered operating cash flow of $1.2 billion of first quarter record and up more than $660 million, we return $977 million to shareholders and declared dividends and repurchases, and we made further progress against our portfolio management targets most notably to the signing of the definitive agreement to divest our chlorine products bringing the total of our portfolio actions well above our stated targets. We\u2019re proud of the performance that company delivered in the phase of 49% year-over-year drop in oil price combined with the 15% year-over-year euro headwinds. It\u2019s clear that this not the commodity driven Dow Chemical from a decade ago. This business model successfully navigated the fast moving market dynamics with catalyst that will further propel our growth. I\u2019ll provide an update on these in a moment. But first let\u2019s take a closer look at our operating results in the quarter. Turning to Slide 6, revenue was $12.4 billion, the solid demand for Dow products across all geographic regions excluding divestitures with particular strength in our merging geography most notably China, which was up 10%. Volume increases were led by performance plastics up 6% and performance materials and chemicals and consumer solutions both up 5% despite 15% price declines at the company level, primarily due to significant oil in currency headwinds. Let\u2019s turn to the segment highlights on Slide 8. Ag Sciences delivered sales of nearly $1.9 billion in EBITDA of $409 million. These results as expected reflected more normalized weather conditions in the first quarter versus last year. From a macro perspective crop protection sales trended with the industry across most regions except for Asia-Pacific, where we drove double-digit volume gains reflecting in part sales of a new rice herbicide, although pricing was down due to currency. We continue to gain traction from the launch of new products. In fact demand for new Dow Ag Sciences products was up 7%. In addition we received preliminary approval on the registration of our Enlist soybeans and corn in Brazil with final approval for commercialization pending. We also have secured approval for Enlist E3 in Argentina. Additionally, the EPA has approved Enlist Duo in nine additional key corn and soybean producing U.S. states and regulatory approvals are pending for Enlist cotton. We\u2019re in the process of a stewarded introduction in the U.S. corn this year and expect the full commercial launch following approvals in China. We remained focused on delivering this key technology platform to serve the global farmer customer base and we\u2019re working to bring it to market as soon as possible. In the near-term Greater China demand continues to drive growth. North America is currently operating with high levels of channel inventories, Latin America is facing some potential economic headwinds and Western Europe growth appears modestly positive with year-over-year weather comparisons normalizing in the second quarter. We remained confident in our technology and expect on our margins to improve. However, acreage and commodity prices continue to be a challenge. Turning to consumer solutions on Slide 9, this segment delivered record EBITDA based on the strength of differentiated products and Dow innovation. Double-digit sales gains were reported in North America with broad-based volume growth across all three businesses. Dow electronic materials led the way with the double-digit volume increased, followed by consumer care and Dow Automotive, sale gains were also reported in Latin America. Let me briefly cover the businesses. Automotive Systems delivered record EBITDA performance. The business is benefiting from auto industry trends toward lightweighting as well as a preference for larger premium vehicles driven in part by lower oil prices. These vehicles tend to feature both more and the higher margin Dow materials. As a result, we achieved margin expansion as key customers continue to increase adoption of our differentiated technologies such as our BETAMATE structural adhesives. Dow Electronic Materials EBITDA was also a new first quarter record, with margin expansion driven by product mix upgrades. The strength of our technologies in electronic sector was recognized by a number of key customer wins across the business. We also reported strong top line performance in semiconductor in both our CMP and litho markets. Notably MSI a key figure that we track for semiconductor growth is forecasted to be up nearly double GDP in 2015. In consumer care, food and pharma sales remained flat overall, but excluding the currency the business grew particularly in Dow pharma and food solutions, we saw expansion through sales of unique and differentiated products. Operating rates are running high in this segment, and we expect to continue to increase sales in the home and personal care sectors due to raising consumer demand and new customer applications. Looking ahead to the second quarter, we expect margin in this operating segment will improve on an increased consumer demand. Moving to infrastructure solutions on the Slide 10, where similar innovation driven performance is delivering solid EBITDA expansion. Sales were $1.8 billion and EBITDA grew 10% to $295 million. In energy and water solutions, we expect continued growth at 2 to 3 times the rate of GDP with strength in our water business offsetting weakness in North American energy markets. This can be seen in the double-digit demand growth in our reverse osmosis business in the quarter. Lower oil values coupled with the decline in the energy exploration and fracking from 2014 levels have impacted Dow microbial control. However, our expert consultancy model combined with our regulatory position in the oil and gas sectors is enabling us to grow share. And Dow building a construction our differentiated products has contributed to global margin expansion as well as growth outside the U.S. in new applications. North America continues to be the demand driver for this business. Dow coating materials reported volume growth driven by EMEAI and Asia-Pacific versus the prior year. These volume gains along with value-based pricing actions and improved raw material margins drove EBITDA growth in the quarter. Looking ahead we expect that the North America will lead global coatings growth due to an improving housing market. Performance Monomers continues to experience trough like conditions in the acrylates market, though we expect improvement in this business toward the second half of the year with more globally competitive U.S. propylene market pricing. From an equity earnings perspective results from Dow Chlorine was slightly up overcoming currency headwinds. But the infrastructure solutions segment we expect margins to remain flat sequentially as the building season ramps up in our new applications and technologies offset continued headwinds from acrylates. Turning to Slide 11, performance materials and chemicals reported sales of $3.2 billion and delivered EBITDA of $535 million excluding divestitures, which is up 4% versus last year and represent the fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year EBITDA growth and margin expansion. Polyurethanes delivered a record first quarter EBITDA driven by a combination of volume gains and margin expansion as the business continues to make progress focusing on their defined markets as well as developing customer tailored solutions through our system house capabilities in the consumer comfort and energy efficiency sectors. Ongoing selfhelp productivity actions will also continue contributing to margin expansions in the coming quarters. Epoxy also continues to improve with double-digit volume growth particularly in differentiated product lines as well as the continued productivity focus. Industrial solutions reported margin expansion with improving demand toward the end of the quarter. EBITDA is up versus the same quarter last year on the core businesses though it was offset by lower equity earnings and the divestiture of both ANGUS and the Sodium Borohydride businesses. Overall we expect prices to stabilize in this operating segments and margins to reflect strengthening demand. Turning now to Slide 12, performance plastics reported sales of $4.3 billion down 11% verus the prior year excluding hydrocarbons and energy. EBITDA was $985 million up 2% in marking the 11th consecutive quarter of operating EBITDA growth and EBITDA margin expansion. Packaging and specialty plastics posted a record first quarter EBITDA performance driven by strong year-over-year volume growth across all geographies as well as in the hygiene and medical and food packaging sectors. Operating rates are running high in every geography. Elastomers delivered the highest EBITDA since 2012, and nearly 60% year-over-year increase results were particularly strong in the transportation sector. Volume also improved to our show-up actions in new consumer durable products. For example, INFUSE Olefin Block Copolymers set a volume record in part due to attraction in the high end footwear sector. Electrical and Telecommunications had a major turn around in the quarter which impacted volume comparisons demand continues to be healthy particularly in North America weakness was seen in EMEAI and Asia-Pacific due to very aggressive competitive pricing actions. At a segment level we expect prices to move up on strong demand for our high value products. Looking at Slide 13, let me briefly cover our modeling guidance. Let\u2019s begin with the second quarter. We expect year-over-year demand growth in most businesses with pricing momentum building through the year. We expect raw material cost remains favorable year-over-year with stable natural gas, oil based cost may rise. Equity earnings will continue to be down year-over-year due primarily to Sadara cost as we ramp the first product later in the year. Cost will be $75 million to $100 million headwind year-over-year in the second quarter. After buying back $500 million in Dow stock in Q1 our buyback program is now restricted until the close of the Olin transaction which is anticipated by year-end. So we expect second quarter share count to remain flat with the first quarter. Turnaround costs were expected to be higher by $75 million to $100 million sequentially and relatively flat year-over-year. And for the full year 2015, we will continue to move forward on our productivity program with a goal of $300 million in savings expected ramping through the year. Pension expense is still expected to increase slightly more than a $100 million for the year, we expect the $400 million to $600 million impact on EBITDA due to currency. CapEx will be approximately $3.9 billion for the year and we still expect the tax rate in the 25% to 28% range. Next, I\u2019d like to review progress against our key commitments on Slide 15. We\u2019ve been transparent ensuring the actions, we\u2019ve been proactively taking to further drive our enterprise into the premiere chemical materials and agricultural company that it is today. For example, late last year, we increased our divestiture target to $7 billion to $8.5 billion and then we expected to achieve that target by mid-2016. With the actions announced this quarter, we have now outperformed this target and expect considerations from divestiture actions to now exceed a $11 billion. This quarter, we have completed both the ANGUS and the Sodium Borohydride transactions. And of course, just a few weeks ago, we announced the most significant action in the series. Our transaction with Olin to divest the substantial portion of our chlorine value chain. This transaction particularly with its tax efficient win-win structure will enable shareholders of both companies to benefit from the significant upside opportunity of the new Olin. From a Dow perspective, the transaction will enable us to continue our drive to grow in our higher value markets as we continue to go narrower and deeper with our portfolio. And we will enable the new Olin to become a first year competitor across the chlorine on below. The follow-up on previous announcements, we expect to receive final regulatory clearance to close some innovation transaction in early May, we anticipate the deal will close officially, immediately following this final approval. Once the Dow Chlorine products transaction along with our ongoing JV consolidation and de-consolidation activities including our colleague, joint ventures as well as a few other smaller portfolio moves are in place, we\u2019ll have completed our select out actions. Turning to Slide 16, as a result of these actions coupled with our targeted strategic growth investments, today Dow has the portfolio to better withstand volatility under most macro conditions. Over the last 10 years, we\u2019ve been executing the significant portfolio shift with clear focus on delivering innovation driven growth, building in region leadership and targeted markets and driving more consistent performance, resulting in lower volatility and more predictable earnings. To further advance these efforts, we invested in a new ERP platform to more quickly and effectively respond to customers as well as providing end-to-end capability on a single instance across the globe. We completed the last phase of this implementation late last year. This powerful platform is also enabling us to remove costs that are made obsolete by our upgraded end-to-end platform. Recall at our Investor Day last fall \u2013 we committed to a new three-year $1 billion productivity drive. Our productivity efforts continue to center on cost out actions and doing more with the resources we have in place all to enable higher earnings. We\u2019re making steady progress to deliver on this objective, as we remove $57 million of cost in the quarter and we\u2019ll ramp to $300 million through the year. Our productivity focus also enabled us to produce the same volume year-over-year in the quarter despite more than $1 billion pounds of incremental capacity offline due to plan maintenance turnarounds versus Q1 of last year. We will make further announcements around the actions we\u2019re taking in the coming quarters to deliver the $1 billion drive, so stay tuned. Looking ahead on Slide 17, our earnings performance coupled with our strengthened balance sheet and the growth catalyst that we have discussed provide us with confidence in our future cash flow. In the near-term, we expect our demand on cash to decrease as a result of three main factors. CapEx reverting to depreciation levels over the next three years. Reduction and pension expense associated with rising interest rates, as well as the conversion of our preferred shares. We also anticipate cash flow increases resulting for multiple drivers. The ramp up of our key catalyst Sadara in the U.S. Gulf Coast investments, which will have a collective $3 billion EBITDA run rate once fully operational. Our investments and innovation delivering 5,000 new products a year and driving higher margins, productivity, and of course, our operating leverage where every percent improvement in our operating rate adds approximately $200 million in annual EBITDA. And while we\u2019re not counting on it, we do see an ethylene cyclical upside in front of us in the next few years. And finally, turning to Slide 18, with our earnings performance our strengthened balance sheet and the growth catalyst we discussed as well as our confidence in our future cash flow, I want to briefly recap our financial priorities. Drive further ongoing ROC improvement with a goal to return 3% above our cost of capital. Continue to enhance our capital structure and maintain our solid investment grade rating. Reward shareholders with a goal to remain in the range of our historical payout ratio of about 45% of our net income and continuing to invest for growth in our key markets through both the organic actions we have in motion as well as our ongoing JV consolidation and de-consolidation actions. In closing, that we emphasize the results we have been consistently delivering on the bottom line reflected delivered actions we have taken and we\u2019ll continue to take. Our focus remains on execution to drive a continued focus on productivity measures and to continue to position Dow for growth as well as increased shareholder remuneration. With that Jack, let\u2019s turn to Q&A. Jack Broodo : Thank you, Howard. Now, we\u2019ll move on to your questions. First however I would like to remind you that our comments regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. Rochelle, would you please explain the Q&A procedure? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question we\u2019ll hear from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. David Begleiter Thank you. Good morning, first in performance plastics very strong Q1 but given the turnaround costs in Q2. Can you improve earnings in this segment sequentially in Q2 was that just too big of a hurdle given the turnaround costs? Andrew Liveris I\u2019ll start that David, good morning. Look yes, performance plastics saw a lot of volatility in the quarter and clearly the moving on the inputs type of things turnarounds is the factor. The load on turnarounds is more evenly distributed this year. Q1 was actually higher than normal especially in performance plastics and performance materials. We are \u2013 we gave some guidance on that. But we believe that with input sort of stabilizing we should see good price momentum on performance plastics going into this quarter. We\u2019re seeing decent demand, still good decent demand. Post Chinese New Year as lot of a restocking going on in China that we saw through the end of March going into April, May. So frankly with that pick up you saw our China numbers by the way we\u2019re up 10% year-on-year. Latin America we had decent volume numbers, in fact we had a decent volume quarter in performance plastics despite all that volatility based on product mix. So look I would say there\u2019s a smaller propane tailwind, but with price momentum. The turnaround factor shouldn\u2019t be there as much as you are indicating in your question. Howard Ungerleider Yes, I would also say David just currency will likely be a higher headwind for us in the second quarter year-over-year and don\u2019t forget Sadara costs will also be ramping. David Begleiter Understood. And just on Sadara, Andrew and Howard, what were the costs in Q1? And are we still on track for the full year $250 million headwind for Sadara? Andrew Liveris Yes. The short answer is we\u2019re still on track that number is still valid, David. David Begleiter Thank you. Operator : And next we\u2019ll move on to Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo Securities. Frank Mitsch Good morning, gentlemen. And thank you for the clarifications you\u2019re expecting FX to be a higher hurdle in Q2 than Q1 what was the hurdle in Q1 in terms of bottom line and top line? Andrew Liveris Yes. It was about $600 million on the top line of price was currency and about a $160 million on the EBITDA line so around $0.10 EPS headwind. Congratulations on the Mets record, Frank. Frank Mitsch Thank you, thank you so much. We don\u2019t want to talk about it too much in public, in fear of jinxing it, so\u2026 Howard Ungerleider I apologize. Frank Mitsch So one record announcement, congrats on a Q1 record in performance plastics as well. And then on just following up on currency, you seem to indicate the European demand seem to be getting a little bit better, can you expand upon that, please? Andrew Liveris What was the additive in front of demand, Frank. Frank Mitsch Seem to be getting a little bit better, if I read the release correctly and listened to what you were saying? Andrew Liveris Yes, absolutely. Like I indicated on CNBC this morning, going around the world, we see China demand, we see U.S. demand and both I would say good to strong for us, in terms of our product mix, remember targeted growth and then the beginnings of green shoots in Germany, The EU numbers weren\u2019t too bad. Latin America is not great, but we\u2019ve got good volumes down there. It\u2019s a volume/margin story, this whole quarter for us, whether its plastics, or our mix, we\u2019re maximizing margin, minimizing the effect of the volatility on inputs. Howard Ungerleider Yes, Frank, we saw nice growth in Dow automotive and Dow coatings in Europe as well. Just to give you some more color. Frank Mitsch Thank you so much. Operator : And next we will move on to Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Brian Maguire Hey, good morning. It\u2019s Brian Maguire on for Bob. Andrew, two quarters ago you said that lower oil would be a benefit for Dow, I guess we are seeing some of the signs of that, with the good volumes and better margins this quarter. But the oil moving backup, do you expect some of that benefit to go away or do you still see it being a pretty big net benefit for the company? Andrew Liveris Well, you know quite right in terms of what we said and also what we are seeing. At the end of the day we are not negatively impacted by low oil, rising oil price at the end of the day could be an indicator of global demand, which is positive for Dow. Consumer spending I think you have seen all the reports from all the consumer companies, it\u2019s interesting to note that the U.S. consumer is actually pocketing most of the savings on gas and they are not spending more in terms of going to spend on consumables. They are spending little more on gasoline but I would tell you that still all small in front of us, in terms of low oil price demand. It really is our mix, with all the records we hit in the quarter, Dow automotive an all-time record, if you look at the electronic materials our first quarter record, or our energy and water business, our first quarter record, our polyurethanes business, our first quarter record. Our performance plastics, our first quarter record, it\u2019s our mix. We have got the right products for this sort of growth in the demand environment around the world. Brian Maguire Okay, great. My follow-up, just the clarification when we heard you last on the Olin announcement, the chlor-alkali spin I think you mentioned that it would be accretive to EPS by about a nickel. Just clarifying is that inclusive of the ethylene deal that you signed with them and the kind of moratorium on share buybacks for the rest of this year? Howard Ungerleider Yes, definitely. It\u2019s all-in. Brian Maguire Okay, great, thanks. Howard Ungerleider Thank you. Operator : And next, we\u2019ll move on to PJ Juvekar with Citi. PJ Juvekar Yes, hi, good morning. Andrew Liveris Good morning. PJ Juvekar And it seems like the speed with which oil prices declined, it was so rapid, that chemical prices haven\u2019t adjusted fully. So you and couple other companies that have reported so far so big benefit. I\u2019m wondering if you can quantify the raw material benefits and if you think that could reverse in the second half. Andrew Liveris Well, firstly, oil went down 49% versus same quarter last year. We\u2019ve already talked about currency being a big headwind as well as the oil pricing effect. That accounted for most of our revenue decline. Holding on to price for us was less of a factor due to our differentiation. PJ, you should not see the Dow of old in our results. There is no way the Dow of old would have attained these results despite what you said about the lead/lag factor. As I said on CNBC morning that did not play into our results, our margin increases occurred in consumer businesses, in our infrastructure businesses and had nothing to do with raw material inputs. So I\u2019d like to squash that notion on the call. This is all about sell out we ran, very reliably we produced same amount of pounds with all the turnarounds out there. We improved productivity, but we sold up. We sold up in all these differentiated businesses. PJ Juvekar Thank you. And then secondly, you talked about realizing value in your Ag business. Andrew Liveris Yes. PJ Juvekar In the next round of consolidation. But given all the headwinds in the Ag, do you think those actions are likely to come a little later than expected? Thank you. Andrew Liveris We\u2019re investors in Ag, we\u2019re investors in the Ag pipeline, we have been investing now for some years, actually about eight years. We\u2019re in the middle of our biggest product launches ever, not just Enlist, the Enlist platform, but a whole range of crop protection products. Our range of seeds pipeline is very, very robust. We\u2019ve always said we want that result to appear in our numbers going forwards, its beginning to appear. Our Ag results despite the weather conditions in the first quarter. As Howard indicated, our new product launches were up 7% year-on-year, in terms of revenue. So look, we want to see the full effect of that pipeline in the valuation of that business going forward, right now we\u2019re investors. Operator : And Mr. Juvekar, were you done with your questions? PJ Juvekar Yes, thank you. Andrew Liveris Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next, we\u2019ll move onto Jeff Zekauskas with JP Morgan. Jeff Zekauskas Hi, good morning. Andrew Liveris Hi, Jeff. Jeff Zekauskas Hi. In your slides you said that your pension funding may come down over time. Can you quantify that at all? Andrew Liveris Yes, sure, Jeff, good morning. Pension funding issue is going to be around an $850 million headwind and about a similar expense for the year. We\u2019re about our fully funded plans are about 80% funded today. But if you get a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate and one-year of expected return on the assets, we go to fully funded. So that would \u2013 that will take that 800 number down overtime pretty dramatically. It will take a few years to ramp down to that level because of the smoothing effect, but it will go down. Jeff Zekauskas Okay. And then secondly, your revenues were down about 15% in the quarter, but your SG&A costs were down 3.5%, and there is an emphasis on Dow on cost reduction. Are you satisfied with that number, or could you have done better? Or do you see SG&A is relatively high versus the sales decrease? Howard Ungerleider Well, as a CFO, I\u2019ll say I\u2019m never happy with our cost. I mean we always want to continue to drive our cost further down, but I\u2019m pleased that we delivered what we expected we would deliver I mean we took out over $35 million of R&D and SG&A. We also if you look at our headcount overall we\u2019re doing more with less. So there was another $22 million of lower costs through headcount that don\u2019t flow through R&D and SG&A. So it\u2019s not just in the R&D and SG&A line that we\u2019re looking at our productivity. Andrew Liveris Yes. I mean the productivity is a never ending journey, Jeff, we\u2019ve announced that $1 billion program over three years, we had movement in the quarter, Howard already spoke to it. So I won\u2019t speak to the specifics in the quarter. But you should expect us to keep ramping that productivity number up, up on the same asset based or smaller and a lower cost footprint especially post-DCP carveout. Once we fold DCP into Olin, you should expect us to get rid of stranded costs. We\u2019ll have a lot more to say about that in the coming weeks and months. But look, you should be thinking about assets focusing precious resources of growth market. And therefore, getting out of low-end, low-return businesses ROC and EVA is our driver. Jeff Zekauskas Okay. Thank you so much. Operator : And we\u2019ll now like to hear from John Roberts with UBS. John Roberts Good morning, nice quarter. Andrew Liveris Thanks and good morning, John. John Roberts A lot of your capital spending is very long cycle. I think the 2017 cracker project was started back in 2010. So you have to be thinking now about any projects that you want to start up, really post-2018. Are we set up for maybe three years of low startup activity and high cash flow after these startups? Or \u2013 I'm trying to reconcile that, that the oil/gas ratio is still relatively high and still would justify investment back into the shale gas play here in the U.S.? Andrew Liveris John, the tee up to your question is the relevant one. I mean, we made the decision to move forward on Texas 9 as we calling that cracker in 2011 both time frame, that plus the big Saudi project, which was done a littler earlier in 2010 or 2011 timeframe were kind of countercyclical investments geared to start up, as we view them at about the right time in demand cycle that\u2019s going to come to pass, as we see in particular ethylene keeps in the 2016, 2018 timeframe. And not to mention the diversified product mix of Sadara is way beyond just plastics, it\u2019s got a lot of performance materials and other downstream products in it. We believe the timing of that CapEx long cycle, as it is, is about right for the startups 2015 through 2017. You\u2019re quite right then in your tee up we expect high cash flow yields in these next several years. We have the growth platform we need to grow, we\u2019re maxing out on CapEx this year. As Howard said, we will be bringing that down to depreciation levels next several years. And we\u2019re beginning to think in the out years of 2020 timeframe and beyond and we\u2019re doing strategic reviews of that board of the next 12 to 18 months. But nothing announced nothing suggested in any of that Howard\u2019s modeling guidance is the one to go with. John Roberts The preference to keep the mix of specialty basics or \u2013 I don't even know if you want to call it basics \u2013 but to keep performance plastics, let's say, as a segment in a certain range of the portfolio? Andrew Liveris Absolutely and remembering in the way you again teed up your question is helpful. When we are done with Sadara and the U.S. Gulf Coast investments when you fold in Canada and Argentina and all these other places, 70% of our ethylene footprint will be in top-decile, low jurisdictions. And so we\u2019ll be low-cost not just on ethane and but associated NGLs like propane, maximum propane flex, and of course liquids crackers to take the balance in there, especially in Europe. So we have always got a view to envelope spending and making sure that the low-cost inputs are matched by the high value outputs. And I have said many times that specialties and the value-add \u2013 as you saw in the quarter plus low-cost inputs and key integration like ethylene and propylene is how Dow makes money twice and we can make money and also to conditions. So yes, emphasis on the envelopes we call them at Dow; some call it integration. Some German companies call it baubude [ph ]. We are not abandoning that. We are very, very committed to stay in low-cost in the envelopes and doing value-add on the output. John Roberts Okay thank you. Operator : And Peter Butler with Glen Hill Investment, have our next question. Peter Butler Good morning, good morning. Andrew Liveris Good morning. Peter Butler Dow is obviously integrated from raw materials to finished products, and this means you have Dow people on the ground in each of the steps along the way. So this means that your management should know the \u2013 your management knows the management at your customers and you sort of compare this to some of your competitors who regard foreign sales pretty much as dumping commodity products through distributors. So does this \u2013 could you expand on this a little, on the advantages that you have with having people on the ground in each one of the steps from raw materials to finished products. And it seems like, when you listen to Dow, you guys seem to be a lot more confident in your forecast than your competitors. I presume that this is a function of you just having better relationships with your customers. Andrew Liveris Yes. Peter, the way we\u2019re thinking about at Dow and Howard talked about the this next level of efficiency and productivity and how we go-to-market channel efficiency based on a new IT platform plus local representation that combination is being driving up to be very connected to where growth is. This growth is no longer uniform, you can\u2019t do a peanut butter approach to growth, you can\u2019t spread the peanut butter evenly. So like our China numbers indicated to your point, we only have out of roughly 3,500 people, only a dozen ex-pats in China. We\u2019re local in China, our 500 scientists are local scientists. We know working with higher how to launch new products like PURINZE. PURINZE is the brand-new U.S. module that we are using for water, water purity in washing machines in China. Water purity in China is everything. And so working with them and directly working with higher, we can actually growth through our R&D present in China, we can do value add on what is an essence reverse osmosis are also filtration membrane. We have that sort of capability across the world. We\u2019re leading that to the next level of activity right now as we speak, we believe we can actually take advantage of that, but being more decentralized. We\u2019re introducing geographic profit and loss score card around the company right now. And we\u2019re empowering our geographies to be much more attached to the customer front, to be as market led company with assets that we have around the world, you got to optimize the supply chain by going to where value is. So that\u2019s how we do it, local, decentralized, market empowered people. Peter Butler Okay. A long time ago Ben Branch, one of your legendary CEOs, sat me down and said : You know, these specialties are playthings, he said. But put a couple of pennies on the price of polyethylene and I'll show you some real money. Through the years, has this changed today? And if so, how does Dow get the extra pennies? Andrew Liveris Well, we get the extra pennies; I mean the polyethylene Ben Branch comment is apropos to the performance plastics through the quarter. Because we have elastomers in the mix because we have ENT resin, because we have packaging resin, we get premiums on commodity polyethylene. So we can do the sell out, sell up strategy so it\u2019s not an either/or. There was a time when you could look at either/or you can make money in one part by some technology another part by some low-cost. In today\u2019s global competitive world there is no longer an option. Technology is ubiquitous. It gets licensed by everyone. State-owned enterprises enter the market they basically run for cash, they can commoditize any product line in a heartbeat. Innovation is now fast cycle so you\u2019re going to keep innovating ahead of the commoditization trend by being local, to your previous question and then giving premiums based on the technology and then reinventing and cannibalizing your technology, okay before your competitor does. So, Ben Branch was right for the time today\u2019s chemistry company has to be as nimble as an IT company. Peter Butler Okay. Well thanks for the help today. Andrew Liveris Thank you, Peter. Operator : And we\u2019ll move on to Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Vincent Andrews Thanks very much. Just a question on your coatings business. Many of the end-market coating customers have reported and have been talking about seeing different levels of cost benefits from the lower oil-based raws over time. So just wanted to get a sense of how that's going to affect you, given you obviously have a different place in the value chain in a different product suite. Are you starting to see benefits now? And where do you think you will hold on to them, and where might you have to pass them through? How should we just be thinking about the cadence over the balance of the year? Howard Ungerleider Yes, when you look at the Vincent, it's Howard. When you look at Infrastructure Solutions and you look specifically at the Dow coatings material and performance monomers I would say on the performance monomers side, acrylates, I referenced in some of the prepared remarks that we have, there is an acrylic monomer trough. So where we are a merchant seller of monomer \u2013 and we have been on a steady march to reduce that percentage and continue to upgrade the value of monomer into emulsion, preferentially in coatings, but also in building and construction and even in our packaging adhesives platform we\u2019re seeing nice growth there. In specifically in Dow coatings, it\u2019s really about broadening the participation in new market it\u2019s continuing to work all parts of pyramid from an overall value standpoint and continue to gain traction on innovations, I mean our FORMASHIELD product is really starting to take off in China this is a formaldehyde abatement in China in Dow coatings. So that\u2019s I would say we\u2019re seeing nice margin gains, nice margin expansion in coatings but on the monomer side it will be, it will still be a tough go. Vincent Andrews Okay. Just as a follow-up, we noticed in the press release that you included \u2013 I think for the first time \u2013 what EPS would look like with the preferred shares converted. Is there a reason why you had to do that? I mean it obviously doesn\u2019t impact the way we\u2019re talking about the quarter today. But what caused that, if anything? Howard Ungerleider Yes, it\u2019s a good problem to have, because it\u2019s the earnings are higher. And we actually did it once before when we got the K-Dow award in 2012, sorry, 2013. But, when we reported because the earnings were higher with the divestitures on a GAAP basis, we had to assume that the preferred shares were in the capital structures. So you have to add about 97 million shares. If you take that 97 million out, that\u2019s we get our actual share count at that time. Vincent Andrews Okay, thanks very much. I appreciate it. Howard Ungerleider Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Next we\u2019ll hear from Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global. Hassan Ahmed Good morning, Andrew and Howard. Howard Ungerleider Good morning, Hassan. Hassan Ahmed You guys obviously touched in the presentation on the Sadara side of things; and obviously slowly it will ramp up through the course of this year, into next. My question is, the Saudi market has been really buoyant year-to-date; it\u2019s up over 15% in anticipation of it opening up to foreign investors come mid-June, as I understand it. So could you give us an update on the IPO of Sadara? Because obviously this would be a great time for that IPO and should, in my mind at least, provide some valuation support to the broader Dow. Andrew Liveris Yes, so we obviously with our partner will decide that post-startup to the entire operation, Hassan. So the opening of the market is a good thing, but clearly, it won\u2019t affect us until we are past all the start-ups which are post-2016. That\u2019s the arrangement we had with Aramco, and that\u2019s the one that we are going to keep. Look, it is a great signal. The Saudis are definitely looking at foreign investment. Sadara will be a great investment, because of the diversified investment away from oil and gas which is their strategy, not just the plants we are building but all the value downstream. Just to remind you, for those who have been down there with us last year, we have a very big value park with over 31 assets downstream, all little small assets that are new value-add. So Sadara will be an investment opportunity for the local market to really, frankly, reflect the kingdom\u2019s diversification strategy. But it won\u2019t be any time soon to answer your question. Operator : And next we\u2019ll move on to Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial. Don Carson Yes, thank you. Andrew, on the last call, you indicated that supply tightness was in your imminent future; and it appears, I guess, it was even more imminent than you thought. We\u2019ve seen a real tightness in operating rates. So just wondering about your near-term view of the ethylene/polyethylene cycle. We\u2019ve seen some rebound in demand. Is this really just restocking driven by a surge in oil prices? Or do you think that operating rates are tighter than most people other than Dow had really expected? Andrew Liveris Yes. So we saw some restocking end of the quarter, Don, to some extent; therefore there is a bit of a head-fake with respect to people anticipating oil prices going up. Now, look, depending on which pundit you believe, there is some upswell in oil price. Not huge, but there is some. So somewhere the back end of this year, into the next year, people are imagining prices will go up with that. But when you really drill down our numbers, as you have, it\u2019s true demand. I mean if you really look at around the world, we are seeing true demand. Therefore it is foreshadowing with not a lot of supply, apart from a couple of plants coming back up \u2013 only one actually restart; not hardly any restarts out there to speak of \u2013 and then the new supply being what it is, then we start to see the whole industry upswelling in the 2016 time frame, maybe late this year, but certainly the beginnings of a cycle, a big cycle 2016/2017. Operator : And we\u2019ll move onto James Sheehan with SunTrust. James Sheehan Thank you. Good follow-on, that question. Could you comment on your current operating rates? I didn\u2019t see it in your release this quarter. Andrew Liveris Yes. It\u2019s 84%, right, Howard? Howard Ungerleider Yes, up about 1% versus the same quarter last year. Andrew Liveris With a high turn-around quarter in particular. Howard Ungerleider Yes. Operator : And we\u2019ll move onto Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America. Kevin McCarthy Yes, good morning. Andrew, would you comment on the cost as well as the timing of your U.S. Gulf Coast projects and how each of those might be trending versus your original expectations, please? Andrew Liveris Yes. Look, timing, no change. We are on schedule with all of our projects. Of course, I think the earlier question on the big Texas cracker, 2017, early 2017 startup. No change to the budget. Everything going according to our financial plans that we\u2019ve announced to all of you. And we showed you on our Investor Day some very specific details on that. No change to that, if you go back to that slide. PDH, we are quite excited. It was on track for a mid-2015 startup, and that will have a material effect on our run rate to EBITDA on our propylene derivatives. Construction there is over 85% complete, also within budget. And all of their other projects that we\u2019ve announced, the incremental ones, also doing just fine budget and timing-wise. I would tell you that the low oil price and the effect on LNG plants and what might happen out there, you are starting to see that on the Gulf Coast. So that\u2019s a good thing. So you know, you\u2019re not seeing the huge upswell that many of you were asking about last year. Operator : And we\u2019ll move onto Alex Yefremov with Nomura securities. Alex Yefremov Hi, everyone. I wanted to ask a question on Dow Electronics. You mentioned several new products. Could you describe the sales opportunity in OLED and films? Also, where are you in the product cycle across various product lines within Dow Electronics? Thank you. Howard Ungerleider Yes, Alex, hi, good morning. This is Howard. We had a nice wins on the CMP side both on the pad and slurry at some major Asian foundry customers. We also had a lithography win at a major customer in Asia. And in Korea \u2013 I won't go into more specifics in that, but a nice OLED win for a flagship smartphone, if I could share that with you. And then also, on the optical film side we had a win at a major display customer for their flagship model as well. Operator : Next we move on to Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Arun Viswanathan Thanks, guys. I just wanted to understand your comments a little bit earlier on the second quarter with regards to Plastics. You had a price increase in March that was announced in polyethylene. You reiterated that increase in May. What gives you the confidence now that you could achieve that pricing going forward? Thanks. Andrew Liveris Well, so our plastics business through the quarter was, as you saw, struggling on the price side. We believe prices have bottomed in North America and Europe. The first quarter average we'll see an upswell from that from the second quarter based on you had a very minimum small price increase. Inventories are low in North America and heading into a peak demand season, and the previous question I think that Don asked was on the operating rates we see higher operating rates of 90% especially here in North America plus our premium pricing. Howard, do you want to add? Howard Ungerleider No, as an old pellet head myself, you covered it well. Operator : Next we move on to Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Duffy Fischer Yes, good morning, fellows. Howard Ungerleider Good morning, Duffy. Duffy Fischer I wanted to go back to some of the issues you are seeing in the acrylic acid chain. With the recent history of the epichlorohydrin commoditizing and taking down what was the specialty epoxy business for you, where is the confidence level? Or why do you think something akin to that doesn't happen in the acrylic acid chain and then into some of its derivatives? If you could use that to compare and contrast. Andrew Liveris A long history of knowing a lot about the acrylic business, I won't take you through all the history. But Dow about share was in the business back in the 60s and 70s. Very complicated chemistry versus anything in the epoxy chain. Whether it's the monomer itself, both glacial and crystal acrylic acid. And also all the various derivatives formethyl methacrylates in particular. You really have some Japanese houses that know how to do it, and then you have a couple of European and then you have Dow and maybe one or two other smaller companies. But that means that, you know \u2013 and not much cross-licensing and very difficult destructs, large waste issues that has to be managed. The barrier entry is much, much different than you would expect on the epoxy chain. Operator : And our final question today will hear from John McNulty with Credit Suisse. John McNulty Yes, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Howard Ungerleider Good morning, John. John McNulty Question on the Ag business or maybe a couple of them just bundled together. As far as what your \u2013 can you give us a little bit of an update as to what you are seeing in terms of Latin America? You said there that you actually had a pretty positive outlook, but there were some economic headwinds you were concerned about. How do you think that weighs on the Ag chem side? And then in Western Europe, like with the weather issues, are you going to get the bulk of what you missed this quarter back in 2Q, or is some of that lost? And how should we think about that? Thank you. Howard Ungerleider Yes, specifically on your Latin America questions, I mean recent good crop harvests, we do have high level of distributor inventories and I would say generally positive outlook but certainly concerns from an economic standpoint and I would throw currency certainly in the mix as well. Specific to Dow, a reference in the prepared remarks about the acquisition of Coodetec. That happened in the quarter, and that's going to give us an avenue not only on Enlist and soy, but also on crop protection products in with the cooperatives, which is an area we have been weaker on and we\u2019re looking to strengthen that capability. And I would say overall, we expect seeds to do volume gains in corn and soy and canola and our forage portfolio as well. Andrew Liveris Yes, I mean just to follow on, from a whole year point of view we'll be flat excluding currency and we'll be down a little bit including currency, single digits. But the big plus is margins continue to go up of sales of new products. Dow AgroScience is a new product story in crop protection as well as seeds. And I think people have to keep noting that we've become a crop protection R&D power house with the new molecule launches, and those new molecule launches our expanding margin for the company. Obviously, Ag is going to be a bigger, bigger part of the company. And you are starting to see that effect on the Ag business in terms of its margin increase. Operator : There are no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Broodo for any additional or closing remarks. Jack Broodo : Thank you, everyone, for your questions today. Andrew, would you like to make a few final comments? Andrew Liveris : Yes, Jack, thank you, I would. Look, I've said many times 2005 is a pivotal year for the company. We have the big start-ups of Sadara later this year our PDH unit in Texas as well as our launches of new products. Not just in agricultural sciences. We had over 5,000 new products launched last year, as we said in our press release. We have one after \u2013 2015 is going to be a year of lots of product launches, and I\u2019ve mentioned some of them. We\u2019ve talked about, for example, that washing machine example I used and that ultrafiltration membrane. You can expect us to continue to be an innovation story and to deliver on our commitments. We have delivered on our commitments on earnings; now 10 straight quarters of year-on-year beat, six straight \u2013 earnings growth, six straight quarters of earnings beat. We\u2019ve delivered on our divestment commitment. We\u2019ve delivered on our shareholder remuneration story, and we will continue to do that. We\u2019ve delivered on the Dow Chlorine product transaction that will close later this year, a very compelling transaction for that business and a very big plus for Olin. You\u2019ve heard us talk about self-help. We created a portfolio over many years that can handle all sorts of conditions. We execute against the targets that we set over many years, and we execute quarter-after-quarter. This is no way the commodity-driven Dow Chemical of a year-ago could have delivered this type of performance with the 49% drop in oil and an 18% currency headwind. The 10 year-ago number has now been matched in these conditions by the portfolio we\u2019ve created. Our margins are back to where they were in 2005. This is the performance we\u2019ve been after for a longtime. We\u2019ve done at the last few quarters, many quarters in a row. There is no gap in the say-and-do ratio here at Dow. We are building a company that can grow under all macro conditions. Thank you for listening and back to you Jack. Jack Broodo : Thank you, Andrew. As always we appreciate your interest in Dow Chemical Company. You reference a copy of our prepared comments we posted on Dow\u2019s website later today. This concludes our call for today. We look forward to speaking with you again soon. Operator : And that will conclude today\u2019s call. We thank you for your participation.",

[Operator Instructions] Also, today\u2019s call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jack Broodo. Please go ahead, sir. Jack Broodo : Good morning, and welcome everyone. This is Jack Broodo, Vice President of Investor Relations for Dow Chemical. As usual, we are making this call available to investors and the media via webcast. This call is the property of the Dow Chemical Company; any redistribution, retransmission or reforecast of this call in any form without Dow\u2019s express written consent is prohibited. On the call with me today are Andrew Liveris, Dow\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Howard Ungerleider, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Around 7 :00 a.m. this morning, July 23, our earnings release went out on Business Wire and post on the internet on dow.com. We have prepared slides to supplement our comments in this conference call. These slides are posted on our website and through the link to our website. Some of our comments today include statements about our expectations for the future. Those expectations involve risks and uncertainties. We cannot guarantee the accuracy of any forecast or estimate and we don\u2019t plan to update any forward-looking statements during the quarter. If you would like more information on the risks involved in forward-looking statements please see our SEC filings. In addition, some of our comments reference non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures are contained in our earnings release and on our website. Unless otherwise specified all comparisons presented today will be on a year-on-year \u2013 year-over-year basis. Sales comparisons exclude divestitures and hydrocarbons and energy, EBITDA, EBITDA margins, return on capital and earnings comparisons exclude certain items. Some of our comments may also contain statements about our announced agreement to separate a substantial portion of our Chlor-alkali and Downstream Derivatives business and merge it with a subsidiary of Olin Corporation. In connection with that transaction, Dow and Olin have filed with the SEC that contains important information and we advise you to read them. These filings are available free of charge from the SEC or Dow or Olin as applicable. The agenda for today\u2019s call is on slide three, and I will now turn the call over to Howard Ungerleider. Howard Ungerleider : Thank you, Jack, and good morning, everyone. Turning to slide four, simply put Dow delivered strong financial results with year-over-year increases in operating EPS, EBITDA and EBITDA margin expansion, all for the 11th quarter in a row. Our business discipline and financial objectives remain firmly on track and are reflected in our performance. Earnings per share rose 23% to $0.91 on an operating basis. Operating EBITDA increased to $2.5 billion, a record second quarter for the company, and driving first half EBITDA also to a record $4.9 billion. Operating EBITDA margins expanded 396 basis point from the year-ago period to 19%. Sales declined 13% year-over-year primarily as a result of currency and the effects of lower oil price. However, on a sequential basis sales were up 4% as local price improved, offset by currency, while volume grew 4%. Excluding the impact of divestitures on a year-over-year basis, sales volume has increased for the past seven quarters. Sequentially we saw increasing demand across most geographic areas led by Greater China, the U.S., and Latin America. Year-to-date our cash from operations increased more than $700 million year-over-year, reaching $2.7 billion. And we returned $1.5 billion to shareholders so far this year. Our performance over these last many quarters highlights the strength of our structurally hedged integrated portfolio. The power of growing demand for our innovative products which enable margin expansion in our targeted markets, the benefit of our geographic footprint to capture demand where is around the world, and the value of our integrated low-cost positions and feedstock flexibility to overcome volatile crude oil pricing, all of which are enabling us to drive higher and more consistent earnings. You can see on slides five and six progress on our key financial goals as outlined at our Investor Day last fall. We are becoming an EVA [ph] driven company with a clear focus on growing earnings, improving ROC and rewarding our shareholders. We review these metrics with our Board at every board meeting. As a result, we have been consistently delivering improving financial performance. EPS has grown at 22% CAGR over the last three years. Operating ROC is 11.5% and continues to increase as our growth levers are beginning to produce and we complete the execution of our announced portfolio management actions. We continue to generate significant cash flow from operations of $7.2 billion over the last 12 months. And we remain disciplined in deploying this cash to further reward our shareholders, having paid $1.8 billion in dividends and $2.6 billion in share buy-backs in that same timeframe, all while continuing to invest for growth. These results, which you can see on slide six, are a direct reflection of our consistent efforts to perform with industry leading operational excellence, execution and enterprise-wide financial discipline. Now let\u2019s take a look at our operating results for each of our segments in the second quarter as well as some modeling guidance. So turning to slide eight, in Agricultural Sciences overall operating EBITDA increased 8%. Record yields across the Americas have led to tough conditions in the Ag industry, but our sales of new crop protection products increased 5% year-over-year while we continue to make progress on regulatory approvals for our new technology. In fact, this quarter we received the approval of Enlist corn and soybean traits in Brazil, Enlist E3 soybeans in Argentina, and the active ingredients in Arylex herbicide and Isoclast insecticide in Europe. And just yesterday the Chinese government approved a permit for Dow AgroSciences to import and test Dow Enlist E3 and Contesta [ph] as the next step. And although this is not final approval or an indication of the timing of final approval, it is a key required and significant milestone on the path forward for full scale launch of Enlist for both corn and soy. In Consumer Solutions overall sales and EBITDA declined, however, Dow Automotive Systems delivered yet another record EBITDA quarter as a result of volume growth and the sector\u2019s demand for light weighting behind our industry leading BETAMATE products as well as strong demand for premium vehicles and large SUVs which feature more Dow material. Our Electronic Materials business also saw strength in the semiconductor sector, building on Dow technologies like our iconic polishing pads that delivered growth at pace higher than the 5% industry MSI [ph] increase expected for the full year. This strength, however, was offset by weaker display volumes as the industry awaits new product launches. In Infrastructure Solutions demand was strong in our Construction and Reverse Osmosis businesses, with new technologies such as our polymer flame retardant materials for foam insulation and our FILMTEC eco membranes for water applications. Our Building and Construction business achieved a record quarterly operating EBITDA and our Coating Materials business once again delivered volume growth through expanded market participation in both new grades of emulsions and rheology modifiers. This was offset, however, by declines in the energy sector which negatively impacted sales in Dow Microbial Control and Dow Oil, Gas and Mining along with continued and industrywide trough-like conditions in acrylic monomers. Turning to slide 11, Performance Materials and Chemicals operating EBITDA grew 28% year-over-year and EBITDA margin expanded nearly 600 basis points as the benefits of our productivity actions, focused price/volume management and lower costs continued to positively impact the bottom line. Demand is strong for products in our core chains including integrated chlorine, polyurethanes and EO derivatives. The chlorine envelope is showing recovering EBITDA performance and stable EBITDA margins due to our productivity gains following a weaker first quarter. And finally, Performance Plastics achieved a new second quarter operating EBITDA record of $1.2 billion, up 15% year-over-year on strong demand. Dow Packaging and Specialty Plastics and Dow Elastomers both delivered record EBITDA levels with strong year-over-year volume growth reflecting our market focus and the success of innovative products like HYPERTHERM and Pack Expert. The quarter was also another proof point on our feedstock strategy as our flexibility provided a healthy earnings tailwind in the quarter. Now I\u2019d like to take a minute to update you on our pending Chlor-alkali and Derivatives divestiture with Olin on slide 13. In the quarter we surpassed a number of key transaction hurdles including all antitrust clearances as well as the favorable private letter ruling from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service which we received last week. The value of the consideration that Dow will realize is approximately $5.5 billion and is approaching $9 billion on a pre-tax equivalent basis. Upon completion of this transaction it is our intention to execute a split allowing us to retire in excess of $2 billion in Dow shares. In addition, at the close of the transaction, which remains on track for the fourth quarter, our cash balance will improve by $1.3 billion, our debt will go down by $1.6 billion with a further $500 million reduction in our pension liabilities. The finalized values of course will be updated at the close of the transaction. Before I turn the call over to Andrew, let me provide you with a brief outlook of our financial expectations heading into the third quarter. We see an overall macro environment which supports volume growth, balanced by ongoing currency and price headwinds across most of our businesses. Our productivity actions are gaining momentum, essentially offsetting inflation. And we also expect a year-over-year increase in turn-around costs in the third quarter, as well as increased Sadara spending as we approach first product start-up. More detail regarding our modeling guidance and our ethane propane supply/demand outlook as well as the return of our popular and often asked for macroeconomic heat map can be found in the appendix of the presentation. And now I\u2019d like to turn it over to Andrew for an update on our outlook as well as our key earning drivers in 2015 and beyond. Andrew? Andrew Liveris : Yes. Thank you, Howard. Our overall outlook is on slide 15, and if you go through the points, global growth remains volatile and uncertain despite a growth in some economies. And our overall global GDP [audio gap] is approaching around 3%. Now the U.S. remains the one consistent bright spot and our view is that the consumer has begun to spend some of those lower oil price bonuses with our order loading remaining strong as we enter Q3. China remains a mixed bag; a very solid Q2 for us is not necessarily a harbinger of Q3, but note that we have targeted our products and our product mix to sectors that are truly domestically driven, like automotive and construction, and we see good growth in those areas. Volatility and softness do prevail in other sectors. Western Europe remains a positive for Dow with further [ph] demand despite the situation that unfolded in Greece. And emerging markets are all strong with the exception of Brazil. And Dow has positive exposure to all of these growing markets, nearly 35% of total revenue, and we see decent demand in places like Southeast Asia, the Middle East, India, and Eastern Europe. Overall we are growing where growth is. That\u2019s our strategy and our execution is very focused on growing share of demand in those markets, which for us means true value growth. We are doing this predicated on the assumption that the world economy will remain in its current volatile condition and we have to find growth while continuing to focus on productivity and our key projects. So turning to slide 16, this brings me to our earnings growth drivers, both in the second half of this year and beyond. Our discipline and our emphasis on EVA, and portfolio management continued to release further value and are driving higher rewards for our shareholders. As Howard showed, we are very milestone driven, with now 11 straight quarters in a row of strong earnings performance. And our key enterprise growth projects are beginning to start up over these next six months with our first units coming online in Texas and Sadara beginning its start-up in Saudi Arabia. Our low-cost integration strategy will be even further enhanced with these new assets coming online. In addition our strong technology pipeline is in full swing and is yielding end demand material in AgroScience Solutions such as ISOCLAST, EVOQUE, INFUSE, BETAMATE, Arylex, VORALUX and many, many more at a rate of 5,000 new products per year. Our innovation program is producing bottom line results with more than a third of our EBITDA tied to innovation. And we have nearly completed our divestiture program. AgroFresh is on track to close within the coming weeks, and as Howard said our Seminal [ph] Dow Chlorine Products transaction with Olin is on track for close in Q4. Last, completing our next six months drumbeat, our JV consolidation efforts remain very much in focus and we are actively addressing our two major joint ventures as we speak. You know 11 quarters is nearly three years. The pivot we made ahead of the market in 2012 was the core on a slowing and transforming China was to submit to a very different focus on how to achieve earnings growth in a slowing and more volatile world. Self-help through a focus on EVA, productivity and aggressive portfolio management has enabled this performance all the while funding our large integrated projects and our innovation program. We now have a portfolio that\u2019s built to last under all conditions that can grow volume and margins, can be upgraded in quality through aggressive portfolio management, has a pristine balance sheet with all the pre-mentioned new value drivers about to become tail winds. And all with a disciplined focus on shareholder remuneration through share buy-backs and dividend increases. In sum, this drumbeat of execution and discipline, based on our Board approved and management aligned strategy, continues to deliver higher earnings growth, drive strong cash flows and is fueling higher rewards for our shareholders. Dow team will continue to deliver quarter in, quarter out as we have done for these last many quarters. With that, Jack, let\u2019s turn to Q&A. Jack Broodo : Thank you, Andrew. Now we will move on to your questions. First however I would like to remind you that my comments regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. Rochelle, would you please explain the Q&A procedure? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. David Begleiter : Thank you. Good morning. Andrew, very strong first half for ethylene and polyethylene. What\u2019s your expectation for the back half of the year in terms of reduced Agis [ph] and potentially some lower polyethylene prices off the lower oil prices? Andrew Liveris : Yeah, look, operating rates, David, are strong on the derivatives and on the crackers. You know there\u2019s a lot of aged fleet out there. And we certainly had some of our own outages in the quarter. And we achieved the results you saw despite that. With the age of the fleet, unexpected outages are out there as a harbinger of constrained supply. There\u2019s not a lot of new supply coming on as a consequence with GDP around 3%. And let\u2019s say that the global ethylene growth rate is a multiple of GDP, somewhere between 1.1 and 1.5. It\u2019s very hard to call them in 90 day slots, but we will see some price slippage with the oil prices staying low and continuing to have a full cost that keeps it low, but you know all of us are reading the same sort of material. But I would tell you that this snugness, this potential for outages, we have a price increase for polyethylene in August. We had one in June. It does speak to the tightness in a pre-cycle run-up that we\u2019ve been talking about for some time. David Begleiter : Very good. And, Howard, just on equity earnings, they were up year-over-year and sequentially. Can you discuss what drove that and what were the Sadara start-up costs sequentially? What was the impact in Q2 versus Q1 from Sadara? Howard Ungerleider : Yeah. Good morning, David. So yeah, you\u2019re right, equity earnings were up. They were up about $46 million versus same quarter a year ago, about $100 million sequentially. What really drove the year-over-year was the naphtha chain margins with our tied JVs and sequentially we saw a little bit of a boost there as well as increased earnings from our Kuwaiti JVs. But actually if you look at it on a first half over first half, we got no help from equity earnings. First half the equity earnings were actually down about $37 million. Relative to Sadara, we don\u2019t release the actual number but I would say it was in line, Q2 was in line with Q2 costs. So that will ramp as we head into the back half of the year. Operator : And next we\u2019ll hear from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Vincent Andrews : Thanks, and good morning to everyone. Andrew, I\u2019m just trying to get a sense sort of where you are in terms of your outlook today versus three months ago. Are you feeling better? Are you feeling about the same? And I guess maybe you could put that in perspective with sort of the performance of the consumer in the infrastructure segments during the quarter. Was it uniform throughout the three months of the quarter or was there some months better than others, did you finish stronger? And how are things trending so far in the third quarter? Andrew Liveris : Yeah, I think \u2013 thank you very much, Vincent. I think there\u2019s no question that the six months is a better read on the go-forward economy than three month slices. If you look at sequential numbers, actually Building Construction for example was up sequentially and stayed strong, and I made note of that in my prepared remarks as well as on the TV interviews today, that Building Construction and Automotive are doing quite well in the global economy, especially in North America or U.S. particularly and Europe. But there\u2019s some headwinds that we have seen that became bigger headwinds in Q2, mostly in and around our Performance Monomers unit which as you know gets tagged along with Coatings. Coatings itself did very well. Performance Monomers continues to be oversupplied. So that\u2019s specific to that little \u2013 that business; not a little business, a big business. And then Energy and Water, Water did well but Energy, the oil and gas market itself as you know with low oil prices is quite depressed. So if you pull those numbers out of there and make a statement around the whole company, Performance Materials end use demand, Performance Plastics end use demand, and then consumer and infrastructure trending in the right direction in terms of global demand. And again I made a big point of saying we have built a portfolio that has targeted demand drivers. In other words, we\u2019re no longer a vanilla commodity supplier. We are targeted now in use. Our China numbers are a good example of that. Our volumes in China are up despite everyone thinking China is softer down. Where we play in China is where China\u2019s needs are domestically driven such as Automobiles, Construction, and frankly water and food safety and all those things that are drivers. So look, I haven\u2019t really changed. We haven\u2019t changed our outlook from three months ago. I think different parts of the portfolio will play in 90 day slices, but we are still trending. We\u2019ve had seven quarters in a row of year-on-year volume growth in the company. That\u2019s a big statement under all these conditions quarter-to-quarter. We\u2019re structurally hedged as our prepared remarks \u2013 I think Howard said in his prepared remarks. Vincent Andrews : And just as a follow-up, you mentioned the Sadara cost ramping in the back half of the year. How should we think about them going into next year? Because I\u2019m just thinking, I think you had four plants starting up this year and I think another 20 or 22 to complete over time. So it\u2019s sort of the \u2013 is it sort of going to move in a straight line the way \u2013 from this year\u2019s trend? Or does it level out? Or how should we think about it? Howard Ungerleider : Yeah. We\u2019ll give more details as the end of the year approaches, but the way I would think about it is Performance Plastic \u2013 first product which is at this point about 99% complete. First product will start to \u2013 is focused in Performance Plastics, right? So you\u2019ll start to see the headwind in cost in Performance Plastics turn into a tailwind between now and the end of the year. That will ramp the \u2013 the cost headwind though will ramp in Performance Materials because those products will be starting to launch in 2016. Operator : And next we\u2019ll move on to Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo Securities. Frank Mitsch : Hey. Good morning, gentlemen. Forgive me, I saw you two in concert last night, and with your results this morning it really is a beautiful day. So thank you so much for starting us off... Howard Ungerleider : Did you just call Andrew Bono? Frank Mitsch : Well... Andrew Liveris : Leave it alone. Go ahead, Frank. Frank Mitsch : Hey, honestly with these results you are a rock star, Andrew. Hey, how \u2013 explain to me how your Performance Plastics business had volumes of 5%, 9% ex-hydrocarbons and energies. I mean I would have thought last year you were running pretty much flat out. What\u2019s going on in that business? Andrew Liveris : Well, remember, there\u2019s a fairly large rebound going on in Europe, Frank, that I \u2013 Western Europe, and overall for the company our Western Europe results have been pretty, pretty strong. And we did a couple things in Europe that gave us even more competitive advantage and enabled us to take share and really pump up those operating rates even higher into their 90s. And that\u2019s because of our propane crack. I mean we have now got propane flexibility not just into Newson [ph] but also in Tarragona. That\u2019s a big deal in terms of our end market cost competitiveness in Europe, and frankly enabled us to really gain share and run those assets even harder. And they\u2019ve been running very, very well. We did have some operating rate issues here in the United States with around some cracker trips that we just basically had to cope with throughout the quarter that actually was a higher \u2013 a little bit of a cost flip for us. But still operating rates were in the high 80s early 90s. So look, when you run this, I said around the earlier question, when you run them this hard you stand the chance of being \u2013 tripping out not just our assets, everyone else\u2019s assets. But our reliability and our manufacturing people are doing a bang-up job in running our assets more reliable and getting more asset capability out of them as a result, and as a consequence of that we\u2019ve had this volume growth that you pointed out. Frank Mitsch : I thoroughly agree in terms of the potential for unplanned outages when everybody\u2019s running their assets so hard. So just hope it\u2019s not you and you just expanded on that. On the propane flexibility side, you\u2019ve quietly kind of improved your exposure, your ability to crack propane. Where do you stand right now in North America and where do you stand in Europe on the propane flexibility? Andrew Liveris : Yeah. So the U.S. number is around 67%, close to 70. And Europe is around 55% to 60%. Operator : And next we\u2019ll move onto Jeffrey Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Jeffrey Zekauskas : Hi. Thanks very much. I think in the first quarter you said that your equity income would be down in the second quarter. And it turns out to be strongly up. What was the thing that was unexpected that happened in the quarter and do you expect these sorts of numbers to be sustainable? Howard Ungerleider : Yeah, I\u2019ll take the first part of your question first. I mean what surprised us on upside was the strength of the naphtha chain margins. We knew they were going to come up. We didn\u2019t expect for them to come up as strongly as they did. And the Sadara spending was actually a little bit better than we expected it to be as well. Andrew Liveris : And double up, Howard, the naphtha point really came home with Thailand Howard Ungerleider : Exactly right. Andrew Liveris : Thai JV\u2019s really had a great year-over-year quarterly comparison that may not be sustainable for the back half but certainly in the comparison for Q2 was very strong. Jeffrey Zekauskas : How much was the benefit from propane cracking both in the United States and elsewhere this quarter versus either the first quarter or last year at this time? How much did that benefit your EBITDA? Howard Ungerleider : Yeah, Jeff, I would say we\u2019re not going to give you an exact number, but what we can say is it was well north of $100 million. And don\u2019t, also don\u2019t forget the Andrew point that we did also have some unplanned events which were probably in the range of $50 million, maybe slightly higher than $50 million. So that\u2019s \u2013 at least I give you a couple of points to titrate from. Operator : And next we\u2019ll move on to P.J. Juvekar of Citi. P.J. Juvekar: Yeah. Good morning, Andrew. Andrew Liveris : Good morning. P.J. Juvekar: So in this tough Ag environment, there is a lot of consolidation that is being attempted. Would you be a buyer or a seller of assets here? And sort of can you differentiate your comments between crop chemicals and seeds? Thank you. Andrew Liveris : Yeah, look, certainly the last few months that question\u2019s becoming top of mind for a lot of people given the obvious Monsanto Syngenta discussion. As you know, P.J., as everyone on this call I\u2019m sure has heard, we\u2019ve been very consistent value growers of Ag. And we have a strength not just in Crop Protection and our integrated Chemistry business there and all the launches that I even had on the prepared remarks, Arylex, ISOCLAST, et cetera, but also we are a very strong trait developer. And that Enlist permit approval for Contesta [ph] and soy E3 was a big deal that Howard talked about that just came yesterday for the soy market in China. As you know, we\u2019ll play big in soy. So we have two very large value drivers. If you look at the value of the buyout of Dow Lanco [ph] in the late 90s, we had an Ag business worth about $3 billion based on that transaction. If you look at the multiples that are out there right now, we have taken that business and made it basically somewhere near a $20 billion to $25 billion business. We doubled the value in the last five years. We can double it again in the next five. But consolidation and this integration between crop chemistry and traits and germplasm, we\u2019re a big believer in. That\u2019s what Enlist, Enlist Duo\u2019s all about. So we understand what\u2019s going on out there in this round of consolidation. And as I said on TV this morning, we\u2019ll be at the table and we could go either way depending on what creates the most value for our shareholders. P.J. Juvekar: All right. Thank you for that. And just in Ag on the near term, you talked about missed applications by farmers in June due to rains. Can you get that back in July? And what does that mean for inventories going forward? Thank you. Andrew Liveris : Look, it\u2019s going be tough. I mean I would tell you that, and I think Howard had it in the prepared remarks, what keeps us expanding margins is our new product introductions, so that\u2019s the differentiator for Dow. But the market, high inventories, currency headwinds, economic issues in Argentina, highly competitive product and pricing environment, this is not going to \u2013 this is going to be a down year for AgroSciences as a market, and certainly for us in the second half it\u2019s going be tough to maintain the year-over-year beats that we\u2019ve had in the Ag business. Look, that\u2019ll clear itself out. I mean one year does not make an Ag driver, an Ag market, but it\u2019s going to be tough to sustain it through the second half, given the conditions of the marketplace. Operator : And next we\u2019ll hear from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Bob Koort : Hey. Good morning. It\u2019s actually Brian Maguire on for Bob today. Andrew Liveris : Good morning. Bob Koort : I see in the appendix it looks like your global operating rate ticked up to 84%; looks like it was the highest second quarter rate on that chart. Just wondering if that \u2013 what that means for your ethylene operating rates? And do you think we\u2019re now at the point of the cycle where we\u2019re firmly in that upcycle where prices aren\u2019t really going to be set by marginal costs and we shouldn\u2019t really think about oil prices as driving the prices of ethylene and polyethylene going forward? Andrew Liveris : Yeah. I think it\u2019s a great astute observation. I\u2019ll kind of \u2013 probably answered it on an earlier question. Those ethylene operating rates and the potential for trips and outages like Frank Mitsch was also talking about really means that cycle dynamics are approaching. I mean we call them 2016 as up cycle opportunity based on non-outage driven demand. If there\u2019s outages you\u2019re going to get opportunities for price increases independent of the feedstock input. This is not yet a cycle discussion, but it\u2019s starting to mimic one with outages. I think that\u2019s really what we saw in 1995, we need a historian on the phone, where supply outages really created a mini cycle on the up. But not a lot of new capacity. Not a lot of upside coming in terms of supply side. Decent demand around 3%. You\u2019re going to be able to keep those operating rates into those pre-cycle dynamics. Remember though, we\u2019re not a cycle story. We\u2019re structurally hedged to take low cost inputs and add value to the outputs. We\u2019re not a peanut butter over bread or toast plastics player anymore. Most of our product mix is very, very, very targeted and very, very up market value add. Bob Koort : Okay. Thanks. And just as a follow-up, in the slides it also mentioned that you\u2019re still working on addressing your two major JVs; assume that\u2019s Dow Corning and then some of the Kuwaiti JVs. If you just maybe provide an update on how business trends are going in those businesses and whether those are businesses where you\u2019d like \u2013 where Dow would benefit from getting some more exposure? Andrew Liveris : So the two major JVs are the obvious ones. Dow Corning is doing very, very well. They\u2019re coming back as the market comes back, and their base Silicones business is doing very well. Polysilicon still has got major issues, flat demand. The whole solar discussion between the U.S. and China and resolution to the Judy [ph] question has kept their demand suppressed. But look, overall I think they\u2019re starting to recover like many of our Downstream businesses have begun to recover based on consumer pull, construction pull and the key drivers like transportation that I referenced in the Dow mix. Kuwait, look, Kuwait is a great low-cost producer and that\u2019s a big contributor of our equity earnings but it will swing compared with the commodity market with like oil pricing being a big driver there and like oil pricing is on a downward swing right now. It\u2019s an up and down business but of course what makes money over any condition is a slow cost. We\u2019ve already said we\u2019re not going to continue to be investors in those businesses. We\u2019re going to be redirecting our resources through the value add, low cost integrated plays like Sadara for example. Operator : And we\u2019ll hear from John Roberts with UBS. John Roberts : Thank you. You mentioned your China strength was automotive and construction. And I can understand automotive. Construction seemed a little bit peculiar there. What\u2019s driving that? Andrew Liveris : No question, John. It\u2019s infrastructure spend. I was just in China. I mean, they pivot the big bubbles that they created in the housing market. They\u2019ve pivot on really trying to figure a way to continue the economy to grow at a reasonably decent rate until they get strong domestic consumption, they\u2019ll be getting all of the good example. But in some not all areas as well. They\u2019re investing in upscaling their water treatment plant so our sales of water treatment products are going up. That\u2019s also construction. So I would say it\u2019s an infrastructure driver. We particularly saw it in our Performance Materials business as well in China not just our water business. The Water Performance Materials, mostly polyurethanes as well as of course the plastics points especially in packaging and specialty plastics and elastomers in transportation. These were all strong drivers and again very targeted. And not your normal housing construction spend. Howard Ungerleider : And our Ag business was also... John Roberts : [indiscernible] Howard Ungerleider : Our Ag business was also up almost 10% on a volume basis versus a year ago in... John Roberts : Thank you. And then you can\u2019t buy back stock until after the Olin distribution. But what\u2019s your thoughts on capital deployment again once we get past that milestone? HowardUngerleider: Yeah. So we\u2019ve got \u2013 we announced at our investor day last fall a $5 billion program. As you know we did $500 million in the first quarter prior to Olin transaction. If you use the current Dow and Olin share price that will be another $2 billion of the 4.5 that we have remaining. That would leave 2.5. And what we\u2019ve said the way to think about it is that 2.5 will be done. It\u2019s an open program. 2015, 2016, 2017 is how you should think about it and we\u2019ll do it in line with our earnings growth as well as our portfolio. Operator : And moving now we\u2019ll hear from Peter Butler with Glen Hill Investments. Peter Butler : Good morning. Good morning. Andrew Liveris : Good morning. Peter Butler : Looking ahead, if this was the second quarter conference call in 2016, what would Andrew be talking about? What would be the Dow-related positives and negatives that would be highlighted in your conference call next year? Andrew Liveris : Successful \u2013 hi, Peter. Good morning. Successful start-ups of PDH. Successful start-ups and, of course, producing positive EBITDA for Performance Materials mostly polyurethane as well as acrylic acids and reduced mostly in coatings. Successful start-up on the first units in Sadara by end of the year. The second quarter next year we\u2019ll have quite a few more. So headwind becoming tailwinds on the EBITDA line for the Sadara enterprise which is a big deal. Places [ph] relates to Plastics side. A very, very low cost Plastics coming out of those units which is very material to the cash flow projection of Sadara. And then of course continue recovery of the global economy and Dow\u2019s operating rate starting to get mid-80s and beyond. Probably in the high 80s by then. That capacity then will be very important to us. Some other markets in some of our key businesses not the least on being Plastics giving us price power and more EBITDA coming from that. Our productivity program which we\u2019ll deliver on a run rate basis $300 million a year of cost savings. And then our new innovation launches and we have 5,000 of these a year right now, Peter, but we review the 50 at our board and our top 5 and their ability to produce bottom line impacts, we\u2019ll be highlighting those. And here\u2019s the punch line, there are going to be different ones every quarter. We have so many new innovations that we have a proliferation of new high margin products so our percent of PAM [ph] predicted sales is increasing as we speak, and so that\u2019s enabling higher margins. So that\u2019s just a snapshot and I\u2019m sure I could add more. Oh the closure of Olin. I shouldn\u2019t forget that one. That\u2019s a biggie. Further realization of our JV consolidation strategy without being specific just to name a few others. And then we\u2019ll see where we are with the Ag business at that point in time as well. Peter Butler : Yeah. You\u2019ve partially answered my follow-up but the full question would be obviously a company\u2019s key resources are people, financial resources and technology and does Dow see any major changes in any of these three inputs in the next year? Andrew Liveris : Yeah. Look, for sure I answered probably the technology question. Remember that we\u2019re in maxed cap of tier in terms of resource deployment this year and into next year. The market is asking us over and over about how you\u2019re going to deploy excess cash flows to the shareholder, and I repeat it, to the shareholder. We\u2019ve got funding of all of our organic growth programs including hiring of lots of new skills for our new portfolio. We\u2019ve hired 22,000 new people in the last five years, 12,000 of them are under the age of 30. We\u2019re making the generational change here at Dow and that will be very, very evident as we go into 2016 in terms of their ability to keep running this company over the next decade and beyond. Operator : Next we\u2019ll hear from John McNulty with Credit Suisse. John McNulty : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So the first one with regard to the second quarter heat map that you had put in the appendix. There\u2019s certainly a lot more green on it than almost anything else. I guess any major pockets in terms of end markets whether it\u2019s packaging or durables, industrials, et cetera, that you\u2019re seeing a noticeable change as you go into 3Q either to the positive or the negative side? Can you kind of walk us through your thoughts on that? Andrew Liveris : Yeah. Look, thanks for referring to heat map. I was wondering if people would notice its return. Yeah. Look, I think the areas of agriculture which I\u2019ve already talked about and oil, oil-related fuel services and products that go into that like Dow microbial control, these are going \u2013 trending negative so I\u2019d put those into the negative category. Turning positive are the ones that I\u2019ve talked about which are packaging, construction, and automotive. I\u2019d say automotive has had a good run up here based on our technologies. The market itself may be looking pretty saturated but in terms of our position in the market our share of wallet that\u2019s turning positive. And Electronics as we see the pivot in products in the fablets as they\u2019re called which is a smartphone tablet combination, new [indiscernible] technology, new product introductions we should start to see the display business coming more to the positive. The semiconductor business is already doing very well. Those are the ones that come top of mind. Do you have anything else? Howard Ungerleider : No. You covered it. Thanks. John McNulty : Great. And then just as a follow-up, I guess with propylene down as much as it is and other raws for some of your more specialized businesses also down, I guess, I was a little bit surprised to not see maybe a little bit more margin lift in areas like consumer solutions and even infrastructure solutions businesses. So can you walk us through how to think about that? Is it a timing issue or are there just other offsets that may be weighing on those businesses now whether it\u2019s Performance Monomers weakness that you\u2019d highlighted or what have you? Andrew Liveris : Yeah. It\u2019s the offsets to be very blunt. I mean, the acrylic acid and [indiscernible] business is way oversupplied and quite troubled with new capacity. And our strategy is very clear. We\u2019re converting more and more of that into coatings. Coatings actually had a very good sequential quarter and we\u2019re doing quite well on our coatings business. But Performance Monomers is just too much of it that supplied into a commodity like market. We\u2019ll get a bit of help with PDH coming on for that business but it won\u2019t help the supply demand balance. That\u2019s a major upset and I\u2019ve already mentioned the energy business. Operator : And next we\u2019ll hear from Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial. Don Carson : Yes. Andrew, I want to go back to your Ag comments. You\u2019ve said in the past you\u2019re willing to be an investor in Ag. I guess question is, is how big because seed businesses could be expensive and, I guess, they could also complicate potential joint venture discussions as well. So how much capital would you be willing to put into the Ag business to grow it? Andrew Liveris : Yeah. Look we have been very clear that we\u2019re not spenders in big M&A and that\u2019s a very important question in terms of resource deployment. As we go narrow and deeper in key markets, I think, what\u2019s going to have to happen here is we\u2019ll look at the opportunity to play up or play down in the Ag space and make a resource decision based on the playing up or playing down. So it\u2019s less about the absolute amount and more about our resource deployment priorities which our shareholder remuneration and organic growth and small volume M&A. So that\u2019s going to factor into our conversation there without revealing our hand at this point in time. Don Carson : And then a follow-up on Ag. You\u2019re down about 10% year-over-year in the first half on EBITDA. How much of that is due to Brazil, and when do you see Brazil turning? You made comments that you think this excess pipeline is continuing rather than shrinking. Andrew Liveris : Yeah. Look, it wasn\u2019t as much Brazil in the first half. It was really Europe and the weather situation and commodity prices through the oversupply, mostly here in the U.S., but warehouses are full. The Brazil factor will really play in the second half. And that, of course, the oversupply issue will hurt the ability to obviously reduce as much or plant as much and produce as much as we would normally see in the season. So, look, I think Brazil and Argentina, don\u2019t forget Argentina, will loom large in the second half comparisons as I said earlier. Operator : And next we\u2019ll move on to James Sheehan with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. James Sheehan : My question, just wondering about some of the strength in your Performance Materials. You noted polyurethanes demand was quite strong. Could you talk about some of the drivers there? I know you\u2019ve done a lot of work internally. What are you seeing on the macro front in polyurethanes? Andrew Liveris : Well, there\u2019s two major macros, one on the supply side, which is \u2013 obviously there was major competitor outages that enabled us to expand margins because of supply shortages. That will disappear in the second half. But the demand side of it, as I mentioned already on China, we started up a new poly-all [ph] plant in Thailand and that\u2019s a specialty poly-all [ph] plant that fed the Chinese market and started up and it\u2019s flat out right now. So it is demand and it\u2019s in demand in the areas I mentioned like construction and bedding and furniture, which is local consumption, back to the domestic drivers in China, but also our competitive position here on propylene in the United States, which means we can run the PO chain flat-out which is one of the other reasons. Isocyanates remains challenged, in particular TDI. But look, demand and tight supply especially in the PO chain. James Sheehan : Thanks. And on slide 19 you\u2019ve got some interesting supply-demand balances in NGLs. Just wondering if you could comment on the propane outlook for the second half. Do you think prices have reached a bottom here, or do you see continued tailwinds in the propane area? Andrew Liveris : I think propane fundamentals remain bearish, so we\u2019ve been actually pretty consistent in saying that. I think I\u2019ve given Mr. Broodo accolades a few times on this comment in the last several quarters and I would do it again. When he was running the hydrocarbons group, we \u2013 full share [ph] of this several years ago, which is why \u2013 excuse me, we ended up spending the capital we did to convert over to propane flex. I think they\u2019re going to stay fundamentally a tailwind for us for the next many quarters if not many years, and that also applies to butane by the way. Operator : And next we\u2019ll move on to Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Duffy Fischer : Yes. Good morning, guys. In the acrylic acid chain, sitting at trough, where do you worry about that kind of infecting some of the downstream derivatives, or do you think those are pretty well walled off and it won\u2019t kind of infect its way down into the chain? Andrew Liveris : Yeah, it depends on your strategy, I think. There\u2019s no question that if you\u2019re going in a more commodity-like \u2013 emotions, F as in [ph] emotions, you\u2019re going to see some price knock-on effect. It won\u2019t be walled off to use your term [indiscernible], but certainly the strategy of Coatings is being innovation-led. And if you look at their work to be with the winners, end-use customers who are making a difference in premium Coatings, whether it be architectural or nonresidential, you\u2019d see that that strategy\u2019s working. I think we\u2019ve got margin growth going on differentiation that is walling off the upstream, if you like, oversupply effect, and that strategy has been deliberate. It\u2019s been hard to get there, but we have and we\u2019ve got sales of new commercial grades of [indiscernible] is a good example of new product launches in the Coatings business. Duffy Fischer : Great. And then if we could just jump back to Ag, kind of on the strategic side. If the Monsanto Syngenta deal happens, do you think that forces either the industry or yourselves to do moves, or would the industry be able to continue to compete kind of as-is, even if Monsanto and Syngenta did come together? Andrew Liveris : Well, I think it would force other moves. I don\u2019t think \u2013 I think the whole consumption base to pharma [ph] is going to look at that and say, we need some alternatives here. This creates an incredible company should it combine which speaks to its integrated strategy which we\u2019re a fan of and we\u2019ve been a fan of as I mentioned earlier. Operator : And we\u2019ll move on to Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global. Hassan Ahmed : Good morning, Andrew. Andrew Liveris : Good morning, Hassan. Hassan Ahmed : Obviously very interesting slides in the ethane and propane supply demand side of things and obviously in this quarter you benefited a fair bit from cheaper propane. As I look at those slides, you obviously have the ethane surplus coming down quite steeply by the end of the decade. Obviously, in my mind that\u2019s partly some exports and to a large extent ethylene [ph] firstly coming online in the U.S. But along the same time horizon propane\u2019s rising quite steeply as well in terms of surpluses. So can you give us your views about this interplay between ethane and propane going forward? Andrew Liveris : I think it does speak to the earlier question, Hassan, on maximizing propane flex and especially in market Europe which we\u2019ve done and here in the United States keeping our fleet able to flip within a day or two between ethane and propane on the in the moment decision or the balanced decision which you just talked about. As this comes to pass and I think we\u2019d all look at that ethane supply-demand balance one and say grain of salt. I don\u2019t think the market will let that happen based on the other consumption of let\u2019s call it low carbon fuel in the United States. Remember, natural gas is a preferred fuel for low carbon emissions as you start to look at that from a carbon emissions point of view, you can see more of the power fleet going over to natural gas with time. So there will be natural gas production. We\u2019ll all be dry. Probably not. Especially the shale gas. So I\u2019d say that interplay is something we\u2019ve strategically invested for. The way we have pure naphtha crackers left is really only the Taiwan and pretty much our Dow central Germany facility. But \u2013 we\u2019ll look at that from a propane point of view both of them very strongly. But we\u2019re okay on the [indiscernible] propane in a mix and in a balance on how we can manage it. We\u2019re probably one of two or three who can do it. Howard Ungerleider : One more point on that is, is that propane\u2019s going put a lid on ethane. They\u2019re going to compete for a cracker to get in the cracker and so there\u2019s competitive economics between them. Hassan Ahmed : Fair enough. As a follow-up to that, obviously the next step to this is your very long propane over here. You\u2019re cracking more and more propane over here. So obviously producing more propylene co-product, right? So propylene partly goes into over supply because of sort of more propylene co-product coming on stream here. And then if global utilization rates pick up as well that means naphtha based ethylene or breaking [ph] rates go higher which means again further exacerbation of the propylene side of things. So now with that in mind assuming for a second propylene is massively oversupplied, I mean, that would mean higher ethylene prices as well, right, because you will not be getting as much propylene co-product credit as you historically would. Is that fair? Andrew Liveris : Very fair. Very fair. Hassan Ahmed : Excellent. Thank you, Andrew. Andrew Liveris : Good job. Hassan Ahmed : I try. Operator : And at this time we have no further time for questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Jack Broodo for any additional or closing remarks. Jack Broodo : We appreciate your time today. Andrew, would you like to make some closing comments? Andrew Liveris : Yeah. I just like to repeat that this Dow is now there are 11 quarters of execution, seven straight quarters of volume growth year-on-year, 11 quarters of EPS growth and EBITDA growth. So volume, margin, self-help, portfolio management, aggressive portfolio management, the closure of the Olin deal here in the next few months, our big projects coming online and our balance sheet in great shape. We\u2019ve never ever had such high quality earnings. In fact, this EBITDA margin we haven\u2019t seen since the bubble economy of 2005. And so if you think about this, this company\u2019s quality of earnings, and all of the things in front of us, the approval of Enlist and launching that is a big product launch next year, and of course, Sadara and gulf stream our big Texas assets and buy-backs. Shareholder buy-backs and shareholder dividend increases, this is the company that we have and you can count on us to keep delivering these quarters. Jack Broodo : Thank you, Andrew. We appreciate your questions today. As always we appreciate your interest in the Dow Chemical Company. For your reference, a copy of our prepared comments will be posted on Dow\u2019s website later today. This concludes our call for today. We look forward to speaking with you again soon. Operator : And that will conclude today\u2019s call. We thank you for your participation.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, and welcome to the Dow Chemical Company's third quarter 2015 earnings results conference call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jack Broodo. Please go ahead, sir. Jack Broodo : Good morning and welcome. I'm Jack Broodo, Vice President of Investor Relations. As usual, we are making this call available to investors and the media via webcast. This call is the property of the Dow Chemical Company; any redistribution, retransmission or reforecast of this call in any form without Dow's express written consent is strictly prohibited. On the call with me today are Andrew Liveris, Dow's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Howard Ungerleider, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer. Around 7 :00 AM this morning, October 22, our earnings release went out on Business Wire and was posted on the internet on dow.com. We have prepared slides to supplement our comments in this conference call. These slides are posted on our website and through the link to our webcast. Some of our comments today include statements about our expectations for the future. Those expectations involve risks and uncertainties. We cannot guarantee the accuracy of any forecast or estimates and we don't plan to update any forward-looking statements during the quarter. If you would like more information on the risks involved in forward-looking statements, please see our SEC filings. In addition, some of our comments reference non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures are contained in our earnings release and on our website. Unless otherwise specified, all comparisons presented today will be on a year-over-year basis. Sales comparisons exclude divestitures and acquisitions, EBITDA, EBITDA margins, return on capital and earnings comparisons exclude certain items. The agenda for today's call is on Slide 3. I will now turn the call over to Howard. Howard Ungerleider : Thanks, Jack, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 4, our results this quarter demonstrate once again the value of Dow's integrated structurally hedged portfolio, our focus on execution and the strong financial position the company has built. Operating EPS rose to $0.82, an increase of 14% year-over-year. Operating EBITDA rose to $2.4 billion versus the same quarter last year on continued demand growth, margin expansion and self-help actions. Volume grew in nearly all geographic areas, reflecting stable underlying demand for Dow's innovative solutions. And operating EBITDA margins expanded nearly all operating segments, reaching 20%, up 370 basis points year-over-year, the highest quarterly result since 2005. Our disciplined approach to price volume management enabled us to deliver these results even in the midst of ongoing and significant topline headwinds, with year-over-year price declines in oil of 50% and currency headwinds of 17% for the euro and 51% for the Brazilian real. The consistent earnings growth, margin expansion and strong cash flow results we delivered in Q3 continue the steady drumbeat over the last 12 quarters, and underpin our ability to return increasing value to our owners, as illustrated on Slide 5. As we have covered in past quarters, we benchmark our quarterly results against our key financial goals that provide a clear view on our performance. Quarterly EPS has grown at a 21% CAGR over the last three years on an operating basis. And I think it's important to note that the one-time gains resulting from portfolio actions has resulted in an additional $0.71 of as-reported EPS, above the year-to-date operating EPS of $2.58. ROC is now 11.9%, up more than 170 basis points versus the same quarter last year. And we expect ongoing improvement, as our growth levers particularly on the U.S. Gulf Coast and in Saudi Arabia continue to produce and as we complete our portfolio management actions. Cash from operations reached $2.5 billion in the quarter, up $700 million or 41% versus the year-ago period, and has now reached $8 billion over the last 12 months and we continue to return this cash to shareholders. Year-to-date, Dow has returned $1.9 billion to shareholders through declared dividends and share repurchases. Additionally, our recent completion of the Dow Korean products divestment, which successfully closed on October 5, at a tax efficient value of $5 billion or a taxable equivalent value in excess of $7.5 billion. This is a significant value for a commodity business and created a win-win-win for Dow, for Olin, and for the shareholders of both companies. Overall, as a result of this transaction, our net debt went down by $3 billion, and $1.5 billion in Olin common stock was distributed to Dow's shareholders in exchange for 34.1 million shares of Dow's stock. A slide is available in the appendix for additional details. Let's please now turn to segment operating results on Slide 8. In Ag Sciences, operating EBITDA for the segment was down from the year-ago period, reflecting declines in price, the sale of AgroFresh and a gain of $44 million from the one-time sale of a joint venture. The business saw continued strong demand for new crop protection molecules with a 40% increase in new product sales versus the same quarter last year, and an 8% increase year-to-date, led by strong growth in spinetoram insecticide. Results in the quarter also reflected significant improvement in year-over-year cost reduction actions. Overall, the ag market continues to be challenged with high inventory levels and currency pressures, more than offsetting higher volume gains in Europe, Middle East, Africa, India as well as North America. We do expect ongoing weakness to continue over the next 12 to 24 months. While conditions in Brazil ag were weak in the quarter, Dow continues to gain share, and in fact has now moved up to second place in corn seed market share. We also achieved a significant regulatory milestone with the approval of Enlist cotton. Moving to Slide 9, Consumer Solutions reported record operating EBITDA, despite a year-over-year decline in equity earnings. Dow Automotive Solutions achieved a quarterly operating EBITDA record, reflecting growth in both OEMs, as we see continued adoption of aluminum, high-strength steel and composites as well as in our aftermarket segments. Our business continues to outpace industry growth, driven by Dow's innovative structural adhesive solutions and there is significant upside potential, as we continue to expand into do adjacent applications. Consumer Care volume grew in pharma and personal care sectors, offset by sales declines in the lower margin homecare and industrial markets as well as by ongoing currency headwinds. We continue to see demand strength in the high-value portions of our cellulosics chain. In Dow Electronic Materials, EBITDA growth in semiconductor and display was offset by declines in interconnect technologies. Display profitability was improved this quarter by self-help actions, including the intentional exit of low margin business and our focus on upgrading the portfolio. Turning now to Infrastructure Solutions on Slide 10. Overall operating EBITDA for the segment decreased, as growth within several businesses was offset by declines in equity earnings, reflecting a one-time tax credit Dow Corning received in the third quarter of 2014. Dow Building and Construction reported record quarterly operating EBITDA as well as volume growth in most regions, particularly in cellulosics and spray foam technologies. Our innovative product lines are driving growth that is outpacing that of global construction markets and our proprietary flame retardant technology is capturing attractive licensing income. Dow Coating Materials reported volume gains in most regions led by double-digit growth in EMEAI. The business has expanded its market participation with a robust innovation pipeline in new vinyl acrylic binders and rheology modifiers across a broad range of customers. On a global scale, Performance Monomers continues to remain in industry-wide trough-like conditions. Energy and Water Solutions reported double digit volume growth in emerging markets for reverse osmosis solutions, partially offsetting declines in energy sales in North America. Turning to Slide 11, Performance Materials and Chemicals reported a decline in EBITDA, reflecting the impact of divestitures and lower MEG pricing. Strong volume in Asia as well as in a majority of businesses was more than offset by global pricing pressures and ongoing currency headwinds. Industrial Solutions reported earnings declines due to compressed glycol margin and weakness in North America oil and gas drilling demand. Polyurethanes once again continued to deliver strong volume growth, with share gains due to broader market participation, expanding system house sales, the start-up of our Thailand polyols plant as well as underlying fundamental demand growth in EMEA and Asia-Pacific. On Slide 12, Performance Plastics EBITDA achieved record levels due to robust demand in all businesses. Dow Packaging and Specialty Plastics reported a record quarterly operating EBITDA, as the business captured gains from demand growth in emerging markets, high operating rates, strong asset reliability and tight inventory across the chain. Dow Elastomers delivered a second consecutive quarterly operating EBITDA record, due to demand in key markets such as transportation, high-end footwear and infrastructure. And Dow Electrical and Telecommunications also reported volume growth in North America and EMEAI, as new home sales and construction spending rates trended higher. Turning to Slide 13, we want to illustrate the importance over time of owning the full polyolefin value chain. As you can see, the source of income has shifted over time. It's hard to predict which bucket the value will come from in any given period. In the 2002 trough, for example, the ethylene to naphtha spread was high in very weak markets, with some contribution from the oil to gas spread. Our differentiation in 2002 was much lower than it is today. In the strong markets of 2005, there was virtually no oil to gas spread. In 2009, Dow retained market share and decent trough margins due to product differentiation, while competitors that didn't own the differentiation or the feedstock flexibility struggled to the brink of insolvency. In 2014, the oil to gas spread was the main driver of margins, but full chain integration and differentiation played an important role. This differentiation for Dow is based on unique polymers, catalyst, process and comonomer combinations. In 2015, the margin has been shifting to both the polymer and the differentiation, as supply-demand tightness, especially across the integrated chain, continues to progress even in a climate of soft GDP. The Dow strategy has been to continue to be a leader in all three of the margin opportunity buckets, leveraging the Dow material science backbone to provide differentiation that amplifies that performance. I also want to take a minute and share our latest outlook on supply demand for the ethylene and polyethylene value chain on Slide 14. This outlook utilizes the most recent GDP forecast, assumes historical growth multiples to GDP, a gradually recovering China, as well as the latest data on capacity additions. Integrated polyethylene and elastomer balances are tight today and the outlook indicates these balances will stay tight for at least the next several years. Additional, tightness is likely to come from an industry operating reliability issues, both at the monomer and polymer stages of the value chain. As we have discussed many times, much of these assets are old and unplanned outages across the sector have been and likely will continue to happen at relatively higher frequencies. With these tight industry balances, any significant unexpected operating event will be met by shortages and a pricing response, which has certainly had an impact on conditions in the U.S., Europe and Asia in the last two years. The bottomline in our view is that Dow is well-positioned for favorable ethylene and polyethylene industry conditions through at least 2020, based on current announcements and timing to complete the projects. Before I turn it over to Andrew, let me provide some modeling guidance heading into fourth quarter on Slide 15. I'll just cover some highlights. On a year-over-year basis, the fourth quarter will be impacted by divestitures, mainly AgroFresh, Angus, Sodium Borohydride and Dow Chlorine Products in three material ways. First on the revenue line, please remember, revenue will be lower by between $1.3 billion and $1.8 billion. We also expect to realize a negative impact on EBITDA of between $150 million and $225 million. And depreciation and amortization will be lower by between $35 million and $50 million. The other item I'd like to point out is the tax rate for the fourth quarter will likely be between 24% and 27% on an operating basis. If Congress enacts the extenders R&D benefit before yearend, we will settle at the lower end of the range. As you all know, we closed the Dow Chlorine Products transaction on October 5, which will have a tax impact on the as-reported earnings in the fourth quarter. As a result, we expect our as-reported tax rate will be between 10% to 13%. Once again, we provided the popular macroeconomic heat map in the appendix of the presentation. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Andrew, who will provide an update on our outlook, as well as our strategic drivers for the next 24 months. Andrew Liveris : Thank you, Howard. In Slide 16, you'll just see in a few moments I'm going to share the next series of goals that our Board and our management have come up with for our portfolio transformation over these next two to three years. So if you reference Slide 17, at our Investor Day 2014, we summarized what you could expect from Dow for the next 12 months. And this series of commitments was a continuum from our 2013 strategy reviews undertaken by our Board, which culminated in the series of choices in our growth engines and our self help actions. And what underpinned those reviews in 2013 and was reinforced by our statements at the Investor forum in 2014 is that : we are an emergent and are a cash flow story; that our portfolio fine tuning would continue with an acute focus on carving out our chlorine chain and cleaning up our joint ventures; that we would raise our divestment target to $7 billion to $8.5 billion; and that we would continue to fund innovation and organic growth with no big M&A and that we would return cash to our shareholders with dividend increases in share buybacks. Slide 18 is a read out of how we did versus what we said. We have over-achieved our targets and there is no gap between what we said and what we did. We have build a portfolio that has as its foundation, both integration and intervention, and is structurally hedged to handle all economic conditions, and as already referenced, is a cash flow machine. Let's look at Slide 19. As a result of these achievements the Dow board and management have deliberated on our focus for the next 24 to 36 months. And we build a simple roadmap for this period. And the goals on this page are very clear. Our execution focus of these last three years has been granular and laser-like. This will continue. First, our productivity goal of $1 billion of cost reductions over three years starting in 2015 will be delivered through Dow's previously announced change management program Dow 10.0. Second, our large assets in Sadara and on the U.S. Gulf Coast are commencing their commissioning phases. These huge new assets would change from being investment headwinds to cash and earnings tailwinds. Our CapEx will be ranged down to new depreciation levels over the next two years. We anticipate no new mega projects during these next five years. Third, we would conclude our joint venture portfolio work by providing full clarity on our large joint ventures and their future in Dow. And turning to Slide 20, on Kuwaiti, these large, highly profitable JVs will pivot through equity restructuring and move to a growth focus. Our partners in Kuwaiti are excited at the opportunity to consolidate all of their JVs under one ownership umbrella, retain Dow as a minority partner move forward to growth path, while extracting synergies in their consolidation. The deal structure on this slide will yield over $3 billion of pre-tax proceeds to Dow by mid-2016 with $1.5 billion by the end of 2015. On Slide 21, our joint venture of 72 years Dow Corning is a tremendous asset with a focus on specialty materials and specialty chemicals, and of course, polysilicon by the Hemlock joint venture. Dow and Corning are in discussions around a potential transaction involving Corning's ownership in Dow Corning. We will have more to say on this in the not too distant future. Slide 22, Dow's portfolio work of these last five years has been to methodically exit commodity cyclical value change, such as those in styrene, butadiene, chlorine and all their derivatives. And as you can see on Slide 23, these commodities exhibit no predictability either on their input price, which is mostly oil based, or their output price, which would be commoditized and genericized and have no technology advantage. We have been successful in repositioning the portfolio to growth markets with clear integration and technology differentiation. Slide 23 shows how we have divested $15 billion of primarily high-beta businesses of these last six years. And what is clear to us is that our owners are continuing to looking at ways, enterprises like Dow with all of our intended complexity can not only create value, but actually release that value. We are very proud of what Dow has built in the agricultural market via Dow AgroSciences. This business has doubled EBITDA over the last five years and has the most envied technology pipeline in chemistry and in traits. By all accounts, this is a successful business with a bright future. So despite Dow AgroSciences being a low-beta business, there is a rationale in our opinion that given the potential synergies in a newly consolidating agricultural market and attractive opportunity to release value may be upon us. As a result, the company is only considering those prospects that will extract further value from this business, while comparing it to the value of retaining the business. Slide 24, 25, the final point on our emphasis goals over the next 24 to 36 months is captured by the notion that we are generating a lot of cash, have more down in that future, and that Slide 23 has shown we have been a returner of that cash -- Slide 25 is showing we have been a returner of cash to you, our shareholders. This will continue. We are pleased to announce our dividend increase of $2 to $1.84 a share. This represents a new historic dividend level. And we're going to continue to accelerate our share buybacks. We will continue to return cash to you. We have no plans or any new big CapEx or large M&A in this timeframe. We have built a structurally hedged portfolio with tremendous organic growth drivers. And Slide 26 gives you a sense of these growth drives. We believe they're unique. We have built three strong integrated pillars of value that uniquely define our enterprise. We start with cost advantaged monomers in geographies with attractive markets. In the second pillar, we selected to industry-leading science and engineering enabling us to create value differentiation with our customers. And in the third pillar, we selected to attracted growth segments of key markets to lower volatility and drive reliability of earnings and cash flow. The first and second pillars, well, they define our integration. The second and third pillars, they define and leverage our innovation. The key is that no one else in this sector brings both operational and commercial excellence across all three pillars. And if you look at Slide 28, our broad scope of scientific capabilities really creates -- Slide 27 really creates a very highly competitive hurdle, not easily replicated or imitated, creating a benefit for both Dow, and more importantly, Dow's customers. Look at those examples if you can see on that slide, they're all unique, all highly valuable to Dow and to our customers. And looking ahead, we believe the market outlook favors the products, technologies and geographic position of the Dow portfolio. If you look at the market outlook on Slide 29, we expect ongoing expansion of growth opportunities that will enable Dow to continue to capture that growth, mostly in markets such as China, the United States and Europe, despite challenges in soft pockets around the world, such as those in Brazil. We anticipate strength in construction, packaging and transportation markets, as well as, in electronics, as the interconnectivity of the world continues to increase and Dow is well-positioned to manage, and in fact, win from the weakness in agriculture. Our forecasts indicate that there will be gradual recovery in the oil markets. And gas-based cracking will continue to be advantage. And in the midst of all of this, our new investments on the U.S. Gulf Coast and in Saudi Arabia are coming online at exactly the right time, further boosting Dow's ability to capture and expand margins. The bottomline is this, today's macroeconomic realities mean the importance of driving differentiation into the portfolio will only increase and companies that aim to win will need to invest in innovative solutions and work closely with customers. Overall, Dow's strategy, our integrated portfolio, our innovation engine, and our proven track record of execution are delivering results. And going forward, and as always, capturing growth where growth exists is not the only way that we would demonstrate consistent earnings growth and strong cash flow. Our self-help and our productivity actions underpin all of our operational and execution tactics. Now, third quarter results highlight this intense focus on delivering the potential of Dow, 12 consecutive quarters of EPS, EBITDA and margin growth; eight consecutive quarters of volume growth; the highest EBITDA margin results since 2005. The Dow machine is generating strong cash flows and returning that cash to its owners. And today's announcements outline for you the next 24 to 36 months of actions that would drive continued results and demonstrate our commitment to being exceptional stewards of the opportunities in hands, but combining exceptional capital utilization with our drive to return cash to Dow's owners across the intermediate, mid and long-term horizons. Our team has distinguished itself by its performance and it will continue to do so. And with that Jack, let's turn to Q&A. Jack Broodo : Thank you, Andrew. Now, we will move on to your questions. First, however, I would like to remind you that my comments regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. Rochelle, could you explain the Q&A procedure? Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question, we'll hear from PJ Juvekar with Citi. PJ Juvekar : Howard, I like your win-win-win comment. Howard Ungerleider : It was PJ. I mean, it was a tremendous transaction for both Dow, for Olin and for all of our shareholders, I mean really it was. PJ Juvekar : So my question is on ag. Andrew, you mentioned that you want fair value, and there's pressure to do something. But is it the right time to divest ag, given that ag markets are depressed? And then on seeds, it doesn't make any money today, but you have this great pipeline, so how do you capture all that in your divestiture comments? Andrew Liveris : You got to take it from the two angles that we are taking it with. You've just given us one angle, which is the retention angle. And then in consolidating ag market, the affordability of R&D budgets and the capturing of synergies is another angle. And if you look at our total market cap and you look at the contribution of Dow AgroSciences, both revenue and EBITDA, then projected EBITDA, you could take some multiples, and say, that as a percent of market cap is higher than as percent of either revenues or profit in the enterprise. So that begs value release and we have talked to many, all of our owners about that. You can entrust upon us, so all of our owners, that we will definitely compare it, as I've said in my remarks, to the value of retention. But look, we believe that over time the hurdle of doing business in this sector will only keep increasing. We've done a phenomenal job through collaboration of building our capabilities and we've done a tremendous job, as you acknowledged on building the pipeline of both chemistry and traits. And we will extract full value in whatever construct we come out with that beats anything towards retention. Operator : And next we'll move on to Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Steve Byrne : Your outlook comments include an indication of a widening oil/gas spread benefiting your polyethylene chain. I was wondering what your thoughts were on the outlook for a looming surge of anthracite-based petrochemical production, and do you see that as an opportunity for China to become more competitive in this area? Any leverage you think they can pull to lower the variable cost of that industry? Andrew Liveris : I really appreciate the question and it's a recurring question. Actually, way back in '03, '04 China's coal-to-olefins projects were looming large, especially with the oil and gas price structures that existed back then. Look, we have been part of it. We have actually assisted one of our partners there to actually move through the approval process. We have one point-in-time even considered participating ourselves. But in our view, despite the variable cost comment you just made, it is unlikely to be any new projects being brought forward. These are very hard to run, highly polluting projects, very water-intensive. They're all in the wrong place. And we believe that their ability to operate even is suspect, as already witnessed by the one that's online. And if you throw on top of that that there will be sub-world scale on the derivative side and actually be mostly in the commodity areas like glycol and gas based, commodity-based polyethylenes and polyprop it will have little or no effect on the value chain comparisons to either the Middle East production, which we're part of or the U.S. production, which we are part of. Operator : And our next question, we'll hear from Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo Securities. Andrew Liveris : What about the Mets, Frank? Frank Mitsch : Andrew, I was just going to say, that I'm not sure who is doing a better job of managing, you or Terry Collins of the Mets, so key point. Andrew Liveris : Terry is a Midland guy. He's born and bred in Midland. Frank Mitsch : I did not know that. I did not know that. Sorry, Howard, about the Yankees. Howard Ungerleider : But are you going to write the check for Cespedes? I mean, I think Detroit helped the Mets this season. Frank Mitsch : We are very grateful and we're keeping Murphy. Andrew, you made the comment no large M&A, and then obviously you indicated that you are in discussions with Corning. I was wondering if you could, at least, conceptually speak about the positioning of the Dow Corning joint venture within Dow proper, the logic behind it, what your expectations might be if in fact you are able to execute on that. Andrew Liveris : Yes, 72-year JV. Despite the comments on execution with the Mets, we are not foreshadowing an easy execution play here in terms of the partnership being such a strong one. But the good news is both partners know the company inside out, as you might imagine having been on the Boards of this company for a long time. We know the company. Look, Frank, it's just down the road here in Midland, Michigan. These synergies are very unique and are available to one partner, i.e. Dow. And then of course, there's more than that. There's the point you just made about market synergy. As we've rebuilt our portfolio these last many years, Dow Corning's become a much more logical fit on the market side, that wasn't true 10 years ago. And clearly whether it's in the consumer sector, the infrastructure sector, there's electronic materials, building construction, home and personal care, we also see growth synergies on the market side. This will only happen, if it's value accretive to both companies. The win/win/win of Olin, if we can construct it here, something might happen. But we've been very public about JVs and bringing them on balance sheet or off balance sheet. The Kuwaiti announcement is obviously moving in the other direction. And we anticipate that if something happens here, it will only happen, because it's hugely value creating. Operator : And next we'll move on to Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Jeff Zekauskas : Maybe I can ask Frank's question in a different way. If there are no large M&A transactions that you plan, but there is something that you plan with Dow Corning, is it that we would rule out that Dow would buy the piece of Dow Corning, that it doesn't own because you don't plan to make large acquisitions or is that not the right inference? Andrew Liveris : Look, I don't want to be -- there's no vagueness in the two commentaries, just to be very clear. There's no big M&A outside of our joint venture work. We've been very clear, our joint venture work is our joint venture work and we'll consolidate or deconsolidate. And yes, some people might say that's big M&A. But no, it's not big M&A, because it's a joint venture that we're either consolidating or deconsolidating. There's no problem with those statements coexisting, Jeff, but I understand your point. There could be cash outlay here, but there will only be cash outlay if it's hugely accretive, I mean just to be very clear. Operator : And next we'll move on to Peter Butler with Glen Hill Investments. Peter Butler : Is, in fact, your stock market goal is to become a sustainable earnings growth story to replace the old Dow cyclical growth story? And if so, could you talk some about what remains to be done on your M&A and restructuring program? What might reasonably happen in the next, say, year-and-a-half? Andrew Liveris : So the three year goals that we punched out today are very clear. We believe that the Kuwait joint venture and the way we're restructuring that will yield cash. And of course, for them it will yield growth. So it's a win/win/win. We believe that we have got bolt-on M&A in our future but no big M&A, to Jeff's question, other than whatever we end up doing with Dow Corning. We believe that Sadara and U.S. Gulf Coast, which by the way Sadara is already sold out on first product and we are pre-marketing as we speak on polyethylene. We're bringing those assets on at exactly the right time. So the $3 billion EBITDA run rate from the US Gulf Coast assets and the $700 million net income boost steady - state run rate on Sadara is new cash flow. And Peter, I think the way we should all think about the company is that it's going to be a cash flow machine these next several years. As you can already see, our cash flows are being boosted substantially. If we do any degree of monetization on ag of any sort, that just adds even further. And so this is all going to be returned to the shareholder. We're going to be a consistent dividend payer at the payout ratio of roughly 45% and we're going to be a buyer of our shares, while our shares in our view are undervalued. And I think the collective view is you generate cash, you spend that cash to grow organically. We have done that. We've got a lot of organic growth in our innovation pipeline. And we'll keep returning cash to our shareholders. Operator : And next we'll move on to David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. David Begleiter : Andrew, nearer term, can you discuss polyethylene price expectations for Q4 volumes as well. And Performance Plastics, how do you view the business versus Q3 sequentially on EBITDA basis? Andrew Liveris : Howard, why don't you take that? Howard Ungerleider : I would say, look, I mean when you think about polyethylene around the world, and I'd point you to the slide and some of the prepared comments. But November price increases are in the market, positive sentiment is building. I think Andrew made some comments in some his interviews earlier this morning about Dow and other producers in Europe closing their order book. So October order books for Dow have been closed for about two weeks and a few other producers as well. So that tells you a couple of things. One, inventory through the chain are low and fundamental underlying demand in Europe is good. We've had really strong demand in Asia. I mean, at a company level, this a company comment, not specific to polyethylene, we had 12% volume growth in China versus same quarter year ago. And our packaging business was north of 20%. So you're seeing demand growth in Asia, you're seeing demand growth in Europe. The U.S. economy still is a bright spot. You've got unplanned events happening. There was a big issue in Brazil in the last week, so that just reinforces a point. So margins over the next several years should continue to move up, that is the expectation. Fundamental underlying demand will outstrip the additional supply growth, and that's our view. Operator : And Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial will have our next question. Don Carson : A question on ag, just on near-term. On Slide 15, you talk about 3% to 5% down sequentially. So are you expecting ag to lose money again in fourth quarter kind of a reversal from last year? And then more broadly, as you look to restructure ag or monetize your position, is DCP the model, where you might do a Reverse Morris Trust, and then distribute the shares in the combined entity to Dow shareholders, so they can continue to participate in the growth of ag? Howard Ungerleider : Why don't I take the first question, then I'll throw it to Andrew for the strategic. But when you think about ag, no I don't think we're going to lose money in the fourth quarter. But it is soft. The market is soft, highly-competitive price environment. We're still dealing with significant currency headwinds. I mean Brazil in the third quarter was a 50% drop versus a year ago. You got economic issues in Brazil. Argentina is certainly where we potentially have a devaluation coming here in the fourth quarter after the elections, so we've got to get through that. But my point would be in a down market we are winning. We're winning with our new molecules on the chemistry side. I highlighted earlier that we are now number two in Brazil corn. That's a new fact. We were number three, we are now number two. So we are winning. And I think we are really seeing the pipeline start to come through the market on both the chemistry side and the biotech side. Andrew, you want to go head with strategy? Andrew Liveris : Yes. And, Don, look, we're open to all constructs. That was a great construct with a win-win-win of Olin. So we're open to all constructs that release more value, and actually that value stays with the shareholders. It doesn't atrophy away in a tax disadvantage deal. Operator : And next we'll move on to Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global. Hassan Ahmed : Two-part question on Performance Plastics, if I may. Obviously, a nice sequential bump-up in EBITDA. So the first question is that you mentioned in the press release that Europe, obviously European margins was strong. How did North America fair? Was it sort of flat, down? Just trying to get a sense of how feedstocks flexibility within North America sort of played a role in the quarter. So that's the first one. The second one is, as you look at 2016, there seems to be a pretty heavy turnaround schedule on the ethylene side of things globally. So do you expect to see effective utilization rates tighten materially from here, particularly through the first half of 2016? Andrew Liveris : Howard, why don't you take those? Howard Ungerleider : I mean, certainly Europe margins were strong in the third quarter. North America came off a little bit, but not as much as everybody was expecting or the third-party pundits were pontificating. We've got North American operating rates in the industry are in the either the very high 80s or low-to-even mid-90s. The ACC data, you had below 40 days of inventory. So again that tells that you fundamental underlying demand is there. And we're taking advantage of that. And if you project forward the next few years, we've added in on our slide in the slide deck, we've added in all the new capacity. I think, frankly, we've been conservative. We added nine crackers on the Gulf Coast coming on between now and 2020. I don't think it's going to be nine, but we wanted to stress test it, and operating rates still go higher from here between now and 2020. Operator : And we'll move on to John Roberts with UBS. John Roberts : Why is the new executive leadership counsel separate from the Office of Chairman/CEO? Could you talk a little bit about the shuffling you did there? Andrew Liveris : Look, I wouldn't over-read anything about team structures. Every company does their own thing. We've got the most important part of the team announcement you saw today, John, is the team at the top. The top three of this company, Howard, Jim and I, we're going to run the company. Howard and Jim have got significant responsibilities, new responsibilities, very excited by that. It's a very strong team. Actually, we've had this team in place for a long time now, and they continue to show exceptional performance, as this quarter has shown. But the team that also reports to the CEO or the governance functions, some of the key functions that now report to Jim and Howard, we're going to pull that together as an executive leadership council that gets together and makes sure that we leverage every aspect of this company. Well, the three of us have everything. And the three of us, there was a term used at Dow for historians, from back in the 70s and early 80s, called a troika. I don't know whether that means anything to anyone, but you can call us that if you like. But the three of us run the company in terms of the big decisions and the operational decisions. Howard Ungerleider : Maybe you just gave at least one of them a headline. Andrew Liveris : Of course. Operator : And we'll move on to Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Bob Koort : Andrew, I'm curious, as you look about the JVs, and then maybe doing something with ag, historically Dow has been pretty flexible. So is there an opportunity to maybe use earn-outs or other mechanisms, if you can't come to an agreement on current values for those assets? And then secondly, I'm guessing as we go through earnings season we're not going to find many companies that produce the numbers you showed in China, the numbers Howard talked about in the architectural paint markets in Europe. So can you give us some sense of were there some one-offs, was there some trade opportunities, arbitrages or what kind of confidence do you have that you can sustain those really pretty surprisingly strong volume trends? Andrew Liveris : I'll take the first one and give Howard the second. There is no question that the Dow AgroSciences property is at the top of that beta pyramid, low beta that you saw on one of the slides in the deck. We've nurtured it, grown it, cared for it, fed it in terms of R&D, and it's grown, grown, grown, and it now has a technology pipeline. In the many years we've been doing that, the Board has done extensive reviews, certainly no less than semiannually and some very big deep drills, where we spent days at a time. To look at the ag market, because it's been obvious that since 15 years, 10 years ago, that another round of consolidation will come one day. And whenever it does, Dow should be able to answer the questions of releasing the value in the portfolio in the best available construct. So, yes, all options are available to us, including the one you just spoke about. Howard, do you want to take the polyethylene thing and the China thing? Howard Ungerleider : On the flexibility side, I would just say, Bob, we have had a track record of being flexible with our divestitures. So you look at in just in last 12 months, Angus and SBH were straight divests. You look at AgroFresh, which was a SPAC, I think we're the first Fortune 50 company to do that. I think at the time we announced $900 million of value for AgroFresh, embedded in that transaction was an earn-out. So that will bring future value, assuming AgroFresh delivers on their financial plan, which we're confident that they will. There is also a tax receivable agreement. When you add the value of the earn-out and the tax receivable agreement, that brings the AgroFresh value on an NPV back to Dow of north of $1 billion of value. And then the Olin RMT, I mean it just shows that we're willing to look at everything. This management team has a very large focus on return on capital, and we've been increasing ROC between 100 basis points and 150 basis points a year. And our focus is any transaction we do, we want it to be a help in EVA momentum and ROC increase. Andrew Liveris : The China question? Howard Ungerleider : I'm not even sure I remember what the China question was? Andrew Liveris : I mean, why are we seeing the contrarian -- Howard Ungerleider : It's simple. It plays to our portfolio. And if you think about where China is, they've exited this heavy industry phase, and it really is all about light industry/consumer. So you think about our materials, whether it's RO membranes in water, whether it's our elastomers, whether it's our architectural paints, where 10 years ago you would sell very low-end paint to a developer who would look to spray an entire building. Today you've got people in China who have been in their apartments or their homes for 10 years, they are making the choice, and their value proposition is going to be very different from a developer. They are looking for technology, they are looking for things, whether it's our FORMASHIELD, to take formaldehyde out of the air and trap it in the formulation or one-coat hiding. These are the kinds of products that we have, and you're starting to really see that through each of the three quarters of the year. Operator : And next we'll move to Jonas Oxgaard with Bernstein. Jonas Oxgaard : One comment first. I would stay away from the troika. I would suggest respectfully a triumvirate. Much better. Andrew Liveris : Thank you, Jonas. You may have saved the headline for me. Jonas Oxgaard : So that said. I was curious on the ag side, have you already started discussions with potential partners, other owners or where are you on that timeline? Andrew Liveris : So Jonas, really, literally, since the Monsanto Syngenta conversations began in May, you could imagine that every player talks to everyone. And on previous call, I think it was the last quarter's earnings call, I basically said Dow will have a seat at the table. So, yes, we're all talking to everyone. And there's no imminent deal. I just want you to obviously listen to the questions that were asked a couple times about, is this a good time, is this the right value, dah-dah-dah, all that is very key questions that we have to answer for our shareholders. But look, the answer is, everyone is talking to everyone. Operator : And next we'll move on to Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Vincent Andrews : I unfortunately have another follow-on question on the ag situation. It sounds like you're considering either a sale or keeping it internally. And I'm just wondering, are you also considering intermediate options such as a spin-off or a sub-IPO tracking stock, those types of things? Particularly in the event if the timing or the bid/ask spreads would suggest it might make sense to wait a little bit longer before complete monetization? Andrew Liveris : Thank you, Vincent, for allowing my shortest answer, yes. Vincent Andrews : And if I could just follow-up on the price declines and crop chemistry vis-\u00e0-vis the inventory levels, how much of that do you think is just a function of weather-related demand issues? How much of it is a function of, maybe in Brazil, the financing issues? And are you extending more credit to farmers or bartering or those types of things? And how much of it is just sort of the dollar has made, maybe in the past made purchasing power and pricing power higher and now that tides gone out a bit? How do you sort of shuffle the deck between those buckets? Howard Ungerleider : Yes, I would say it's really -- you literally answered the question, because it really is a little bit currency, it's a little bit lower crop prices, which you look at a rented piece of land and the farmer's not able to make money in Brazil on that basis. And there has been -- you throw some weather in there and you mix it all together and it makes for a really challenging environment after three years of pretty high yields with high inventories. Operator : And next we'll move on to Jim Sheehan with SunTrust. Jim Sheehan : Regarding your flame retardant technology, you're gaining some new license revenue there. I was wondering if you could just comment on where you see that technology going in the future. Do you think you can grow it outside of Europe? Howard Ungerleider : I would say, yes, the medium- to long-term plan is that's going to be global technology. So we're seeing nice licensing income. I mean, it plays right into our technology material science strength. And boy, talk about EVA and ROC, it really has been a nice tailwind for building and construction and we see that continuing to expand over time. Operator : And next we'll move on to Aleksey Yefremov with Nomura Securities. Aleksey Yefremov : What is the EBITDA associated with any global stake being sold? And also, could you comment on the magnitude of the equate stake sale as well, how does it compare in terms of proceeds and EBITDA? Andrew Liveris : So we don't look at it on an EBITDA basis. Do we, Howard? Howard Ungerleider : I would say this, Phase 1. I mean, this is the beautiful thing, and why I would differentiate in terms of JV consolidation, deconsolidation, its hidden EBITDA. Remember, because of 20-50 equity accounting, you don't see the EBITDA of our joint ventures. You only see our percentage ownership of the net income after tax of the joint ventures in our EBITDA. So when you look at Phase 1 that we announced today, you're talking about probably in the range of $30 million to $50 million of lost Dow EBITDA in exchange for the $1.5 billion of proceeds. So it's a pretty nice EVA positive. Operator : And that will be all the time we have for questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Broodo for any additional or closing remarks. End of Q&A Jack Broodo : Thank you, everyone, for your questions. Andrew, did you have some closing remarks? Andrew Liveris : Yes, I do. We packed a lot into this call. We appreciate your questions. You've got our earnings release. You've also got our pathway for the next two or three years release as well. We have a company that's closing out one year early from its goals that we announced in 2013. Our divestment targets were exceeded. We are in the position now of talking about the next two or three years with great clarity, and that clarity has been provided on the call. This is a company that has delivered on its promises. There's no gap between what we've said and what we've done and we intend to continue that. And we're getting little to no help from a consistent economy. Witness all the questions on volatility. Look at the proof points of our portfolio performing in this economy, which we now have got quite a few quarters in a row. Those who worried about low oil, look at our results. Those who worried about China going away, look at our results. The results of the company and the consistency of performance enables us, as a Board, and management team to continue to deliver that growth in terms of earnings and cash flow. We are strong cash flow machine, getting stronger back to you. There is no big M&A. We will consolidate JVs where it makes sense. There is no need to think about this company directing itself to anything in terms of big CapEx. We've got the big projects starting up. We have done this the last five years with your perseverance, and we are now in the throes of starting up some of the biggest industrial chemical complexes of all time, the one in Saudi Arabia, and of course, the big expansion on the US Gulf Coast. We're advantaged on the inputs and we're advantaged on the outputs. That's a structurally hedged portfolio that's very unique to this enterprise. We commit to you consistent return to shareholders, consistent return of that cash over these last five years. And last but not least, I'm very proud of the team announcements we've made today. We have the team to drive this company for the next five to 10 years in place. It's a team that has consistently grown and delivered for you, the shareholder, and I'm very proud of that. Thank you. Jack Broodo : Thank you, Andrew. As always we appreciate your interest in the Dow Chemical Company. For your reference, a copy of our prepared comments will be posted on Dow's website later today. This concludes our call for today. We look forward to speaking with you again soon. Operator : And that will conclude today's call. We thank you for your participation.",

Howard Ungerleider : Thank you Neal and welcome back to investor relations. Good morning everyone. Turning to slide six, our results this quarter and in 2015 reflected the benefits of our continued disciplined approach to execute on our priorities. Dow delivered its 13th consecutive quarter of operating EPS and EBITDA margin growth. Operating earnings per share increased 9% to $0.93 per share. Volume increased 4% which represents the ninth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. This includes 5% growth in our emerging regions led by greater China which was up 10%. Operating EBITDA was $2.4 billion. Excluding the impact of divestitures operating EBITDA rose more than $100 million versus the same quarter last year. Operating EBITDA margins expanded across all segments to 20.9%, the highest quarterly results since the first quarter of 2005. During the quarter we also returned $2.7 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases with the closing of our Dow Chlorine Products transaction serving as a significant driver of improvement to capital. We've included a full look back on the greater than $4.8 billion in consideration for the transaction in the appendix. And finally, at the very end of December Dow received $1.5 billion in pretax proceeds through the sale of its direct ownership interest in MEGlobal to EQUATE. Moving to our full year results, Dow reported operating EPS of $3.47 a share a 12% increase year-over-year. We achieved operating EBITDA of $9.6 billion a new high. Operating EBITDA margins expanded more than 360 basis points to 19.7% representing the highest level in more than a decade with gains reported in all operating segments reflecting our continued discipline and price volume management. Operating return on capital increased to 12.1%. Marking three consecutive years of expansion we delivered $7.5 billion of cash flow from operations in a year, $1 billion dollar increase compared to last year and on an operating basis this represents our third consecutive year of record cash flow from operations. We also continue to return significant cash to our shareholders. In 2015 we returned $4.6 billion through paid dividends and share repurchases and we recently announced another increase to our quarterly dividend to a new historic high. Additionally, during the year we announced a series of portfolio management milestones which brought our total pretax value from portfolio actions since 2013 to more than $13.5 billion dollars coming in well ahead of both our committed target and timeline. Moving on to our dashboard of key financial performance metrics on slide seven, these highlights reflect our consistent track record of delivering earnings growth, margin expansion and strong cash flow. As a reminder, our financial priorities include delivering 3% above the cost of capital, driving 10% EPS growth over the long term, maintaining a capital structure that provides financial flexibility and continuing to increasing reward our owners. And as you see here, we've made significant progress against each one. In the fourth quarter we reduced our net debt-to-cap to 24.8% from 37.3% in the year ago period and well below our ten-year average of 35.9%. Net debt-to-operating-EBITDA declined to 0.9x versus 1.5x in the same quarter last year and year-over-year total cash and cash equivalents have increased by $2.9 billion. Further, we returned $2.7 billion to shareholders through paid dividends and share repurchases with $1.5 billion related to the equity redemption from the Dow Chlorine Products transaction and an additional 700 million of stock buybacks in the quarter. We exited the year with operating return on capital of 12.1% an increase of 130 basis points versus the prior year. Now let's turn to our segment results starting on slide nine. Ag Sciences reported sales of $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter down from $1.9 billion in the year ago period, impacted by continued lower crop commodity prices, high channel inventories and ongoing currency headwinds. Operating EBITDA for the segment was essentially flat year-over-year and headwinds from pricing in the divestiture of AgroFresh were offset by the sale of nonstrategic product lines and disciplined productivity actions we drove throughout 2015. Here, we were among the first movers in the industry to take swift action and reduce our cost structure in response to market headwinds. During the year, sales of our new crop protection products grew 6% and we gained corn market share in the Americas. Looking ahead to 2016, soft commodity prices are expected to continue with the overall market projected to be down 3% to 5%. In this environment we're focused on continuing to differentiate ourselves with new products as well as continued self-help actions to deliver performance that continues to outpace that of our competitors. Consumer Solutions on slide 10 achieved an all-time quarterly operating EBITDA record of $296 million. This reflects continued demand in the automotive and semiconductor sectors. Collectively the businesses in the segment drove cost reductions in line with productivity initiatives and realized margin expansion from demand for innovative customer focused solutions. Dow Automotive Systems had another strong quarter led by demand for our science and engineering capabilities that improved fuel efficiency, safety and acoustic performance. In this business we're leveraging our technology capabilities to outpace the industry. For example, in North America we continue to make solid progress with electric vehicle manufacturers where our content per vehicle averages three times that of non-electric vehicles. In Consumer Care volume gains in Asia and EMEAI more than offset a transition in the Americans from powder-based detergent solutions to capsules. We also saw double-digit volume growth in target pharmaceutical and personal care markets and took action to respond to the weaker industrial markets by closing a less competitive CELLOSIZETM facility in West Virginia. Dow Electronic Materials expanded EBITDA once again as semiconductor and growth technologies grew faster than the industry driven by our technology differentiation that lowered the cost of ownership for advanced nodes. Looking ahead we see margin improving in our display business driven by our core knowledge and our strength in LED backlight films. Turning to slide 11, Infrastructure Solutions reported fourth quarter sales of $1.7 billion down from the year ago period as volume gains in nearly all businesses were more than offset by price pressures from lower raw material costs and currency headwinds. Dow Building and Construction drove margin expansion through strength in construction chemical markets and our FR-63 licensing efforts. Dow Coating Materials grew volume led by industrial coatings. Looking ahead we expect growth in our coatings business to outpace the market due to the commercial launch of five new vinyl acrylic binders. Performance Monomers remains in an ongoing global trough and we are taking several actions, shutting down 20% of our Deer Park acrylate capacity to reduce our merchant exposure, optimizing our turnaround and structural cost and continuing to explore co-producer supply agreements. In Energy & Water Solutions, our industry-leading reverse osmosis business saw double-digit growth driven by strong demand. During the quarter our new RO membrane plant in Saudi Arabia also came online and will serve the growing need for water in the Middle East. Based on the market penetration and customer acceptance of our product we expect to reach capacity on this asset very quickly. Turning to Performance Materials & Chemicals, fourth quarter sales were down on a year-over-year basis driven primarily by the impact of the split off of Dow Chlorine Products and other divestitures as well as significant price and currency headwinds. Industrial Solutions reported a volume decline as growth in ethylene glycol sales was more than offset by weakness in the energy sector along with a change in long-term supply arrangement. Our price volume management kept EBITDA flat in our core business, but that was offset by weakness in energy MEG pricing as well as increased dollar expenses as the site continues to progress startup of the new production units which drove down equity earnings. We reported another strong quarter in polyurethanes as a result of self-help measures and a shift to a more specialized systems how sales approach, which achieved double-digit sales growth. Additionally, our new polyols facility in Thailand drove share gains and double-digit volume increases in Asia. Moving to slide 13, our Performance Plastics segment delivered a fourth quarter operating EBITDA record of $1.3 billion driven by steady demand in all businesses and margin expansion in most geographic areas. Dow Packaging and Specialty Plastics sold a quarterly record polyethylene volume led primarily by double-digit gains in Asia and strong demand for Dow's innovative packaging solutions. In early December the first polyethylene units began production at our Sadara joint venture and first shipments have already been received by our customers. Dow Elastomers reported double-digit growth in North America on continued customer demand for Dow products in the transportation and infrastructure sectors. Our INFUSE elastomers which are sold into higher-end footwear saw strong volumes in the quarter. Additionally, an increase in consumer preference for SUVs resulted in higher per vehicle elastomer demand. Dow Electrical and Telecommunications saw double-digit operating EBITDA growth as well. This quarter's business performance continues to be underpinned by ongoing progress in our integration and feedstock flexibility. For example, Dow Europe produced almost half of its ethylene in 2015 from LPG and we increased our European LPG cracking capability to over 60%. Some additional details on this topic are also in the appendix. Turning to slide 14 let me briefly cover our modeling guidance for the quarter and for 2016. On a year-over-year basis in 2016 we will have earnings catalysts from a full year of PDH impact and we have two positive drivers that will contribute to the back half of the year, the Dow Corning transaction and our enhancements to ethane cracking capabilities in Louisiana. In the spirit of continuous improvement we will make further progress on our productivity initiatives to build on the $345 million of savings we delivered in 2015 by targeting an additional and incremental $300 million in 2016. We also see pension expense providing an approximately $250 million tailwind as well. We do see several headwinds, mainly continued pressure from currency, loss of earnings due to divestitures and soft Ag fundamentals from continued lower crop prices and higher channel inventories. Specifically in the first quarter we see demand fundamentals that continue to favor volume expansion in our targeted sectors. This will be tempered by higher turnaround activity on a sequential basis as well as lost earnings from our recent portfolio management actions. Finally, we will continue to drive our $5 billion share repurchase program forward. We expect to deliver $2 billion of share repurchase as of this year as our purchasing window likely opens up following the shareholder vote for the Dow-DuPont transaction. With that, I'll turn it over to Andrew. Andrew Liveris : Thank you, Howard. If you look at slide 16, you'll see that 2015 in every regard was a transformative year for Dow. We delivered record results amid some ever challenging macroenvironment with 13 consecutive quarters of earnings growth and margin expansion. In addition to the financial highlights that Howard we made further progress on our productivity goals through harmonizing our work processes, streamlining functional business support and optimizing our asset footprint. We committed to achieve $300 million in 2015 and in fact we have delivered on this goal with $345 million realized. We completed the first full year operating on Dow's new one instance IT platform. This world-class system represented the single largest implementation of SAP and that is already delivering significant streamlining benefits while also enabling sharper business and geographic insights. We're delivering on our significant growth project milestones, celebrating first polyethylene product shipped from our Sadara joint venture and starting up the worlds largest on purpose propylene facility which is making smooth and steady progress towards full rates. And importantly, in a year with these significant operational projects coming online we delivered our best ever EH&S performance. And last, but certainly not least, 2015 was a truly transformative year on the strategic front. We drove major actions on our joint ventures with the sale of our direct ownership into MEGlobal to EQUATE, the step acquisition of Univation Technologies, and the announced restructuring of the ownership of Dow Corning Silicones business. We split up Dow Chlorine Products and released further value through our transactions of the AgroFresh, Sodium Borohydride and ANGUS businesses. And of course in December we announced the signing of a historic transaction with DuPont and we intend to crease three focused industry leaders in agriculture, material science and specialty products releasing tremendous value for our owners. I will have more to say about our progress here in just a moment If you turn to slide 17, in summary 2015 represents the culmination of actions we have taken over a three-year period to increase cash flow generation, drive self-help measures, enhance the quality of our portfolio, capture growth for the future and increasingly reward our shareholders. 2015 will go down as the most significant year Dow's storied [ph] history and quarter for the exclamation mark on the year. This direction was set by the thorough review of the Dow Board and the Executive Team launched in 2013 to identify clear actions to unlock additional value for our shareholders. As part of their review we set very focused goals including to grow EPS by 10% per year over the long-term, to enhance our traditional EVA focus, to continue to reduce our debt and to go narrower and deeper in key end markets and divest non-core businesses including Dow's exiting chlorine our original foundational product, all with a relentless focus on shareholder value creation and long-term growth. We have made significant progress against the strategic roadmap and these actions have delivered impressive financial results and returns to our owners over that that three-year period including $22 billion in cash flow from operations, ROC improvement of 450 basis points from 7.6% to 12.1%, more than $8 billion reduction in net debt and most importantly $12 billion distributed through share repurchases and paid dividends. Turning to slide 18, these results are also underpinned by our intense focus on driving an EVA culture and performance using our best on our mindset as our key lens and taking actions on multiple fronts, lowering our working capital and asset base through our multiyear productivity actions, most recently our Dow 10.0 streamlining program and our aforementioned world-class IT capabilities, driving synergies through our corporate base further leveraging our functional expertise across the enterprise to increase sales, optimizing purchasing and driving a lean corporate center and regional hubs, capturing growth where growth exists by cross-selling opportunities, maximizing our operating leverage and improving our sales mix. As a result, over these past three years, our EVA improvement has been significant placing us in the 95th percentile relative to our peers. Turning to slide 19, to keep this momentum going and build on the performance and portfolio actions of the past three years we've put in place clear earnings growth drivers that are delivering now and will ramp up in the near future. Our multiyear productivity push is already delivering bottom-line results. Our mantra is one of continuous improvement. We did it in 2015 and we will continue with that same mindset into this year making even more progress towards our goal of $1 billion in savings over three years with 2017 being year three. We're pleased we exceeded our $300 million productivity target with a $345 million of savings we delivered in 2015 and 2016 we have targeted to save an additional and incremental greater than $300 million. In fact, we're increasing our headcount reduction target as part of this program by proximately 500 roles bringing the total program headcount reduction to 2200 roles that will be eliminated. Thus far we have reduced just over 1200 roles. Our strategic investments including our U.S. Gulf Coast and Sadara projects will significantly enhance our go forward earnings profile. These projects are based on strong underlying fundamentals. They deliver bottom line benefits in all scenarios because of their low-cost position and value-add products. We are pleased with the start-up of these good facilities and we expect several additional units to come online both on the U.S. Gulf Coast and in Saudi Arabia in 2016. Another earnings driver comes from our restructuring on the ownership of Dow Corning which we expect to close in the middle of this year. This transaction is expected to yield more than $1 billion in additional annual EBITDA at full run rate synergies. Just all these drivers alone approach $4 billion of EBITDA contribution on a run rate basis. And of course, it is important to remember that we have additional levers in place that will benefit our portfolio depending how market forces develop through the year. From a cash flow and future earnings potential view, these drivers are indeed powerful, a real booster and our growth profile, expand the potential to serve our customers and release significant value for our shareholders. I will now review our 2016 market outlook and priorities for the year. So turning to slide 21, we will continued to see growth in the three key markets in which our materials businesses compete; packaging, transportation and construction, all consumer driven and innovation based. These three markets have carried the strength that we saw at the end of 2015 into the first month of 2016. The global economy continues to be volatile and we see that trend persisting for the near term. However, we also see strong demand from consumers in the U.S. as well is in China and that plays well through our consumer driven portfolio, technologies and narrow and deeper market focus. From a macro perspective we are in and expect to continue to be in all the supplied energy and agricultural markets. We see low energy prices being a net benefit to the consumer. We do not sell energy. What we produce and sell continues to see tight and tightening supply/demand dynamics. Our differentiated solutions allow us to drive demand and capture value. And turning to the geographies North America is expected to remain strong. Demand in Europe will continue to improve and Latin America will have mixed returns across the region. We also expect continued growth in China, driven by demand for our consumer targeted solutions. And finally, in this volatile macro environment, expect us to control what we can control, expect us to improve our productivity, expect us to control cost and expect us to deliver the growth projects we have in place. Turning to slide 22 and looking ahead, 2016 is primed to be another big year for Dow and our teams are squarely aligned around three clear priorities. Priority one, deliver our 2016 plan despite these volatile macro conditions. Here you can expect us to continue controlling the things we can control, driving our productivity initiatives, realizing the benefits of our commercialized innovation and executing ongoing price volume discipline. We will continue to reduce costs and expand margins Two, close the Dow Corning transaction by midyear and deliver the related synergies and three, move swiftly through the key stage gates of the Dow-DuPont transaction. Close MergeCo, realize synergies on accelerated basis and prep the intended spins. The make-up of the teams and the timeline for the transaction is available is more detail in the appendix. These are the same slides DuPont provided during their earnings call last week. I reiterate Ed\u2019s comments that he made during the call. We are working on an accelerated timeframe to close the merger and deliver the synergies and the intended spins. The synergy estimates of $3 billion cost and $1 billion growth are indeed a floor not a ceiling. In sum you should expect in 2016 the same resolute focus our Dow team has demonstrated over these past several years. And speaking about our Dow team, we also announced this morning that Jim Fitterling has been appointed to the position of President and Chief Operating Officer of Dow. Since the announced merger with DuPont, Jim has been and will continue to work closely alongside me in running Dow's operations. He will play a key role in supporting me to drive the successful completion of the merger and unleashing the full value of the three intended subsequent independent companies. His appointment is extremely well deserved and a reflection of his abilities and a commitment to our company of his 30-plus year career. Now we anticipate that the entire process to close the merger and set the companies up to be spun will take about a year and a half or two. I look forward to working with Jim and also with Howard Ungerleider in the office of the CEO over that time period to bring that entire process to a successful conclusion and enable a successful leadership handover to coordinate with my own planned transition out of the company which will occur when we have set up to be a spun off but no later than the end of Q2, 2017. We will continue to drive our strategic agenda and the transformational steps we are undertaking. We will deliver further productivity gains and cost reductions. We will innovate and add value for our customers and we will drive and enhance returns for our shareholders and we will deliver this exciting new phase of growth manifested in the creation of Dow-DuPont and its three destination companies. And with that Neal, let\u2019s turn to Q&A. Neal Sheorey : Thank you, Andrew. Now we will move onto your questions. First, however, I would like to remind you that my comments regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures apply to both, our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. Levi would you please explain the Q&A procedure? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll take our first question from Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo Securities. Frank Mitsch : Congratulations to go around, of course Mr. Fitterling, congrats Mr. Broodo, congrats Neal, I don\u2019t think I should congratulate you because IR in this day and age is kind of a thankless position [ph], but welcome back into the role. Hey Andrew, obviously\u2026 Andrew Liveris : Nothing for Howard? Frank Mitsch : And of course Howard, congratulations on you being you. Howard Ungerleider : Okay, good. Frank Mitsch : Andrew obviously very impressive results, volumes really jumping off the page here and especially in Asia and China, can you expand upon that and I know that your commentary was rather upbeat on China as well, what exactly is going on for you guys there? Andrew Liveris : Well look I\u2019ll give you \u2013 thank you Frank for the, all kinds of congratulations commentary. I think this is an exciting time at Dow and the question you\u2019re asking is an indicator of it. We\u2019ve positioned our product mix now for about a decade to be technology driven waiting for China to move to quality products, not quantity products. So rather than selling commodities and they reprocessing them for exports which is the China engine of yester year, the China engine of today and tomorrow suits our product profile, but we\u2019ve been working a decade to put in place the Shanghai R&D center that you visited is a good example of that. So we have the right products for China\u2019s current needs. Jim, did you want to add anything? James Fitterling : I would say in plastics obviously the higher end of the market for food packaging, what we\u2019re doing in polyurethanes was structures going into automotive and appliances has been big. Electronic materials, we\u2019ve seen a shift to more production into China, so that benefited us as well. And we continue to focus on all of our value added products moving into the market. So double-digit growth in China and even though automotive is a little bit slower in China, we are still very, very strong in automotive. Our elastomers business as well as our automotive bonding business has been quite exceptional. Operator : And we'll take our next question from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. David Begleiter : Thank you, good morning. Andrew Liveris : Good morning. David Begleiter : Andrew, Howard and Jim lots of moving parts for 2016, can you grow EBITDA in 2016? Andrew Liveris : Howard? Howard Ungerleider : Yes David, good morning. I mean, you know we don\u2019t give earnings guidance. What we try to do with the modeling guidance is talk you through some of the moving parts. I mean we certainly have the potential to grow our EBITDA, when you look at all the tailwinds whether it\u2019s the volume growth that we expect to continue, whether it\u2019s the productivity self-help which is another $300 million on top of the $345 million that we delivered. Lower pension expense between $200 million and $300 million, but I would just caution you to look at all the headwinds as well. We\u2019ve got some headwinds, but clearly PDH is well coming on as a tailwind and Sadara will be a tailwind in Performance Plastics, but it will be a headwind in Performance Materials and Chemicals through the year as both units in PMC continue to get closer to startup in 2016. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Jeffrey Zekauskas : Hi, good morning. Andrew Liveris : Good morning. Jeffrey Zekauskas : Hi, in your previous corporate filings, you said that your Texas nine cracker would come on in the first half of 2017 and suddenly the chatter in Houston is that that cracker is running a year late in coming on-stream, is it still on schedule or is it running late? Andrew Liveris : Jeff, I\u2019ll give it to Jim to answer. James Fitterling : Jeff that cracker is on schedule to start up in the second quarter of 2017 and when you take a look at the progress that we\u2019ve made vis-\u00e0-vis the other competitors or we call it the first wave of production, it\u2019s right on time. Operator : And we\u2019ll go to our next question from Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global. Hassan Ahmed : Good morning, Andrew. Andrew Liveris : Good morning. Hassan Ahmed : I just wanted to sort of follow on from the earlier question, you guys are saying that your crackers on stream coming online on time and the like, if I take a look at the 15 or so cracker announcements that have happened in the U.S. it seems that only three have started construction right? But yet there seems to be this perception that there is going to be this flood of capacity coming on stream in 2017. Could you broadly give us your view of supply/demand and more specifically of what we should expect ex-Dow in terms of cracker delays? Andrew Liveris : Yes, I\u2019ll get Jim to handle that one as well, Hassan. James Fitterling : Yes, Hassan what I would say, we have said since the beginning of this and our long-term experience in the ethylene business is this, half of what\u2019s announced is in play and half of that might come on, on the timeframe that was committed to. So when you look at what\u2019s in the first wave today, the things that we know, we know that Braskem [ph] has started up experiencing a few problems but have started up. You\u2019ve got three big players ourselves, CPChem and Exxon that are coming in a small cracker with OxyChem. That is our view as of the first wave of capacity that\u2019s coming on. That is quite a bit I had of anybody else and those were the first ones out of the ground and are going to continue to be the ones you see in the first wave. When the second wave comes is anybody\u2019s guess at this point. Some people are saying 2018, I think it might even slide into 2019 or 2020 and given the financial conditions there and given things are going on with construction labor, I think that would be a realistic expectation. I don\u2019t expect a tidal wave of new capacity coming on. We\u2019re well positioned as a first mover in this and in fact I think we\u2019re going to be up before the rest. Operator : And we\u2019ll go to our next question from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Vincent Andrews : Thanks and good morning everyone. Just wondering if you can give us an update on the list approval from China and I\u2019m also kind of wondering whether you think the delay has anything to do with ChemChina\u2019s interest in acquiring Western assets? Andrew Liveris : Yes, just the back end of that, look there is no question China has been very much after GMO technology for a long time, Vincent and it\u2019s not surprising that ChemChina is interested in Syngenta. That is a long held rumor and if indeed the announcement this morning that they are close, there is no shocker there. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a correlation, but go ahead Howard on the investor group [ph]. Howard Ungerleider : No, I don\u2019t really have anything new there. I mean we\u2019re continuing to try to work with the Chinese Authorities and the Ministry of Agriculture. We are giving them as much technical information as they\u2019re asking for and we\u2019re very confident in the chemistry and the efficacy for the farming value chain. Andrew Liveris : Operator, do we have another question? Operator : Yes, we\u2019ll go next to Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Steve Byrne : Yes, thank you. How much of that double-digit volume growth in Performance Plastics was a reflection of perhaps inventory destocking in the year ago quarter when you had falling oil or conversely did you have more inventory destocking in the fourth quarter with another leg down of oil, just curious about your outlook for operating rates in these next couple of quarters? Andrew Liveris : Hi Steve thanks for the question. I don\u2019t think there was any massive destocking that happened in the quarter. We saw strong demand through the quarter and we saw a strong December. We moved product in almost every region of the country. I'd say a little bit soft maybe in Latin America for the fourth quarter and we see January is starting at a solid pace. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a destocking. On our own particular situation we ended up with record low inventories at the end of the year, but last December was also a strong December. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Peter Butler with Glen Hill Investments. Peter Butler : Yes, good morning, good morning. Andrew Liveris : Good morning. Peter Butler : Wall Street analysts are again talking backend loaded year, loaded years for their favorite economy sensitive stocks and wondering how much visibility does Dow have, that you have on the second half in next year, how much confidence do you have in your internal projections? Andrew Liveris : Well let\u2019s start with the market side of that question and then we\u2019ll get to our own Peter. Look I think every industrial company, every company out there up is not giving any sort of firmness on any of these years in front of us, that\u2019s not new news. I think 2016, 2017 even with an election year here in front of us in the United States the macros are very difficult to predict. What we are seeing though is very strong trend lines which we said in our call, which I think gives us strong views towards our ability to grow earnings, is this notion that the consumer is active in the United States and the consumer is becoming increasingly active in China and then actually this is the beginnings of good spending in Europe. We do believe low energy price, low oil prices are seeping into the economy and that\u2019s creating a stimulus that actually is of the right kind and I think if that stimulus continues to be what it is short of major tectonic events geopolitically, I think the confidence in the real economy will emerge continually from the consumer. And frankly that is what we\u2019re seeing in our results, we're seeing it in our product mix which we've been working hard to position to be B2B to C and I think when Jim talked about packaging and plastics and I could say the same about anything, elastomers, our water business, our automotive business. We\u2019re seeing strong demand in construction chemicals in Western Europe. I think it takes away this notion of back loading. It takes this notion of 13 quarters in a row continuing that trend and that then speaks to the other side of it. Most of our scenario plan this \u2013 does these days, we don\u2019t actually say this is the condition. It's going to be 2.5% GDP and then got from there, none of us do that. We bracket it and then we pivot self-help appropriately and if we have to go down further in cost based on productivity actions because markets don\u2019t manifest themselves, we take out more costs and having an IT platform that is leveraged, we can do that pretty quick. We can move the cost structure with demand and price volume managed and that\u2019s what you've seen from us. So look, I think we have confidence in our machine continuing to deliver and generate the stats. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Aleksey Yefremov with Nomura Securities Aleksey Yefremov : Good morning. Thank you. I was wondering if you could elaborate on Dow Corning's performance and the outlook for silicones and poly silicon business given that you are about to buyout your partner there? Andrew Liveris : Yes, sure Aleksey good morning. Overall when you look at our equity earnings for Dow Corning in the quarter on a reported basis they are actually up year-on-year. If you strip out some of the certain items there was a one-time gain that they had in the fourth quarter of last year they didn\u2019t recur and then there was some lumpiness in polycrystalline silicon side of the house. But the silicon\u2019s platform has historically grown at 1.5 to 2 times GDP. They are in attractive, high growth markets that are clearly aligned with the markets that we have said we want to go narrower and deeper in, whether that\u2019s construction, whether that\u2019s automotive, whether that\u2019s packaging, home and personal care or even electronics. And so, we're very excited about the silicone\u2019s platform and the intent with the transaction on the poly silicon side is to have no economic change in ownership. That will remain a JV between Dow, Corning and Shin-Etsu. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will take our next question from Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital markets. Arun Viswanathan : Good morning. Thank you. Andrew Liveris : Thanks. Arun Viswanathan : I had a couple questions, I guess, I could ask them as one question. It looks like you guys really hit an inflection point on volume growth in many of your businesses, should we expect that to continue? And similarly on the margin side, you've now had a level, new level of margin, so just to Andrews point that you are able to adjust the cost structure going forward is all of this kind of Dow specific or dependent on the market or again are we going to expect that these levels should continue on the volume and margin side? Thank you. Andrew Liveris : Jim, you'd like to take that? James Fitterling : Yes, I\u2019d say Arun, the team has been very, very focused and aligned in all of the businesses and I think you are starting to see that come through in the consecutive quarters of results. If I went through every one of these segments, the teams knows what markets we're going after. They are well armed with new innovative products from our pipeline that are helping them to pick up market share and so it\u2019s not just moving products with the commodity part of the cycle. They are very targeted on which geographies we want to grow in. If we had started the quarter we would have thought may be fourth quarter would have been more dominated by emerging markets and more by developed market instead of emerging markets and what we\u2019ve saw - was we saw a strong performance in both. And so, I think what you\u2019re seeing here is the culmination of just a lot of intense focus since about the middle of 2012 around our top line growth and when you think top line growth for us you should really focus on the volume right now because what\u2019s happened with the oil prices is the thing that shows through in revenue, oil price and currency. What do you see on volume is sustainable. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial. Don Carson : I just have a couple of questions on Ag what was the underlying performance in Ag? You talked about an asset sale and I know you had an asset sale last year and with the headwinds in South America and 3% to 4% declines, can you grow EBITDA in Ag next year with the cost cuts that you are making. Andrew Liveris : Howard? Howard Ungerleider : Yes Don, good morning. So the first question on the operating, underlying operating earnings, so look on average the Ag or Ag business Dow Agro sciences sells between 3 and 5 molecules a year on the crop protection side of the house. This is in line with the strategic intent where if we see products that are on the tail end of their lifecycle we can add significant value from our science and technology platform. So we did sell a couple of molecules in the fourth quarter. They were in the range of $50 million to $75 million of EBITDA contribution, so you need to back that out of the segment, but otherwise that was real productivity that really drove that. You remember we were one of the first if not the first Ag player to do a restructuring and that was part of our announcement earlier in 2015. To your question of whether we can grow EBITDA in 2016 that\u2019s going to be a very tough slog on an operating basis even with productivity considering that, high channel inventories, low crop prices and just lower overall demand. Remember we\u2019re forecasting when we see the market to decline between 3% and 5%. So it\u2019s going to be tough. Our focus is to continue to deliver the innovations, they'll continued to deliver the growth on the crop protection side and the new products on the seed side and continue to drive productivity to outpace the competition and that\u2019s our focus. Operator : And we\u2019ll go to our next question from Jonas Oxgaard with Bernstein. Jonas Oxgaard : Good morning guys. Andrew Liveris : Good morning. Jonas Oxgaard : Good morning. I was also curious about that volume in Performance Plastics because which your cost position I kind of assume that you guys will be selling full out regardless of end market demand so, could you talk to me a little bit through where that volume is coming from, you talk about reliability improvements on end market demand. I\u2019m assuming someone most also be selling ethylene to Olin, now that are a separate company? Andrew Liveris : I think, - it\u2019s a good question I think I you look at our Performance Plastics segment, you also have to bear in mind that we have capacities that are coming there on the elastomers business which is a high value, high margin business which has much more resilience in pricing and also a lot of targeted towards automotive and other consumer goods and high end manufacturing. When you look at plastics business per se, a very large part of it is predominately food and specialty packaging and that business has continued to grow strong around the world. Obviously, we have some plastics to go into the commodity segments and they continue to be strong as well. You\u2019ll see a little bit of sales that are going into ethylene to the Olin deal, but that isn\u2019t going to be material to the numbers that are in front of you. And the other thing you see on the revenue line is revenue looks down pretty dramatically, but when you peel back the byproduct sales of the crackers which are hydrocarbon and energy type of byproducts that have moved with oil more and on a one-to-one relationship, plastics has held up really well based on volume demand in the end markets and we think that that\u2019s going to continue. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from James Sheehan with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. James Sheehan : Thanks, could you talk about the impacts that you see on polyethylene prices for new capacity coming on in 2016? Andrew Liveris : Hi, Jim. Yes, so as I said we ended 2015 with record low inventories and very, very strong sales, record production out of our manufacturing assets and product continuing to shift to higher volumes. In 2016 most of the new capacity that\u2019s talked about is scheduled to come on at the end of 2016 and our view is a lot of that\u2019s going to slide may be into the next year. Also bear in mind that you have a big turnaround season in the Q2 here in the Gulf Coast which we think will have an impact and we have Sadara coming up in the first quarter. So I think net-net, we\u2019re poised to take advantage of that situation and when the new capacity does come in, in the second half we think the market will be geared to absorb it at a 2.5% GDP rate supply and demand is imbalanced for 2016. Operator : And we\u2019ll go to our next question from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Brian Maguire : Hey good morning, it\u2019s Brian Maguire on for Bob. Andrew Liveris : Hi Brian. Brian Maguire : It\u2019s been a while since I got I guess an update on the earnings contribution from Sadara. I\u2019m just wondering with all the changes in feedstocks and product prices and global supply/demand balances if you care to make a guess of what the ultimate earnings contribution from Sadara will be and what you would kind of expect to get to that point? Andrew Liveris : Howard? Howard Ungerleider : Yes, hey Brian. Good morning. So I mean, I mentioned earlier I think in the Q&A that when you look at 2016 specifically on the Performance Plastics side, you\u2019re looking at 50 plus or minus million dollar tailwind because those assets have already started. So we got first product out in December. The mixed feed cracker is going to be coming up and another couple of polyethylene units throughout 2016. But in PMC, performance materials and chemicals, you\u2019re looking at about $100 million, $200 million headwind because they\u2019re in the really steep part of the S-curve as their assets are being built and finalized in 2016, we\u2019ve got some capacity for PMC not coming on until really the back half of the year. We still have a view that our long-term average is $500 million split between equity earnings and the commission structure that we\u2019re going to get as we are marketing the product for Sadara outside of the Middle East zone. That is a long-term average and that is after the whole complex has started up. So that would start to hit those numbers in the post 2018, 2019 timeframe. We still feel really good about the project overall. Operator : And our next question comes from Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Christopher Parkinson : Perfect, thank you very much. In credit it is still in the early stages, but on a preliminary basis what do you believe your largest long-term opportunities are for your Ag business post merging with Pioneer is it more product focused within either chemicals or seed or are there more themes within our specific geographies? And also have you heard any preliminary feedback from your R&D team and/or field associates which you particularly find interesting or incremental from your original analysis? Andrew Liveris : Thank you for that great question. All I can say Chris is that the last several weeks of team discussions have just amplified and magnified the original pre-announcement of the merger work that was done by the teams. We had over 4000 man hours of combination work and the Ag teams, the two Ag teams were on fire in terms of complementarity. I mean the absolute hand in glove combination of what we have now seen Jim and Howard and I have done trip out to the [indiscernible] Johnson and seeing the Pioneer capability up close and personnel, it\u2019s first class. It has incredible technology not just of course in traits delivery mechanisms but it is automated, it is technology rich, it\u2019s got capabilities on the climatic side. And what the Dow Chemistry brings and the Dow traits bring, especially the combination of traits. So we can bring on herbicides and insecticides it is winning hand. As you know we are the next series of traits coming out in the marketplace. So everyone has always said that this is the greatest combination you could put in the sector and everything we\u2019ve seen since the announcement and the work we\u2019ve done has just doubled down and tripled down. We cannot be more excited and Indianapolis and there are signs we were down there and the people they were excited because the property has always been a property we talked about in terms of where its destination might be. It is no secret that Dow never saw itself as the natural owner long-term, but the combination waiting for it to come the way it did was a winning hand and so we will have a lot more to say. You know stemming our holes in the repertoire that we\u2019ll have to address. But I can\u2019t wait till the merger occurs and this company is set up for them to identify how they\u2019re going to grow with this complementarity. Operator : And we have time for one more question, that question will come from PJ Juvekar with Citi. PJ Juvekar : Thank you and good morning. Andrew, in your price declines of 19% overall, how much was FX and how much was local price declines? And then across your product chains where are you seeing some most price declines and where do you think you have pricing power? Thank you. Andrew Liveris : I\u2019ll let Jim take that PJ. James Fitterling : Yes PJ, good question. In the fourth quarter specifically, you know we had a gain over hydrocarbons and energy costs of about $240 million and then we had some currency headwinds which were the local price declines that you talked about, but net we were up $65 million in the quarter and for the year we had gains of $1.1 billion and net out about $800 million of currency or $300 million of margin expansion. So I hope that gives you a rough idea. Howard? Howard Ungerleider : Yes, PJ just to give you some specific data, at the enterprise level local price versus the same quarter last year was down 14%. If you look at that on an EBITDA or an EPS impact it was between, well it was $0.11 roughly on the EPS line and just north of $160 million on the EBITDA line versus same quarter last year in terms of impact on currency. Operator : And that concludes today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Sheorey, at this time I will turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks. Neal Sheorey : Thanks Levi. Andrew, before we close the call would you like to make any final comments? Andrew Liveris : Yes, I think I said it in my opening script, I can't be proud of the Dow team, 2015 was the year that we pivoted to our future. We've demonstrated 13 quarters in a row 9 quarters of earnings beat. We had revenue beat in the quarter. It was an exclamation mark. That's the result Howard and Jim and I working hand in glove with our team. Our business leaders have put in place the enterprise of the future. Yet, if you look at the transformative deals that we put in place for that future, whether it be the Kuwait pivot, whether it be the Chlorine close, whether it be the AgroFresh sale, whether it be of course the Dow Corning restructuring and ultimately the Dow-DuPont merger that created history, great companies, you can't put a quarter like that together or a year like that together unless you have a gun team aligned to shareholder value focused on margins, focused on cost, focused on productivity and growing that top line based on quality share. I'm very proud of Jim and Howard working closely with me. Jim congratulations on your next step here. Howard and Jim and I are very committed to keep delivering for you as shareholders. Just keep watching this space. Our headlines will only be about performance and we can't wait till we get to the merger and then the three spins that we will create. Thank you, Neal. Neal Sheorey : Thank you, Andrew and thank you everyone for your questions. As always we appreciate your interest in the Dow Chemical Company. For your reference a copy of our prepared remarks will be posted on Dow's website later today. This concludes our call for today. We look forward to speaking with you again soon. Thank you.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to Neal Sheorey. Please go ahead, sir. Neal Sheorey : Thank you. Good morning and welcome to the Dow Chemical Company's First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. I'm Neal Sheorey, Vice President of Investor Relations. As usual, we are making this call available to investors and the media via webcast. This call is the property of the Dow Chemical Company.

These filings are available free of charge from the SEC or Dow or DuPont as applicable. I will now turn the call over to Andrew. Andrew N. Liveris: Thank you, Neal, and if we can turn to slide four. Dow's resolute focus on our priorities was once again evident in the first quarter. The Dow team is clearly building momentum as we head toward our historic Dow Corning and DowDuPont transactions. Simply put, our strategy's working, yet again underscoring the power of our differentiation and integration coupled with a focused market participation, driven by our innovation agenda and disciplined productivity mindset. The strength of our businesses and our unique business model was on full display as our integrated value-add specialty businesses and broad geographic footprint enabled us to outperform versus our more narrowly focused competitors despite lower hydrocarbon and crop price environments. I'm very proud of our team's achievements and their relentless focus and action with self-help actions on productivity, variable margin management and targeted growth driving our agenda. We have and will continue to run our businesses to maximize value for our customers, and returns for our shareholders as you can see that in our results : 14 consecutive quarters of earnings growth and EBITDA margin expansion, 10 consecutive quarters of volume growth, the highest production volume quarter in our history and we delivered value for those additional pounds as disciplined margin management enabled the highest EBITDA margin in more than a decade. Importantly, on a trailing 12-month basis, this translated to an expansion in both ROC and EVA. These results have enabled us to increasingly reward our shareholders as we paid our highest regular quarterly dividend in our history of $0.46 per share. I'll now turn the call over to Howard and Jim to cover highlights from the quarter, updates on Dow Corning and DowDuPont and our Plastics outlook. I'll then close the call with our market outlook and strategic priorities. Howard? Howard I. Ungerleider: Thank you, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. Turning to slide six, our results reflected our continued discipline in executing on our financial priorities. Operating EPS increased 6% to $0.89 per share. Volume increased 4%. We saw growth around the world with North America up 6%, Europe, Middle East, Africa and India up 4%, and Asia-Pacific up 3%. This more than offset a decline in Latin America, down 4%. Emerging geographies also continued to grow with India up 13% and Greater China up 5% reflecting continued consumer driven demand. Overall, price was down 12% primarily due to local price declines of which the largest contributor was the hydrocarbons business and ongoing currency headwinds. However, it's important to note that our ongoing margin management more than offset these declines enabling operating EBITDA margin expansion to 21% with some of the strongest gains in our downstream innovation focused businesses in Consumer Solutions and Infrastructure Solutions. Operating EBITDA was $2.3 billion with notable strength in our transportation, infrastructure, and electronic end markets, plus an all-time record in consumer solutions and a first quarter record in Performance Plastics which were more than offset by the impact of lower equity earnings and divestitures. Moving on to our dashboard of key financial metrics on slide seven which reflect our consistent track record of delivering earnings growth, margin expansion and strong cash flow. As a reminder, our financial priorities include delivering 3% above the cost of capital, driving 10% EPS growth over the long-term, maintaining a capital structure that provides financial flexibility and continuing to increasingly reward shareholders. And as you see here, over the last three years we've made steady progress against each one. Now I'll turn to our segment results on slide eight starting with Ag. Agriculture Sciences' operating EBITDA was nearly flat with EBITDA margin up 250 basis points. The result exemplifies our self-help mindset as disciplined productivity essentially offset the impact of challenging market conditions and currency headwinds. We also reached further milestones on our innovation agenda. In the ENLIST program we launched cotton in the U.S., in crop protection the business progressed its investments in support of launches from its product pipeline for novel herbicides such as Arylex and Rinskor and Inatreq fungicide. Looking ahead, we maintain our view that the market will be down 3% to 5% this year as we expect high yields in the Americas, high channel inventories, ongoing currency headwinds and low crop prices. While it may be too early to call the bottom, we are encouraged to see corn and soybean pricing rise from recent lows and long-term, the world continues to need solutions that will drive greater Ag productivity. Turning now to Consumer Solutions on slide nine, this segment achieved an all-time operating EBITDA record, and margin expanded 400 basis points reflecting robust demand for Dow's innovative product portfolios in the automotive and the semiconductor sectors. Dow Automotive Systems achieved volume gains on above market demand for solutions enabling lightweighting and sound dampening performance. The business launched a new BETAMATE solution for structural impact performance as well as technologies for advanced floor protection solutions. In Electronic Materials, despite a decline in demand for applications tied to personal computer components, we benefited from new business wins for semiconductor and display technologies. For Infrastructure Solutions on slide 10, EBITDA was essentially flat despite lower equity earnings and margin expanded 220 basis points. Dow Building and Construction delivered double digit volume growth with increases across all geographic areas on strong demand for our Construction Chemicals portfolio and STYROFOAM insulation. Here too, our innovation is delivering as we saw continued adoption of the FR63 flame retardant technology as well as progress with our INSTA STIK roofing adhesives and our liquid armor flashing and sealants. Energy & Water Solutions continued to be impacted by headwinds in oil and gas exploration. During the quarter, our Water business reached a milestone as its new RO membrane plant in Saudi Arabia sold its first production. This facility is targeted to meet demand of the emerging world for Dow's separation technologies. I'm pleased to report that the site is already delivering our differentiated value-added products and is operating at similar rates and yield as our state-of-the-art operation in Minnesota. Performance Monomers' profitability improved partly due to the business' decision to reduce its merchant sales exposure. And in Dow Coating Materials, the business grew volume due to improvements in industrial and architectural coating sectors, benefiting from a strategy to broaden Dow's participation in these end markets. The business continued to broaden its product portfolio, launching five new vinyl acrylic binders. In equity earnings, Dow Corning Silicone delivered a double-digit earnings increase on strong volume growth. On slide 11, Performance Materials & Chemicals increased volumes in most businesses. Polyurethanes delivered a double-digit volume increase on demand for system house applications and specialty polyols as the business continued to shift its mix into higher-value offerings. Industrial Solutions reported a volume decline, despite strength in the durables markets on weaker de-icer demand due to a milder winter. We also saw a notable decline in our equity earnings in the segment consistent with our modeling guidance from the ramp up of Sadara spending, the change in ownership of MEGlobal, and lower MEG prices. Performance Plastics on slide 12 delivered a record first quarter operating EBITDA with volume gains across all business. Packaging and Specialty Plastics achieved a new record polyethylene sales volume in the quarter driven by operational reliability and robust demand for its differentiated products. The business continued to advance its innovation agenda with new launches in several product families including AGILITY for food packaging, INFUSE for health and hygiene, and INNATE for industrial and consumer packaging. Gains were achieved in most geographic areas led by North America and Asia-Pacific with double digit growth in China. Earnings grew in our Thai JVs on stronger Asian NAFTA chain margins. These results were more than offset by a greater than $100 million headwind in Argentina due to our facility outage and the reduction of import barriers. Elastomers delivered earnings growth on higher demand for its differentiated technologies that enhanced the customer experience in transportation and high performance athletic footwear. And Electrical and Telecommunications achieved double-digit volume growth on demand for infrastructure projects, subsea cable and fiber optics. Turning to our second quarter and full year modeling guidance on slide 13, in the second quarter we do expect a seasonal uptick in infrastructure which lifts our Building and Construction, Coatings and Electrical and Telecommunications businesses. In Performance Plastics we expect year-over-year margin compression in Europe as well as reduced earnings from our position in Latin America. In Ag, we expect the market headwinds to persist. However, with our continued self-help actions we expect the first half of 2016 to be comparable to the same period in 2015 when adjusted for the impact of divestitures. In 2016, we continue to bring on several earnings growth catalysts starting with the PDH contribution which will continue to build throughout the year. The start-up of new units of Sadara will also continue. In fact, the second solution polyethylene train came online this month. Turnarounds and maintenance spending will be higher sequentially in the second quarter by $100 million to $150 million. We expect lower equity earnings to continue as a result of our portfolio actions, and the Sadara unit start-ups. Turnarounds and equity earnings headwinds in the second quarter will primarily impact Performance Materials and Chemicals and that will subside in the back half of the year. The Dow Corning transaction is expected to be a tailwind in the second half of the year and we will benefit from ethane cracking enhancements in Louisiana toward the end of the year. We also see pension expense continuing to provide a tailwind. As we look ahead, we expect our operating tax rate for the remainder of the year to be in the range of 23% to 27%. We expect our reported rate to fall in the 7% to 12% range in the second quarter assuming a successful Dow Corning close. I'll wrap up my comments this morning with an update on the Dow Corning transaction on slide 15. We have made significant progress towards the integration and will hit the ground running immediately following close. In the first quarter, the transaction received a favorable private letter ruling from the IRS and we have made steady progress on the regulatory front with approval from several key jurisdictions including China, Japan and the EU. Joint integration teams composed of Dow and Dow Corning leaders have been working together since the first of the year to set the foundation for a successful integration. With an eye toward our post-close priorities, we have established the business and the organizational structure that will lead Dow Corning in the future. The team is aligned to three areas of focus, delivery of the 2016 plan and the market and technology based growth in our key sectors such as infrastructure, transportation and consumer care, productivity and asset management as well as the seamless integration and realization of our cost synergies. I want to take a moment to talk about cost synergies and the work the team has accomplished to date which you'll see on slide 16. As we said in December, this traction provides Dow an opportunity to own all of the Silicones business and secure enhanced cost and growth synergies that are unique to Dow as the owner. Dow Corning Silicones is a successful and thriving business that Dow helped build over the last 70-plus years. This transaction enhances our market-facing businesses with a high quality silicones franchise and provides a catalyst for growth. It allows Dow to accelerate our narrower and deeper focus in our key value chains including transportation, infrastructure, consumer care and electronics. Because we know the business so well, there is a tremendous value in the synergy capture, and here Dow is uniquely positioned to access quick wins. The $300 million of cost synergies will focus on back office and operational efficiencies and we expect to achieve 100% run rate within 24 months after closing. You see here our latest estimate of how this will develop. We expect to deliver a 65% target run rate within 12 months. The team has now completed their work to validate our cost synergy target and their findings give me great confidence that we will hit our commitment. In total, we still see this transaction adding more than $1 billion in additional EBITDA for Dow on a full year basis post-synergy capture. It will also be accretive to our EPS, operating cash flow and free cash flow in year one. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim. James R. Fitterling: Thank you, Howard. Turning now to slide 17, we continue to make strides toward the close of DowDuPont and the pursuit of the intended separation into three independent publicly traded companies. Here you see our updated timeline. All key deliverables remain on track. A major milestone in the quarter was the filing of the Form S-4 registration statement and just last week we followed up with the first amendment. We continued to expect the S-4 will be made effective in the second quarter. Following that, both Dow and DuPont will set the date for our respective special meetings for shareholders to vote on the merger. The second major milestone in the quarter was our formation of a joint implementation management office or joint IMO which is driving the integration process across the two companies. And the third milestone was both companies jointly engaging McKinsey who has assisted many other companies through large successful integrations. Turning to slide 18; with oversight from the joint executive steering committee, the joint IMO is developing execution ready plans to ensure that we can quickly integrate the merger, capture our anticipated cost and revenue synergies and begin to operate as three independent divisions as soon as possible post-close. The clear objective of the joint IMO which Rick Olson from DuPont and I co-lead is speed of execution, speed to close, speed to capture the synergies and speed to spin. The team is squarely focused on that mission. Soon after forming the joint IMO, we commissioned multiple sub teams focused on the diversity of work streams from governance to stand up and separation activities to sourcing and purchasing. There have already been numerous joint planning meetings between the two companies. Plans are progressing well and we continue to make significant progress to realize the vision for the merger and the subsequent intended spins. One of the key deliverables for this team is an execution-ready playbook to achieve our greater than $3 billion synergy target. In this space we've already done considerable benchmarking to validate our targets. We followed a rigorous process coordinated by McKinsey to provide objectivity and external validation for our assumptions. We compared various financial metrics for the intended spins against best-in-class peers. We did this across businesses and functions. This independent benchmarking yielded a similar answer as the joint working session our companies held prior to announcing the merger. This is just one of the reasons why we feel even more confident in the target and the opportunity in front of us. We're equally excited about our near-term earnings growth drivers which are on slide 20. In March, our PDH plant successfully completed the performance test and achieved full run rates less than two months after start-up. The unit recently went down for planned maintenance and will begin ramping back up next week. We made significant progress on the construction of our Louisiana flexibility project, which is now 95% complete. And in Texas our Texas-9 cracker is 50% complete with more than 80% of the equipment installed. In Saudi Arabia we have started our second polyethylene plant on purchased ethylene and have proven several of the major cracker components. We continue to move forward with the start-up of this impressive site and expect those activities to accelerate as we proceed through the year. And our multiyear productivity push continues to deliver bottom line results. Let's now take a moment to discuss our outlook for the plastics and feedstocks markets starting with polyethylene on slide 21. Some are projecting much looser balances for the second half of the year and into next year. The main point of disagreement that we have with consultant projections is the speed in which new U.S. projects are brought online as well as assumptions about projects in Asia and the Middle East, which we find overly optimistic. If you look at history, you will see that industry supply projections are almost always higher than what is achieved due to project cancellations, construction delays and labor constraints. For example, in 2007, supply projections for 2012 were about six world scale ethylene crackers higher than what became reality. We generally degree on the demand projection in these scenarios which rest on sustainable urbanization in the developing world. Ten years ago, China's per capita use of polyethylene was roughly one-fifth of the United States. Today it's half. And this trend will continue. Our view is highlighted in the chart on the right. If you overlay more realistic assumptions about the ability of the industry to bring new facilities online, we see sustainably high rates of ethylene and polyethylene utilization for the next several years. In this environment, we believe that lasting value creation comes from participating in the entire Plastics value chain as outlined on Slide 22. The dynamics across the chain can shift significantly over time. The long-term winners are the players that own the entire chain integration and can manage the swings through feedstock flexibility, geographic diversification, innovation and differentiation. No one rivals Dow on this front, and our results have shown this time and time again. First, we believe the value of our advantaged feedstock positions will grow. Feedstock flexibility remains one of our signature advantages of Dow's cracker fleet. This combined with our European LPG capabilities and U.S. PDH form structural hedges for the exposure to frac spread pressures. And we continue to see ethane and propane balances as being favorable for some time. We have given our updated outlooks for these in the appendix. Bottom line, our view hasn't changed. We see plenty of NGLs available for the new crackers based on continued growth in gas demand. Second, European and Asia NAFTA cracker margins will continue to reflect tight conditions as underlying demand surpasses realized supply while the U.S. ethylene balance will be somewhat looser. Third, polyethylene over ethylene margins are likely to remain solid as polyethylene capacity additions lag ethylene expansions, especially in the U.S. The key point here is that it's consumer demand that drives the market balance. And finally, the value of Dow's differentiation should grow. We've proven the value of our customer intimacy and our differentiated portfolio time and again. We are the innovator to the packaging, elastomers and electrical and telecommunications industries, and that, coupled with our new capacities in Sadara and the U.S. Gulf Coast, drives growth and advantaged results. I'll now turn the call back over to Andrew. Andrew N. Liveris: Thank you, Jim, and let's turn to slide 24 and our market outlook. In short, we expect to see continued consumer driven demand around much of the world. We see strong demand signals in North America, gradual recovery in Europe and ongoing consumer-led demand growth in China, all of which are driving the need for Dow's unique products, underscoring our innovation, market access and integration, enabling us to deliver value in our selected market sectors. We saw this in the quarter in the performance of our Building and Construction, Elastomers, Automotive and Electronic Materials businesses where our smart sized scale enabled us to produce high margin, technology-rich solutions faster and to commercialize them more quickly in the key sectors these businesses serve and grow faster than smaller-sized competitors. We believe that pockets of volatility will persist including near-term geopolitical and economic uncertainty, most notably in Brazil. Supply surpluses will continue in Agriculture and Energy. This outlook is what we've seen these last many years and we expect slow economic growth and high volatility to continue in the near term. Going forward, we will continue managing what we can control. We've shown we can grow earnings and volume in this environment using a narrower and deeper market focus, targeted innovation, and our exceptional low-cost and integrated position in the value chain. The Dow business model has outperformed its peers in the last several years and despite a mixed market outlook, we believe we can continue to do so. If you turn to slide 25, I'll end the call today by reiterating that we remain squarely aligned around three clear priorities this year. Priority one : deliver our 2016 plan. As the quarter showed, we are delivering and will continue to do so. Priority two : close the Dow Corning transaction. As Howard said, we are ready to implement and have clear targets in place to meet or exceed expectations. And priority three : move swiftly through the key steps of the DowDuPont transaction. As you heard from Jim, we are on track and we continue to see the $3 billion in projected cost synergies as the floor. We are driven by the mantra, speed to close, speed to spin. Our team has clear goals and a resolute focus on achieving them. Our unique combination of differentiation and integration coupled with a focused market participation driven by our innovation agenda is delivering results. Our broad geographic footprint and relentless productivity mindset will serve us well in the face of volatility and regional and market headwinds. The Dow team is building momentum for the integration of the Dow Corning Silicone's business, the creation of DowDuPont, and the ultimate creation of the new materials co to be named Dow, a growth company with a winning portfolio. These once-in-a-generation transactions further bolstered by our near-term growth drivers and our relentless focus on execution will enable new levels of value creation for our customers and generate even greater returns for our shareholders. And with that, Neal, let's turn to Q&A. Neal Sheorey : Thank you, Andrew. Now we will move on to your questions. I ask that you please keep to one question so that we can allow as many people as possible the opportunity to ask a question. First, however, I would like to remind you that my comments regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. Operator, would you please explain the Q&A procedure? Operator : Certainly. We'll take our first question from Hassan Ahmed from Alembic Global. Hassan I. Ahmed: Morning, Andrew. Andrew N. Liveris: Morning. Hassan I. Ahmed: You know, obviously really continued strength within the Performance Plastics side of things. A couple of quick ones on that. You obviously outlined your views on NGLs so if you could just tell us, within those views of NGL pricing, what sort of natural gas and crude oil pricing assumptions do you have? So that's one part of it. And the second part is that in my mind obviously part of the continued strength within Performance Plastics was lower NGL prices but the other part was a rebound in ethylene prices. So could you also tell us who right now is setting the price for ethylene? Is it MTO? Andrew N. Liveris: I'm going give that to Jim. Go ahead, Jim, both of them. James R. Fitterling: Yeah. Hassan, thanks for the question. We believe that gas is really going to be very well supplied over this five-year horizon and I think in most cases, gas remains sub $3. Maybe it runs between $3 and $4 depending on where oil price goes. And our other view is that $50 to $60 barrel oil, the NGL supply is going to expand significantly in the U.S. Gulf Coast region. So when you combine that with the fact that the crackers' completion schedule and their RTO horizon is stretching out and that spreads that NGL demand intensity out and that's reflected in what we put in the appendix. Ethane export starts up this year but that growth is slow. And propane competition right now is acting as a ceiling for the prices at the cracker level. In fact, it's back into the site. And if you look at first quarter, ethane and propane were kind of at an even tradeoff in the cracker slate. So we think the outlook for NGLs for all these projects is going be just fine and then we'll continue to have a favorable balance there. And you'll see that in the oil and gas ratios as well. As far as ethylene, ethylene moved up $0.05 in March. And I think a little bit of that is some bounce-back in volume demand. As you could see from our own results, volume growth is good there. And you also see some impacts of different outages around the world. Some planned, some unplanned. Look, I'm not a believer yet in this whole theory that MTO is setting the pricing out there. I think demand is setting the pricing. MTO may be a factor in some commodity grades of ethylene, polyethylene in China but for most of the marketplace, I think you've also got a very, very competitive U.S. Gulf Coast situation that's helped setting that price. Hassan I. Ahmed: Extremely helpful. Thank you so much. Operator : Moving on, we'll take our next question from Steve Byrne, Bank of America. Steve Byrne : Hi. In your Ag business, what specifically are you doing to cut costs? And if the merger with DuPont closes, say, at the end of the calendar year, is that too late to negotiate with retailers on the combined platform of crop chemicals to negotiate a combined rebate program and/or to incent growers to buy both chemicals and seeds? Andrew N. Liveris: Go ahead, Howard. Howard I. Ungerleider: Yeah. Good morning, Steve. I mean, look, if you look at the Ag results for Dow AgroSciences this quarter, I'm really proud of Tim Hassinger and the whole team. On a down 10% top line, they were able to keep EBITDA flat. Actually if you exclude the divestitures, it was actually up a couple of percentage points. So they did just a tremendous job and the focus and the execution was evident. It was really around productivity. If you remember, we were one of the first in the Ag space to really declare that the Ag market was starting to slow down. And so they got ahead of it with footprint rationalizations and lower SG&A and lower R&D in a focused way. So that was one of the big differentiators in results this quarter. On your last question relative to Dow-DuPont, look, I mean, as you heard from Jim in the prepared remarks, we're on track with the closing before the end of the year. So we really have to get to 2017 before we can have those kinds of discussions. But the teams are actively working on synergies to make sure that we continue to get the cost efficiencies across all three of the intended spins. Andrew N. Liveris: Yeah. But just to add to that last point, Howard, it's fair to say just to underline, we are separate companies, we're operating separately. We will not have any of those conversations and then when we get to day one, there'll be an opportunity and hopefully as I think stated by Jim, that's back half of this year for 2017. Operator : Moving on, we'll take our next question from Duffy Fischer from Barclays. Duffy Fischer : Yes. Good morning, fellows. First question is just around the cost programs. What was running through this quarter cumulatively and how should that step up throughout the year? Andrew N. Liveris: Yeah. I think I'd like Jim to have a shot at that and, Howard, you can add if you wish. James R. Fitterling: Duffy, we had in-flight programs that we started last year. Some of them were related to making sure that we had stranded costs out as we did the chlorine divestiture so some of that is rolling through. And we've essentially got those stranded costs out from the chlorine deal. Additionally, we have some other activities that are going on from productivity that also hit in things like cost of goods sold. So you'll see that show up in the EBITDA margins, things that we're doing on efficiencies there, both in manufacturing, supply chain, some IT cost improvements. A couple years ago, we finished the implementation of a new IT infrastructure and we're starting to see some productivity come out of that. And then each of the businesses has individual targets and each of the functions have individual targets which will keep rolling out. We have a $300 million target for in-flight savings for 2016 and we banked $90 million of it in the first quarter. So we're on track to deliver that target and more. Andrew N. Liveris: Thanks, Duffy. Operator : Moving on, we'll take next question from Vincent Andrews, Morgan Stanley. Vincent Stephen Andrews : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Just a question on your volume and your operating rate. I've been under the impression that in 4Q you obviously had a big quarter there. I thought that inventory levels in general were pretty low coming into 1Q. Then you obviously were able to run all the assets harder to put up the volume growth. Where are we in terms of your inventory levels as we head into 2Q and your ability to run harder? I'm just trying to think about how we should be thinking about volume sequentially from here. Andrew N. Liveris: Jim, go ahead. James R. Fitterling: Yeah. Vince, this is Jim. We had really a strong first quarter, obviously strong volume sales and also good inventory performance. I would say right now inventories in most of these chains are very balanced. I'll use Plastics as an example where I can give you some specific data. We had 37 days, the industry had 37 days of inventory in North America going into the big turnaround season here. And that is really a tight inventory position. And we obviously are at that level, slightly below that as we head in. And operating rates have been very high. So I don't think in any of these businesses you're going to see the units in inventory be very high. You have some working capital impacts from the changes on accounts receivable and payable because of what's happened with the revenue line. But on a units basis, things remain balanced and relatively low for this time in the year. We have turnarounds coming up in Q2. But we're going to be coming out of those with tight inventories and the ability to still run hard. Vincent Stephen Andrews : Okay. Thank you very much. Andrew N. Liveris: Thank you. Operator : Moving on, we'll take our next question Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan. Jeffrey J. Zekauskas: Hi. Good morning. Andrew N. Liveris: Hi, Jeff. Jeffrey J. Zekauskas: I would have thought that you would have earned a lot more in Performance Plastics and Performance Materials this quarter, in that European ethylene margin or European petrochemical margins were much stronger in the first quarter than they were in the fourth quarter. And U.S. ethylene margins really weren't all that different because of falling raw material costs. Your big competitor reported flat to up sequential petrochemical results and yours are down 15% or 20% sequentially. Did something happen? Or what accounts for the sequential quarter change that you're experiencing that some of your competitors didn't experience? Andrew N. Liveris: Go ahead, Jim. James R. Fitterling: Thanks, Jeff. I'll talk about our performance and then we'll talk about the peers next. First on Plastics, I think one of the things that is not evident just at the high level on the numbers is we had about a $100 million headwind from Latin America. And it was a combination of currencies and obviously the changes that happened in Argentina as they removed duties and opened up. So people won't see that in terms of the high level numbers. In Europe we saw strong business in Europe just as you mentioned and I don't think our view there is any different than our peers. When you look at Performance Materials & Chemicals, I'd say that delta is 50/50. And if you look at polyurethanes in Performance Materials & Chemicals, they're carrying the burden this year of the higher start-up cost of Sadara. So you have to, on a run-rate basis, you have to think about where they will be next year. And they've also got some commodity price pressures in some parts of the chain, mostly in isocyanates right now. And then in Industrial Solution, Howard mentioned that we actually, with the stepdown on MEGlobal and also the slower MEG prices, that hits Industrial Solutions earnings. So if you look about at Industrial Solutions, how they did year-over-year, that's carrying that stepdown in MEGlobal and MEG prices. And also a de-icing season that was 50% lighter than it was last year, and the weight of oil and gas sector. Some of the EO derivatives go into the oil and gas sector and they're carrying that. So I think that explains really most of our own performance. On peer comparisons you have to adjust for one times and portfolio differences, so divestiture sales and then the portfolio difference. Some of our peers are heavy into polypropylene and, of course, we don't play in that space. When you take those things out and put it on an apples-to-apples basis I think you'll see that it's a slight beat there. Andrew N. Liveris: And we could help you on follow-up on specific comparison to the competitor you referenced. But we're quite comfortable that we are at or better than their performance. Operator : Moving on, we'll take our next question from Frank Mitsch from Wells Fargo. Frank J. Mitsch: Hey. Good morning, gentlemen. And Andrew, nice job on the quarter and perhaps even nicer job delegating questions this morning. You're keeping Jim and Howard on their toes. Andrew N. Liveris: Frank, it's a new mode for me and I appreciate you noticing it. Frank J. Mitsch: Yes. Yes. Hey, as I think about the quarter and actually the recent quarters, the volumes have absolutely been eye popping. I'm wondering to what extent \u2013 Brent is up \u2013 well actually it's about \u2013 Brent today is about 35% or so higher than when the last time you guys reported a quarter. I'm wondering to what extent some of the volume is that. And I'm wondering to what extent, if we see Brent stabilize here, maybe we see volumes start to moderate. Could you offer some comments on that? Andrew N. Liveris: I'll start seeing you said I haven't answered a question yet. I'll start and I'll let Jim or Howard pile on. Look, just being in both Europe and Asia, specifically Japan and China, I would tell you the low oil price phenomena is seeping through to the consumer economy in both places, actually, as oil importers. And that's been a sustained trend now for several quarters. You're seeing consumption increase. And then double down on our products that we supply, some of the very specialty products that we have downstream. These are the products that the Chinas and the Europes need, whether it be lightweight materials for cars or whether it be building insulation for energy-efficient buildings. On and on, our innovation agenda is working in those economies. So we're seeing sustainable volumes because we can actually sell out asset and sell up asset. It's that combination, Jim had it on slide, I think 22, that shows that we can make money at different parts of \u2013 in his particular case, he referenced the Plastics business. So we think that's detaching itself from that oil number quite substantially. In fact, Frank, if you've seen our 14 quarters in a row and 10 quarters in a row of volume increase, if you see how that volume increase is made up, it's mix and it's mix under \u2013 if you look at the extremes of oil price, we've had oil price as high as $120 in that four-year period, and oil price as low as in the high $20s in that same period. Yet we've grown volume through sustained execution of products people need. So it's not an inventory readjustment that you're noticing in our results. Jim, did you want to pile on? James R. Fitterling: Yeah. The other thing I would say, Frank, Andrew mentioned China. We had probably 70% of our businesses where we were double-digit growth in volume in China this quarter. Packaging, polyurethanes, Industrial Solution, elastomers, electrical and telecom, auto coatings, Building & Construction all right down the line. And it's all strong consumer-driven demand. You've got an economy that's changing there and we play in all of those spaces. The second thing I would say is around the world, Auto has continued to be strong. And in all these portfolios, you've got an increasing number of new products that are driving innovation. You see that show up in the EBITDA margin line. So it's not just volume of old, existing products. It's volume of brand new products and innovation advantaged products, whether it's in Automotive with adhesives, some of the things we talked about in Building & Construction, new olefin block copolymers and elastomers into Asia which was just a blockbuster quarter for them in Asia-Pacific. You've got a lot of strength. It's not just one particular thing. Operator : Moving on, we'll take our next question from John Roberts, UBS. John Roberts : Thanks. Nice quarter, guys. Howard, I was a little confused about the second quarter tax guidance. So that's 7% to 12% tax rate that you say is reported. Will there be an operating rate that'll be in the 23% to 27% range? Will it be given some differences or does the second quarter actually have a low operating rate too? Howard I. Ungerleider: Yeah, John. Good morning. No. To be clear, the operating tax rate guidance we expect in the second quarter and really through the balance of the year, the operating rate should be in the 23% to 27% range. I just wanted to highlight, because we do expect to close the Dow Corning transaction in the second quarter and assuming that happens, the reported rate is going be likely in the 7% to 12% range driven by the balance sheet gain that we'll get on the step, just on the purchase accounting side of the equation. I just wanted to flag that so you weren't surprised. John Roberts : And then, Jim, I think you said polyethylene expansions are expected to lag ethylene expansions in the U.S. Where does the excess ethylene go if the polyethylene expansions lag the ethylene expansions? James R. Fitterling: Well that's a good question, John. I think right now in the short term with some of the unplanned events that are happening you're seeing some of it go into EDC and BCM so you're probably seeing a little higher run rates in those industries. The volume is still good on EG. There's not a lot of EG in the Gulf but the volume is still good there. The other thing is you're seeing exports move up out of the U.S. because of the cost competitiveness. The U.S. is exporting more polyethylene so you're seeing more of that product move. John Roberts : Okay, thank you. Operator : Moving on, we'll take our next question from Peter Butler, Glen Hill Investments. Peter E. Butler: Good morning. Good morning. Unknown Speaker : Good morning. Andrew N. Liveris: Morning. Peter E. Butler: Obviously there's been a lot of volatility in currency and energy markets of late. Is Dow gearing up and getting more aggressive in trading? Do you see opportunities here to make some decent money? Andrew N. Liveris: Howard, talk about our forex hedging and (44:23) hedging. Howard I. Ungerleider: Yeah. Well, what I would say is, I mean, look, we're still \u2013 as I said in the opening comments, I mean, currency is still a net headwind for us although it's been a declining headwind. So in the quarter we had about a $0.04 EPS headwind on currency, about $60 million in EBITDA. In terms of our treasury group, I mean, Peter, you know they do an exceptional job. We do not speculate on currency. We do hedge our economic exposure and that work has been going on and will continue to go on. Andrew N. Liveris: Jim, did you want to comment on the energy headwind? James R. Fitterling: Yeah. I'd say, Peter, in our model obviously the biggest hedge that we have in here is a physical hedge. And so we manage that very, very actively and take advantage of the seasonality that's out there in the marketplace. And we can do that because of our storage and we can do that because of the access that we have to the market. Nobody's got the flexibility or the kind of access we have to all the NGLs, naphtha oil. So that helps us a lot. But as far as speculation, it's to Howard's point as well, we're very careful about how we manage that. Operator : Moving on, we'll take our next question from Aleksey Yefremov from Nomura Securities. Aleksey Yefremov : Good morning. Thank you. Andrew N. Liveris: Hey. Aleksey Yefremov : If you look at Sadara, do you expect sequential improvement in equity contribution within Plastics as polyethylene units start up? And is it fair to say that most of your year-over-year headwind in equity earnings is concentrated in Materials and Chemicals? Andrew N. Liveris: Jim, take the first slice of that. James R. Fitterling: Yeah. So right now the commissioning is going well and we're underway with the mixed-feed cracker. The key point will be when that mixed-feed cracker starts up. So once we get the mixed-feed cracker running and we can communicate to you that it's up and running, we've got those two polyethylene plants proven. At that point, you should start to see some of that show up into the Performance Plastics business. Obviously, the start-up costs on Performance Materials and Chemicals, primarily in the polyurethanes business, are going to continue through the year because those units don't start up until later in the year. So it's kind of a mixed bag there. And I would expect you won't see most of it until probably second half. Howard I. Ungerleider: Yeah. And not much to add. I mean, we gave the down $50 million to $100 million headwind year-on-year for the second quarter if you look at it versus same quarter a year ago. And clearly the tailwind, it will come in Plastics in the back half of the year to Jim's point. But PMC is going to be a headwind for us all year. They're in the big part of the build from a unit op standpoint in Performance Materials and Chemicals. Aleksey Yefremov : And Jim... Operator : Moving on, we'll take our next question from Christopher Parkinson from Credit Suisse. Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker) Perfect. Thank you very much. I'm just going to be boring and switch back to Ag from Plastics. You mentioned the Ag sector should be down roughly 3% to 5% year-on-year, but could you just offer a little more guidance given your cautious view in Brazil and Southeast Asia due to political challenges and weather? And then also the South American market and North America. And then also very quickly on your comment on Argentina, regarding your herbicide portfolio do you have the necessary registrations to benefit from improvements there? Thank you. Andrew N. Liveris: Go ahead, Howard. Howard I. Ungerleider: Yeah. Thanks, Chris. I mean I would say, look, first you got to look at Ag as a first half. So first quarter, second quarter and so that's where I said in the prepared comments that on balance, it's going be essentially flat ex-M&A, first half versus first half a year ago. I will say, and I'd hesitate to call the bottom but you certainly see crop prices have moved up. We are moving from an El Nino weather pattern to a potential La Nina weather pattern and that could be helpful into 2017. I would say in Latin America, there is a greater optimism today. We see upside in the second half in Latin America. If inflation doesn't ramp up further, things should improve gradually. Andrew N. Liveris: Want to comment on Argentina? Howard I. Ungerleider: Yeah. I mean, I think we are very well positioned on the crop protection side in Argentina. Andrew N. Liveris: And the registration's not an issue at all? Howard I. Ungerleider: No. Andrew N. Liveris: Okay. Operator : Moving on, we'll take our next question from P.J. Juvekar from Citi. P.J. Juvekar: Yes. Hi. Good morning. Jim, I want to go back to your ethane and propane comments. Propane exports are going up significantly and ethane demand could go up with the new crackers and Enterprise Products building the export terminal. So are you expecting more drilling activity to get to your outlook of a long ethane propane? And then given that, what is your new expectations for EBITDA from your PDH and the new ethylene plant? Thank you. James R. Fitterling: Well there's demand \u2013 thanks, P.J. There's demand obviously for natural gas. And as that natural gas demand increases and you start to see frac spreads come back, so your point on exports, you're starting to see some improvements in the frac spreads. As you start to see those come back, although we think they're going remain subdued. Maybe frac spreads will be $1, $1.50 a million BTU. That's enough incentive for people to take more out of the gas and you're going start to see some NGLs become more available there. And then the other factor is oil price. And our view is oil is going to $50 to $60. Currently that's obviously, I think the way the market, financial market is headed, but and they're usually ahead of when the supply demand balances. And our view is the back half of this year that supply demand is going to balance. Q1 output in the U.S. was down 200,000 barrels a day quarter-over-quarter. I think the back half you're going to see that tighten up a little bit more and then into 2017. So those two factors I think, from our view, are going to continue to drive the availability of those NGLs. Operator : Moving on, we'll take our next question from Bob Koort from Goldman Sachs. Ryan Berney : Good morning. This is Ryan Berney on for Bob. I just wanted to ask a question here on the polyethylene operating curve that you provided on slide 21. I think you said earlier that you expect kind of polyethylene units to lag the ethylene, especially in the U.S. But here it looks like you have kind of your polyethylene rate dipping ahead of when that capacity is probably going to come online in 2017 and 2018. So I'm kind of wondering if you could bridge there whether that's just a kind of pickup in demand expectations or really how you think about that. James R. Fitterling: Yeah. In general, on polyethylene capacity and supply demand, one of the things you have to bear in mind with these numbers is there's a wide range of interpretation on them. In these assets you make a mix of products and they can swing those operating rates 2% or 3% pretty easily. So a flat line like you see there in 2016, 2017, 2018 at any given point in time could be moving up. Our point is that you don't see any big dip downward in polyethylene operating rates coming in front of us. And even we, right now, have been running well above those operating rates for a considerable period of time to generate the kind of volume growth that we've been generating. I could, in fact, use two new trains coming up in Sadara to feed the commercial organization because they're screaming for more product. Ryan Berney : Great. That's helpful. And then second... Operator : Moving on, we'll take our next question from Don Carson, Susquehanna Financial Group. Emily Wagner : Good morning. This is Emily Wagner on for Don. I was wondering if you could just talk about the organic growth outlook for Dow Corning businesses in the second half excluding synergies. Andrew N. Liveris: Go ahead, Howard. Howard I. Ungerleider: Yeah. The \u2013 thanks. Good morning. So Dow Corning in the first quarter, the Silicones business had 8% volume growth versus same quarter a year ago. I would expect that to moderate a little bit, but certainly it historically has been around one to two times GEP (52:57) so if you want to take 1.5 times global GEP (53:00) that's probably a good proxy from a modeling guidance standpoint. Operator : Moving on, we'll take our next question from Arun Viswanathan, RBC Capital Markets. Arun Viswanathan : Great. Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in. Just had a question to go back on Plastics. If we take out the $100 million that you called out on Argentina, is that appropriate? And does that mean that given the recent price increases in polyethylene, that your Q2 results would be significantly above what you did in Q1? Thanks. Howard I. Ungerleider: You know, I don't know what kind of guidance to give you on Q2, but on pricing, we saw pricing take hold in April and we see it continuing through. We see demand continuing to be strong. Obviously, all the downstream markets' demand is good. You're into a turnaround season where you have twice as much capacity offline this year as you did last year and you had fairly high operating rates for the industry. So I think all that bodes well going into Q2. Hard for me to give you an exact number on what the upside would be but you've got good underlying demand. Operator : And at this time we have time for one further question. That'll come from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. David I. Begleiter: Thank you. Good morning. Andrew and Jim, in terms of Europe, if Brent goes back to $50 or $60 what happens to its elevated level of European profitability in ethylene and polyethylene? Does it get pressured a little bit here at higher oil prices? Andrew N. Liveris: Go ahead, Jim. Reference the industry and also our special way of handling that. James R. Fitterling: Well, I think in general in the industry, we've seen some improvements in naphtha ethylene spreads which has been positive both for Europe as well as for Asia-Pacific and so those have held up. Obviously, Europe over the last several years has moved into a little bit of a different position, a little bit more balanced. You haven't seen much new cracker capacity come back. You've seen a little bit come back to support Shell. Obviously, Porto Marghera came back up to support Shell. The other thing is the shift towards LPG cracking on our side. We've shifted to a very high percent of LPG cracking and we continue to look at opportunities to make small incremental investments to expand that. And that flexibility has helped us out tremendously. So I don't see that's going to stop. So I think Europe has got a pretty good handle, the Dow in particular, but in general in the industry has got a pretty good handle on how it's adjusting itself to a changing world. Operator : And at this time I'd like to turn the conference back over to Neal Sheorey for any closing remarks. Neal Sheorey : All right, thank you. Andrew, before we close the call would you like to make any final comments? Andrew N. Liveris: Yeah. I want to hit on five key points that we made throughout all the question-and-answer session as well as the script. We're off to a strong start to the year which is continuing the three-and-a-half-year streak of earnings growth, managing all sorts of environments. That's coming because we firstly have targeted growth and the portfolio is built for this environment. The diversification works. And frankly we're finding growth where growth is and we're seeing great numbers coming out of our various regions. Then use markets whether it be China here in the U.S. or even Europe. We're benefiting from strong margin management and a strong focus on ROC. And that's the next point I want to make. The U.S. and Chinese markets are strong markets and we have strong outlooks there. We can continue to grow margin in those markets under these environments because we do have the product mix and that last question on Europe means we have the feedstock flex to keep making margins in a recovering Europe. U.S., Europe and China being strong for us is something we've now seen for a while and it's continuing to build momentum. And then the two transactions. Both Howard and Jim outlined it, the questions we were asking on the transactions. We are moving towards these transactions becoming a reality and we're planning very strongly to execute the synergies and execute them and lean into them and execute them quickly. And execute them so in the case of the DowDuPont transaction we moved to spins as fast as we can, in the case of the Dow Corning transaction so that we integrate. Howard's numbers of $300 million of cost synergies and $100 million of growth, just to remind you is about 8% of revenue. We did double digit percentage of revenues on synergies on both Carbide and Rohm and Haas. So we have a strong record of executing the synergy targets that we will talk about. We'll have a lot more to say about DowDuPont and the specifics on that in ensuing calls as we build towards the S-4 registration and of course the shareholder meetings on both sides. Both Ed and I are very dedicated to delivering the three-in-one, $3 billion of cost, $1 billion of growth as a floor. So with that, Neal, I'll turn it back to you. Neal Sheorey : Thank you, Andrew. And thank you, everyone, for your questions. As always, we appreciate your interest in the Dow Chemical Company. For your reference, a copy of our prepared remarks will be posted on Dow's website later today. This concludes our call for today. We look forward to speaking with you again soon. Operator : And again that will conclude today's conference. We thank everyone for their participation.",

If you turn to slide three - and good morning, everyone. Let me open the review of the quarter by stepping back and just looking at our three simple and very focused goals of the year. First one, achieve our plans. Second one, close Dow Corning by midyear. And third, drive the merger milestones with DuPont for a year-end close. Simple, clear and focused. Let's start with the plan. Dow's relentless and disciplined execution once again delivered another quarter of operating earnings growth and margin expansion, and the Dow team has again done it through a variety of challenging geopolitical and market conditions, and outpacing our peers in the process. You can see that in our results. 15 consecutive quarters of earnings growth and margin expansion. 11 consecutive quarters of volume growth. Notably, we delivered gains in all geographies, with particular strength in the United States, China and Europe. Cash flow from operations of $2.2 billion, up nearly 60% versus the year-ago period. We are focused on every aspect of the P&L and balance sheet to deliver these numbers, with weekly operations meetings and very strong self-help actions. Our unique combination of world class innovation, diversified integration, and a narrower and deeper market focus enabled operating earnings growth in every business in our Consumer Solutions and Infrastructure Solutions segments, while the strength of our Plastics franchise was again on display. We have built Dow's portfolio to grow both the top and bottom line, even though market and economic conditions remain challenging. In those markets that are challenged, we have been implementing proactive and targeted self-help measures. You can see this in our Ag segment, where our actions have generated earnings year to date that have outperformed the industry downturn. Another example is our recent restructuring announcement related to the Dow Corning transaction, which will reduce head count by an additional 700 positions on top of the Dow Corning synergies, to a total of 2500, and accelerate earnings growth under these volatile market conditions. Howard will review our results in more granularity in a moment, but the income and cash flow results are truly noteworthy. Our second goal is indeed to close Dow Corning and its ownership restructuring, where we bring in a new element for growth and powerful technology platform that will further drive Dow's focus in an attractive targeted market segments, as well as enhance the earnings power of the new Dow. Soon after closing, we also increased our cost synergy target by $100 million, to $400 million. When combined with the estimated $100 million of growth synergies, we see a total of $500 million of synergies from this transaction. We achieved this goal ahead of schedule on June 1, and I'm happy to report that the integration has proceeded seamlessly. And on our third goal, we recently received overwhelming approval for the historic DowDuPont transaction from our shareholders, illustrating the market's recognition of this unique opportunity to deliver value to all stakeholders as we drive the intended separation into three independent leading science-based companies that will redefine their respective industries. Simply put, the Dow team is sharply focused on driving our three goals, and this quarter's report shows the results of this effort. I'll now turn the call over to Howard to cover highlights from the quarter and an update on Dow Corning. Jim will then give an update on our Plastics franchise and DowDuPont. And I'll close with our outlook and earnings growth drivers. Howard? Howard Ungerleider : Thanks, Andrew. Good morning, everyone. On slide 5, Dow's financial performance had several noteworthy highlights in the second quarter. The team delivered operating EPS of $0.95 a share, despite the slow growth, uncertain macroeconomic environment. The Dow team found pockets of growth in all of our major geographies, and we kept our focus on driving further productivity gains, adding another $90 million of savings in the quarter. Bringing our first half savings to $180 million, tracking well above our 2016 target of $300 million. Our innovative products and solutions are also winning in the marketplace. Many of our businesses highlighted market share gains and new business wins, as evidenced by our continued volume and margin growth in the quarter. Our overall operating EBITDA margin rose more than 160 basis points to 21%, our highest second quarter margin in a decade, led by gains in Consumer and Infrastructure Solutions and Performance Plastics. We also achieved multiple records in the quarter, including EBITDA records in Consumer Solutions, Infrastructure Solutions, and Performance Plastics, and a sales volume record in Performance Plastics, all of which helped the team deliver an $800 million increase in cash flow from operations in the quarter. Taking a longer view, the progress we've made over the past 4 years has enabled us to significantly grow EPS above our target of 10% annual growth, to continue to increase free cash flow generation while fueling our future growth through targeted investments and, at the same time, return $14 billion to our shareholders through share buybacks and paid dividends. Now, turning to our segment results on slide six, let's start with Ag. We're delivering despite high industry crop protection inventories, currency headwinds, and low crop commodity prices. Our Ag team continues to respond with targeted self-help actions that have largely offset the headwinds while maintaining the long-term growth potential of our franchise. In the second quarter, we achieved double-digit sales growth in corn seeds, but that was more than offset by soft demand in sunflower and soybeans. Crop protection volume was lower, primarily due to reduced generic herbicide demand and the impact of the AgroFresh divestiture. For the year, we see the market declining 5% on robust yields in North America, high inventories, and low crop prices. In the second half of 2016, crop protection volume is expected to be flat, with modest pricing pressure due to lower demand for insecticides and generic herbicides. And we expect some positives in seeds as the Latin America season outlook improves. On slide seven, Consumer Solutions continues to deliver impressive results, achieving record EBITDA of $341 million. Earnings increased in all businesses on market share gains, new business wins, and robust demand for our innovative products. Dow automotive achieved record second quarter EBITDA and double-digit volume growth, driven by strong demand for light-weighting and sound-dampening technologies and benefited from greater productions of SUVs and trucks, which contain more Dow content. Consumer Care recorded higher earnings, led by double digit volume growth in personal care applications, solid demand in home care sectors and market share gains. Dow Electronic Materials delivered double digit EBITDA growth on share gains in the semiconductor and display end markets. And our newly integrated Consumer Solutions Silicones business captured greater market share on strong demand in the consumer care sector, notably in Europe and Asia Pacific. On slide 8, Infrastructure Solutions also reported EBITDA growth in every business. Dow Building and Construction delivered a record quarterly EBITDA and saw volume growth in most geographies on strong demand for its construction chemicals, spray foam insulation, and continued adoption of our BLUEDGE technology. In Energy and Water Solutions, self-help actions mitigated persistent energy headwinds, as oil and gas exploration project demand remains low. Water fundamentals, however, remain robust. Our new Saudi RO membrane plant is at full rates, positioning us well to meet demand in emerging geographies. We also saw improvement in Performance Monomers, reflecting our aggressive self-help measures including our purposeful reduction in merchant sales exposure. Dow Coating Materials grew volume in all sectors and our new vinyl acrylic binders are enabling share gains and diversification into value add applications. Finally, our new Infrastructure Solutions Silicones business saw strong demand in the construction sector, enabling higher first half EBITDA. On slide 9, Performance Materials & Chemicals had several moving parts in the quarter. Equity earnings were over $100 million lower, consistent with our modeling guidance, due to the change in ownership of MEGlobal coupled with lower MEG prices and Sadara startup costs. When you take into account these two items, the core polyurethanes business performed well, as it continued to increasingly tilt toward its higher value specialty portfolio. The business delivered double digit volume growth in its systems houses on strong consumer demand, particularly in Asia Pacific, enabled by our new polyols plant in Thailand. This benefit, however, was offset by margin compression in the upstream portion of the business, where supply balances have loosened and turnaround and maintenance costs were higher due to a planned outage in Europe and a short unplanned outage in Brazil. In Industrial Solutions, putting the impacts on equity earnings to one side, our core business delivered flat earnings as disciplined self-help actions offset challenging industrial end market conditions. Turning to Performance Plastics on slide 10, reported record second quarter EBITDA with volume gains across most businesses and all geographies. Packaging and Specialty Plastics achieved several second quarter records, including EBITDA and sales volume, enabled by operational excellence, reflecting an aligned team focused on manufacturing reliability and producing incremental volume in a robust demand environment. Additionally, the business recovered margin in Latin America on demand growth. Dow Elastomers volume increases from strong demand for its innovative technologies in automotive, hot melt adhesives and athletic footwear were balanced by the impact to production from higher turnaround activity in the quarter. Dow Electrical and Telecommunications delivered volume growth across all geographies, led by double digit gains in the Americas on continued demand for fiber optic, coax, and jacketing solutions. Turning now to slide 12, as Andrew stated, our teams successfully closed the ownership restructuring of Dow Corning in June. As we worked together more closely with the Dow Corning team, we discovered even more opportunities to streamline, giving us the confidence to increase our cost synergy target by $100 million to $400 million with 1800 role reductions directly related to Dow Corning. We expect to achieve a 70% run rate within 12 months of closing and the full cost synergy run rate within 24 months. The gross synergies of $100 million will be captured within 36 months. This transaction will unlock significant value for Dow shareholders and it is expected to be accretive to our EPS, operating cash flow, and free cash flow in year one. And at full synergy run rate, it is expected to add greater than $1 billion of EBITDA to our bottom line. Finally, in order to leave ample time for Q&A at the end of the call, we have included our usual model and guidance slide in the appendix of the deck. I'll now turn it over to Jim. James Fitterling : Thank you, Howard. I'll start with the most important growth lever, our Plastics franchise. The dynamics across the polyethylene chain can shift significantly over time and it's critical to remain agile and adaptive with this industry. The long-term winners are the players that own the entire chain integration and can manage the swings through feedstock flexibility, diversification and differentiation, and global reach. And our results have shown that Dow does this exceptionally well time and time again, maximizing our returns while reducing our long term earnings volatility. As value in the chain shifts over time, our direct customer intimacy, innovation in application development and technical support differentiate our earnings unlike all of our competitors. On slide 15, I'll go through our polyethylene view. Consistent with the view that we've held since the beginning of the year, we see polyethylene balances remaining stable over the next few years. Demand growth continues globally as consumers expect the higher food safety standards, better sustainability of plastic packaging relative to the alternatives, and improvements in packaging functionality and convenience that polyethylene provides. On the ethylene supply side, our view takes into account that the leading industry consultants forecast capacity additions that overstate what actually gets built. We saw this play out just a few years ago. And we think that incremental delays and project postponements will happen once again. In fact, we've already seen evidence of this. We believe that both ethylene and polyethylene rates will remain high globally, and we continue to expect higher operating rates in polyethylene than in ethylene. And, as we've seen this year, there may be some regional differences. Earlier this year, some called for very weak conditions in the second half of the year. We did not hold that view. And today margins remain firm globally and inventories are below average. I will state once again that we see continuing good conditions with expected seasonality over the next few years. In this environment, the Sadara additions will position us well to capture growth where growth exists. The 26 units at this world scale facility, the largest of its kind ever built in a single phase, continue to come online. We're in a ramp in start-up activity right now. We have qualified 25 polyethylene products to date and have shipped polyethylene from the first two trains to nearly 100 customers in more than 25 countries. The multi feed cracker is now in the early phases of start-up and we expect commercial operation in the third quarter. All construction at the Sadara site should be complete by year end, with commissioning thereafter. We are happy with the progress made to date and will continue to provide updates as we get closer to year end. I'll give my comments with DowDuPont on slide 16. We continue to make significant progress on the transaction and the pursuit of the intended separation into three independent publicly traded companies. All key deliverables remain on track and just last week both companies received overwhelming support from our respective shareholders to approve the merger. We continue to focus on preparations for day one, developing the financials for the intended spends and also driving the regulatory approval process. As I've said before, the vast majority of Dow people are focused on day-to-day business results and our teams are doing a great job of making sure these transactions do not take away from our sharp focus to deliver the 2016 financial plan. With that, I'll turn it back to Andrew for our outlook and earnings drivers. Andrew Liveris : Yeah, thank you, Jim. If you turn to slide 18, our earnings growth drivers are very visible to us, clearly definable, and will be appearing in our bottom line results over these next few years. Just to remind you, from 2012 to 2015, Dow has delivered an EPS growth CAGR of 22% per year based on an intervention mindset on productivity and portfolio management. Aggressive self-help actions, if you like. During this time, our R&D innovation agenda delivered new products and technologies and upgrading our margin from 13% to 20% in this same period and growing core volumes on average 2% per year. As you can see from this quarter's results, we are at a $10 billion EBITDA run rate. Building from 2015's results and adding our specific actions, interventions and projects we grow the new Dow's EBITDA post intended spin to greater than $15 billion of EBITDA and 25% EBITDA margin. You can see here what we count. Productivity pre-merger, the U.S. Gulf Coast and Sadara investments at steady run rate, the Dow Corning transaction and the DowDuPont transaction, which are materials synergies target of $1.5 billion plus DuPont's performance materials business minus Dow's agricultural sciences and electronic materials business. Note that we do not count any growth synergies, any market organic growth, or any new innovation contribution. These new earning streams are in motion and are known to us and described to you. And we will do all of this in a market and global economy that is mixed at best. Our outlook is that this won't change. Volatility and macro uncertainties are the new norm. But Dow will deliver as it has these last many years, by firmly executing against our earnings growth drivers. And we will continue to grow earnings before, during, and after the merger and its intended spins. We have the team to do so. We have not been, nor will we be, distracted in delivering value for our shareholders. And with that, Neal, let's turn to Q&A. Neal Sheorey : Thank you, Andrew. Now we will move on to your question. I ask that you please keep to one question so that we can allow as many people as possible the opportunity to ask a question. First, however, I would like to remind you that my comments regarding forward looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. Rochelle, would you please explain the Q&A procedure? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Arun Viswanathan : Good morning. Thank you. Andrew Liveris : Good morning. Arun Viswanathan : I just want to get your thoughts on ethylene and polyethylene in the next two quarters. We have seen, potentially, some turnarounds here in the first half and some of those are potentially moderating here in the second half. What's your outlook for pricing in polyethylene over the next quarter or two? Do you expect some moderation in pricing in the third quarter and fourth quarter as operating rates tick down? Andrew Liveris : Go ahead, Jim. James Fitterling : Thanks, Arun. Look, every - in Plastics, the story, I think, is still demand. And demand has been strong, and our volume growth of 13% reflects that. In fact, we had growth in all geographic areas, especially in EMEAI and Asia Pacific, and also this year in Latin America. So, hopeful that we're seeing a rebound in the developing economies right now. And our operating EBITDA is up 7% versus same quarter last year. Compared to previous quarter, pricing is up. Compared to same quarter last year, pricing is off about a penny. So, I think you're seeing that reflected - the polyethylene price reflects that robust demand. And then my point on inventories, I mean, the derivative demand is much tighter than the ethylene demand, and we think that's going to remain the case. In fact, we continue to see announcements of projects flight out of the pipeline. I reflected that in my comments. We continue to see delays, forecasted later start-ups, projects being completely taken out of the forecast for ethylene. So I think, to your point about back half of the year, I think you're going to see more of the same that you have seen. We see a little bit of seasonality toward the end of the year typically, but usually third quarter is a strong quarter for us in the Plastics franchise. Andrew Liveris : If I could just jump on real quickly, Jim, just the way you should think about the way we put the two slides in the deck for this reason. The way Jim just described it is, we are number one in this game, and we understand supply-demand on the ground. When Iran was talked about five years ago, people like the consultants had statements. That never happened. We knew what was going on with supply side. So, I think the way Jim and all of us are talking about this is, these next many years, the delays are going to create the conditions that we've just seen these last few years. We can make money in this chain very nicely, thank you very much, based on demand drivers and supply drivers being in the right place, plus our differentiation. Post 2020, there might be a few more start-ups, but I don't think many of you are modeling 2020. So, let's work on understanding that the dynamic right now is quite favorable. Operator : And next, we'll move to P.J. Juvekar with Citi. P.J. Juvekar: Yes, good morning. Andrew Liveris : Morning. P.J. Juvekar: Yes, hi. Neither of you talked about the America-created polyethylene, where North America would export more to Latin America. But if Latin America demand remains weak, where do you think U.S. polyethylene have to go to balance the market? And just secondly, on your polyethylene or ethylene plant, is your plant on time? Thank you. Andrew Liveris : Go ahead, Jim. You get the second polyethylene question. James Fitterling : Yeah, P.J., thanks for the question. Our demand in Latin America is actually up 4% in the quarter. So, we see pretty strong volumes in Latin America, and I think we're going to continue to see Latin America come back. Obviously, the impact of the lower GDP has a little bit of a market sentimental impact on what happens with the consumer market. But, when you look at the currency impacts in Latin America and, for that matter, in most of the developing world, most of the inflationary impacts of those currency changes have already been felt. And that's, I think, what leads into our comments that we think, in the emerging geographies, we're seeing a bottom and, hopefully, a recovery from this point on. Meanwhile, the United States, given the energy feedstock competitiveness, is still one of the lowest cost places in the world to make these products. And so, we still have the ability to export, based on our global reach, to all parts of the world. And based on the fact that we're focusing on the higher value end markets, where most of the new capacity that's coming on is coming on in the really highly commoditized segment, it gives us the added benefit of the power of innovation. So, when you look at that power of innovation and the competitiveness of scale that we have, I think we're well-positioned to take advantage of this whole market situation. Relative to your point on our timing, our Sadara plants are up, and the cracker is in the startup phase right now. In fact, the systems are running. And we're in the phase right before you really bring on the rest of the furnaces. We've got things inventoried in the hydrocarbons unit, and we're drying out the rest of the plant and getting ready to go. So, you're going to see polyethylene running here. And our hope is that polyethylene turns favorable, more of a tailwind for the plastics business in the back half of the year. U.S. Gulf Coast, the cracker project is making tremendous progress. I think we're well above the 70% to completion rate. And as we said, we're going to have that up by mid next year. And the polyethylene plants are coming along very nicely. I was just down in Plaquemine last month, and I've been down in Texas the last couple of months, and we're making tremendous progress on those. So, I think our timing is very consistent with every previous report we've given you on those plants. Operator : And next, we move to Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Vincent Andrews : Thanks. Andrew, I was wondering if I could ask you, on trade, in this presidential election, there's an awful lot of back and forth about trade policy, whether it's TPP, or China, or what have you. As you think about that sort of environment over the next couple of years and you think about Dow's business, is there anything that's being discussed right now that's concerning to you at all? Andrew Liveris : Look, there's a lot being discussed or not discussed that's concerning, but you all know the season you're in. So, when we get to the next administration and we engage, we'll engage on all the things that matter to the company. Notably, trade. Just a little reminder, Vincent, because I've been asked this question a few times. Just a little reminder that the United States has actually put in very few trade agreements in the last 10 years. Actually, 3 specific bi-lats and one multi-lat in the works but not yet done. So, I would tell you we haven't really been exposed to the positives of trade and most of it is the way Jim answered the other question, which is we're on the ground pretty much everywhere else. And so regionalization, the sum of all the places you're in, which is 37 countries for Dow. We're on the ground with physical facilities in 37 countries, means we have local market access under all sorts of trade environments. And there are great trade agreements going on between Asian countries and European Union and elsewhere. So we benefit from all of those. I would like to see the U.S. get to a multi-lat trade agreement, the TPP, but we're not counting on it. I think what we're going to see here is a lot of uncertainties in the political environment. I grew up in Asia where there were trade barriers everywhere. So, Dow has the strategy to operate and generate profit in economies that grow wherever there is growth. And we have the diversification of geographic mix to take a few countries being on the downside of growth, i.e., like Brazil right now, and of course manage the upside, like the U.S. and China right now. So I'm not particularly concerned about the rhetoric that's going on right now. Operator : And Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs will have our next question. Robert Koort : Thank you. Andrew, you guys have had some pretty remarkable auto end market growth rates, certainly exceeding global production. Is this certain product wins, is it certain customer platform wins and how sustainable do you see that? Andrew Liveris : Good morning, Bob. And thank you for the question. I'll take the first piece of it and then I'll pass it over to Jim. Look, I'm very proud of Dow automotive and our transportation platform in general. It's a great example of the entire company. Steve Henderson and his team, in the last ten years, have changed the mix. So to answer your question, is yes. It's a change in mix. It's a change in technology platforms. It's a change in product mix and change in positioning with the OEMs, both geographic repositioning as well as particularly where you are in the supply chain. And we are speaking to light-weighting and we're speaking to fuel efficiency, and we are speaking to value add in the car or in the truck or whatever. And so we've got a lot of great programs. Jim, you might want to reference a couple of them. James Fitterling : Yeah, Bob, it's a great question. And, look, we still believe that automotive this year is going to have a production level that's above last year, even if it's just slightly above, and sales continue to be strong there. We've always had the leading supply in glass bonding. So that business continues to perform exceptionally well. And the addition of crash durable adhesives, I can't underestimate how much of a growth driver that is for this business, not just in - I mean, we've highlighted our experience with Ford in the F150, where we're bonding aluminum to a steel structure. And not just light-weighting the vehicle, but improving the crash safety rating of that vehicle, a class of vehicles that's not known for high crash safety ratings. But that applies in other dissimilar materials, so whether you're talking about carbon fiber composites on a steel frame, that application still applies. And as we continue to see others focus on light-weighting and our driving force in automotive has been and continues to be a seat at the design table with the brand owners, so that we can actually get out there and get our products specced in. We are continuing to see strong growth drivers in those businesses. And that is before we even think about what we can do with the power of Dow Corning Silicones in the mix. Operator : And next we'll move to Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo. Frank Mitsch : Good morning, gentlemen, and nice results here. Andrew Liveris : Good morning, Frank. Frank Mitsch : Andrew, if I were to be told a few months ago that you guys were going to post 13% volume growth in Performance Plastics, my first question would be, what operating rates are you guys at? And is that pretty much taking you to capacity? Or is there some that's coming out of inventory? Can you give us some sense as to where you stand, how much more there is to go, if any? Andrew Liveris : Jim, why don't you take the ball on the tee and put it down the fairway. James Fitterling : Well, Frank, I appreciate the question, because our team is very, very focused. And they've been doing a heck of a job. And I mean that right out to operations and manufacturing. This year, year to date, at virtually the same operating rate as we had last year, we produced 2 billion pounds more production out of our assets. Now, 25% of that is PDH, so take that out of the equation. This quarter, we produced a billion pounds more out of the same asset base. And so we - this is Dow's DNA. This is what we do best and what we have always done, and I call it the competitiveness of scale, getting that extra percent out of a machine, doing it reliably, doing it safely, working that product mix, working the product waterfalls. Nobody does that better than we do. And the team is firing on all cylinders right now. And really looking forward to two trains of Sadara being up in the back half of the year, because customers are ready for that product. Operator : And we'll move on to Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Jeffrey Zekauskas : Hi, good morning. Two questions. My understanding is your PDH unit has had difficulties in producing since you brought it onstream. Can you talk about what those difficulties are and when they might be remedied? And in terms of your Texas 9 project that you say will be complete midyear next year, do you mean mechanically complete? That is, when do you expect it to be producing commercially? Andrew Liveris : Go ahead, Jim. Take both. James Fitterling : Yeah, Jeff, that's a good question on PDH. And you'll recall that we did get that plant up in December and got it up in record time. And as I just mentioned on Frank's question, we produced over 500 million pounds of propylene out of that unit this year. The technology itself is working very well. The catalyst, the reactor performance is strong, in fact the conversion rates are higher than we expected out of the catalyst. So that all looks good. We had two unit operations inside the plant that gave us some trouble. One heat exchanger, which we referred to earlier this year. And then we just had a problem with a dryer bed in the unit where we had to make some mechanical improvements in there. I don't think any of those are fundamental long term problems. I think they're just the normal problems of start-up of a massive unit. And those of you who have been down there have seen the size of that thing. So, we've got vendors and our support from EOP all over it. And we're expected to be up next week, the week of August 8, and it's looking good right now. So, we're very hopeful. The team is very hopeful that we've not only solved a couple of mechanical problems, but made a couple of improvements along the way. Andrew Liveris : And just on Texas 9, we're mechanically complete in a year. James Fitterling : No, you're going to be mechanically complete on Texas 9 at the beginning of second quarter next year. And then, of course, you've got to do the commissioning and start-up. And that takes you, usually, better part of a quarter to get it up and running. So, we're right on schedule with operational by midyear next year, Jeff. Andrew Liveris : Thank you, Jeff. Operator : And next we'll move to Peter Butler with Glen Hill Investment. Peter Butler : Good morning. Andrew Liveris : Good morning. Peter Butler : If the pending DowDuPont merger, in effect, has dealt you guys a new hand of cards, how do you, as you look back, how do you evaluate the new hand? And does this have the possibilities of really making a huge disconnect in your future that you could be on the cusp of a really good earnings and cash flow story, I think. Andrew Liveris : Peter the last slide in the deck, which I went through, was to give you guys a great visibility the way we're thinking about your question, which is, as we put together these historic transactions, the Dow Corning one just closed, and, of course, you're seeing a little bit of the positive effect of that already in our synergy increase there, is our confidence in delivering against the EBITDA that's in the slide in the deck. And the DowDuPont transaction, the two becoming three powerful companies based on the synergies that we'll get as well as the complementarity and the growth vehicles that we created, Materials Science, Agricultural Science and Specialties. I know you heard Ed the other day. We're working pedal to the metal to get those metrics in place, the milestones in place. The board reviews and the way we'll run the merged companies with advisory committees. All those metrics, so we're aligned to implement, beat to close, beat to synergy, beat to spin. And those details, granular details, with the powerful shareholder vote approval we got last week, over 97% approval in our case and in DuPont's case. This is just an indicator. This is a lot of EBITDA that's going to come at both the merged company and the intended spins. And we gave you a road map to the new Dow Materials Science company on that last slide, which shows you 25% EBITDA margins and greater than $15 billion. Operator : And David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank will have our next question. David Begleiter : Thank you, good morning. Andrew and Jim, maybe just talk about what's next on the ethylene capacity front. Sadara is almost done. Texas 9 will be ramping up next year. Is the next increment capacity in Saudi Arabia or, like [indiscernible] is doing, will it be in the U.S. from your perspective for Dow Chemical? Andrew Liveris : Yeah, I'll give Jim a shot as well. Look, I think supply and command, Jim's already spoken to that, so we won't be redundant there. But we think about this as get these units up, satisfy the demand that's out there. Ethylene/polyethylene/plastics are growing very nicely as a factor to GDP. And as the number one player in the world, we're always looking for our increments. And we're going to have some very nice increments available to us for the next investment cycle. But fair to say our very big focus is getting these units up and running, and then we'll calibrate what they are. We've got ideas, and Jim and his team are working on those. Jim, you might want to add some thoughts there. James Fitterling : You know, David, I'd say right now, we typically tend to look at two things; obviously, where you're going to have the low cost feedstocks. And so places like the United States certainly, the Middle East, Canada potentially, Argentina potentially, are all locations where you're going to have access to low cost feedstocks. The good news for us is, we're in all of those places and we have the ability to expand in all those places. And Andrew said, some of that is very incremental for us. So certainly in Canada and the U.S. Gulf Coast, we have opportunities for increment, and then we have the footprint in all of those places to be able to do something full scale, if that's what we decide to do. Right now, we have a lot coming at us over this next few years, and we want to make sure that we take best advantage of the investment that we've already made. Operator : Next we'll move on to Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Christopher Parkinson : Perfect. Thank you very much. Do you have any quick updates on the ENLIST approval process for either cultivation or importation? And also, where do you stand with licensee agreements? And then also, sorry to sneak another one in, real quick, if you have any comments on the progress of active crop protection launches, specifically the ones in 2018 and the registration processes, it would also be greatly appreciated. Thank you. Andrew Liveris : I'll let Howard get into the Q&A here, as the resident Ag expert. Go ahead, Howard. Howard Ungerleider : I was waiting for the first Ag question. Good morning, Chris. On ENLIST and the approval in China, we continue to wait import approval for the ENLIST corn trait in China. We believe we've provided everything to the Ministry of Agriculture with all the data that they have requested. So we can't tell you when, but technically, with all the data, we believe we're ready to receive the approval. In terms of your ENLIST license question. So, look on corn, Monsanto has a non-exclusive royalty-bearing license to access thousand list corn traits. On soybean, the plan is to utilize our own channel and other soybean seed companies, both in the U.S. and Latin America. And we're partnering with the strong regional companies, both in the U.S. and Latin America. And with cotton, we're going to market with the DAS brands, so PhytoGen. And remember, cotton accounts for 10% of the ENLIST acres that we're projecting. So, full speed ahead, but we are waiting for the China approval. Operator : And next we'll hear from John Roberts with UBS. John Roberts : Thank you. Andrew Liveris : Hi, John. John Roberts : DowDuPont reportedly has offered some Ag concessions to the E.U. regulators. Could you tell us if they only address normal horizontal market share concerns, or are there any vertical market share concerns that you need to think about? Andrew Liveris : Yeah, John. Thank you. No, we can't disclose that. In essence, the regulatory approval process and what we're doing in terms of remedies, there was couple of statements out there. But look, just rest assured, as Ed said the other day, we're deep into this process. E.U. a key jurisdiction, and we're quite conscious of some of their concerns, which you'd expect. The one thing that we're very clear on is what this is and what this isn't. What this is the creation of three growth companies, not one mega merger. So the details around that are obviously very detailed, and they do get into questions like yours. And rest assured that we've got all sorts of thoughts on how we can get to close by year-end, and we're still confident we can do that. Operator : And next we'll move on to Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Stephen Byrne : I have another Ag question for you, Howard. Continuing with the question on ENLIST. There are some reports recently of some soybean damage from the drift of dicamba from your competitor's herbicide tolerance product. Can you comment on whether that risk of drift from 2,4-D is as great of a concern for you guys, or is it less? Howard Ungerleider : Yeah. I would just say, Steve, we feel really good about the ENLIST technology platform. Remember it's both a seed as well as the over the top ENLIST Duo herbicide. And when you do that combination - our view on the herbicide, on ENLIST Duo, we have reduced volatility and reduced drift. All the field forward trials that we've done in the U.S. and Canada have proven that out, on top of all the test plots that we have done internally within Dow Ag, so we feel very good about that. Operator : And we'll move on with Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Duffy Fischer : Yeah, good morning, fellows. Andrew Liveris : Good morning. Duffy Fischer : You gave a lot of helpful guidance on the slide in the back around Dow Corning, but I was wondering if you could kind of help quarterly, just because as we annualize this the first year, we don't have good year-over-year data for it. That $800 million and some of the synergies rolling through, how will that impact quarterly in Q3 and Q4? Andrew Liveris : Well, I'll give you a second quarter look on Dow Corning, Duffy, and thanks for the question. In the second quarter, the Dow Corning on the EBITDA line was about $100 million tailwind for us. Now that included a little bit of purchasing step-up related activity, so you can't take that and roll it through for the full back half of the year. I would say remember, though, all of our divestitures that we had through the last year. So there was about $100 million of headwinds on divestitures. So those pretty much offset each other. On the EPS line in the second quarter, Dow Corning was about a $0.02 EPS tailwind, because you take that $100 million, you have to raise - we borrowed additional money to fund the deal, so you got a higher interest cost and then, of course, you got purchase step-up accounting as well that's a little bit of an offset. So, on the EPS line it was a $0.02 tailwind for us in the second quarter. Operator : And next we'll move on to Aleksey Yefremov with Nomura Securities. Aleksey Yefremov : Good morning. Thank you. Turning back to Sadara. Could you tell us what is the current plan for having the entire project be up and running, and also what do you expect the net equity contribution for Sadara to be next year. Is it going to be a tailwind or a headwind? Andrew Liveris : I'll let Jim pile on. I just wanted to just - he said something earlier which gives me opportunity to repeat what he said and then double down on it. So, Howard and I made a trip out there just this last weekend and we had a thorough review with the project team. Jim's on the board and he's the lead for Dow on that board. The new energy minister, Khalid Al-Falih, the previous CEO of Aramco, was present for a whole day. We are into the granular detail of starting up 25 units all in parallel and many of them, there's over 500 Dow people on the site to assist the local Saudis in getting it all up and running. Very impressed with the quality of the Saudi workforce, by the way. It's first class. We train them around the world, they're great. And we've got the human resources on the ground and, of course, we're now working on the most important one of them all which is getting the mix feed cracker up and running. And then Jim may comment on that. Actually they fed ethane in while we were there for the first time. And not often that you want to see a ground flare burning ethylene, but everyone was celebrating the burning of ethylene through the ground flare. That's just a little piece of detail for you to let you know there's real things happening on that site. Now the handoffs, the multistage handoffs, the fact that we're allowing most of this year and all of next year to get these handoffs before we're all the way done. There's going to be a lot of those handoffs on the interfaces. And, Jim, you may want to comment on the complexity and what we expect. James Fitterling : Right. So as soon as this cracker comes up, we've got the two PE plants ready to run. And then a third PE plant will be ready to run before the end of the year. So that will consume quite a bit of ethylene. And then EO and PO derivatives come on next, and they're going to be complete in the end of third quarter beginning of fourth quarter. They have a start-up phase to go through, and so you can expect to see them in the first quarter of 2017. And then as we go down the aromatics chain, you'll start to see isocyanates and some of the other derivatives come on by mid next year. So, throughout the end of this year and through most of next year, we're going to be sequentially starting up these units in this big integrated complex to bring the whole thing up and running. Right now, construction is 99.5% complete. So mechanical completions, every week we're handing over units to the project team and the operations team. So we look in good shape to get it up and running. The point on tailwind, our view is still you're going to see equity earnings out of Sadara of $400 million to $500 million in that timeframe when they're all up and running. Howard Ungerleider : Yeah, I would just say, in terms of - Jim's guidance was a long-term point on earnings, so we still feel really good about Sadara. If you want to talk about this year punctually, year-on-year 2016 versus 2015, it's likely to be about a $250 million enterprise level headwind for us sequentially, and probably about a $400 million cash flow headwind for us, just as we fund the completion and start-up costs associated with the whole integrated site. Operator : And next, we'll move to Jonas Oxgaard with AllianceBernstein. Jonas Oxgaard : Hi, guys. Congrats on the quarter. Andrew Liveris : Thank you. Jonas Oxgaard : Question. Your friends over at DuPont guided, on Tuesday that they would be unable to finish the 2 billion share buyback due to volume restrictions. Is that also true for you guys? Andrew Liveris : Go ahead, Howard. Howard Ungerleider : Yeah, Jonas, good morning. I would say, yeah, we're going to be synchronized in our stock buyback, right? As you know well, until the shareholder vote, we've been required to be out of the market. We're very pleased, and Andrew talked about the shareholder vote earlier in the call. So we're pleased that that's behind us. So, right now, we're not going to do any kind of an ASR. We're going to go open market purchases. So, obviously, the next step is, we need the trading window to open. As soon as the trading window opens, we do intend fully to buy back stock, but within the volume limits that we have. And, obviously, the summer months, volume tends to be a little bit light. But we intend to buy as much as we possibly can, in sync with DuPont, in line with the volume. Operator : And next, we'll move on to Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial. Don Carson : Yes, Howard, another question on Ag. You talked about some headwinds, but there are some positives out there, too, like the reais turning in the second half. You talk of flat crop protection chemical volumes. So how do you see Ag earnings unfolding in the second half of this year and into next year, also with the headwind of lower grain prices? Howard Ungerleider : Yeah, I mean, look, we've been aggressive in reducing costs. The long-term growth drivers in the business are robust, right? I mean, population growth, limited arable land, urbanization, water scarcity. I mean, you know, Don, better than probably anybody on this call, why we feel so good about the Ag market. I would say, we still believe that the market overall is going to decline 5%. But our team, the Dow Ag team, have really been focused on a combination of productivity, self-help, as well as introduction of new molecules on the crop protection side, as well as growing as much as we can as quickly as we can on the seed front. So we feel good about the back half. I mean, it's still a tough Ag macro. You talked a little bit about some of the potential, headwind movement and tailwind in Latin America, and I would agree with that. Our goal is to outperform the competition. That's what the team is focused on. Neal Sheorey : And Rochelle, we have time for one more question. Operator : Okay. Next, we'll hear from Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global. Hassan Ahmed : Morning, Andrew. I somehow made it. Andrew, a bunch of questions, obviously, on ethylene, polyethylene supply-demand fundamentals. Jim alluded to sort of this point earlier in the call that over the last couple of months we've sort of seen and heard a fair degree of cynicism around ethylene supply-demand fundamentals. But part and parcel with that cynicism is the feedstock side of things as well. There seems to be this perception that ethane is going get tight very quickly. And I've heard numbers like $0.50 to $0.60 a gallon imminently being thrown around. Now, you clearly have a slide in the deck talking about your views on ethane being long. So, A, would love for you to talk a bit about why you feel ethane's going to be long. And, B, what sort of energy pricing stack are you using when you're coming up with your ethane supply-demand sort of analysis? Andrew Liveris : Go ahead, Jim, and I'll add a couple comments when you're done. James Fitterling : Thanks. And thanks. I think it's a very good question, Hassan, and it's the reason we put that in the back of the deck. I'm glad you looked at that. I think a couple of things. Obviously, on the demand side for ethane, my comments about what's happening with project delays and things are sliding out the timing, impacts a little bit of that demand picture. But the power of feedstock flexibility here is what we always talk about in Dow, and one of the reasons we invest the way that we do, is that propane and natural gas play a big role in this too. So, propane right now is capping ethane. And the other dynamic that you see happening, is that propane exports out of the U.S. are really flooding and exhausting some of the available buyers that are in that market. And natural gas prices are low. And the supply, even with the rig counts down, the supply has continued to be very strong, and now we're starting to see rig counts pick up a little bit. So our view here is that, despite the exports, despite all the other things happening, you're still going to be long propane and ethane. And you're going to be longer nat gas and propane than you are ethane. And when you're long propane, and propane is in the crack slate, that's advantage Dow. And so that's what we play for. Obviously, we have the flexibility to go back into ethane when that's possible. But look, there's more gas supply, at low cost, that's coming on every day. Not just in the U.S. It's coming on in the Middle East, it's in Australia. It's putting pressure on these gas prices, and that's going to help us out. Andrew Liveris : Yeah, and I just want to add a comment there, because it enables us to repeat, the 15 quarters in a row of EPS growth year-on-year has come under all environments at $100, and all environments at low $30. And there's been corrections out there, because the view is - the basis of your question, Hassan, is that in some way, where naphtha is versus ethane, where naphtha is versus propane, is linked to where oil is versus gas. And what we have seen, and what we have said, and what we've now performed against under these diverse environments is, firstly, our geographic mix helps us. Secondly, our feedstock flexibility enables us. Thirdly, we've added to that flexibility, i.e. propane in Europe, for a great example of that. And we see propane as long as far as the eye can see. And, lastly, and very importantly, low oil price over time has enabled consumer demand. It took a while, but it's here. U.S. consumers are spending because they've got more money in their pockets. That's also happening in countries like China, which is becoming more consumer-led.. So, a low oil price with the enablement of feedstock flexibility on the Dow side, with ethane, propane, some butane, here certainly in the U.S., and our feedstock flexibility engine in Europe, means we can maximize profits in the chain. That key slide that Jim had in his deck. So, we can make money as long as there is demand. There is demand. The feedstock input-output thing, we're managing to maximize profit, maximize margin, which is a price volume trade-off in that chain, and we're doing it successfully now under all environments. Operator : And at this time, I would like it turn the call back over to Mr. Neal Sheorey for any additional or closing remarks. Neal Sheorey : Thanks very much. Andrew, before we close the call, would you like to make any final comments? Andrew Liveris : Yeah, I would like to pick up on Hassan's question and go a little forward and lean into the company's strong performance in the quarter as a harbinger. 15 quarters in a row, Consumer Solutions, Infrastructure Solutions, and Plastics performed, and they performed in tangent with a consumer-led economy. We have the portfolio to keep performing and keep strong performance. But we're not resting there. Self-help actions for many years on reducing cost, taking productivity to the bottom line, keeping it sticky. The 2500 positions we're reducing, i.e., the 700 extra on top of the Dow Corning announcement is a great example of how we're continuing to work the cost engine, not just feedstocks but actual costs, so that we can stay in a margin expansion mode, now 15 in a row. This has not only yielded margin, but the working capital side of this, you got to look at what we have done. We produced 1 billion more pounds in the quarter from a year ago. 2 billion pounds more from the same machine from the first half point of view. Those extra pounds and that operating rate and disciplined working capital is generating this extra free cash flow that will feed the share buyback question that Howard answered. And we're very committed to working capital management, cash flow management, free cash flow generation to keep working the balance sheet, so we increase share buybacks. And then this strong demand environment will continue. Look, it's not a great global economy, but it's a consumer-led economy and our products speak to it. And our new plants will come online at the right time. So, all of our interventions and actions are producing and they are continuing to produce. Dow Corning, accretive in the first month. Synergies raised already. The merger on track. And with a great see-through to these three new entities. These three great growth entities. We're firing on all cylinders and we will continue to do so. Neal Sheorey : Thank you, Andrew. And thank you, everyone on the call, for your questions. As always, we appreciate your interest in the Dow Chemical Company. For your reference, a copy of our prepared remarks will be posted on Dow's website later today. This concludes our call for today. We look forward to speaking with you again soon. Operator : And that will conclude today's conference call. We thank you for your participation.",

And, if everyone could turn to slide three \u2013 good morning to everyone. The Dow team continues to deliver against every one of our goals for the year, building on our consistent track record of execution. Let's start with the financial highlights. We achieved record third quarter EBITDA and our highest third quarter EPS in a decade. This quarter marks four full years, 16 consecutive quarters of earnings growth and margin expansion. In addition, we returned more than $900 million of cash to our owners through stock buybacks and dividends. Operationally, we continue to meet consumer-led demand for Dow products and solutions, driving volume gains in all geographies. We've now consistently grown volume over three years, 12 consecutive quarters, despite a slow growth macro environment. We also delivered another quarter of productivity and cost savings, bringing the year-to-date contribution to $254 million on track to exceed our 2016 target. On our strategic projects, we accelerated the Dow Corning integration moving quickly on our cost synergies as we said we would. Our Sadara joint venture celebrated the startup of its multi-feed cracker and a third polyethylene train. And our next wave of U.S. Gulf Coast projects is on the cusp of delivering bottom-line results. Dow has proven time and again the power and resilience of our business model. Our focused market participation shows resiliency in all environments, our commitment to self-help productivity and cost-cutting and the compelling upside from our strategic investments. Collectively, these drivers will deliver the next levels of earnings and cash flow growth and delivering that cash to our owners. I'll now turn the call over to Howard to discuss our financial performance, the Dow Corning integration, modeling guidance, and our Ag results; Jim will cover the remaining businesses; and I'll close with some thoughts on our track record of success and our future growth trajectory. Howard? Howard I. Ungerleider: Thanks, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. Turning to slide five, we had a number of important financial achievements in the quarter. We delivered operating EPS of $0.91, an 11% increase. We achieved record third quarter operating EBITDA of $2.5 billion, up $118 million, and we expanded our operating EBITDA margin to 20%. Our earnings expansion was driven by our consumer-oriented businesses, which features strong results with the integration of Dow Corning and better than expected performance in Dow Ag. We grew volume in every geographic area in the quarter with notable strength in Europe, which was up 9%, and the United States and China, both up 6%. Productivity continue to be an important contributor. We delivered another $76 million of savings in the quarter. And, finally, we resumed our share buyback program with more than $400 million of share repurchases in the quarter. Moving to slide six, and an update on Dow Corning. Since close, we have been working quickly to integrate the silicones platform into our Consumer Solutions and Infrastructure Solutions businesses as well as capturing the synergies. The quick wins we've already delivered underscore the power of the silicones franchise, its highly complementary hand-in-glove fit with Dow's business model and the role this transaction plays in further enhancing our earnings growth profile. First and foremost, the core business continues to outperform even our initial projections on broad-based volume gains and share growth. Second, I am pleased to report that we've already reached more than $200 million in cost synergies on an annual run rate basis. This was largely due to the value our team has extracted in purchasing, optimizing our warehouse and logistic footprints, as well as consolidating back office operations. We've also completed notifications with the vast majority of impacted roles, with only a small percentage remaining, where we're adhering to local labor rules. We remain on track to achieve a run rate of 70% against our $400 million cost synergy target by the first half of 2017, and 100% by the first half of 2018. And finally, we're also seeing the power of silicones on the growth side of the equation. As we've said for some time, Dow Corning's silicones is a natural fit into Dow's packaging, transportation, infrastructure and consumer care end markets. We are even more positive today about the growth synergy opportunities that this transaction presents. Our commercial and R&D teams finalized the playbook to achieve the $100 million growth synergy target and in fact, we've already delivered some early cross-selling opportunities. Bottom-line, the Dow Corning integration is progressing very well, delivering financial returns, uncovering future growth opportunities and enhancing Dow's market-focused portfolio. Before we turn to our segment results, let me share some thoughts on modeling guidance on slide seven. In the fourth quarter, we expect ag market headwinds to persist, largely offset by our self-help actions. Comparing year-over-year, recall that we sold several nonstrategic molecules last year, which lifted Ag results in that period. Consumer Solutions will benefit from the integration of Dow Corning. Approximately 60% of Dow Corning's EBITDA and synergies are in this segment. We do expect typical seasonality in electronic materials and U.S. auto production as we approach year-end. In Infrastructure Solutions, my comments about Dow Corning apply here as well, with the other 40% of its EBITDA generated here. This segment also consumes roughly one-third of the propylene from our PDH unit. We expect that to be offset by continued oil and gas headwinds in energy and water. Turning to Performance Materials & Chemicals, which consumes two-thirds of the propylene from our PDH unit, from a seasonality standpoint we could see some upside from deicer sales. After all, it did snow yesterday in Michigan. As you know, we have seen compression on the integrated EO and PO margins globally, which will impact PMC. Also, Sadara costs are increasing here as we continue to startup downstream units related to this segment. Finally, in Performance Plastics, we expect a modest uptick from the cracker and the three PE units at Sadara as sales have begun. However, we expect these to be more than offset by higher costs from the Louisiana turnaround, debottleneck and maintenance activities currently underway as well as higher feedstock costs globally. Now, let's turn to our segments. I'll start first with Ag on slide nine and then hand it to Jim to cover the rest of the businesses. Dow Ag continues to outperform despite the ongoing challenging industry fundamentals. Segment EBITDA increased by $141 million and represents the best third quarter results in nearly a decade. Several factors contributed to our success. Share gains due to continued increasing demand for our innovative products, price improvements, continued self-help actions and strong early demand for the Latin America growing season. Latin America seeds was the highlight. Strong demand in the region drove record sales with price and volume both rising by double digits. Corn seed sales nearly tripled primarily on double-digit volume and price growth in Latin America. The business increased share particularly in the Brazilian Safrinha season, where we have a strong position. Soybean sales nearly tripled as well, reflecting higher price and volume. Crop protection set a third quarter EBITDA record supported by improved product mix and the ongoing self-help productivity and cost-cutting actions. Insecticides improved on increased price, while herbicide pricing and fungicide volume each declined. I'll now turn it over to Jim to cover the rest of our segments. James R. Fitterling: Thank you, Howard. Moving to Consumer Solutions on slide 10, the segment achieved an all-time operating EBITDA record of $492 million, boosted by the integration of Dow Corning, which is further enhancing our end-market positions across this segment. This marks the fifth consecutive quarter of EBITDA growth for this segment and it demonstrates the power and differentiation of our Consumer, Automotive and Electronic Materials franchises. Dow Automotive achieved its seventh consecutive quarter of EBITDA growth and a record third quarter EBITDA led by double-digit volume gains in Asia Pacific on new business wins and market share gains. The business continues to grow above market on demand for Dow's light-weighting solution. Consumer Care grew market shares through gains in home care market sectors and new innovation for personal hygiene solutions. Silicones in the Consumer Solutions segment delivered double-digit volume growth in Asia-Pacific behind demand for electronic and automotive applications. The business also achieved its first cross-selling opportunities with the Dow Automotive, Consumer Care and Polyurethanes businesses. And Dow Electronic Materials achieved record quarterly EBITDA. In addition to ongoing self-help measures, the business captured strong demand in semiconductor, interconnect and display technologies particularly in Asia-Pacific. On slide 11, Infrastructure Solutions delivered EBITDA of $379 million, primarily reflecting the integration of Dow Corning. Dow Building & Construction achieved record third quarter EBITDA and delivered its eighth consecutive quarter of EBITDA growth. The business captured volume gains on demands for acrylic-based construction chemicals and benefited from continued voluntary adoption of our BLUEDGE polymeric flame retardant. Silicones in the Infrastructure Solutions segment reported volume and EBITDA growth driven by improved demand in packaging and building construction applications. Dow Coating Materials reported volume growth in all market segments led by strong demand in Asia-Pacific and gains in both the architectural and industrial coatings sectors. Moving to slide 12. Performance and materials chemicals (sic) [Performance Materials & Chemicals] (13:03) EBITDA declined, primarily due to the impact of portfolio actions which included divestitures and the reduced ownership in MEGlobal as well as higher Sadara start-up costs. In the core business, pricing pressures led to unit margin compression, but this was partly offset by volume growth. In Polyurethanes, we achieved record volume on double-digit gains in specialty polyols and systems houses, led by growth in EMEA and Asia-Pacific. Industrial Solutions reported volume gains in all businesses also led by strength in EMEA and Asia-Pacific. Turning to Performance Plastics on slide 13. The team achieved $1.25 billion of EBITDA and double-digit volume growth, with gains across all businesses. A key part of our continued success is the team's focus on manufacturing reliability and producing incremental volume in a robust demand environment. Dow Packaging and Specialty Plastics delivered record third quarter sales volume on double-digit growth in developed geographies and adoption of new innovations for food and specialty packaging applications. Dow Elastomers also achieved record third quarter volume, driven by increasing global consumer preference for larger vehicles that incorporate more Dow content, as well as double-digit growth in athletic footwear. These applications are further enhanced by our innovative products, such as INTUNE and INFUSE Olefin Block Copolymers. Dow Electrical and Telecommunications reported double-digit volume gains in the Americas, as the business continues to benefit from the global trends for fiberoptic cabling for faster and more reliable wireless connections. Additionally, Sadara started up its multi-feed cracker in August and a third polyethylene train in September, adding to the two polyethylene trains already in operation. In the U.S. Gulf Coast, we commenced the Louisiana turnaround and feedstock flexibility project. That unit will restart later this quarter giving our LA-3 cracker the ability to produce an additional 250,000 tons per year of ethylene and enhancing the reliability of one of the best units in our fleet. During the quarter, our Texas 9 ethylene facility passed 85% mechanical completion and we made significant progress on our Performance Plastics production facilities. Our target for Texas 9 to come online remains mid-2017. And now, I'll hand it back over to Andrew. Andrew N. Liveris: Thank you, Jim. So if you'd turn to slide 15, and there is a chart here that you should pay particular attention to, the one on the right of the slide. As I mentioned at the start of the call, we've now achieved four full years, 16 consecutive quarters, of earnings growth and margin expansion. And we've been doing earnings growth now for over a decade. You can see that we have taken a series of purposeful steps taken over these past many years. These steps are deeply rooted in our strategy to get the near-term right and the long-term right, and steadfast execution from an aligned team Dow. And to put things into context, you actually have to go back to the late 1990s, when our industry came under pressure from state-owned enterprises. Returns were clearly impacted because we all had, Dow included, a me-too product wheel. Low-cost integration was absolutely necessary, but on its own, not enough to ensure long-term profitable growth. Since then, we've taken a number of decisive actions to create a sustainable business model built on both low-cost integration and innovation to drive our narrower and deeper focus in attractive end markets, to invest for growth in consumer-led sectors while having a strong presence in investment-driven markets, like infrastructure, and to control what we can control through disciplined productivity and cost savings. In doing so, we believe we've created a portfolio for all seasons, a more resilient portfolio, one built to grow and last. We have fundamentally shifted our earnings trajectory, not only enhancing our growth but also driving greater consistency. Equally important, we've put in place a series of growth drivers that will serve us well in the near-term and long-term. These include a reinvigorated industry-leading R&D engine, which now delivers over 5,000 new products every year; a new set of technical capabilities, most notably the addition of Dow Corning silicones; an expanded footprint in attractive global markets through our investments in the U.S. Gulf Coast, the Middle East and Asia, positioning us to grow where growth exists; and finally, a low-cost structure that has productivity wide into its very core. These drivers will further enhance our market focus, continue to reduce our volatility, bolster our integration and our innovation and ultimately maximize shareholder value creation. Stepping to slide 16. Of course, the ultimate proof of our business model is the enhanced returns team Dow has delivered, earnings growth, enhanced cash flow and higher shareholder returns. And going forward, our team remains relentlessly focused on our priorities, delivering the operating and financial plan, accelerating earnings growth and value creation through the continued integration of Dow Corning and advancing to the Dow-DuPont transaction and intended spins. And we will do so despite persistent macro uncertainties. As I've said before, regional economic trends are mixed at best. North America and Europe show measured growth, with Dow products growing stronger than the market. Latin America, especially Brazil, which is beginning to recover, is a slow growth environment. However, we do see bright spots there, particularly the Andean economies and Mexico. And economic transitions are underway in Asia, notably China. In this environment, we will continue to find growth where growth exists. That includes our core consumer-led markets of packaging, automotive and construction. As we establish the foundation for the new Dow, we have the right tools in hand to build the world's leading material science company and our four-year streak, 16 consecutive quarters, of earnings growth and margin expansion fuels our excitement for the future. In closing, on slide 17, we have not nor will we lose sight of our priorities. Dow will continue to deliver through our focused portfolio, integration, our innovation and our geographic reach. Through our relentless focus on our execution and on maximizing value creation for our customers, for our shareholders, for the near-term and for the long-term. With that, Neal, let's turn it to Q&A. Neal Sheorey : Thank you, Andrew. Now, we will move on to your questions. I ask that you please keep to one question so that we can allow as many people as possible the opportunity to ask a question. First, however, I would like to remind you that my earlier comments regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. Rochelle, would you please explain the Q&A procedure? Operator : Thank you And we'll take our first question from Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo Securities. Frank J. Mitsch: Hey, good morning, gentlemen and a nice quarter. Andrew N. Liveris: Thanks, Frank. Frank J. Mitsch: As I look at the beat that you had and particularly the terrific volumes that you're seeing that we're not really hearing from a lot of other companies out there, and especially given the fact that three months ago we probably weren't as optimistic as what these results turned out to be, what exactly happened over the past three months to lead to this major upside? Andrew N. Liveris: I'll start off and I'll give it to Jim. At the end of the day, the volume is a harbinger of the product mix, Frank. There's no question that out there consumer demand exists. I just came back from China. I participated in a couple of interesting market-driven events like Walmart had a food safety seminar. There is huge demand for safe food product supply in China. So that type of driver is actually growing double digits, way above the Chinese economy. So where things are weak is in the industrial economy around the world. But where things are strong is safety drivers, hygiene drivers, environmental drivers and actually consumer drivers. And I think our product mix, especially with Dow Corning now added in which has given us new growth synergies, is double down and triple down on that part of the portfolio. And that's also true in packaging and plastics, electrical and telecom and elastomers. Jim, did you want to add? James R. Fitterling: I would just say in the weak spots, Andrew covered them. In oil and gas, although we've seen a little bit of rebound in the energy sector, it's not enough yet to have a significant impact. And industrial solutions has got some weakness in oil and gas, steel, industrial coatings applications for steel and also some EO derivatives in the ag space. And in Latin America, really Brazil is the story. Our sales in Latin America are good, but Brazil is at bottom and trying to recover right now. Otherwise, the rest of the businesses had strong volume performance and strong demand. North America, Europe, China, Southeast Asia and a little softness in the Middle East because of what's going on with the oil economy. Operator : And next we'll move to David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. David I. Begleiter: Thank you. Good morning. Andrew N. Liveris: Good morning. David I. Begleiter: Andrew, another strong quarter in plastics. As we head into 2017 and the startup of a number of ethylene crackers, and even 2018, what's your view on U.S. ethylene chain margin in 2017? Andrew N. Liveris: Yeah, Jim, why don't you take that one. James R. Fitterling: Yeah, David, I think the startup of the crackers it's going to be staged over 2017, so our view is you're going to see, obviously from our perspective, some uptick in our sales growth because we've got three new trains from Sadara running now. We'll have a fourth one coming up in first quarter in Sadara and then mid-2017 we've got our Gulf Coast projects coming on. So I think from our perspective, we've been running the franchise flat out for the last 12 months and inventories are at five-year lows in the downstream chain. So our view is the market demand \u2013 as long as you don't have a cataclysmic event in the economy, the market demand is going to be there for these products and the timing of these startups is going to be such that I don't think you're going to see it really loosen up that much next year. Andrew N. Liveris: And bottom-line is that everyone's expectations of a very weak ethylene market in 2017, in our view are way too pessimistic. We're already seeing delays and notably our three PE units started up in Sadara are running flat out and so it's a harbinger of strong demand drivers, especially the areas Jim and I have referred to already. Operator : And, next, we'll move on to Steve Byrne with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Stephen Byrne : Hi. Continuing on this ethylene chain margin discussion, how would you characterize the feedstock mix in your ethylene crackers right now? How does that compare to where it's been the last couple of years and more importantly, where do you see it going over the next couple years? Andrew N. Liveris: Go ahead, Jim. James R. Fitterling: So our mix right now is still light, so obviously ethane and propane both in the mix and it just depends on what part of the world you're in, what's in and what particular week, but that still looks good. Obviously, what you've seen through the course of this year is our naphtha-based units become more competitive, so you're seeing good equity earnings out of our Thai joint ventures. You've seen our positions in Europe become stronger over the last couple of years \u2013 I think that continues to play out. Our view is that propane is still long and propane is Dow's big advantage in fleet feedstock flexibility. Propane is still long for some time to come. Ethane is still long until you get to the end of all these projects coming on, which is more like the 1920 timeframe, so our view is we're still going to see some very good chain margin in this space. Operator : And, next, Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan will have a question. Jeffrey J. Zekauskas: Thanks very much. In your Performance Plastics discussion for the fourth quarter, you framed things year-over-year and last year in Performance Plastics you made about $1.3 billion in EBITDA and it looks like \u2013 you seem to say that you're going to be flat to down, which would be sort of roughly a flat performance in the fourth quarter from the third quarter even though propylene prices are up and polyethylene prices are up. Regionally, where are you feeling a squeeze and is this the correct characterization of your guidance? Andrew N. Liveris: Go ahead, Jim. James R. Fitterling: I would say, Jeff, the difference I would say is we've got turnarounds in this quarter that are fairly significant, so the Louisiana three turnaround the majority of that cost comes in this quarter and we expect that unit to be up sometime mid-November. That is not just a turnaround but it's also tying in the ethane cracking flexibility, which is both front end on the furnaces and back end on the distillations section and separation section of the plant, so that's a big turnaround. You still got Sadara startup costs for another polyethylene train that comes up in first quarter, so those are neither one in last year. The other example I would give you is when you look at this quarter and third quarter, if you look at the margin compression year-over-year, half of that is from Sadara startup costs in the beginning of the LA-3 turnaround. So I don't think we're foretelling that there is a big margin compression coming here or there is a big drop-off in demand. I think it's really more related to one-off items. We've also been doing turnarounds in our polyethylene derivatives space, so in Seadrift, where we're heavy on electrical and telecom capacity, we've been doing some turnarounds and debottlenecks and reliability work there. We're doing the similar types of things in St. Charles in our LP-6 plant. We're getting ready for really the Texas 9 cracker coming up and the ability to have more ethylene down in the Gulf Coast and get as much as we can out of the franchise in the Gulf Coast. Operator : And, next, we'll move on to P.J. Juvekar with Citi. P.J. Juvekar: Yes. Hi. Good morning. Andrew N. Liveris: Good morning, P.J. P.J. Juvekar: You have significant investments coming online in the Gulf Coast, Sadara and you have Texas 9 PDH. When you look at all this, how much total incremental EBITDA do you expect from all these investments? And if there is a potential downturn, let's say in 2018-2019, do you think this incremental EBITDA can offset any ethylene downturn? Thank you. Andrew N. Liveris: Howard, why don't you take the first part of that question on EBITDA forecasting. Howard I. Ungerleider: Yeah. Well, I mean, I think you have to go back and you have to have a view of whether you're a bull or a bear in the cycle. I mean, we put out a long-term range in 2014 at the Investor Day and we said, look, all of these projects add at least $3 billion of EBITDA over the long-term and we're still standing by that number. That's a long-term number and when you add it all up, that's where we see the long-term. Andrew N. Liveris: And, Jim, on the ethylene part? James R. Fitterling: Yeah. So P.J., when we authorized all of these investments, we said we expected greater than $3 billion of EBITDA impact out of all of them. And as Howard said, at any point in time you can have some cash margins that are above or below where we are right now. PDH today \u2013 case in point, St. Charles was right on the line with what we've said. PDH today is still running very positive cash margins, even in a low propylene environment, it's running very positive cash margins. LA-3, the real EBITDA increment from LA-3 is the fact you get 250,000 tons a year more ethylene out of that. So that's right to our bottom-line. That's produced for us versus purchased, so that goes to the bottom-line. And Texas 9 in derivatives is a whole new slate of products. It's really four of our highest value-add derivatives plan on that franchise, it's our highest growing segment. So we're going to continue to shift the mix here up in the higher-performing products and away from the most commoditized parts of the earnings. So we're still bullish on the fact that we're going to deliver these results. Andrew N. Liveris: And just to get it out now, I know you guys are all into the plastics forecast here, this company \u2013 the next last slide I did in the deck shows consistent earnings growth with the plastics profile having obviously an effect but it doesn't wobble the company as much as it used to because of the value add point Jim just finished on, plus the forecast going forward on the supply side shows more of a plateau in these next few years despite these supply adds because of the delays. So we think high-operating rate environments and strong value-add demand drivers like packaging, E&T and elastomers builds margin for Dow from here, not destroys margin. Add to that the feedstock flexibility point on the previous question, that's an expanding margin scenario in one of our core franchises. Operator : And, next, we'll move on to Jonas Oxgaard with Bernstein. Jonas Oxgaard : Morning. Andrew N. Liveris: Morning. Jonas Oxgaard : Another nice quarter. Appreciate it. Looking at Sadara, in your numbers, you said 80 million pounds sold. If my math is right, that's about 10% of the utilization. Looking at next quarter, everything is running full out. Does that mean you'll reach somewhere around 90% utilization on the actual plant? And how should I think about the EBITDA or the daily income contribution from this? Andrew N. Liveris: Yeah, so just to be very clear, we have four units running of the 24 that have to start up. And so we've got a fair while to go before we get up on the utilization rate for the whole complex. The four units that are running, clearly the three polyethylene trains are running flat out. That was the point we were making earlier. So we are very early in the capacity utilization. We still expect lender reliability tests in 2018 timeframe. So 2017 is going to be a big startup year for us. However, the headwind will start becoming more tailwind and I'll give that part of it to Howard. Howard I. Ungerleider: Yeah, Jonas. Good morning. I would say, look, in the fourth quarter, we will have a tailwind in plastics for Sadara, but offset by the comments that Jim made relative to Louisiana 3 turnaround and some of the higher costs coming globally from a feedstock standpoint. But 2017, it will definitely be a tailwind for plastics. But as Andrew said, you still have 22 units that you're in the steep part of the curve in spending. And those are all in PMC with the exception of one additional polyolefins unit that'll start up in the first quarter. So PMC will be a headwind all through 2017. Operator : And next we'll move to Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Duffy Fischer : Yes. Good morning. Andrew N. Liveris: Morning, Duffy. Duffy Fischer : Wanted to go back to the volume number in the Performance Plastics segment. And I was wondering if you could talk about it maybe in three buckets. So how much of that volume improvement was your existing asset base that just ran harder, so on the olefin side this quarter? How much was new olefins capacity, either debottlenecks or some of the new plants coming online? And then how much was the downstream value added where you were able to upgrade those olefins into capacity that wasn't utilized a year ago? Andrew N. Liveris: Jim. We don't think of it that way, but I think we'll give you a stab. Go ahead. James R. Fitterling: Just high-level, Duffy, it was the first that you mentioned, existing asset base. I said before, we've been running flat out, sold out in those units. We've achieved some pretty phenomenal operating rates in those units in spite of the fact that we've turned a few of them around during this year to get ready for the Texas-9 startup. And then I would say the rest of it is the latter part, the mix shift and the value add from the mix shift is the big thing. There really hasn't been enough time to have enough of an impact from new capacity. As Sadara starts up, you've got to fill that supply chain to get the product out, so we've been moving a lot of product out into that supply chain. We sold some material, as was discussed earlier, in the third quarter in the month of September. However, you're going to see more of those sales come in the fourth quarter as we've got three units running and getting that supply chain full. And for that reason, a lot of our growth in the third quarter was North America, Europe and then China and Southeast Asia. And I would say had we had more Sadara volume in the third quarter, we'd have had more growth in China. Andrew N. Liveris: A lot of the investment we've done in the machine, the assets the last many years has now made that machine more reliable. So our production is up versus same quarter last year, up 9%. That's 1.9 billion pounds that we've sold in Q3 that we didn't sell a year-ago. Year-to-date, that number is 5.6 billion pounds. So kudos to our operations people. They're running safely, they're running reliably. And our salespeople have been able to get it out the door and move more volume to demand based on value add and, therefore, kept inventories quite low. So this machine is moving into the high-80%s operating rate. Right now it's 86%. As a totality of Dow, this is not just the ethylene integration piece that I'm referring to, I'm talking about the whole company. And so the value-add piece, when you think about innovation agenda, stretches across all of it, from the propylene derivatives to the ethylene derivatives to the silicone derivatives, all the value-add piece. And very few of our businesses today are we selling the strict monomer. Probably the last remaining example there is our acrylic chain, our performance monomer, where we are moving, driving all those monomers down to value-add polymers and emulsions. That's the last part of the Dow commodity engine that sells just commodities. Operator : And next we'll move on to Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Vincent S. Andrews: Thanks very much. Just a question. We've had some increases in the oil price more recently. And I guess as I'm thinking about what's left of this year and into next year and we think about the ethylene and polyethylene chain, do you anticipate those higher prices increasing the marginal cost of production and flowing through to product prices such that you can hold onto the recent $0.05 increase in polyethylene prices? Or should we expect seasonality and everything else to overwhelm that? Andrew N. Liveris: I think your last phrase defines it, but I'll let Jim get into the details. But in essence, there's always a lead lag factor, but as oil prices go up that's generally good for us over time. But there is always transitions. Jim, speak to it, please. James R. Fitterling: It's generally good. The feedstock for us is predominantly gas, and so what you see is it's remained low and steady over this time period and so we haven't seen any real move up in the input costs. We saw prices firm up in polyethylene at the end of third quarter and we've seen them firm into the beginning of fourth quarter and I think that's back to inventories being low and demand being high. And so as oil goes up, that just adds an element to prices being able to firm up in the near term. And that's our view. And I'll stop at trying to predict what's going to happen with oil price. But at least that's where we are today in the current quarter. Operator : And next we'll move to Peter Butler with Glen Hill Investments. Peter E. Butler: Good morning. Good morning. Management appears to be making really good progress improving the quality, consistency and predictability of the earnings stream. Would this encourage Dow's board to significantly boost the dividend payout ratio and boost the share repurchase program? It also could cause analysts to boost Dow's trend earnings growth projections in their models. Andrew N. Liveris: Go ahead, Howard. Howard I. Ungerleider: Yeah. Thanks and good morning, Peter. Thanks for noticing about the consistency in the increasing results. I appreciate it. Look, on the dividend and share repurchase, we have been on a streak here of a double-digit CAGR of growing our dividend for the last several years. Our payout ratio really hasn't changed. It's a 45% of net income target, long-term target, that will go back to the shareholders in the form of dividend growth. And we've been tracking at that number as the earnings has improved, net income has improved, we've improved the dividend. On stock buyback, the same. We've spent over $7 billion of cash in the last several years buying back stock. You saw that we entered the market again now that the shareholder vote was behind us on the Dow-DuPont transaction. We bought more than $400 million worth of stock back in the third quarter with about $1.9 billion left in our open program and so we're going continue to do that as well. Andrew N. Liveris: Yeah. I mean, look, I've said it many times on these calls and between calls. The last many years has been a proof point that we can be a consistent cash flow generator and earnings grower so we can return cash to owners. And that'll come through dividend and share buybacks while we fund our growth programs. We're coming off some pretty significant investment in CapEx here and so as we come off that CapEx spend, that's going to open up more of the cash flow. If we think we're undervalued, which we do, we'll buy back shares and we'll go back to our board for more authorization. But for sure being a consistent dividend grower is part of the Dow mix of returning money to our owners. Operator : And, next, we'll move on to John Roberts with UBS. John Roberts : Thank you. You announced you're divesting a small ethylene copolymers business which I assume overlapped with DuPont's packaging polymer businesses and is related to the antitrust issues. I know the Ag antitrust continues, but have you largely concluded the antitrust discussions outside of Ag? Andrew N. Liveris: Complex regulatory processes in EU, China and particularly \u2013 and in the U.S., those three in particular, but Brazil, remain in front of us in terms of whatever might come from them. We clearly have been in the market on the ethylene-acrylic acid copolymers and ionomers business under the PRIMACOR brand. That is one that we have foreshadowed. We have had no surprises in any of the discussions. They are going a little longer than we had hoped. As Ed I think said on his call, we expect Q1 close. We're very confident about that. We're not in a position to speak to specific remedies. We are waiting for those key jurisdictions. Just a note, by the way, we've got 10 approvals already, 10 jurisdictions have approved us. Some pretty key ones as well. However, having said that, setting the pace here through EC, DOJ, MOFCOM is our whole focus, and we're being very, very thoughtful about how to respond over time. You're going to see some filings from time to time especially out of EC. I think it's important to note that their process does that. Just know that we are quite aware of all of that and we are working towards \u2013 a few months shouldn't impact the value creation of a $30 billion deal. So taken a few more months, you should want us to all do that. Operator : And, next, we'll move to Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global. Hassan I. Ahmed: Good morning, Andrew. Andrew, through the course of the last couple of months, we've seen some pretty significant moves up in coal prices, right? Now as you sort of sit there and think through sort of the macro, call it ethylene, polyethylene pricing environment, do you see sort of these moves having an impact first and foremost on ethylene and polyethylene pricing? And secondly, do you see them having any sort of impact on future, call it CTO, MTO, CTP supply? Andrew N. Liveris: So as I mentioned earlier \u2013 I'm going to give the other part of the question to Jim here in a second, but just on the big energy picture as it relates to China in particular, I was just over there as I indicated. I would tell you China is de-industrializing very fast, Hassan. I have no confidence that they're going to allocate capital to coal or emissions-heavy investments. I think there will be some of that, but these are massive capital investments that have the problem of not being forecastable in terms of return. And that's the other pressure point. I believe certain enterprises have got this from literally the top leadership are under huge pressure to show returns. And they are having in essence a come-to-Jesus moment in terms of understanding how capital gets allocated between equity, property and other investments. It's much more Western financial environment appearing there, especially as they open up their financial sector, which they pretty much are committing to do. I think that recalibration in China is going to slow down coal heavy investments with time. The paradox there is I think they're going to go much heavy into nuclear. I think that's going to be their place of choice while they transition to LNG. So I am not confident at all that you're going to see CTO or MTO off of coal coming in anywhere near the pace that was foreshadowed. Jim on the margin aspects of it? James R. Fitterling: The only thing that I would add to what Andrew said is that most of the capacity that's on those CTO and MTO plays is heavily, heavily commodity-oriented C4, and it's not really an area that we play in significantly in that part of the world or really anywhere right now. So we're shifted towards a much higher mix, more driven towards the end-use markets that we talked about before. We still think, and we have thought for a long time, that people are pretty optimistic about the rate at which these plants are going to come on and how high they're going to run. And there is a dissatisfaction already with the returns on these investments that's heavily, heavily capital intensive to put in one of these operations relative to what you can do in the U.S. Gulf Coast or in the Middle East. Operator : And, Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse will have our next question. Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker) Thank you. You mentioned that within Ag that seeds are chugging along on the back of the Latin American demand on both price and volume. But can you just comment a little more about the key drivers here? And a little more on your expectations heading into Safrinha as well as pre-buying in the U.S.? And then also you mentioned crop protection was negative. I'm assuming most of that was insecticides in Brazil, but were there also challenges in Europe as well? Thank you. Andrew N. Liveris: Go ahead, Howard. Howard I. Ungerleider: Yeah. Good morning, Chris. So overall on the key drivers, I mean really proud of the Dow Ag team in the quarter. I mean that $141 million improvement versus same quarter year-ago, I'd break down the drivers into three buckets, and it's pretty much equally split. About one-third was due to the higher volumes and higher prices and specifically seed in Brazil for sure. About one-third came from just the continued drumbeat, steady drumbeat now for many quarters in a row on self-help productivity and cost cutting. And then the other one-third was really by the turnaround in currency. If you think about a year-ago, there were pretty big currency headwinds facing us in Ag, and it didn't help much \u2013 actually in the quarter I think it was 1 percentage point of the price up was related to currency and Ag. And actually overall at company level currency was a zero help to us. But it helped on the margin and certainly the delta change. That was the other one-third of the key drivers. When you think about why the volume was up in seeds in Brazil, I would say a couple of things. One, just the continued development of our new technologies that we continue to introduce, that farmers continue to get more and more comfortable that it does what it says, and it increases their yield and so they just continue to get used to it. I do think there was some early buying in the quarter. I mean the farmers \u2013 we don't get to choose the weather. The farmers decide when they get to plant, and I do think there was some of that that will a Q3 versus a Q4 move. So I would not count all of that is a Q3 gain. But we feel good about where we ended up in the quarter. Operator : And next we'll move to Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs. Robert Andrew Koort : Thank you. Good morning. Andrew N. Liveris: Good morning. Robert Andrew Koort : Jim, I was wondering you mentioned oil and gas, maybe some signs of life. Is that more of things flattening? Or are you actually seeing an uptick? And then could you also just give us in your deck that shows the polyethylene-ethylene long-term supply-demand balance, what your growth rates for both are assumed in those charts? Thanks. James R. Fitterling: Yeah. So on oil, Bob, really we've seen a flattening and kind of an uptick here in the U.S., which I think is \u2013 I think it's instructive that at $50 a barrel, you've got people moving rigs back into oil production down in the Gulf Coast. It hasn't been a lot. Remember, 1,500 rigs were moved out of production and you've got about 11 to 15 that have moved back in, but it is a move and it's starting in that direction. So there is cautious optimism there. I think if prices continue to firm up on oil, they continue to firm up toward the $55 maybe even next year into the $60 range, we're going to see more rigs coming back in. So shale gas is going to be competitive. Some of these fields can be competitive at $25 a barrel. So I think we've got a situation which is good for us that the U.S. is competitive and it's going to be there longer. And so when you look at where our assets are around the world, where it's a very good competitive cost position base is to have our franchise. As far as supply-demand balances and the numbers that are in here, we're still running at the traditional 1.3 times, 1.4 times GDP types of numbers for demand. And the real question mark is what's the GDP number that you plug into there? I would say at the beginning of the year, we were starting with something like a 3% global GDP. And we backed off of that some through the year more towards global 2.5% number. But look, we've had 6% growth all year, and we've oscillated between 6% and 10% in China year-over-year. We've operated in kind of the 4% range in North America, similar maybe a little bit stronger in Europe and kind of flat in Latin America. So our view going forward is these operating rates are strong, and it's not just reflective of the fact that you've got the historical rates. It's also sustainable packaging is driving a lot of trends toward plastics, and that's competing against other materials, and we're knocking other materials out. So I think the sustainability trends are helping us stay there. Operator : And next we will hear from Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial. Don Carson : Andrew, a question on Ag antitrust approvals. Your strong Ag results I think underscore your under-appreciated Brazilian corn seed position. You've actually got a bigger share there than DuPont. So wondering if overlap in the seed is an issue in South America? And then more broadly, how do you address the non-product overlap issues? The EC has made some \u2013 raised some concerns about potentially reduced innovation due to decline in R&D spending as you combine. And then how do you put your deal in the context of the other two transactions going on, which the regulators have said they'll also look at as well? Andrew N. Liveris: Yeah. Thank you, Don. You have to start where you were leaving off. I mentioned many times already on this call that food and agriculture (51:55) discussions for countries and regions. And so just like energy and just like security, food is right at the centerpiece of political, basically making sure the constituencies are satisfied that they have adequate and safe food supplies. So agricultural lobbies and farm lobbies are strong everywhere and, of course, create unlevel playing fields around the world. That's why there's some jurisdictions without GMOs and some with GMOs and there're some jurisdictions that have trade protection barriers and some that don't. So this is not a new conversation. Eyes wide open going into our transaction, as you all know, you in particular, about 10 years of asking the question, what are you going to do with Ag. We always felt that there was a complementarity between biology and chemistry and an integrated farm science helping the farmers. Integrated farm science, including big data, is expensive. And R&D to fuel that has to be funded in a public company over long cycles. In short-cycle investment type of thesis, not many people have patient money for long-cycle investment. So smart scale and innovation and pro-competitiveness for farmers to get the very best out of their plot of land, whether it's an acre or 10,000 acres. Row crops and niche crops and the science needed to get more food, safe, reliable food, to all the citizens of those countries is mission at hand with our deal and, frankly, I'm sure it's the mission at hand for the other deals. We are first in in all jurisdictions. We are very eyes wide open on what it means to create a pro-competitive farm lobby, and we believe our deal does that. And if there are pushbacks based on various views on how those innovations come to market, we will definitely engage and are engaging. Again, we are taking the time to listen very carefully to what the jurisdictions want us to do and we are very, very thoughtful on those remedies. And we're confident we'll close this deal in Q1 and, frankly, solve that complex equation that you asked about and hopefully I've articulated on. Operator : And next we'll move on to Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Kevin W. McCarthy: Yes. Good morning, gentlemen. A question on your preferred. We've noted that the share price is once again above the trigger level of $53.72 over the past half dozen sessions or so. So my question is, if that were to continue such that you could force conversion, how might you react in the wake of that? In other words, would you expect to take action to offset the step-up in the common count? And, if so, how quickly might you be able to offset that? Thanks. Howard I. Ungerleider: Thanks, Kevin. Look, we've been working both the numerator and the denominator on that equation for quite a while. So as we articulated in the results today, 16 consecutive quarters of year-over-year earnings growth and margin expansion to work the numerator. And we have been proactively working the denominator on share count. We bought back, I think I mentioned earlier, over $7 billion worth of stock here in the last several years and another $400 million. We're planning to continue to do that. So we're working the equation both ways and you should continue to expect that. Operator : And next we'll move to Aleksey Yefremov with Nomura Securities. Aleksey Yefremov : Good morning. Thank you. Should Sadara start-up costs go away when all the units start up or will they represent some kind of fixed cost on a go-forward basis? And also in the short run, do you expect in the fourth quarter the net contribution from Sadara to be in that positive between the start-up costs and increased earnings from polyethylene units? Andrew N. Liveris: Go ahead, Jim. James R. Fitterling: Yeah. So on Sadara start-up costs, right now we're in the EO and derivatives and getting ready for the isocyanates block, which is nine integrated units in that block to start up. And that'll be first quarter, second quarter, third quarter types of timing for those things. So you expect to see that through next year and that's a significant number of units. And then once you get to 2018, you'll see those start-up costs go away and we'll be back to having the full units up and operational. And, at the same time, on the ground in Sadara within the joint venture, they're working hard to get their cost positions where it needs to be and get their comps where they need to be to be competitive as a JV in their own right. So I think both of those things are going to have an impact in 2018. Howard has said we expect plastics to show some positive next year. We expect it still to be a headwind in Industrial Solutions and Performance Materials, but we're working through all that right now. Operator : And at this time, we have time for one more question. We'll hear from Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Arun Viswanathan : Great. Thanks for squeezing me in here. I guess just had a question. I'm trying to understand how you guys are performing better than your markets, especially in Europe and in automotive Europe. EMEA was up 9%, but was that more Middle East or was that Europe? What are you seeing in Europe? And then also what are you seeing in automotive going forward? Thank you. Andrew N. Liveris: Go ahead, Jim. James R. Fitterling: Yeah. So I think the issue is where we're playing in automotive. When you look at the number of applications that we're in, whether it's our plastics products, ENGAGE, things like bumper fascia for the cars. Our light weighting solutions like our crash-durable adhesives. So as companies continue to use carbon fiber aluminum, other things to bond to the steel frame, they need more adhesives in that vehicle. And when you get to it, we look at content per vehicle. So even though, in some areas, production in automotive year-over-year has flattened out, we're expanding our content per vehicle in that space and I think that's what's driving the growth for us. Elastomers is a big product line that sells a lot into the automotive sector. Coatings as well, into areas like sound dampening for the car is an area that people sometimes don't appreciate how much content goes into the automotive space. So that's how we're growing better than market is really getting the content per vehicle up and getting the number of solutions on the new vehicles up. And as you go into heavier vehicles, into trucks, you get into crossovers and higher-performing vehicles, like the higher-performing sedans, the ones that people are paying more value for, we have more content on those vehicles than, say, the entry-level sedan. Operator : And at this time, I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Neal Sheorey for any additional or closing remarks. Neal Sheorey : Great. Thank you. Andrew, before we close the call, would you like to make any final comments? Andrew N. Liveris: I'd kind of want to wrap the call by one more time referring to the visuals we showed you on slides 15 and 16, which shows the CAGR of 6% on the earnings growth and also EBITDA growth. They also show what we've done on cash flow and what we've done on the TSI (59:05). I would tell you that, again, controlling what we can control, self-help and productivity and an innovation agenda speaks to that last question a bit which is why are we growing volumes above market. We're growing where growth is needed and we have built a portfolio really under all sorts of environments that can perform, a portfolio for all seasons. We're very focused here on running the business to its maximum EBITDA, EPS output. At the same time, we're very focused on closing the Dow-DuPont deal and we're powering on (59:36) those things, I'm very proud of our team and that we've been able to do both. There's never been a better time at Dow. We're better positioned than ever before. We have a strong track record, multiple years now of delivering and we're delivering these results under these macros that frankly are not very helpful. But we have the portfolio and we've built the business, and you can expect us to return cash to our owners. That's our focus and this value creation of the deal in front us, once we close the deal and implement the synergies and get going on the spins, we'll create even more value for our owners. So I really want to double down on the fact this is a company that's delivering and we will continue to do so. Neal Sheorey : Thank you, everyone, for your questions. As always, we appreciate your interest in The Dow Chemical Company. For your reference a copy of our prepared remarks will be posted on Dow's website later today. This concludes our call for today. We look forward to speaking with you again soon. Thank you. Operator : And that will conclude today's call. We thank you for your participation.",

If you turn to slide three, good morning, everyone. The fourth quarter of 2016 capped another strong year of performance for Dow in which the full power of our business model was once again on display. We reached 17 consecutive quarters of EPS growth, 13 consecutive quarters of volume growth, another year of record EBITDA, and shareholder returns that have outpaced the industry and the market. As you can see, the Dow team delivered exactly as we said we would in 2016. We have delivered this performance day in and day out against one of the most unpredictable and volatile macroeconomic environments in our history, mitigating risk and driving both top line and bottom line growth. In a world of constant uncertainty, our focus on targeted markets, productivity and investing in strategic growth drivers has resulted in consistent performance, no matter the headwinds, and we have done this while rewarding our shareholders with substantial share repurchases and consistent increases in our dividend, now at a record level. We are exiting 2016 with strong momentum and this bodes well for 2017. Our strategic agenda, our strength in portfolio and our determination to deliver served us well throughout 2016, as it has over the past four-plus years, and as it will continue to do so into 2017 and beyond. Turning to slide four, this brings me to our results for the full year. Here are the headlines. Financially, we grew full year EPS for the fourth consecutive year. We achieved record full year EBITDA. We converted all of our Series A preferred shares into common stock. And we returned $3 billion to shareholders, resulting in a TSR that outperformed the market. Operationally, we exceeded our productivity target. In fact, since 2012, we have removed $2.7 billion of total costs out of our system. We continued our streak of volume growth, which is now more than three full years running. We capitalized on our higher quality portfolio, illustrated through our operating EBITDA margin, which is north of 20%. And we drove operational excellence to ensure we had the pounds to meet growing consumer demand for Dow products. And strategically, we made significant progress on all of our investments for growth, positioning each to deliver in the year ahead. We closed Dow Corning, which was immediately accretive to earnings and far surpassed every value and synergy capture target we set. We achieved multiple milestones to advance the proposed merger with DuPont, including finalizing our plans to ensure we deliver the $1.5 billion of cost synergies for Material Co. Sadara completed its construction phase and is turning its attention to startup activity. And we completed two expansions as part of our U.S. Gulf Coast investment and our new cracker and derivatives remain on target for startup later this year. In sum, 2016 proved to be yet another successful and strategically important year for Dow. We achieved new milestones and drove our focused agenda with clear priorities. I'll have more to say later in the call regarding our track record of success, our outlook, and our priorities. First though, I will turn the call over to Howard to discuss our quarterly performance and our Ag results, and then Jim will then cover the remaining businesses. Howard? Howard I. Ungerleider: Thanks, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. Turning to slide six, we closed the year with another strong quarterly financial performance. Dow's reported sales in the quarter were $13 billion. Excluding acquisitions, sales grew in nearly all segments, as volume rose 3% and pricing was flat. We reported operating earnings per share of $0.99. Notably, our fourth quarter performance was the highest EPS result of 2016 and in fact our highest fourth quarter in a decade. You will see that our GAAP EPS was primarily impacted by a charge for asbestos-related matters, which was largely due to a voluntary accounting change to accrue for defense costs that were previously expensed as incurred. This change reflects our adoption of common practice as well as our confidence in the improved processes and systems we put in place two years ago to better predict these costs. It also accrues for pending and potential future claims through the terminal date, which drives less volatility in the accrual level. Equally important, these moves provide an increased level of financial transparency through better visibility into our underlying performance. Our record EBITDA of $2.6 billion in the quarter was driven by strong performance in our downstream segment. Consumer Solutions set an all-time quarterly EBITDA record and Infrastructure Solutions and Agricultural Sciences both set fourth quarter EBITDA records. We also continued our focus on productivity and cost out, delivering $60 million in the quarter. And we delivered $1.9 billion of cash flow from operations. Finally, we continued to see the powerful contribution from Dow Corning in the quarter in both our Consumer Solutions and Infrastructure Solutions segments. I'm very pleased with the rapid progress we've made in just seven short months since closing this transaction. Our teams continue to surpass every target set for this integration. On the cost side, we exited the quarter with a cost synergy run rate of more than $360 million. This is more than three times our year-end target and puts us well ahead of schedule to achieve our two-year run rate target of $400 million. It also speaks to the focused and rapid implementation mindset that our teams have taken since day one. On the growth side, we continue to see early cross-selling wins and customer excitement continues to increase as they see the value of our integrated portfolio with silicones, which allows us to go deeper in our key end markets of infrastructure, consumer care, and transportation. Turning to slide eight and our business results, Ag Sciences reported record fourth quarter and full year EBITDA, driven by sales gains from price and volume growth, as well as sales of new Crop Protection technologies, currency improvements, and self-help actions. We've said for years that innovation has always been the centerpiece of our Dow AgroSciences business, and even in this down ag market, we continue to advance our novel technologies. For example, we recently received notification from the EPA that it has federally registered Enlist Duo herbicide for use on Enlist cotton. Additionally, the EPA has now extended the geography for the product from 15 to now 34 states, which covers the vast majority of cotton, corn, and soybean acres in the United States. This marks the full system approval of the Enlist cotton trait, which will now be available this spring. And in 2017, we will launch and ramp several more Crop Protection technologies. Isoclast insecticide will ramp in the U.S., Japan, Korea, and Latin America. We will launch Arylex herbicide in Europe, Canada, and Australia. And we will pursue line extensions such as Resicore herbicide in the U.S. and Strongarm herbicide in Latin America. You can expect innovation to remain front and center in Dow AgroSciences. Now, let me turn it over to Jim to cover the rest of our segments. James R. Fitterling: Thank you, Howard. Moving to Consumer Solutions on slide nine, the segment reported record quarterly and full year EBITDA, boosted by the integration of Dow Corning, as well as new commercial wins and market share gain. This marks the fifth consecutive year of EBITDA growth for this segment. Dow Automotive reported its eighth consecutive quarter of EBITDA growth. The business had record fourth quarter and full year EBITDA, driven by double-digit volume gains in Greater China and Brazil. Dow Auto also continues to grow well in excess of industry growth rates fueled by its innovation strength. As an example, our structural adhesives platform grew nearly four times the market year-over-year. Consumer Care achieved double-digit volume growth in the Americas on market share gains of new product introductions tied to trends in gluten-free food and single dose detergent applications. Dow Electronic Materials achieved record fourth quarter and full year EBITDA results on continued above market volume growth. The business has now grown EBITDA for the sixth consecutive quarter. And the silicones business in this segment saw continued strong demand and volume gains in Asia Pacific, particularly in the automotive and electronics end markets. Moving to Infrastructure Solutions on slide 10, the segment reported record fourth quarter EBITDA, driven by the integration of Dow Corning. Dow Building & Construction delivered volume growth on double-digit gains for cellulosics-based construction chemicals, which is now in a sold-out position. Business also delivered its second consecutive year of record EBITDA. The silicones business in this segment reported volume growth in Asia Pacific and EMEAI on robust demands in pressure-sensitive adhesives and release liners. In Energy & Water Solutions, water volume declined year-over-year due to soft demand for reverse osmosis membranes used in industrial applications. However, RO membrane sales grew double digits sequentially driven by increased demand in emerging geographies. Energy saw lower volume on reduced demand from refining and processing end markets, however, we did see early signs of a rebound in U.S. shale, which led to business reporting double-digit growth sequentially in this end market. Dow Coating Materials reported volume gains in all market sectors. And in Performance Monomers, we progressed well through a large planned turnaround at our Texas site. On slide 11, Performance Materials & Chemicals reported volume growth with gains in most geographic areas, led by double-digit volume growth in Greater China. Polyurethanes reported volume growth for the 15th consecutive quarter. This business saw a double-digit increase in demand for a higher-margin systems application. Industrial Solutions reported record sales volume in Greater China and higher equity earnings, driven by improved MEG pricing. Moving to slide 12, Performance Plastics reported record sales volume in most businesses. Dow Packaging and Specialty Plastics delivered record quarterly and full year sales volume on ramping Sadara production, which led to double-digit growth in Greater China and strong demand in North America and EMEAI. Dow Elastomers also reported a record quarterly and full year sales volume, driven by continued strength in the automotive end market, as well as steady growth in hot melt adhesives and share gains in athletic footwear. We delivered these results despite a nearly $125 million impact from planned maintenance and expansion activities in the quarter, plus an additional $100 million increase in feedstocks and energy costs. We also achieved two important capacity expansions in the quarter. In Seadrift, Texas, we completed the expansion of a polyethylene facility in December and in Plaquemine, Louisiana, during our planned turnaround at the LA-3 cracker, we expanded that plant's ethylene capacity by up to 250,000 tons by increasing the ability to crack ethane, while maintaining the flexibility to crack propane, butane and naphtha. Since startup, we've been conducting test runs of the cracker's new capabilities and we've ramped the ethane cracking capabilities while also proving the operational reliability of the plant. Today, I can report that we've exceeded the original design case by approving the plant's ability to crack more than 80% ethane and we've maintained the flexibility to switch between ethane and propane. This agility further maximizes our cash generation to deliver competitive advantage for our downstream businesses. As we've said before, the long-term winners are the players that own the entire chain integration and can manage the swings through feedstock flexibility, geographic diversification, innovation and differentiation. Dow's best-in-class feedstock flexibility in the U.S. and Europe remain a key differentiator to our competitive advantage. No one rivals Dow on this front and our results have shown this time and time again. Now, let me turn the call back over to Andrew. Andrew N. Liveris: Thank you, Jim, and if everyone can turn to slide 14 and turning to our outlook, where we are seeing early signs of positive momentum with the U.S. in expansionary mode, driven by ongoing strength of the consumer and the tailwind of the new incoming Trump administration, which really has articulated a focus on structural reforms in several areas, including competitive taxes, smart regulation and fair trade rules. As you know, I met with the President and his team earlier this week and I'm honored to be serving a leadership role in working closely with the administration to create a vibrant U.S. manufacturing sector through a robust action agenda with focus on near-term actionable plans. Europe continues its gradual recovery despite increasing political uncertainty. Sustained growth of Asia's middle class continues to drive demand through that region and we see improvement in Latin America from its low base. We expect demand for Dow's portfolio will continue to be strong in 2017, particularly in our downstream market-facing businesses. With our broad geographic reach, our unique innovations, and integration strength, we will see stronger growth in a world that has begun to exhibit stronger growth in the last few years. And finally, with consumers increasingly demanding Dow's products, our strategic investments are well timed to deliver the next layers of earnings and cash flow generation. Sadara will continue ramping through 2017 to meet growth in Asia, Africa, the Middle East, India and Eastern Europe. Dow Corning adds new market channels and a technology tool kit that enhances our core Materials Sciences businesses. And the U.S. Gulf projects bolster our Performance Plastics franchise in the Americas with the industry's broadest and most differentiated derivative slate. Turning to slide 15, taking a high view and elevating from the near-term outlook, what you have seen from Dow is that it is the consistency and agility of our business model that has proven time and again to be the key driver of our consistent outperformance versus our peers in the market, no matter what the macros throw at us. This business model was reviewed and reaffirmed by our board and executive management team in 2013 and we've been executing against it with a relentless focus on specific goals. Grow earnings, significantly tilt our portfolio toward attractive, consumer-driven end markets, upgrade the quality of our business by divesting low ROC non-strategic assets, drive a culture of continuous productivity, enhance our portfolio with high-quality complementary market-focused businesses, such as Dow Corning silicones franchise, and execute integration and innovation investments to capture growth for the future. When we set out on this path, we knew that our success would ultimately be reflected in the value we unlocked for our shareholders and our success is evident, not just this quarter, not just this year, but for these last four years. The results of our actions are clear and they're powerful. Speaking in specifics, our portfolio is now 60% driven by consumer-led markets. We've delivered a 7% EBITDA CAGR since 2012 and have seen our average margin improve 700 basis points over that timeframe. We've grown EPS at an 18% CAGR, nearly double our 10% target. We've returned more than $16 billion of cash to our owners and our TSR has outperformed the S&P 500 and the S&P Chemicals Index on a one-year, three-year and five-year basis. And as we close the fourth year of executing this growth roadmap, we have positioned the portfolio with our mantra being to deliver stable EPS and EBITDA growth across all market conditions. Looking forward, the Dow team remains focused on continuing this path of execution, growth and shareholder returns. Turning to slide 16, this brings me to our 2017 priorities, which are clear and well defined. One, deliver on our operating and financial plan. Two, close the DowDuPont merger, which we expect will occur in the first half of 2017 and quickly drive toward the intended spins. And three, capitalize on our growth investments; U.S. Gulf Coast, Sadara, Dow Corning and our innovation pipeline. Dow has never been better positioned to win for our shareholders, our customers and our employees. The task is clear, and we have the right strategy, the right portfolio and the right team. We will deliver. With that, Neal, let's turn to Q&A. Neal Sheorey : Thank you, Andrew. Now, we will move on to your questions. I ask that you please keep to one question so that we can allow as many people as possible the opportunity to ask a question. First, however, I would like to remind you that my comments regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. Rochelle, would you please explain the Q&A procedure? Operator : Thank you. And our first question, we'll hear from Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo Securities. Frank J. Mitsch: Good morning, gentlemen, an impressive end to the year. Andrew N. Liveris: Thanks. Frank J. Mitsch: Hey, we're seeing a lot of publicity regarding the European Union's view on the transaction, and the deadline is now March 14. We're not hearing that much regarding the U.S. and China. I'd appreciate, I guess, your characterization of how your discussions are with the various significant regulatory agencies out there, and the confidence level you have in being able to complete the transaction with DuPont in the first part of this year. Andrew N. Liveris: Yes, thank you, Frank. Look, the long pole in the tent has always been the EC clearance, EU clearance. And they are obviously very public as they go through their various milestones. That's very different to other agencies around the world. And we've got clearance in significant number, double-digit number of agencies around the world. But the DOJ or the U.S. and the Chinese MOFCOM are being paralleled with the EC. So we have teams working on that. They don't have the publicity. I was in China just last week, and we are confident that as we saw the EC regulatory issues, and as Ed said on his call, we're confident we can solve them. We're confident that we can get to the right answer that satisfies their innovation remedy request, which, as he said, was speaking to R&D capability of whatever we end up divesting. We believe we can find that sweet spot. And once we've done that, the others will fall in. But we certainly do believe, as he said, and we reaffirm, and there's no dialog between the two companies. We're working hand in glove on this. We clearly can see that this could be a Q2 close, and we understand that. Operator : And next, we'll move to Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global. Hassan I. Ahmed: Morning, Andrew. Just wanted to follow up on the pending merger. Look, I mean, since, call it December 2015, when the merger was announced, clearly the world has changed a lot. Be it the EU side of things, be it higher oil prices, new regime in the U.S., Brexit, et cetera, et cetera. So all of this said, how are you thinking about the synergy calculus? Be it the cost synergies, the growth synergies. Have those numbers changed a bit? Are they higher in your mind? Are they lower? Can you comment about that? Andrew N. Liveris: Well, I'm going to pass on to Jim, who's running that entire program, but just to preface his comments with one that may be obvious to all of you, but maybe not. Because we've had this extended time, both companies decided to get into it ahead of the close. So, Ed and his team are taking out costs, we're taking out costs, and we're making sure we're counting those against the $3 billion we've all committed. We're not waiting for the approval. Now, you might argue that some of those can't be optimized, because we can't talk to each other on certain things for obvious reasons. So there is a need to make sure that we ground the $3 billion as a rolling number, counting the stuff we've done ahead, but I'll let Jim comment on the confidence level of that number as we sit here today. Jim? James R. Fitterling: Yes, I would say the confidence number is very high. The team, through the end of third quarter, had documented more than 380 integration synergy projects, so we have a good view to what we need to do once we get to close. Obviously, many of those can't be implemented until we get to close, but as Andrew said, whatever we can accelerate in the near-term, we're trying to accelerate independently. A good example of that would be as the DowDuPont approval is extended, we really shifted some resources internally to go heavy on what we could do with Dow Corning to accelerate that integration, and you see that in this quarter's results. And that has allowed us to get some things done earlier than we expected on Dow Corning, and those resources will now be available once we close the DowDuPont deal to move forward. Operator : And next, we'll move to P.J. Juvekar with Citigroup. P.J. Juvekar: Yes, good morning. Andrew N. Liveris: Morning, P.J. P.J. Juvekar: Is your Texas-9 cracker on time for mid-2017 startup, and when do you begin to see the full benefit of PDH, as well as Sadara and what's your latest estimate on EBITDA contribution there? Thank you. Andrew N. Liveris: Go ahead, Jim. James R. Fitterling: Texas-9 is on track. I was down there two weeks ago. We've crossed 95% mechanical completion, and greater than 50% of the unit operations inside that plant are already into commissioning and startup, and we're turning over units every week. It's really, really coming together strong. PDH, after our early part of the year incidents as PDH, it ran very strong. It ran at nameplate for most of the rest of the year, and so it continues to be able to deliver the capabilities that we said. And obviously, the limit of that is the propane, propylene instantaneous market spreads, which right now continue to be pretty good. So we're in good shape on both of those. Operator : And next, we'll move on to Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Steve Byrne : Yes, thank you. With respect to the European Commission concerns, how would you rank their concerns from your view? Overlap between pipeline and patents between the companies, conversely the potential rationalization of pipeline products versus maybe a third bucket being the number of companies out there that are discovering new molecules in crop protection. Those three buckets, if you would, please. Andrew N. Liveris: Yes, Steve, see, that's way too much detail than I'm going to offer you in terms of an answer, but I can give you a high level view that, as Ed said, this is focused in on crop protection, and it's really focused in on discovery. So, when we sit in front of them and talk through what the two companies bring to the table on discovery and product development, the innovation thesis gets tackled pretty fast, because we're both innovators and we'll become even better innovators when we're together. And so what they really are asking about is towards the third point you made, which is they want to make sure that whatever comes out of this, that we don't have less innovation. That's their innovation thesis. There are points of agreement and points of disagreement, but we're converging. We're converging on points of agreement and disagreement, and I'm very confident with this 10-day extension, we're going to get to an outcome that satisfies all shareholders and of course the regulatory authorities. Operator : And next, we'll move on to Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Jeffrey J. Zekauskas: Hi, good morning. I see sequentially your pension liability went up by $1.6 billion. I would think that pension expense, pension liability might have moderated because of the interest rate environment. So why is that? And then secondly, if your Texas-9 cracker is effectively almost mechanically complete, your CapEx should probably come down quite a lot next year. So what do you spend on CapEx this year, and what do you plan to spend on CapEx next year for 2017? Andrew N. Liveris: Howard? Howard I. Ungerleider: Yes, good morning, Jeff. Look, I mean on pension, what you're seeing there on the balance sheet is really just a year-end mark-to-market true-up for the full year. When you think about it on a go-forward basis, our pension would get to be fully funded with less than a 200 basis point increase in rates, which you could expect in the next several years. I'm not going to call exactly when. On a pension expense standpoint for 2017, you should expect about a $450 million expense for the full year, and then actually, our cash contributions for pension in 2017 should be about $150 million lower 2017 versus 2016, so that will be a cash flow tailwind going into 2017 sequentially. In terms of CapEx, we had a target in 2016 of $3.9 billion. We actually did $100 million better than that. We spent $3.8 billion. About 2/3 of that was on growth. And you're exactly right. As those CapEx projects start to roll off into operations, our CapEx for 2017 will be down. For modeling purposes, I would use a $3.4 billion number, so about a $400 million decrease from 2016. Andrew N. Liveris: And, Jim, just add some color on that last point. James R. Fitterling: Yes, I'd say, Jeff, don't forget that we still have four world scale plastics plants that are being finished and that will come on sequentially with the cracker \u2013 a couple of them with the cracker and then a couple more as the year progresses. So we've got to finish that CapEx spend too. Operator : And David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank will have our next question. David I. Begleiter: Thank you. Andrew and Jim, on that same topic, a lot of moving parts in ethylene, polyethylene in the first half of the year. What's your view on the ethylene chain in the U.S. in the first half of the year in terms of potential margin erosion or margin stabilization, given new capacity coming on stream on the polyethylene side? Thank you. Andrew N. Liveris: Go ahead, Jim. James R. Fitterling: David, if anything, the ethylene chain looks like it's staying where it is in terms of operating rate, if not tightening up as we move into the year. We've already seen geographically we've seen some tightening in Asia Pacific and we know that things are going to balance a little bit in North America as we move through the year. There are a couple of plastics plants that will get completed this year. There's been really some length in ethylene in North America as the incremental debottlenecks on the ethylene side and people back integrating themselves have freed up some merchant ethylene. I think through the year, most of that's going to dry up and you're going to start to see ethylene strengthen in North America. And Europe has been balanced and is staying steady and I'd say the growth outlooks for Europe are nice steady increases and it's going to be constructive as we believe oil will be constructive through the year. Andrew N. Liveris: Yes, and don't forget, we've been bringing up Sadara polyethylene all through the year and that's been well placed and prices have filled out very nicely, thank you very much. So, the big new capacity coming on includes us and we're not seeing any weakness in the chain. I think we've always said, the ethylene, shape of the ethylene curve this time around is more a plateau than peak and valley. And so, we're seeing it mostly because of these delays that Jim referenced. Operator : And we'll move on to Jonas Oxgaard with Bernstein. Jonas Oxgaard : Morning. Andrew N. Liveris: Morning. Jonas Oxgaard : Your equity earnings were really quite impressive, particularly Hemlock. And we were wondering, well, what drove that, and on the Hemlock particularly, is any of that some of the contracts enforced by courts or is it true recurring earnings? Andrew N. Liveris: Go ahead, Howard. Howard I. Ungerleider: Yes, so look, equity earnings were up over $100 million versus the same quarter last year. And really, a few key drivers are our Kuwait JVs did very well. Our Thai JVs did very well. Sadara was actually in line with our modeling guidance, but it was a headwind year-on-year. And you're right, Jonas, Hemlock had a seasonally strong fourth quarter. It was a combination of just continued improvement in polycrystalline prices, good demand, but then there was a little bit of lumpy revenue in there for some of the deferred contracts. So, all of that is not recurring. Operator : And we'll move on to Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Thank you. You've clearly executed well on Automotive Systems, but can you just offer a little more insights on the cadence of the annualized build rates on a regional basis or your exhortations there; general trends on your content per vehicle, as well as any preliminary exhortations on the compatibility and synergies with DuPont? Thank you. Andrew N. Liveris: Go ahead, Jim. James R. Fitterling: Yes, thank you, Christopher, for the question. It was a very strong year in the United States in auto builds, and SUVs, and light truck builders. It was in Europe and we saw growth coming back at the end of the year in China. China was relatively strong. Some question as you go forward in terms of what the tax credit reduction will do in China. Our expectation is flat with 2016 in China. Europe and U.S. probably up slightly 1%. At the end of the year, we watched very closely on auto builds for inventories with sedans, primarily, and what happened there. But actually, the sedans moved out relatively well with some increased rebates, and so the businesses plateaued to slower growth but at a very, very high level. And surprisingly to the positive, we saw an uptick in Brazil in the fourth quarter and that's the first uptick we've seen there and I'm going to guess three years. So, I think, all in all, a very strong market. Our content, I mentioned on the call we're growing at about four times the rate of the industry average. That's really driven by the amount of use for crash-durable adhesives as it goes into higher performing vehicles, SUVs, crossovers, the light duty vehicles, trucks and that really feeds to our sweet spot. So we're continuing to innovate to grow that content per vehicle. Operator : And John Roberts with UBS will have our next question. John Roberts : Thank you. On the $3 billion merger cost savings, you've never given a regional breakdown, but can you tell us if it's consistent with the new priority on maintaining U.S. jobs or do you have to shuffle things a little there? And could we get some new Dow U.S. project announcements, given the priority on U.S. investment? Andrew N. Liveris: I'll take the back \u2013 good morning, John. I'm going to take the back end of your question and then flip to Jim. So, look, we haven't changed anything in our geographic mix based on potential new policies, as I think some of you may have caught my Cramer clip today, that question came up. I said, look, at the end of the day, we're going to achieve cost synergies, which actually does mean head count reduction. So, we don't fit the Presidential agenda right away, but we're creating growth companies that will create growth opportunities. And a good example of that is what we've already announced on Dow Corning with a new R&D center here in Michigan to build on the synergies of Dow Corning and being part of the materials company. So, that's a good example of innovation going ahead of, if you like, the growth curve there. What we've got to do here is get these companies formed, we've got to make them competitive, and then they can grow, and they'll grow along the paradigm of hopefully friendlier policies here in the United States. And I can already see that this administration is going to move fast on taking out regulatory costs and giving us better tax regiments. That's all tailwind to these new companies as we set them up that will lift our growth synergies with time. Jim? James R. Fitterling: And, John, I would say we haven't released regional targets for the synergies. We do have regional targets and we do have regional teams that will implement those. I don't see anything so far that would change what we're looking to do from a regional basis. A lot of the integration is not driven around our capacity as a growth model. So it's meant for growth. More of it was driven towards back office efficiencies and productivity, but we'll keep an eye to that as that landscape changes. Operator : And next, we'll move on to Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Vincent S. Andrews: Thanks. Good morning. Hopefully, you can give us an update on feedstock outlook for ethane and propane, both sort of the shorter-term issues we've seen this year with ethane falling off a fair amount and propane I think running up more than expected? And then, how you're thinking about it exiting 2017 into 2018 as the new capacity comes online, anything changed about your view versus prior calls? Andrew N. Liveris: Go ahead, Jim. James R. Fitterling: Thanks, Vincent. Our view is still the same in the long-term for 2017, that there's plenty of ethane to run the crackers to the forecast period even with the exports and the new crackers that are coming on. And if anything, U.S. propane is going to be continuing to lengthen. It's going to take an awful lot of propane export to balance this market, we think. We think the length in propane is going to continue as we projected. As we sit here right now, in the short-term, there's been some move of ethane back into rejection, which I would say I believe is a Q1 phenomenon and I think it's going to sort itself out over the next few weeks. I think it's really related to Mont Belvieu storage and a little bit of logistical capabilities. Once that sorts itself out, we think it will move back to normal. Crack spreads for ethane, we're moving up towards $0.70 a million Btu. They've now gone back toward rejection. Our long-term look was they were going to be $0.70 a million Btu to $1 a million Btu in this year. Andrew N. Liveris: Jim, you may want to mention our flex project. James R. Fitterling: Yes, and on LA-3, obviously we've increased the capability to crack ethane in LA-3, which gives us 250,000 tons more ethylene out of that unit. It raises that unit's ethane cracking capability above 80%. That unit also has a really strong propane cracking flexibility as well as naphtha. It's the most flexible unit in our fleet now and that's going to provide big advantages in Louisiana, which if anything, from time to time gets tight in that pocket. Operator : And next, we'll move on to Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial. Don Carson : Yes, thank you. Andrew N. Liveris: Good morning. Don Carson : Andrew, wanted to go back to your view of the polyethylene and ethylene cycles. I look at the charts you have on slide 21. You seem very different than the industry, both in terms of when you see the downturn and how far rates go down. Specifically, you've got 2017 really as the trough in operating rates globally for both ethylene and polyethylene. Most consultants are looking at 2018/2019 as kind of the trough. So what gives you a different view on the cycle? Do you think that the industry forecasts are overstating the capacity visions or are you more optimistic on demand growth? Andrew N. Liveris: Yes, so we'll take two slices of that question because it's a hugely important one. Thank you, Don, and I'll give you the slice that all of us here at Dow have been working on for a long time, and Jim and his team spend every day on this. So, what our granularity \u2013 and by the way, to your point, we've been different to notable industry consultants for a long time. And I want to point out to you that we've been right and they haven't. And so, we have a granular view on the ground around the world, in particular, of course, where all the new builds are occurring. And of course we're participating in some of those new builds in a big way. But we understand what's going on in terms of steel on the ground, and we understand in terms of what it will take to RTO. And we also understand where people are in that process, and we have the granularity, which is our proprietary data, and we're keeping it to ourselves, but that comes out in this chart that you're referring to. And when you look at the big new builds that were announced a few years back and where they all are, and they're adds on the supply side, that speaks to some of the shape of that curve that you referenced on slide 21. So, it doesn't have an aggressive demand side assumption, and if the aggressive demand side assumption on GDP started lifting, and by the way, we think that's actually getting quite likely, as we reported in our numbers, we're seeing momentum into 2017 in the global economy, and we're seeing momentum here in the United States. And the U.S. GDP assumption we have embedded in some of these numbers is quite low. And so what we see on the supply side in terms of delays, we see delays with MTO and what's going on in China because of emissions and their commitment to Paris. We see Iranian operating challenges, and they have \u2013 I was just in Saudi Arabia yesterday. Was that yesterday? Yes, yesterday, and I had a report out from the Minister of Energy there on their view of oil and gas, and specifically to the Iranian production. And I would tell you, our partner there of course is pretty much in the market and knows it a lot. So, their view, our view on oil price, on gas price, on regional prices, on supply side, on Iran, on what's going on in the Middle East in general, is right connected with them. So we believe that the shape of this curve, as I said earlier, is a plateau through a combination of supply side delays and then of course a fairly conservative assumption on demand side, that if it starts correcting itself, we'll actually see the capacity that we're bringing on be well consumed, as already they are out of Sadara. Jim, did you want to add some granularity? James R. Fitterling: I would only add that polyethylene capacity has not come on in any meaningful way, so it's really constricted a little bit, the ethylene capacity. The ethylene operating rates have been high and steady at 87%, 88%, 89% for the industry, and some of us have been running stronger than that, where we've had the ability to convert the material. As you have more polyethylene capacity come on, that ethylene is going to tighten up. So I don't see this as a trough. I see it more of an adjustment to all of these increments and all of these capacity adds that are coming on over the next three years. Andrew N. Liveris: Thanks, Jim. Operator : And next, we'll move on to Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs. Ryan Berney : Good morning. This is Ryan Berney on for Bob. Andrew N. Liveris: Morning. Ryan Berney : I was hoping you could provide a little bit of an update on your outlook for pricing in your Ag segment for 2017, particularly on the Crop Protection side, where it sounds like maybe there was a little bit of pricing pressure this quarter. Andrew N. Liveris: Yes, Howard. Howard I. Ungerleider: Yes, look. Thanks a lot for the question. When I look at the fourth quarter from an ag perspective, the Dow AgroSciences team did an exceptional job of delivering year-on-year earnings growth in a tough market. When I look out to the first quarter, look, the highly competitive pricing environment is going to continue. Crop commodity prices remain below historical averages, as you know, and farmer profitability remains under pressure. What I would say is you should expect to see the same thing in 2017 that you saw from the Dow AgroSciences team in the fourth quarter and for the full year. Record fourth quarter EBITDA, record full year EBITDA. It's about innovation and bringing new molecules, specifically Isoclast and Arylex to market with the full Enlist cotton launch. That's going to be additive. We've got product line extensions in our herbicides and insecticides, and then continued self help. So we feel really good about Dow AgroSciences' ability to outperform in what is likely to be another tough year for the Ag sector. Operator : And next, we'll move on to Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Arun Viswanathan : Great, thanks, good morning. I just had a question. Andrew, you said last year that you were planning on stepping down at the end of the second quarter. Maybe you can just give us an update on your plans. You did say that you've made some changes in the senior leadership team for proposed DowDuPont. Anything else you can share with the management on the new entity as well, that'd be helpful. Thank you. Andrew N. Liveris: I think the board of our company, as well as, of course, the board of DuPont, which I can't speak for, but certainly, the two companies actually have had at least two sessions together, are being very, very, very mindful of regulatory approval as being the sine qua non gate for all the questions you just asked. So we are very ready, both in terms of board deployment and executive management deployment, and right now we have nothing new to announce in terms of changes to timing other than the focus I just mentioned. We'll close, and then we'll be out of the gate, actually, running start already on synergies, deliver the synergies and get the 18-month timeline on spin. And actually, we are very driven, Ed and I and our teams, to actually once we stage-gate regulatory, to spend meaningful time on even that 18 month to spin. We know that the market is expecting these three companies, and to be formed in the most competitive way possible, which means front-loading the synergies. We have delivered a synergy plan to our boards that front-loads the synergies so that we can get the extraction of value by being together, while at the same time prepping everyone, boards, executive management, to be ready to run the new enterprises. I'm very committed to delivering all of that for our board, and at the right moment, we'll have the appropriate announcements on anything else. Operator : And next, we'll move on to Peter Butler with Glen Hill Investment. Peter E. Butler: Andrew, is management execution in the post-merger company a concern to you, or do you see good execution producing financial results, including cost savings, that come in a lot better than what Wall Street has been discounting? Andrew N. Liveris: All right, Peter, thank you. Good morning. Look, one of the benefits of taking a little longer to get this closed is the two teams have been working together now for a fairly long time, since December of 2015. And as the year progressed last year, we had what, Jim, over 800 people deployed from the two companies working together on granular detail. And our confidence in each other has been increasing and increasing and increasing, from Ed and I, all the way through our teams, Jim and his counterpart, Howard and his counterpart. And the executive managements, of course, we're obviously the drivers of getting all of this done, but I'm very impressed with the quality of the people that we are working together with. We've had mutual town halls. Ed's been to some of our soon-to-be SpecCo sites and ag sites. We've been there together in a couple of instances. I think, Jim, next week we have a few more of those where we'll be going to Performance Materials sites from DuPont, and we'll be talking with our people. We clearly understand the uncertainty cloud that basically goes with a long delay to close, but we have not let that be an excuse, to answer your question. We will execute in an execution culture, and we are very pleased to see the strength of DuPont's results this last year or so. They've been tremendous. They've been outperforming. I think we've been doing the same as we establish our records. So, two performance cultures coming together should be synergistic to more than two. Operator : And Duffy Fischer with Barclays will have our next question. Duffy Fischer : Yes, good morning. If we could go back to Ag for a second, with your launch of Enlist over cotton this year, can you just remind us, across both cotton and soybeans, kind of what you think the competitive dynamics will be, your dual herbicide stack versus the competitors? And in Latin America, is Conquesta (48:48) still on track to launch in 2018? Howard I. Ungerleider: The answer to the last question is a short yes, Duffy, on the 2018 launch. Look, relative to Enlist, we feel really good about the technology. As you know, we've had great success with our Farm Forward trials in corn. We've got a stewarded launch now in corn. We're going to do a full launch of Enlist cotton now that we've got the trait and the herbicide registered. You heard in the prepared remarks that we now have 34 states that have approved the full package. So we feel very good about Enlist, and relative to the competitive set when you think about the lower drift and the lower volatility of our technology, we've had overwhelming positive feedback from all the farmers. Operator : And we do have time for two more questions. We'll hear from Alex Yefremov with Instinet Nomura. Aleksey Yefremov : Good morning, thank you. In your coatings and consumer products businesses, your margins expanded as raw materials fell. Now that some of these raw materials are rising, how sustainable are your margins? Andrew N. Liveris: Jim. James R. Fitterling: Thanks, Aleksey, for that question. Coatings demand has been strong, and we've been continuing to expand that franchise. As we talked about last year, our attempt there is to try to take more of our monomers position and move it into downstream differentiated coatings and we're doing that, including new capacities in China, Southeast Asia. So, that's been a positive. Building & Construction, even though single family homes in the U.S. have not been strong, you've seen a lot of growth in Building & Construction in new applications, new product, LIQUIDARMOR, that was just announced last year, which is doing well for sealing gaps on commercial and new family homes. But also spray foams has taken off, both at the DIY counter inside of Lowe's, Home Depot, as well as in low pressure applications for contractors coming in and really taking buildings and retrofitting, going into the attic space, sealing them up, tightening them up. And I would say the only drag that we've had in this sector has been Energy & Water as it relates to the oil and gas sector, which we think is turning the corner. Prices are moving up in the first quarter. I think that's a strong indication of the demand growth, and I think we'll be able to maintain, and we have to always watch here, propylene is the thing that we have to watch here. Our PDH capacity gives us some flexibility, a hedge against that and that helps. Operator : And our final question today will come from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Kevin W. McCarthy: Good morning. Thank you. Andrew, I was wondering if you might be willing to drill down another layer on some of the structural reforms on the table for the U.S. market. For example, what might implementation of border adjustment mean for Dow Chemical, if that passes as part of tax reform? And with regard to regulations and fair trade, are there specific issues, policy actions, or markets that you might have your eyes on as the year progresses that we should be watching as relevant for investors for Dow Chemical? Andrew N. Liveris: Yes, thank you. Appreciate the question, Kevin, and certainly this is not only topic du jour, but it's real-time, right? So we're five or six days into this new administration and clearly the privilege I have, as I said on the call, that I've been asked to lead this Manufacturing Advisory Group, which as you know it was his first meeting on Monday morning. And so, the President is very serious, as is his team, in around the five or six pillars of competitiveness that gets some air time in the press. But certainly the specificity of your question starts to point directionally to some solution space topic. So, starting in no particular order, the regulatory reform one is the one I'm most excited about, because he's asking lots of questions about to all the sectors that are in front of him, inclusive of the autos that have had another bite at the apple on Tuesday. The regulatory costs on manufacturers in the country per employee, almost $20,000 per employee cost of federal regulations. That compares to just short of $10,000 per employee by all firms as a whole. So, manufacturers bid two times the federal regulatory costs than do all other companies. So the manufacturers have specific statements on the sorts of regs that have been coming out, especially these last eight years, that have really crippled us in terms of locating factories in the United States despite a decent growing U.S. market. So that speaks to imminency. I believe 30 days, 60 days you're going to see decisions from the administration that start to lift some of these regulatory burdens, I think a lot of that can be done through executive orders. So that's topic one. Topic two, anything to do with tax reform is built into what's going on with the blueprint out of the House, and the Senate, and the Ryan Plan. But in addition, the President's got some specific statements and views on, in particular, the border tax. He has some views on border tax, the Ryan Plan speaks to border adjustment tax. The border adjustment tax, which is your question, will be, for us, a big positive. We're a big exporter out of the United States. That will immediately accrue to our bottom line as a significant tax advantage for us. And so, frankly, we're quite big supporters of it, but different sectors are not and so there is a lot between here and enactment of something like that. Certainly, punitive measures as it relates to border tax specific to certain sectors or certain companies, that's not the agenda that's going to be driven here. Bilateral trade will be, and putting in place bilateral trade agreements that speak to border adjustment tax per the Ryan Plan. We're big proponents for what you're going to see. There will be something on the loss side of that. There will be stuff that we lose in terms of depreciation assets and claiming those, maybe a little bit on the R&D side. So we're going to have to watch all of that, but we have a seat at the table and we'll be definitely very, very vocal on some of those things. And then, not taking too much more time on the call, on infrastructure, we'll be a big beneficiary. Increases on investment here in the United States. And infrastructure, many of the businesses in the Infrastructure Solutions business will benefit from that. Building & Construction business, the Coatings business, those are all going to be beneficiaries of more spend here in the U.S. And then, energy policy. As we move through energy policy that takes off regulations. I mean, the Keystone Pipeline decision alone is a big positive for us and we've got certain things we can now go do that actually unlock more supply side, take out the cost of supply. And then, on top of that, help us, if you like, look at expansion opportunities against the shale gas opportunity for our businesses here in the U.S. But, all of that has to be taken through the Department of Energy and the work will be done there, especially as it relates to the climate change agenda, which will also be on the table. I don't have enough time to go through it all, but just to give you some flavor of the topics that are being discussed as recent as this week. Operator : And at this time, I would like to turn the call back over to Neal Sheorey for any additional or closing remarks. Neal Sheorey : Sure, thank you, Rochelle. I'll now turn the call back to Andrew for some final remarks. Andrew N. Liveris: There's a lot that can be said in final remarks, but you've got to home in on 2016 as another record year, seminal year for The Dow Chemical Company. The portfolio we've put in place these last many years as we shed low cost \u2013 I'm sorry, commodity-oriented, low ROC businesses that have been part of our commodity portfolio for more than a dozen years. We've been shedding those and replacing them with high value IROC businesses. And you can see we're a portfolio for all seasons. We literally are firing on all cylinders. There's no question that our self-help programs, and productivity, and our innovation agenda, our integration investments that Jim talked about as it relates to the feedstock flexibility, have enabled us to set record EBITDA margins, record EBITDA. And as we exit the quarter, in fourth quarter we exited with momentum. Just volume of growth alone, 13 straight quarters, is impressive and amazing, but think about China number. We grew 27% year-on-year in China in the fourth quarter. Everyone is bemoaning what's going on in China. We've got an expansion strategy in China that's going to all of the geographies of China, opening up offices, and we're the first there and selling products to the tune of the volume growth that I just mentioned. And that's without acquisition numbers. With acquisition numbers, our volume in China grew 56%. So we are really growing where growth is. In addition, we are a cash story. The cash we're returning to our shareholders, the cash flow that's being generated. Remember, we've had the headwind of investments these last many years. And as Don Carson said in his question, as your CapEx starts coming down, as we go down the CapEx cycle, as we release more cash from these new capacities coming on at about the right time, then that will add just more and more cash that we can deliver to all of you, our shareholders. So these smart portfolio moves, this fortress balance sheet we've created, this focus on shareholder return, the record dividend we're at, and the record share price, if I can close on that thought, is to reward you, our shareholders. And 2017 will be yet again another breakout year for Dow as we move towards closing the merger. Neal Sheorey : All right, thank you very much, Andrew, and thank you, everyone, for your questions. As always, we appreciate your interest in The Dow Chemical Company. For your reference, a copy of our prepared comments will be posted on Dow's website later today. This concludes our call for today. We look forward to speaking with you again soon. Thank you. Operator : And that will conclude today's call. We thank you for your participation.",

If you turn to slide 3 \u2013 and good morning, everyone \u2013 our results once again underscored the strength of Dow's portfolio. The first quarter saw rapidly changing business conditions around the world, and Dow showed once again it has the right levers in place to say agile, focused and deliver strong earnings growth. Summary of these results are : we delivered an all-time record quarterly EBITDA. We extended our EPS growth streak to four and a half years, and our volume growth streak to three and a half years. Volume and price both grew in every geographic area. We achieved the full Dow Corning cost synergy run rate of $400 million in just 10 months versus the two years we said when we closed the transaction. Construction of our Texas cracker was completed, and the unit remains on track for startup midyear, ahead of all our competition. Sadara now has 16 units in the start-up phase. And just today, this powerful joint venture achieved commercialization of its entire plastics franchise, with the startup of the fourth polyethylene unit. And we've progressed our pending merger with DuPont, receiving key regulatory approvals and announcing that the intended Materials Science Company will be the first spin-off if it would not adversely impact the value of the intended spin-off transaction. Simply put, Dow's business model showed, once again, its ability to deliver under all conditions. I'll spend some time later on the call discussing our growth strategy over the next several years as we move through the Dow-DuPont merger and spin period and emerge as the new Dow, a preeminent global Materials Science Company. But first, I will turn the call over to Howard and Jim to discuss our quarterly performance and an update on the silicones integration. Howard? Howard I. Ungerleider: Thanks, Andrew. Turning to Slide 5 and a summary of our results, sales grew to $13.2 billion, driven by price and volume gains and the addition of Dow Corning's silicones business. Pricing rose 7%, reflecting broad-based actions that led to increases in all geographic areas and in most operating segments. Volume ex-M&A, grew 4%, reflecting consumer-led demands, particularly in our core end markets of packaging, transportation, infrastructure and consumer care. EBITDA increased 20% to $2.7 billion. The key tailwinds in the quarter included broad-based consumer-driven demand, the addition of our new silicones business, higher equity earnings and productivity and synergies that totaled $200 million, evenly split between Dow Corning cost-synergy savings and productivity actions. We have now achieved more than $750 million of cost out since 2015. These gains more than offset higher feedstock costs, which led to short-term margin compression, particularly in a few of our downstream businesses where pricing initiatives typically lag the raw material increases. As we shared with you on our fourth quarter call, we also had more than $100 million of higher spending for both planned maintenance activities as well as commissioning costs in the U.S. Gulf Coast, all of which was in line with our modeling guidance. The commissioning cost will continue in the second quarter, and I encourage you to review our updated modeling guidance in the appendix for more details. Now moving to our business highlights. On Slide 7, Dow Ag reported EBITDA of $351 million. The highlight of the quarter was the continued increased contribution from the seeds business driven by gains in Latin American and the successful launch of ENLIST cotton in the U.S. due to strong early grower adoption. Crop Protection reported volume growth in all geographic areas except Asia Pacific on strong demand for new product innovations and 9% growth globally in insecticides, with particular strength in Spinetoram and Spinosad in Europe and across multiple molecules in North America. We saw lower herbicide demand in North America aligned with a projected acreage shift from corn to soybeans. The decline in Asia Pacific was primarily related to soft rice herbicide demand due to an inventory overhang created by flooding during last year's season and increasing resistance to our existing Penoxsulam technology. Going forward, we will address the resistance issue with the launch of Rinskor Active herbicide, which features an alternative mode of action. Rinskor will be launched in time for the next growing season. Innovation is still very much valued by growers. We saw this in the quarter with gains for our new Arylex broad leaf herbicide for use in multiple crops including cereals and strong demand for ENLIST cotton. Looking ahead, our Crop Protection business, which represents about 70% of Dow Ag, has an industry-leading pipeline with products including Isoclast insecticide to control sap-feeding pests and Rinskor herbicide to control grass, broad leaf and sedge weeds. Dow AgroSciences remains well position to bring at least one new-to-the-world molecule to commercialization every year. We have included a review of the business's innovation pipeline in the appendix, which highlights the breadth and depth of products that are still to come. We still expect to deliver flat EBITDA in the first half of 2017 versus last year's first half. And I'll now turn it over to Jim to cover the rest of the businesses, and I'll come back to provide an update on the silicones introduction. Jim? James R. Fitterling: Thanks, Howard. Moving to Consumer Solutions on slide 8, the segment delivered record first quarter EBITDA of $500 million and its seventh consecutive quarter of growth led by Dow Automotive, Electronic Materials and the contribution from silicone. Dow Automotive achieved an all-time quarterly EBITDA record driven by its 16th consecutive quarter of volume gain, as the business's growth continues to outpace the automotive end market. Consumer Solutions \u2013 Silicones delivered strong results led by volume gains in Asia Pacific, particularly in the automotive end market. Electronic Materials delivered its seventh consecutive quarter of EBITDA growth on continued above-market volume gain driven by new business wins and share gain. Infrastructure Solutions on slide nine achieved record quarterly EBITDA of $511 million driven by volume growth, the contribution from silicone and the benefit from on-purpose propylene production. Building & Construction delivered volume growth on strong demand, particularly for commercial application. The silicones business reported volume growth on robust demand for pressure-sensitive adhesives, label-stock release liners and Building & Construction application. Silicones also benefited from the significant cost synergy savings, and our Performance Monomers business benefited from tighter industry fundamentals and reduced turnaround spending. Performance Materials & Chemicals on Slide 10 delivered a year-over-year EBITDA increase of $100 million. Equity earnings and volume gains in all geographic areas and all businesses more than offset margin compression in some of the products. Polyurethanes achieved double-digit growth on continued robust demand for systems application, particularly in building insulation and household appliances as well as tight market conditions in isocyanate. Industrial Solutions grew volume in high-value applications for textiles, lubricants and electronics, with double-digit volume growth in Asia Pacific. The business also reported higher equity earnings. On Slide 11, Performance Plastic's EBITDA was flat year-over-year as volume growth and price gains offset increased feedstock cost, and we absorbed more than $100 million of headwinds in the quarter. These headwinds were evenly split between planned maintenance and turnaround spending and U.S. Gulf Coast commissioning cost. Packaging and Specialty Plastics achieved record first quarter sales volume and its 11th consecutive quarter of sales volume growth. The business expanded variable margin as polyethylene supply-demand fundamentals remained tight, and chain inventory continued at low levels. Elastomers also reported record first quarter sales volume and its ninth consecutive quarter of sales volume growth, led by strong demand in transportation, packaging and high-performance athletic footwear applications. I'll now turn it back to Howard for an update on the silicones integration. Howard I. Ungerleider: Thanks, Jim. Turning to Slide 13, I want to thank the Dow Corning and the Dow teams for their efforts to drive a seamless integration. It continues to exceed our expectations, and as you clearly see, based on the result, we have accelerated the cost-synergy realization. In fact, we hit our $400 million run-rate target in the quarter and saw approximately $100 million of realized savings drop to the bottom-line. And we delivered this more than a year earlier than planned, which reflects Dow's strong project management skills and bodes well for the implementation phase of the Dow-DuPont merger. With the cost synergies achieved, our mindset increasingly focuses on growth. Here, too, we're ahead of plan and are seeing early commercial wins and robust volume growth, and this is just the beginning. Turning to slide 14, you'll recall that our stated goal is at least $100 million in growth synergies by the end of year three from the close of the silicones transaction. In 2016, we rapidly defined our growth synergy playbook. As part of that process, we identified and are now tracking more than 400 distinct growth opportunities. We have a clear line of sight to attaining our target, and our execution plans are well underway. We see the growth synergy initiatives delivering at least $400 million of additional revenue, with more than 70% of that aligned to our core end markets. And, in fact, we've already secured some early wins in Automotive, Building and Construction as well as Home and Personal Care. One example is LIQUIDARMOR LT. The Dow Building and Construction team recently launched this flashing and sealant for the commercial building market. This new to the world product takes advantage of silicones' low-temperature flexibility and can be applied in weather as cold as negative 20 degrees Fahrenheit, meaning year-round. We've also achieved synergy wins in automotive brake fluid applications, feeding solutions, as well as into multiple home and personal care applications with brand owners around the world. You can expect our teams to continue to show the same disciplined mindset on growth that rapidly delivered the cost synergies well ahead of schedule. With that, I'll turn the call back to Andrew. Andrew N. Liveris: Yes. Thank you, Howard. Dow Corning is one of the most comprehensive examples of our integration and innovation growth strategy in action. And if you turn to slide 16, you'll see that the long-term Dow strategy has been well articulated. The Dow-DuPont merger is a key part of realizing the strategy, and it accelerates our execution as well as builds upon the trajectory we have consistently driven for the past many years. This strategy, reaffirmed by our Board and executive management in 2013, is underpinned by our unparalleled combination of world-class innovation and industry leading integration. We deploy that expertise and strength to the consumer-led end markets that value these unique material science capabilities in packaging, transportation, consumer care and infrastructure, going narrower and deeper, making strict value-based portfolio decisions, delivering superior returns, all based upon our integration and innovation drivers. This strategy has fundamentally shifted our growth and earnings trajectory, delivering impressive volume growth, significant EPS growth and, ultimately, higher cash flows that have enabled us to invest in our next chapter of growth, while also increasingly rewarding shareholders. We are actively working on the next phase of this growth strategy, and that work starts with a view towards market trends and our capabilities. And turning to Slide 17, the post-merger Materials Science division company will have nearly 90% of its revenues aligned to these four core end markets. These markets are attractive; they're growing spaces that are fueled by strong demand drivers, including sustainable organization and a growing middle class around the world. They are markets that have shown great resilience and consistent growth over time, and they are sectors where Dow has leading positions today. We are attracted to these markets because they are increasingly demanding a broader and more complex suite of technology offerings and capabilities, market access and customer intimacy and the unique combination of local presence and global scale. The winner in these markets brings the complete toolkit to the table. That's how Dow has earned a seat at our customers' design table, working hand-in-hand with brand owners, OEMs and other value-chain members to customize and spec in breakthrough innovation. Turning to Slide 18, to do so, we've reinvigorated our innovation engine. We've done it through thoughtful investments in capability, in people and in bringing a business lens to the laboratory. Today, Dow has a truly world-class R&D franchise. Here are some proof points : we have enhanced product commercialization and rapid prototyping, catalyzed by our investments in proprietary high-throughput R&D capability. Dow now launches more than 5,000 new products each year and executes more than 2 million experiments annually. We have boosted our IP portfolio to ensure that our innovations are protected and unique. We received 754 U.S. patent grants in 2016, an all-time record for Dow, and our eighth consecutive year of record patent grant. And we continue to attract the best minds. Since 2010, we have recruited more than 600 PhDs and post docs from the top 20 U.S. technology universities alone. These results reflect the steadfast commitment to our strategy, our core consumer-led markets and our customers. And the success we've had is hitting the bottom-line. We have had many examples where innovation-led profitable growth has fundamentally reinvented our businesses, driving both longstanding demand growth and significant EBITDA margin expansion. And our results over these last 18 quarters bear testimony to the margin and cash opportunities for these new products over the next 5 years. Turning to Slide 19, the second pillar of our strategy for the next 5 years is our integration. And here, too, we have invested significantly to ensure we maintain our unmatched strength. Our growth investments in the U.S. Gulf Coast and the Middle East create a multiplier effect by broadening our market and geographic access and enhancing our competitive advantage in key regions around the world. These investments create powerful and cost-advantaged manufacturing hubs, where we can deploy our unique technology capabilities and capture growth where growth exists. In both cases, we are bringing forward the industry's broadest and most differentiated derivatives slate. These are not ordinary investments, but rather they are carefully crafted to take advantage of the consumer-led demand drivers in our core markets. Both of these megaprojects are on the cusp of shifting to earnings tailwind, as they fully come online, activating this critical element of our compelling growth story. And as you have come to expect from Dow, as we turn the page on these investments, we're not resting on our laurels. We still see vast potential in these markets and the regions they serve, and these investments provide a springboard to drive the next chapter of Dow's growth trajectory. We will be announcing this next phase of this investment very soon. Slide 20 says this strategy of innovation, integration and growth investment to drive narrower and deeper to our core markets has delivered at the bottom line with increasing earnings and cash flows. Looking at our financial scorecard today, you see the significant progress we have made since 2012. Dow has improved its ROC by 390 basis points. We have delivered an EPS CAGR of 18%. We have taken out nearly $3 billion through productivity, cost control and synergies. We have maintained a strong liquidity and financial position, and the core Dow cash engine is thriving. Free cash flow has doubled from $1.5 billion to now $3 billion on a trailing 12-month basis, while at the same time, we had funded our key growth projects. This trajectory will be further enhanced as our CapEx returns to DNA levels and our aforementioned growth projects become operational. Slide 21, and so today, as we look forward, the strength of our future trajectory is evident. We have an enterprise that has delivered greater than $10 billion of EBITDA on a trailing 12-month basis and has a full arsenal of growth investments to deliver the next level of earnings growth to $15 billion and beyond. And as we realize these higher earnings, cash flow from operations will be further enhanced by up to $5 billion, providing a higher base to invest in our growth and reward our shareholders. We have an enterprise with a consistent strategy rooted in integration and innovation, driven by a narrower and deeper presence in our core markets and committed to continuous productivity. And we can deliver this next phase without the significant investment headwinds of the previous 5 years. On Slide 22, as we look into and well beyond our intended merge and spin transaction with DuPont, this is our North Star, our winning strategy, our winning portfolio and a suite of growth investment and a winning team with a strong execution mindset, and it continues to guide our path forward. Therefore, our growth strategy going forward remains grounded in these fundamental elements. We will deliver strong cash flow as our current growth investments at Sadara and in the U.S. Gulf Coast come online. We will continue to drive narrower and deeper into our core Materials Science end market. We will further bolster our world-class innovation and industry-leading integration. We will deliver our cost synergies from the Dow-DuPont merger and maintain a mindset of continuous productivity. And we will soon deliver the world's leading Materials Science Company, a growth company rooted in the strategy that we are executing against today and that positions us well to maximize shareholder value creation in the future. A strong earnings growth story, a strong cash flow story and a focused growth company. And with that, Neal, let's turn to Q&A. Neal Sheorey : Thank you, Andrew. Now we will move on to your questions. I ask that you please keep to one question so that we can allow as many people as possible the opportunity to ask a question. First, however, I would like to remind you that my comments regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. Rochelle, would you please explain the Q&A procedure? Operator : Thank you. And our first question, we'll hear from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. David I. Begleiter: Good morning. Andrew and Jim, on the ethylene chain, the ethylene cycle, as we head to the back half of the year, how are you viewing the strength in the cycle, and h ow that might be sustained or whatever? James R. Fitterling: Good morning, David. Look, the ethylene cycle continues to look attractive to us even in the slower growth environment. And our view on oil, obviously is in kind of a low-to-mid oil pricing environment. Operating rates are still hanging in there at 90%, even with new capacities coming online. And that's with the look that monomers are going to come on probably ahead of the polymer capacity. So I think our view is continued strength in the ethylene cycle and continued strength in the polymer market. Operator : And we'll next move to Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Vincent Stephen Andrews : Thanks and good morning. Just on the Texas cracker, when do you think you'll actually be selling commercial volumes of polyethylene, and how fast do you think you'll ramp up, or when do you think you'll ramp up to sort of complete utilization? James R. Fitterling: Morning, Vince. On the U.S. Gulf Coast, we're about 50% through the commissioning phase of the Texas 9 cracker right now. So we're targeting mid-year to have ethylene. We have two plastics plants that will come up at the same time as that plant. We have a high pressure, low density plant for kind of a next-generation low density product to bring to the market, similar to the fourth plant that Andrew mentioned in Sadara that started up just this week. And we also have another plastics plant that's coming on for our Elite branded Performance Plastics technologies, which go into high performance food packaging, specialty packaging, and our hygiene and medical applications. So both of those will come on mid-year. And then we move with the next phase of (24:47) in the first part of 2018. We'll have two more plastics plant in the first part of 2018 as well as a de-bottleneck on some gas phase assets, which we'll be making bimodal pipe products for high pressure pipe application. Operator : And, next, we will hear from Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global. Hassan I. Ahmed: Good morning, Andrew. Andrew N. Liveris: Good morning. Hassan I. Ahmed: Andrew, obviously, as we sort of look at the cycle, there seems to be increased capacity addition momentum in 2018 and 2019 and sort of a tapering off thereafter. So my question really is \u2013 a) what are you thinking in terms of the next wave of capacity additions? Will you be partaking in that? Question one. And associated with that, would be that obviously we're seeing increased activity in Saudi Arabia. Obviously, Aramco has \u2013 your joint venture partner, has very aggressive capacity growth plans within petrochemicals as a part of their Vision 2030. But, similarly, you're seeing more and more of the Middle Eastern companies come out here as well. We recently heard SABIC announcing plans for a cracker here in the U.S. Epic (26:03) has announced plans as well. So just where will these capacity additions be? Will you be partaking in them? Would love to hear your thoughts. Andrew N. Liveris: Well, thank you, Hassan. I'll start, and Jim can round off. We definitely will be participating, and I foreshadowed that in my remarks. And I also foreshadowed that as we have done these massive investments, which are, in essence, one grassroots in Sadara and one brownfield in Texas and also in Louisiana, we've had a mind's eye to when these come up, what's the next load of capacity? And you should think of us then as incremental from here because we have these big bases. And there's a lot of work that's been done to define how we get that in place over the next 5 years. And we're reviewing all of that now, and we're going to have something to say about it very soon. You can assume that we're going to be a leader in making sure that we keep our share where it is, if not grow it, especially with these high-end products that we can make, elastomers and the C8s, and some of the more specialty end-uses in packaging, which we see a strong growth market. As regards to Saudi Arabia and Aramco, this clearly a drive by not just Aramco, but as you mentioned, SABIC and others. They're playing in more the low-end type business and the more petrochemical business and the more commodity business, which is fine. We can participate in some of that with them with Aramco as a licensor, maybe as a small equity player. But in the high-end product line, we are their partner of choice. And we're definitely talking to them now quite actively about after we get Sadara through the lender's reliability test what does it look like beyond. And as our partnership evolves, you can assume that The Dow Chemical Company and Saudi Aramco will stay very, very tight together. We are their preferred partner, and we like doing business with them. Jim, did you want to add? James R. Fitterling: The only thing I would add, Hassan, is we've got a broad range of incremental projects that Andrew spoke of that we'll be looking at here. And additionally, as soon as we can close on the Dow-DuPont deal, we'll want to bring them into that discussion and understand how we can bolt-on some growth capacity for DuPont Performance Materials that we'll need be going into the merged company condition. Operator : And next, we'll move to Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo Securities. Frank J. Mitsch: Hey, good morning, gentlemen. Nice start to the year. Andrew N. Liveris: Good morning. Frank J. Mitsch: Jim, when you're talking about the Performance Plastics segment, obviously, the top-line was fairly robust. And you did mention that there was a $100 million negative impact from maintenance expenses as well as commissioning of new \u2013 of the new facilities. I was wondering if you could talk about the underlying margins and what you saw in Q1 and, equally, if not more importantly, what your expectations are given market dynamics for Q2? James R. Fitterling: Sure, Frank, happy to. The underlying business was very strong. The volume was up 5%. The price was up 15%. At the same time, remember that feedstocks year-over-year were up about 40%. So the underlying business performance was closer to a $1.1 billion EBITDA number, before you take those headwinds of the greater than $100 million that we had for commissioning and start-up costs. And on turnaround and maintenance costs, we had the Terneuzen cracker down. It's the first turnaround we've had in Terneuzen for tenure. So obviously that's a sizeable turnaround, and we started that in the first quarter. And then commissioning and startup for Gulf \u2013 the Texas 9 cracker, as I mentioned right now, we're about halfway through that. That will complete in the second quarter. So you're going to see some commissioning and start-up costs in the second quarter as well. With that increase in feedstocks cost though and as I talked about the underlying earnings, plastics actually increased variable margins in the quarter. So their price and volume moves were very strong, and they did a good job in that space. They just had these one-time costs that hit them. Operator : And, next, we'll move on to Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Jeffrey J. Zekauskas: Thanks very much. Andrew N. Liveris: Morning. Jeffrey J. Zekauskas: Hi. Good morning. I think, Andrew that you plan to retire as CEO of The Dow Chemical Company on June 30. Are you open to playing a different leadership role following that retirement, or do you think your career will take a different direction? Andrew N. Liveris: Well, thank you, Jeff. That's about as direct a question I've had on the topic. Look, clearly, we \u2013 we the Board, the Board of the company decides what happens here. And with the delayed close, there has been an awful lot of dialogue. We're not ready to say anything yet, but we will have something to say very shortly. So if you beg our indulgence, that's a pretty important question you just asked. And nothing to do with my importance, everything to do with where we are in closing the merger. So we are talking at the Board level, and we'll have something to say very soon. Operator : And, next, we'll move on to John Roberts with UBS. Mr. Roberts, your line is open. Neal Sheorey : We'll move to the next question, please. Operator : We'll move on to Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Steve Byrne : Hi. I just wanted to drill in a little bit on materials co. Would you expect that materials co. would invest in downstream specialty products facilities adjacent to Sadara, similar to your Consumer and Infrastructure Solutions businesses, but just in that region? And then similar, on materials co., what would you anticipate revenues out of that spinco to be based off of value-based pricing versus commodity pricing? Can you roughly split between those two buckets? Andrew N. Liveris: I'll let Jim take the second piece. But Steven, the Saudi-related question and what happens in the construct of our three enterprises post-spin, there is a strong inclination here that the Saudis want to go downstream and want to diversify as part of their Vision 2030. We at Dow have been helping them with that strategy. And in fact we've got some of our own investments downstream, including our membranes facility that we have built there, which is 100% owned, as well as a coatings plant that is under construction that's in our Infrastructure Solutions business. So there's no question that they have interest in the next step of value. We haven't had large discussions about this as a merge co and future spincos yet. I think there's no question that all the spincos, but particularly the specialty co. and the materials co., would have interest in looking at what value creation can occur by being alongside the world's largest industrial complex that has a very low-cost footprint and is very integrated. So I'm sure those conversations will be brokered at the right time, but nothing right now because, of course, where we are right now in our creation of merge co. and spinco. Jim, did you want to add anything on pricing? James R. Fitterling: On your question on value pricing, greater than 60% of the materials co. portfolio today is consumer driven, and I would already consider in a value pricing type of an environment. When you bring in DuPont Performance Materials and you look at a pro forma of materials co., it's going to be north of $50 billion of revenue. And I would venture that DuPont Performance Materials is going to increase the amount of value pricing as a percent of the consumer-driven applications. So our intent is to continue to go downstream in innovation. As Andrew talked about, we're still investing in R&D. We've got a robust pipeline of new products coming out, automotive, transportation, energy-efficient building products and our food and specialty packaging products, high-pressure pipe. These are all areas that are value-added markets for us, and some of the highest returns that we have in the company. Operator : And next, we'll move on to Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial Group. Emily Wagner : Good morning. This is actually Emily Wagner on for Don. You guys confirmed that the total synergy number for the combined company would remain at $3 billion. Could you give us a bit more detail regarding where the additional synergies are coming from in the Materials and Specialty business? Andrew N. Liveris: Yeah. Look, thank you, Emily. We aren't ready to give you the details and the high-level breakdown that was reaffirmed by DuPont the other day, which is the Materials piece will go from $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion. The Ag, which saw the biggest hit from the remedy \u2013 the conditional remedy out of the European Union, we also know there is obviously some more to come there with China and Brazil. So Ag has lifted its number even with those remedies to $1 billion, and then spec co. to $0.4 billion. So that adds up to $3 billion. We knew going in that there is a lot more there than what we announced. We said $3 billion was the floor. Now that we've had a lot of remedy action, we are still confident we can speak to the $3 billion. When we get to close, we'll look under the tent. There is a few things that we're hopeful we'll find, especially in the procurement area and leverage cost. So that's work that Jim and Howard and others will be doing with their DuPont counterparts. But we can reaffirm the $3 billion, which is, I think, the most important thing we will say on that question. Operator : And, next, we'll move on to Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Laurence Alexander : Good morning. I just want to parse out one of the things you said in your opening remarks. For the $15 billion of EBITDA longer term, I think, you indicated that you do need a certain number of additional projects to get there. Roughly, how much CapEx are you thinking of to support that bridge? Andrew N. Liveris: Yeah. Howard, you haven't had a chance to speak. So why don't we get you to there? And maybe, Jim, you can back up. Howard I. Ungerleider: Sure, Andrew. Good morning, Laurence. So I mean, look, we've \u2013 last year, we peaked at CapEx at $3.8 billion. Just a friendly reminder, that was $100 million less than we had committed to externally. So it was a $3.9 million target, and we spent $3.8 million. This year, we're on trajectory to spend $3.4 billion. And our DNA, as the projects that we've talked about that Andrew and Jim both talked about on the call, as those roll off, our DNA will increase. So you can expect that we can deliver those kinds of EBITDA growth in line with spending at roughly DNA in the $3 billion to 3.4 billion range from a CapEx standpoint. James R. Fitterling: I would agree with Howard. And I think given the nature of what we've got in front of us, the next three or so years being incremental projects, albeit some of them pretty good sized increments, we can do it within those numbers. Operator : And we'll next to move to Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Arun Viswanathan : Great. Thanks, guys. Just had a question on Slide 26, your outlook for Q2. It looks like Corning is tracking well ahead of your expectations, but some of the start-up commissioning costs are a little bit stronger. Is that kind of a fair characterization? I mean maybe you can just help us walk through some of your expectations for Q2 and the rest of the year? Thanks. Andrew N. Liveris: Howard, now you go and then Jim can back up. Howard I. Ungerleider: Yes, sure. I mean, thanks for highlighting slide 26. I think that's an important slide when you look at the moving parts. I think you've characterized it right. I mean, the underlying volume growth and pricing growth is there, and that should continue. Dow Corning on the silicone's integration that continues. I mean, if you look at the silicones business, since we've owned it, it's grown volumes 6%. So you pick your GDP number, that's roughly 2x global GDP, I would say, at this point. When you look at the second quarter, you definitely are going to have headwinds on both finishing the commissioning of the U.S. Gulf Coast, the Texas-9 cracker and also the Terneuzen cracker that will go through the second quarter. It started in March, but there will be a big chunk of downtime in the second quarter. So that's why we're showing you the headwinds that are non-operating between the planned turnaround and the commissioning costs for Q2. James R. Fitterling: The only thing I would add, Howard, is that we had pricing momentum through the first quarter. So we ended March at better pricing than we had through the first quarter, so we take that into second quarter. And, as you know, some of these products as you have a pretty sizable step-up in input costs, they don't get passed through within a month. Some of them take a couple of months to pass through, so you'll see some of that come through in second quarter. Operator : Peter Butler with Glen Hill Investments will have our next question. Peter E. Butler: Hey, good morning, guys. In getting closer to the consumer increasing your market share in faster growth sectors, how much of an advantage do you guys have having your own sales force, your global sales force organization on the ground? Particularly compared to less advantage smaller competitors. For example, does it produce the extra several cents on polyethylene that your legendary CEO, Ben Branch, was always looking for? Andrew N. Liveris: Yes. May he rest in peace. Thank you, Peter. So I'll let Jim take that last piece of your question, but I do want to highlight a very important point I'll use as an example. So Sadara, we've been watching, of course, and building and constructing these 26 units for the last five years. But in parallel, Saudi Aramco gave us the marketing rights and sales rights because we're a trusted on the ground direct supplier to end use customers. We don't use agents. We don't use distributors. We use our own sales force. And we're on the ground in pretty much every country out there \u2013 162, to be precise. And these direct interactions we have \u2013 I talked about China on the Cramer segment I did today. The fact that we're in Western China, the fact that we're opening up in Urumqi China \u2013 go look it up on your map \u2013 we have this ability to create new demand, and we can create new demand and we have built a marketing plan and a sales plan with Sadara so that when Sadara starts up every one of its units, we have the warehouses, we have the direct sellers, we have the incremental selling plan, we have the new customers. We have brought the customers to Sadara. We have lined up all the sales such that all these units can start up and run pretty much flat out. That's Dow's sales machine and marketing machine, which was built decades ago, we've doubled down and tripled down on it, especially in the newer emerging geographies, whether they be Africa, whether they be the Middle East itself, whether they be the near Middle East, India and then, of course, Asia. Now, all of that is Dow playbook 101. And this is what I think we've been very, very good at in creating value-driven premiums for our newer portfolio. Over 60% of our portfolio now really is directly driven by end use consumer demand. So we work with our paint customers on their customers' needs, whether it be in China or whether it be in the United States. That functionality is driven by our innovation engine across the product mix and, in particular, the reorientation of plastics. So Jim, why don't you speak now to this premium that we have whether it's driven by packaging or elastomers? James R. Fitterling: The activity in sales, technical service and applications development exist in every region that we do business. So the labs are local. Customers can come into those labs and work together with us, and we can customize solutions for them. And also we target markets where we can achieve value for the return on business rather than just filling up assets with commodity products. The combination of those two things allows us to achieve higher returns on the polyethylene margins than our competitors. And, obviously, we're not an oil company or we're not a natural gas company. So we don't have that advantage. But we try to cover that with our feedstock flexibility on the integration end. But far and away, the vast majority of our investment is in downstream innovation, more application development and more solutions for these customers. The great example is automotive. We've already launched products in automotive that have chemistries from both Dow Corning and our Dow Automotive business. LIQUIDARMOR that Howard mentioned, silicones and acrylates, combinatorial chemistries to get us new Building & Construction products, already in packaging where Dow Corning had a big presence you already see that happen. When we bring DuPont Performance Materials into this, it's going to be huge. Operator : And next, we'll hear from Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Duffy Fischer : Yes, good morning. I wanted to drill down on your marketing agreement with the Saudis. How is that going to play out kind of at the sales line, the EBITDA line and the cash flow line as you report? We've got some production today. Are you seeing those sales roll through from your marketing agreement already? And how will that ramp? And then, do you have to take the working capital on your balance sheet to fill up all of those warehouses you were talking about? So just how should we think about that sales agreement flowing through your financials? Andrew N. Liveris: Howard? Howard I. Ungerleider: Yes, thanks, Duffy, for the question. If you go to Slide 26, we tried to give you little bit of modeling guidance, because you're right, because we do \u2013 we have responsibility to market the Sadara product everywhere outside of what we call the Middle East Zone, which is the countries around Saudi Arabia, including Saudi Arabia where Sadara will market for themselves. In the first quarter, about 20 basis points of our EBITDA margin dropped. So we had a 61 basis point margin drop year-on-year. 20 basis points of that was due to just the Sadara revenue ramping, because we essentially make a distributor-type or an agency-type commission on those sales. We preserve the profit. We get the 35% of Sadara's profit flowing to our equity earnings. So there is a little bit of disconnect between the two. At this point, I would say for the full year, you should expect about $1.5 billion of revenue coming into Dow's revenue from Sadara. And for the second quarter, we're calling between a 25 basis point and a 50 basis point margin compression on the Dow total bottom-line. Your question around working capital, it should balance itself out. Obviously, we've got to fill the pipeline, so there's a little bit of a build here in the first 90 days or 120 days of each asset coming up. But once they line out, it should be neutral on a Dow working capital basis. Operator : And next, we'll move on to John Roberts with UBS. John Roberts : Thank you. You've significantly cleaned up the JV accounting with the Dow Corning and MEGlobal actions. But even before SADAF, you look at slide 30, you still have a number of other JVs. Are we essentially done with the portfolio actions at the JVs? Andrew N. Liveris: No. Certainly, thank you for the statement. That was one of our goals, but we were in triple-digit numbers of JVs when we started this five, seven years ago. We're down now to double digits, but that's still a lot of double digits. We have a long tail. So Jim and Howard have been leading an effort and especially the financial group to get us out of the smaller ones. The big ones \u2013 there is still some work to be done there, and so we're \u2013 we won't say which ones, but we definitely are not stopped to answer your question. Operator : And we'll move on to Alex Yefremov with Nomura Instinet. Aleksey Yefremov : Good morning. Thank you. You mentioned margin compression in both Infrastructure and Consumer in the first quarter. Is it fair to say that from at least raw material margin perspective, first quarter would mark the low point for this year, adjusting for seasonality? Andrew N. Liveris: Do you want to go? James R. Fitterling: Yeah. Morning, Aleksey. I would say they've experienced a real spike in a couple of key raw materials. Propylene spiked pretty heavily in the first quarter. And then in Building and Construction where the Styrofoam brand installation is one of the big products, they saw a huge spike in styrene monomer, which hit them for polystyrene raw materials. They got prices moving through, but they didn't get enough through in the first quarter to cover all that. I think you'll see some of that improve as we go into the second quarter. I think that's the biggest issue there. The demand is strong. So I don't think there is any issue in terms of demand weakness. Operator : And, next, we'll move on to Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs. Ryan Berney : Good morning. This is Ryan Berney on for Bob. Andrew N. Liveris: Morning. Ryan Berney : I had a question for you on your slide 28. You have a chart at the bottom right showing PE inventories in the U.S., and it looks like you've shown enough years there to hopefully get a full cycle in there. And it looks like, right now, you're trending towards the bottom of that range. So my question for you is, given \u2013 in context, a lot of the consultant data seems to call for pretty big price reductions in the back half of this year, and yet we seem to be at the low end of this inventory range. How do you feel that those price discussions have historically played out when you are at the lower end of that range, and maybe what we should expect to see over the next couple of months? Andrew N. Liveris: Go ahead, Jim. James R. Fitterling: Yeah. So you're right. Chain margins are low. And in fact, if you went back to last year's charts on this, almost 75% of the data points on last year's charts were at the bottom end of that five-year range. So we continue in that space. There hasn't been much new polymer capacity added. There's been more new monomer capacity than polymer capacity. So these things get disconnected from time to time. Plus I think where you've got the new capacity coming on you're seeing some mix shift around the world. So you've got new capacity coming on in Northeast Asia and in Middle East. And you're bringing product back into the U.S. Gulf Coast. So you're seeing some movement in the regional prices. But we still see strong price momentum heading into Q2. We have North America looking like it's up $0.03, Latin America, similar, and Europe up about \u20ac30 a ton. So we're looking as we go into the quarter for continued price movement end of the quarter. Volumes are very strong. Operator : And next, we'll hear from Chris Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Perfect. Thank you. You hit on this a little, but just within Consumer Solutions, you saw pretty good growth across care, auto and silicones. But could you just comment across just the specific raw material headwinds you're seeing in that business, pricing pass through efforts, and just the rough cadence of how you see these themes evolving? Any color would be appreciated. Thanks. James R. Fitterling: Well, I would say in Consumer Solutions, probably, the biggest pass-through items are going to be when you get into areas where you have the propylene chain impacted. So you saw propylene prices, in some cases, spike pretty substantially in the quarter. And some of the pricing there is indexed to pricing, so it trails the increase in propylene prices. I think you've also got one bit of margin compression in there on a year-over-year basis. We had a unit in Europe called SAFECHEM that we had sold, so that comes out of Consumer Solutions. We also saw \u2013 in the silicones segment, we also saw strong volumes and good pricing movements in the quarter, so I think we're going to see that as we move into second quarter. Operator : And P.J. Juvekar with Citi will have our next question. P.J. Juvekar: Yes. Hi. Good morning. Just a couple of questions on ethylene, one short term and one long term. In the short term, can you compare the profitability in the first quarter of your U.S. versus European crackers, given that naphtha was advantaged for a while? And then on the long term, as new crackers start up on the Gulf Coast and Sadara, what is the future of MTO and CTO plants in China, obviously this is high-cost capacity, and do we need that during 2018 and 2019? Thank you. Andrew N. Liveris: Go ahead, Jim. James R. Fitterling: I'd say two things, P.J. On Europe, on the question specifically on Europe, I think the propane naphtha spreads have changed a lot through the quarter on Europe. And so at one point in the quarter in Europe, naphtha prices were fairly high. We crack a lot more LPGs over in Europe than we have historically. But as you know, we had Terneuzen down for turnaround. So it's a little bit hard to take all that back to the feedstock fundamentals. Once we get Europe \u2013 Terneuzen back up and running, I think, we'll see that. But on the issue of propane in the near term, I think that has pushed propane prices up. So relative to last year, the propane costs are a little bit higher even on that LPG spread. So I think you see a little bit of compression there on the ethylene side on Europe. And on the U.S, we had at different points in time naphtha, propane, butane and ethane. We've alternated between all four of them being the most favored crack in the U.S. Gulf Coast, which speaks to why we have feedstock flexibility, so we can move around with that. Right now, we're back to ethane being favored. Andrew N. Liveris: And on the China thing, just my direct exposure to the Chinese administration suggests their connectivity to emissions and emissions control is strong. So even though they have got the CTO/MTO capacity P.J., they're slowing it down quite a lot. And most of the stuff that's out up is really commodity low-value polyethylene. So it doesn't really impact much of the supply-demand balances. So I do believe that they're very serious about emissions. And that is part of the reason we're growing in China. We have a lot of good product to supply markets that control emissions like energy efficiency building materials. So all of that to tell you that we're not as concerned about the rate of that. Operator : And, next, we'll move on to Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Kevin W. McCarthy: Yes. Good morning. Your Performance Materials & Chemicals segment posted strong results relative to the street expectations and also year-over-year. So wondering if you could talk through your outlook for the polyurethanes business specifically. It seems to me you have a number of moving parts there in terms of industry outages in MDI. And I think you cited strength in systems, PDH uplift, etcetera. So how would you characterize the sustainability or durability that you saw in 1Q, as you look through the latter nine months of the year? James R. Fitterling: Yeah. Thanks, Kevin. The volume trends are very strong. If you look in polyurethanes, the systems volumes and the MDI volumes are both double-digit growth. And as you mentioned in North America we're going to be a little bit limited on MDI and PO, because we have a planned turnaround there. But the pricing momentum has been strong in those spots. And even when we come back, realize that we're not a merchant MDI seller. We're selling into the systems market and into formulated end product. So compared to some of our competitors who are big merchants, MDI sellers, we may look a little bit different there. The other thing I'd say, besides the volume and price moves, our equity earnings improved in this segment. And also, we're capturing some of the margins from on-purpose propylene. So at points in time in the first quarter, the spreads on propane propylene were as much as $0.30 a pound and we ran the unit at greater than 95% of capacity in the first quarter. So that helped too. Operator : And that will conclude the question-and-answer session. At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Neal Sheorey for any additional or closing remarks. Neal Sheorey : Thanks very much, Rochelle. Andrew, before we close the call, would you like to make any final comments? Andrew N. Liveris: Yes. I do want to go back to the questions, I hit at it, but I just want to wrap it all together. Slide 22 does the best job of wrapping it all together. The way you should be thinking about our year going forward is the 18 quarters in a row, we've got merge co running in front of us, so delivering the cost synergies, point number four on that slide, is job 1, 2 and 3, I mentioned that. Also getting everything ready for spin, including a comprehensive portfolio review as soon as practical so that we can really look at what markets align to what parts of the portfolio. We haven't had good views to that because we haven't been able to get together. And so we're very committed to working on that together so we can get the right shareholder story for the right time to deliver the right results. And then going forward, through the merge into the spin, the question on what's in the out years here, when the out years is only 2 or 3 years away in terms of CapEx and OpEx and all the things that we want to keep investing in. Incrementalizing our big, big investments of these last many years, the point number one, we're going to be delivering very strong cash flows from these incredible investments that we've been putting in place these last 5 years. We've delivered earnings growth. We've delivered strong cash flow increases. We've delivered shareholder remuneration, and we have right in front of us, tailwinds from those investments. So we're going to bring CapEx down to depreciation. We're going to invest in our downstreams where it makes sense. We're going to do that incrementally, and we're going to deliver the shareholder returns that we've been promising and have delivered, in fact, in these last many years. So that slide says a lot, and I want you to focus in on the commitments we are making and the financial underpinning of what that implies. Neal Sheorey : Thank you, Andrew, and thank you, everyone, for your questions. As always, we appreciate your interest in The Dow Chemical Company. For your reference, a copy of our prepared remarks will be posted on Dow's website later today. This concludes our call for today. We look forward to speaking with you again soon. Thank you. Operator : And that will conclude today's conference call. We thank you for your participation.",

I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Neal Sheorey. Please go ahead, sir. Neal Sheorey : Thank you and good morning.

EBITDA, EBITDA margins and earnings comparisons exclude certain items. I will now turn the call over to Andrew. Andrew N. Liveris: Thank you, Neal, and good morning. If you could look at slide 3. Our results in the second quarter further extended Dow's unparalleled track record of performance. The strategy we put in place more than a decade ago continues to prove its ability to deliver short and long term sustainable shareholder value under all business conditions. Here are some highlights from the quarter. 19 consecutive quarters of EPS growth, nearly five years. Only two other companies in the Fortune 100 can claim such a consistent track record of bottom-line growth and no other company in our industry. 15 consecutive quarters of volume growth, nearly four years. Our third consecutive quarter of all-time record EBITDA and broad-based top line growth as sales grew in every segment and in every geography. I'll come back to this in a minute. And we have achieved this while also driving the most comprehensive slate of growth investments in our industry which are now on the cusp of becoming earnings tailwind. In the Middle East, our Sadara joint venture has now achieved commercial operations at 25 of its 26 production units. On the U.S. Gulf Coast, startup of our ELITE enhanced polyethylene unit and our new world-scale cracker are imminent, and we advanced our proposed merger with DuPont, achieving conditional regulatory clearances, announcing the Board of Directors for DowDuPont and reaffirming our expectation to close in August. Turning to slide 4, I want to take a moment to expand on Dow's strong top-line performance in the quarter. We grew organic sales 8% in the quarter with gains in every operating segment and in fact in nearly every Dow business as well as in every geography. This is a testament to the increase in consumer-led demand that we continue to see for Dow products around the world driven by our strategic mix shift to downstream, high growth end-markets that are growing in a slow growth world, markets such as packaging, transportation, infrastructure, and consumer goods. Growth was particularly strong in key regions of North America and Europe where we grew sales greater than twice GDP as well as throughout Asia Pacific where new product from our Sadara joint venture is enabling us to meet the need of a growing middle class. Simply put, Dow again delivered in the second quarter as we have these last many quarters and we're entering merger close from a position of strength. I will spend some time later on the call discussing the exciting future we see as we embark on the next steps in our evolution into the world's leading material sciences company. But first I'll turn over the call to Howard and Jim to discuss our quarterly performance. In addition, they will describe the status of our growth projects and in response to recent question on the value creation of our integrated portfolio in both assets and markets, Howard will reveal new information on how the silicones platform has been a hand-in-glove fit to the Dow portfolio and Jim will discuss and show the value embedded in our integration. We have not shared this information before, but I feel it's time we show these numbers to you, our owners. First, the quarter. Howard? Howard I. Ungerleider: Thanks, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. Turning to slide 6 and a summary of our results. We delivered earnings per share of $1.08 which represents our highest second quarter EPS since 2005. Sales grew to $13.8 billion, volume and price both grew in all geographies for the second consecutive quarter. Price rose 5% as we drove pricing initiatives across many businesses in response to value and use as well as higher raw material costs. Volume grew 3% reflecting gains in all segments with notable strength in our downstream consumer-led sectors. EBITDA increased 12% to $2.8 billion with increases in all segments except Performance Plastics. Key earnings drivers in the quarter included broad-based consumer-driven demand, higher prices, improved mix including the benefit of new product introductions, and cost savings from both productivity and synergy. These gains more than offset higher feedstock costs, commissioning and startup expenses at Sadara and the U.S. Gulf Coast along with planned maintenance spending. These commissioning costs were in line with our modeling guidance and will continue into the third quarter. I encourage you to review the updated model and guidance in the appendix for more detail. After we close the DowDuPont transaction, we do plan to provide additional info to assist in building out your models. Moving to our business highlights, starting on slide 8. Despite a persistently soft ag market Dow AgroSciences continues to deliver. EBITDA was $326 million on strong demand for our novel Seeds and Crop Protection technologies and on benefits from lower operating cost. Seeds delivered double-digit volume gains led by higher demand for corn seed in Latin America and demand for cotton seed in North America. Our highly successful launch of ENLIST cotton in the quarter was a significant driver of the increase in demand. We also achieved import approvals, specifically in China, enabling the full commercial launch of ENLIST corn seed in the U.S. and Canada for the 2018 growing season. Crop Protection volume increased on higher demand for herbicide and insecticide which more than offset lower demand for fungicide. Dow Ag's robust Crop Protection innovations were, again, a key driver of growth in the quarter with notable contributions from ARYLEX broadlleaf herbicide, ISOCLAST insecticide and new corn herbicide formulations in North America. The business also benefited from accompanying sales of ENLIST DUO herbicide resulting from the launch of ENLIST cotton seed. Farmer reaction to ENLIST DUO has been overwhelmingly positive based on its highly effective volatility and drift profile when compared to traditional 2,4-D and glyphosate. We continue to expect $600 million of additional revenue from our new seed pipeline by 2020 of which ENLIST is a key driver. Moving to Consumer Solutions on slide 9. The segment delivered record quarterly EBITDA of $541 million and its eighth consecutive quarter of earnings growth. Volume gains were reported in all businesses and all geographies. Dow Automotive achieved record second quarter EBITDA and a 17th consecutive quarter of volume growth. The business continues to outpace the automotive end market largely due to strong demand for our innovative platform of structural adhesives. Consumer Care reported volume growth in all geographies as well as double-digit gains in pharma and food applications and Dow Electronic Materials delivered its eighth consecutive quarter of EBITDA growth and an all time record EBITDA. The business drove double-digit volume gains in most geographies with strong demand in semiconductor, OLED and printed circuit board applications. Electronic Materials also had a one-time benefit from the sale of Dow's share in a non-core joint venture. And with the addition of our silicones platform, we were able to achieve new commercial wins and market share gains across each of our Consumer Solutions businesses. Infrastructure Solutions on slide 10 achieved record EBITDA of $556 million, driven by volume growth, the contribution from silicones and a one-time benefit from a building sale resulting from the integration. Dow Building & Construction delivered volume gains on strong demand for methyl cellulosics and acrylics-based construction chemicals. Dow Coating Materials reported higher sales as price increases gained traction in most geographies and Performance Monomers reported price and volume growth on opportunistic sales of acrylates and methacrylates. On slide 11, Performance Materials & Chemicals delivered EBITDA of $347 million as broad-based sale gains in all businesses and geographies more than offset the impact of higher raw material costs. Polyurethane sales grew double digit and the business recorded its 15th consecutive quarter of volume growth led by strong demand in downstream higher-margin system applications. Industrial Solutions sales increased in all geographies on pricing momentum and higher demand into lubricants, crop defense and electronic processing applications. Chlor-alkali and Vinyl sales increased, led by double-digit gains in caustic soda and vinyl chloride monomer in EMEAI. On slide 12, Performance Plastics achieved its fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year sales growth. EBITDA was $1.1 billion, down from a second quarter record of $1.2 billion in the year-ago period. Price gains were more than offset by increased feedstock and energy costs, commissioning and startup expenses and the impact of higher maintenance activity, all of which were in line with our modeling guidance. Packaging and Specialty Plastics delivered record second quarter sales volume and the 12th consecutive quarter of volume growth, led by double-digit increases in EMEAI and Asia Pacific, partially supported by Sadara volume. Elastomers achieved volume gains led by a double-digit increase in EMEAI on demand growth in automotive and infrastructure applications. Now let's turn to an update on our value drivers beginning with slide 14. Throughout our nearly five years of delivering consistent bottom line growth and increasing shareholder returns, we have also continued to build for our future. Dow's comprehensive growth investments are fundamentally rooted in the key pillars of our business model, aligning to our key chemistries and value chains where we hold industry-leading positions, leveraging our world-class innovation expertise across technology platforms to serve our core material science market, combining scale and operational excellence, optimizing value through operational reliability as well as feedstock flexibility, and enhancing our global reach to capture consumer driven demand and grow where growth exists. On slide 15, I'd like to start with the successes we have achieved in our first full year following the Dow Corning ownership restructure. The silicones integration continues to exceed all of our expectations. First, we have reinvigorated the financial performance of the business. Prior to the restructure, Dow Corning's revenue and earnings had plateaued. In the past year, we have accelerated the business' bottom line growth by double-digit, while at the same time broadening the addressable market for silicone, expanding its customer base, and bringing Dow's sell-out and sell-up mindset into its operational discipline. We have also significantly outperformed on the cost synergies. After raising the initial target to $400 million, we achieved a full two-year run rate in just 10 months, as you know. And today, I am pleased to report that we have uncovered even more opportunity. As a result of implementing Dow's unique business model and our work processes into the and across the silicones platform, we now see a total cost synergy opportunity of more than $650 million across Dow, up more than 50% from our previously stated target. We expect to achieve this higher run rate by the end of 2018. And today, we are already at a run rate of more than $500 million. We're also making strong progress to accelerate growth utilizing our silicones platform. In addition to our $100 million growth synergy target, we now see more than $500 million of additional Dow-enabled bottom line growth across the enterprise, driven by volume and mix benefit from integrating silicones into the Dow portfolio, and going narrower and deeper into our four market verticals. Taken together, these cost and growth drivers greatly enhance silicones' profitability. We now see EBITDA increasing to more than $2 billion at full run rate by the end of 2019, more than double our initial projection. The vast majority of these benefits are exclusive to Dow, uniquely enabled by our capabilities, our infrastructure, our scale, our value chain focus and application development leverage at the customer interface. Turning to slide 16. Our successes to-date have been achieved due to the strategic hand-in-glove fit between Dow and our silicones platform, not just in our markets and applications, but in the very essence of our business model and our asset footprint. Silicones as a platform is rooted in integration and innovation. It is at its core an organic chemistry capability. And as you can see on this slide, the manufacturing is a multi-step, asset-intensive process. Our silicones manufacturing is back integrated into the key building block, including silicon metal, which are used to produce basic silicones or siloxanes at key sites globally. These are then fed to our downstream systems and finishing units, often at the same integrated site, to produce high-value formulations in our core material science markets of packaging, transportation infrastructure, and personal care. The end result is a financial profile of the silicones platform that is nearly identical to Dow's, especially now that we've captured cost synergies as we've integrated silicones into the Dow business model. The integration of silicones, however, goes beyond assets to the growth side of the equation, as you can see on slide 17. Here you see why we continue to be so excited about this transaction. The hand-in-glove fit with silicones is a growth accelerator. We're already seeing it, as the silicones platform captured demand growth at nearly 2 times GDP in 2016 and the first half of this year. Going forward, the value of our combined chemistry platforms, broader channels to market, and multiple touch points through the value chain, is enabling $7 billion of addressable market expansion in our key market verticals through 2020. This is why we are so confident in continuing our top line growth trajectory and further extending our leadership position. No one in our space can match the deep capabilities, differentiation, and material science expertise that we now bring to bear in these sectors. But the benefits don't stop at our growth or cost synergy capture. We've also started to capture benefits from key operational improvements that have been released as a result of being integrated into Dow's business model. From improvement in safety performance to working capital efficiencies to increased productivity, all of these improvements enhanced our unique ability to drive efficient earnings growth and deliver the step change in financial performance I showed on the last slide. To sum it up, the first year of the integration has gone faster and better than even our highest expectations. The transaction was immediately accretive, and the progress we continue to make will further enhance shareholder value in ways that are truly unique to Dow. With that, Jim will cover the rest of our value driver. James R. Fitterling: Thanks, Howard. Let's turn to our Sadara joint venture on slide 18. I cannot stress enough the magnitude of the progress that the Sadara team has made since our last earnings call. The JV brought online nine additional units, including PO/PG, polyols, amines, and glycol ethers. Year-to-date, we have started up 21 units. And today, Sadara is commercially operating 25 of its 26 production units, with the final unit preparing for startup. Product marketing and distribution have gone well, and the work we've done to establish channels to market and generate customer excitement is paying off. In the second quarter, Sadara sold nearly 0.5 billion pounds and was a tangible growth driver in our Performance Plastics franchise. All plastics unit, as well as the cracker, have demonstrated at or above their design capability. Looking ahead, we still see 2017 as a startup year, as the units continue to increase production rate, optimize integration reliability, build inventory, and qualify products with customers, and the JV remains on track to achieve the financial targets we set out for the year. Moving to the U.S. Gulf Coast on slide 19, we have completed construction of our new world-scale ELITE enhanced polyethylene train, and the startup is imminent. Once online, we will ramp toward full prime production and begin qualifying material with customers and replenish our supply chain in the Americas. You should expect this unit to deliver earnings contribution starting in the fourth quarter. Startup of our new Texas-9 facility, the ethylene cracker, is also imminent. In fact, we've begun to introduce hydrocarbons into the unit. Once online, the cracker will ramp as derivative production increases throughout this quarter. The next unit online will be our new tubular high-pressure low-density polyethylene facility in Clacama, (19:06) which is the same design as the one in Sadara. This train is on track for mechanical completion in the fourth quarter and is expected to begin contributing to earnings in the first quarter of 2018. These new facilities will build on the successes and the benefits of those investments that we've already completed. The recent expansion of our Louisiana-3 cracker has been a huge success. This project increased the ethane cracking flexibility of the unit while maintaining our propane and our naphtha flexibility. We've tested the full capabilities of the unit and we're already seeing results. This past quarter, Clacama (19:42) achieved its second consecutive quarterly ethylene production record and for the first time ever, the site produced over half a billion pounds of ethylene in a single quarter. Our PDH unit also delivered another quarter of bottom-line benefits. We recently took the unit down for planned maintenance after more than a year of operation and implement best practices and make improvements to ensure long-term reliability. PDH is back on line and ramping to rate. We continue to make improvements to the process to take this technology to higher reliability levels. And finally, we continue to put in place future growth drivers. Last quarter, we announced the next phase of comprehensive investments. Approximately $4 billion over the next five years involving a series of low capital intensity, fast payback, high return on capital projects. These investments are expected to start coming online in 2020. Taken on the whole, Dow's program of near-term and long-term growth projects further enhances our strategic pillars of integration strength and innovation capabilities deployed into a focused set of core end markets. On that note, I would like to discuss the future of the Material Science Company and the value creation from our unique integration plus innovation strategy on slide 20. Let's start with the depth and breadth of our integration across the value chain which continues to serve as a key differentiator and competitive advantage for Dow. Market dynamics can shift significantly over time and the last several years bear witness to that. Dow's strategic choice to own entire value chain gives us a competitive advantage to manage volatility through unmatched feedstock flexibility, geographic diversification, and a differentiated product and market portfolio. As I've said before, no one rivals Dow in these capabilities. In contrast to commodity chemicals companies that typically run our cracker plus one model, Dow is a cracker plus five, downstream value-add player. In fact, in some cases, we reach as high as cracker plus nine as is the case for our Texas operations in Freeport. The power of our key building blocks of ethylene, propylene and silicone is amplified by our market-back approach and by leveraging the complexity of molecular and physical integration. This, coupled with our deep material science expertise makes us the preferred partner to our customers by delivering high-tech solutions from these industry-leading technology platforms. The result of this industry-leading physical integration is a more agile and robust enterprise ready to adapt at the speed of business today. On slide 21 while product and asset integration are important foundational elements, there are other aspects of integration that are equally critical in enabling Dow's competitive advantage. Dow's integrated ecosystem leverages functional and business collaboration in critical areas including purchasing and procurement, leveraged services, information technology, operations and engineering, and it unlocks immense value. We believe that our level of integration is unique and therefore holds tremendous value. We've done an enormous amount of work over the last decade both within Dow as well as with independent third parties including banks and consultants to quantify the value of Dow's integration. These multiple comprehensive analysis, some of which have been completed very recently, have shown the intrinsic value of our integration approaching $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion per year. This is the power of scale and leverage and something that we continuously refine. It provides a formidable source of sustainable and stable competitive advantage and it is a benefit that Dow enjoys as a result of our business model as well as the source of value to our shareholders. That brings me to innovation, which is at the heart of everything we do at Dow. As we've pivoted our businesses to a consumer-led model, we have reinvigorated the innovation engine and we've enhanced the value the customers enjoy from our material science expertise earning us a seat at the design table in our core markets around the world. This did not happen overnight. It was methodically built through disciplined investment. More than $8 billion in R&D investment over the past five years coupled with a sharp focus on developing proprietary capabilities to innovate faster and partner more closely throughout the value chain. We also established core technology platforms that stretch across the enterprise. You can see how we leverage these platforms across multiple businesses and in some unexpected places. Elastic adhesives in Dow Automotive, polyurethane's chemistry in Dow Electronic Materials, cellulosic and acrylic technologies in Dow Building & Construction. We received a huge boost last year with the silicones addition, which brought an additional platform to unlock new to the world solutions in high-growth end-markets, combining silicones with acrylates with urethane with polyolefins, and with our cellulosics chain. These chemistry innovations are fueled by our proprietary high throughput research engine and our application development capabilities. And turning to slide 23, you can see that the results of our efforts are evident, from 2010 through 2016 our innovation revenue has nearly doubled while at the same time, our innovation EBITDA has tripled, and year-to-date our new innovation EBITDA is now more than one-third of Dow's total EBITDA. In summary, market-driven innovation derived from interconnected technology platforms is in Dow's DNA. It is not something siloed in individual business units, but rather the strong technology platform developments are leveraged across the entire enterprise. We strongly believe that this unique innovation model delivers greater value than any individual business could on its own and our track record of success speaks to this achievement. With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Andrew. Andrew N. Liveris: Thank you, Jim and turning to slide 25. I'd like to take a moment now to look back on the track record that Jim and Howard have both spoken of, of execution that Dow has delivered these last many years. It's a track record of consistent and reliable financial and operating performance that no other company in our industry can match. As I've mentioned, only two other companies in the entire Fortune 100 have. It's a track record achieved through the foresight result of a highly dedicated board and management team who've put in place more than a decade ago the strategy you heard Howard and Jim speak to today. We have thoughtfully and consistently executed against this strategy through a business model that emphasizes long-term value creation and in doing so have delivered impressive EPS growth, significant volume gain, greater quality and consistency in our earnings, and ultimately, increasingly rewarding our shareholders. Turning to slide 26, we have achieved this through aggressive portfolio management, divesting low ROC, non-strategic assets, totaling more than $15 billion of revenue since 2009. We have shifted our earnings mix to more consumer-driven exposure from 35% in the early 2000s to now more than 60% of our portfolio. This has significantly enhanced our ability to generate consistent earnings growth across the cycle. Our beta as a company has significantly reduced as a result, as you can see on the slide. Today it is about half of what it was five years ago and even more so when you compare it to the early 2000s. On slide 27, we have highlighted some of our successes in the past and that I'll be repeating. An EBITDA growth CAGR of 8% over last four years with more than $10.5 billion delivered over the last four quarters, an EPS CAGR of 18% over the last four years and with tangible drivers in place to push this to higher in the near term. A market cap that we have more than doubled and nearly $18 billion returned to shareholders since 2012 through share buybacks and a record high annual dividend. These numbers have not come by accident. Dow's ability to integrate silicones and achieve greater than $650 million in synergy plus our embedded integration value of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion as articulated by both Howard and Jim is a differentiator compared to our peers. These results have earned us the right to be where we are today at a turning point in our history. And with that, let's look forward to the upcoming close of our merger with DuPont as we stand on the cusp of this seminal transaction and the next chapter in Dow's growth story. All remedy actions are on track. We still have a few more select approvals from key jurisdictions which we believe are imminent and we still expect to close in August. Going into merger close, the Dow team is coming from a position of incredible strength with a proven track record of success. We are ready for day one. Our teams will be immediately mobilized to capture the $3 billion of cost synergies. Our playbooks are ready with clear line of sight to milestone and accountability. We'll also move quickly on the intended spins which we still expect to complete within 18 months of close with the intended Material Science Company expected to spin first. Our team remains focused and disciplined with a sharp execution mindset on continuing to control what we can control. We have the right strategy, the right long-term growth drivers and the right portfolio and we have proven it over and over again. We have never been better positioned to continue to deliver for our customers, employees, communities and our owners. We enter the merger strong and we will exit the merger stronger. With that, Neal, let's turn to Q&A. Neal Sheorey : Thank you, Andrew. Now we will move on to your questions. I ask that you please keep to one question so that we can allow as many people as possible the opportunity to ask a question. First, however, I would like to remind you that my comments regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. Rochelle, would you please explain the Q&A procedure? Operator : Thank you. We'll take our first question from P.J. Juvekar with Citi. P.J. Juvekar: Yes, thank you and good morning. Andrew N. Liveris: Good morning. P.J. Juvekar: You know, a question on sort of ethylene industry. There's an expectation that there's an industry downturn in 2018 driven by all this new crackers, but you have Texas mine starting up, Sadara starting up. Is it possible that Dow's Performance Plastics EBITDA will continue to grow through a potential downturn? Andrew N. Liveris: Jim? James R. Fitterling: Hi, P.J. Yes, we think it will. As a matter of fact, demand has been solid for all those products and as we noted for this year, through the first half of the year, price has been up. Packaging and Specialty Plastics, for example, is up 5% year-over-year and if you look at both North America and Europe, both pricing and margins have been up. We have a couple of things in the quarter that I think point up to some deltas. We have some higher input costs and feedstock costs, so gas and some of the natural gas liquids are up year-over-year. In this particular quarter and going into third quarter, we'll have some higher startup costs as we're bringing on the Gulf Coast asset, and the Sadara volume is there, so you could see that show up in the earnings growth or the volume and revenue growth in Sadara. I would say that those volumes are not yet carrying EBITDA as we're bringing up the entire asset and the entire complex so that will start to add value. Look, I think that we've got a couple of things happening. One of the reasons that we have this full integration is to capture the margin shift, which moves all the time between ethylene and polyethylene and that vertical integration, that feedstock flexibility, enables us to have that, plus these investments are not all geared to one homogeneous polyethylene market. They're four different technologies that we're building, similar to what we're building in Sadara. Sadara is focused on growing the developing world. We're focused on growing our Americas market tier. (33:25) Both of those markets, at these growth rates, these GDP growth rates today, have the ability to take that kind of increase. Globally, it still takes two to three world-scale crackers per year to keep up with the GDP rate growth, and if the GDP increases, it'll take more than that. Operator : And next we'll hear from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Vincent Stephen Andrews : Thank you and good morning, everyone. Andrew N. Liveris: Good morning. Vincent Stephen Andrews : China has filed with the WTO to ban the import of a variety of plastics, but in particular polyethylene, at least certainly by the beginning of next year, and maybe phasing it in by the end of last year. I'm just wondering what your thoughts are on that generically, in terms of whether you think it'll be implemented and what impact it will have on the balance as we move into 2018? Thank you. Andrew N. Liveris: Go ahead, Jim. James R. Fitterling: Good morning, Vince. We saw that news and that announcement and are aware of it, and I would just clarify a couple of things. So I think the big driver for what China announced is maybe not what we typically think of as recycling of neat resins and compounds, but it was the shipment of what I would call foreign garbage into China, and so they're banning kind of some of those streams of materials coming in, and the real driver was to protect community health and the environment. So countries were sending all kinds of stuff into China, and it wasn't going in to be recycled and put into food packaging. They just want to make sure that it doesn't get recycled and put into food packaging. If you look at all that trash that went into China in 2016, PET was the top volume for most of that scrap, two-thirds of it. 35% was polyethylene, I would say. It's mostly into applications like garbage bags, some injection molding, or some compound related stuff. So yeah, it might have an impact around the margins, but that trash is going to go somewhere else, and I think, if we'll move it out of China, we'll move it into some other market, probably in the ASEAN region, so we'll probably have to watch what happens out there. Operator : And next we'll move on to Alex Yefremov with Nomura Instinet. Aleksey Yefremov : Good morning, thank you. You're making a case for benefits of various integrations throughout the company. If you look at vertical integration from building blocks to higher-end specialty chemicals, and then the horizontal integration was deep market understanding and R&D expertise, so which one do you think is more important, the horizontal one or the market integration? Andrew N. Liveris: Well, I think you've seen some material today, Alex, that we haven't shown before that basically says both. In essence, the change in the portfolio of the company is the reason we've had this five straight years of earnings growth, it's a mix question, but it's also an integration, innovation question that combined, we no longer are a seller of outputs that are commodity products, very little bit of our mix, so we're in control of our own destiny about where value gets created, and value gets created in different parts of the value chain depending on the market condition, and what Jim articulated on the answer to, I think, P.J.'s question, is true right through our system integration, and so this ability to do both vertical and horizontal with equal impact is in the hands of only, I'm going to use, say, two companies in the entire sector, and you know the other one. It's in Europe, and so there is no benchmark we have any more, which is where people start to fail when they do some of the past comparison. And in fact, our intrinsic value more than beats some of the past comparison, so we are all for displaying where value gets created in both parts of your question right now, and I think it's being highlighted of course through many things, not the least of it being the portfolio review that's been initiated. Operator : And we'll move on to Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo. Frank J. Mitsch: Good morning, gentlemen, and Neal, I just want to say, I look forward to our follow-up and discussing slide 20 in great detail through all of the product flows, so I'm looking forward to that. Andrew and team, you guys made a compelling case for the inclusion of silicones into MaterialsCo, laying out some new data for us. I'm assuming that that has also been shared with your soon-to be-marriage partner, as well as McKenzie, that's doing a deep dive into the structure of DowDuPont, et cetera. What has been the initial feedback from those parties, if you can share that with us? Andrew N. Liveris: Let me give you a quick answer, and I'll pass it over to Howard. So the answer is yes, it's been shared. There is no feedback loop yet and the parties are very aligned that we're going to do this very thoroughly, Frank, and then go out to the marketplace with the outcome, so we're not in the business of jump-starting or gun-jumping that, but I think it's very important that we get this deeply grounded and satisfy every investor, not just a few, and so that's where we are and I think, Howard, did you want to add anything to that? Howard I. Ungerleider: Frank, good morning. I mean, I think the prepared commentary really speaks for itself. I just couldn't be prouder of team Dow. Remember where we started with the cost synergies. When we announced the transaction in 2015, we were talking about $300 million. When we did day 1 of Dow Corning restructure, we increased that to $400 million. Now we're saying that number is more than $650 million, and we're already at a $500 million run rate. So that's exciting, and that's one of the key reasons \u2013 that was the key reason why it was accretive on day one to Dow, but the growth side, I think, is equally compelling, in terms of the market verticals that we talked about. So we'll see where the portfolio review takes us, but we feel very good about the hand-in-glove fit with Dow and in MaterialsCo. Operator : And next we'll move on to John Roberts with UBS. John Roberts : Thank you. At the bottom of slide 31, you talk about additional guidance post-merger. Will you have pro forma third quarter results in time for the third quarter reporting, or will pro forma third quarter come after the initial results that might exclude DuPont during July? Andrew N. Liveris: Howard. Howard I. Ungerleider: Hey, John. So look a couple of things on that and I appreciate the question. Both Dow and DuPont at a company level will continue to file Qs and Ks with the SEC, so I would say similar to what you see as a Carbide filing today. We will get DowDuPont high level filings on a pro forma basis. These are high level combined company and they'll reflect the purchase accounting impact. Those should come within 75 days of close. Our plan right now is to provide pro forma segment information, so sales and EBITDA for DowDuPont by quarter. For the full year 2016 and most likely through June 30, through the second quarter and the plan would be to release those if we can in the month of October and a separate 8-K filing to give you at least a couple of weeks if you want to update your model before earnings. We've got a lot of work to do, so I can't commit to that but that is the intent. Operator : And we'll move on to David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. David I. Begleiter: Thank you, good morning. Andrew, on the review of the portfolio, what is the timing of the completion and what's the potential to see more than three companies being created from this new DowDuPont organization? Andrew N. Liveris: Yeah, look \u2013 thank you, David. So as I said in the answer to the earlier question, the timing is as soon as we can. I mean, I think it's very important that we get transparency and output on a portfolio review. We had agreed to this back at the signing of the original agreement, so this is not new news to us that we knew we would do this based on better facts, and using a third-party as announced by the two parties, Dow and DuPont, a few weeks ago and that McKenzie has stated. We'll have an output hopefully in the next 30 or so days maybe 45 days, so we don't want to rush it, but clearly as we showed today on the call, there's a lot of compelling information both parties have that are now being turned by our friends at McKenzie. I would say to you that everything is on the table, as I've said many times and we're open-minded for shareholder value-based on better fact and if it results in more than three companies so be it and there's a trade-off on value here that has to be explained to all of our owners and that is do you delay getting some of the synergies to make room for more companies, but that's the sort of work that we're going to get feedback on and the combined board will see that hopefully no later than that timeframe I indicated. Operator : And Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan will have our next question. Jeffrey J. Zekauskas: Thanks very much. Your cash flow from operations for the first half was about $500 million lower year-over-year, and it seems the primary source of that was an elevation in receivables which were up $1.1 billion sequentially and maybe $1.6 billion year-over-year. I'm sure that you'll be able to get your receivables lower by the end of the year, but can you get them under $10 billion or under $10.5 billion? Can you explain what will happen in the receivables area? And secondly, was the point of Howard's discussion of the strength of silicones and the point of Jim's discussion about the strength of Dow's vertical integration will exemplify the progress that the company has made over time or was it a commentary that to split material sciences into pieces would be value-destructive? Andrew N. Liveris: Jeff, you asked two questions which is very good of you, so the second question let me tackle and then give you the first question to Howard. Look, there is no intent other than transparency. I think it's very clear that over time market conditions and shareholder conditions change and where one makes money can't be opaque, we worry about competitive information all the time and what we reveal to our competitors. But it's very important that all the facts get out on the table through this review. And frankly, we've been sitting on a lot of facts here for a long time. You yourself asked us for those on a constant basis, so we are very prepared to let all of our owners know what the consequences are of where money gets made in an enterprise, as I said earlier, very unique in this sector. There is no comparator other than our friends in Germany. So Howard, first question? Howard I. Ungerleider: Yeah. Thanks, Jeff for the question. So look on cash from ops, first quarter cash from \u2013 working capital is usually a use of cash, second quarter it usually starts to be a source. It wasn't this quarter as you highlighted. A key reason for that is the sales growth. Remember, we had 8% organic sales growth, so a 3% volume, 8% price. Of the $900 million increase in working capital, you've got $800 million of that was receivables, $200 million of that was higher inventory, that was offset by more than $250 million in net income. One of the key reasons for that is we were building out the Sadara value chain, so once all the 26 unit operations are stabilized, Sadara should be a net neutral to us on a total working capital, but obviously, we're building out the supply chain throughout the world, so that was a little bit of the use. The other thing that was unfavorable from a year-ago, we had $200 million in one-time legal settlement that weren't in the year-ago period, so that's the other factor. I would expect that we will continue to see a source of cash from working capital in the back half of the year. In fact, I would expect the third quarter numbers to be very positive. Operator : And next we'll move on to Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global. Hassan I. Ahmed: Good morning, Andrew. A decent set of numbers in Performance Plastics despite some of the headwinds that you guys talked about be it startup costs of the Gulf Coast crackers and Sadara, be it some of the movements that we've seen in oil and NGL prices. Question around sort of declining oil prices, as I take a look \u2013 and this is for your rest of the world, non-north American assets, as I take a look at naphtha, the naphtha to crude oil ratio seems to be at 20 year lows. It seems that there is copious amount of naphtha out there. Just, a, wanted your views on how that impacts your non-North American assets. I mean, are we in this sort of pricing regime now going forward where there will be an oversupply of naphtha, maybe potentially if ethylene remains tight, your naphtha-based ethylene facilities could actually start generating outsized returns? Andrew N. Liveris: Go ahead, Jim. James R. Fitterling: Hi, Hassan. It's a good question because through the quarter and second quarter, we were in a position where at any given point in time, there wasn't a lot of difference between naphtha, ethane and propane in terms of what the (47:32) crackers. You had some times when naphtha by-products drove naphtha cracking, obviously with styrene and butadiene and the aromatics chain that drove that for a while, and then with all of the exports of NGLs going out of the U.S. Gulf Coast, you had periods where there was no difference between ethane and propane. So we didn't get the normal kind of feedstock flex advantage that you see in the quarter. I would say, it's a little bit like ships passing in the night. Something is going to become favored here as we move into the third quarter. If it's naphtha, we're in a position to take advantage of that, obviously, in Thailand, in Sadara and obviously in our European assets. If it's propane, that's huge Dow advantage, and if it's ethane we've got increased volume out of our ethane cracking flexibility on the plant. So I think in any of the scenarios we'll be okay. We're looking at longer term and I think everybody is trying to get their hands-on what's going to happen with the oil pricing. What's happening with the fundamentals versus what's happening in the speculative market on that. If the available production that's out there for oil continues to reduce, then you could see a scenario where this start to turn with oil becoming constructive and that's a very different scenario than we're in right now. Obviously, what we're going to do for the rest of the year is make sure that we protect ourselves in the case that oil continues to keep pressure on naphtha, and we'll max our naphtha cracking if we need to. Operator : And next we'll move to Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Steve Byrne : Yes, thanks. I have a question for you, Howard, on ag. Given some of the dynamics that are going on right now in ag, there could be increased demand for your ENLIST soybean product next year. Just wanted to ask if you had any idea what's holding up Chinese import approval for either the two versions of that trait that you have and if you are to get approval on that in the next month or so, are you likely to ramp up seed production this winter in South America and what kind of a launch could you have next year? Howard I. Ungerleider: So Steve, look, thanks for the question. I mean, I agree with your thesis, and I would say that if you think about ENLIST, we had the full system launch both seeds, traits and ENLIST DUO herbicide cotton in the spring of this year. It was a tremendous success. We sold out of the seeds. We exceeded grower expectation on weed control with ENLIST DUO, and we've had near a zero volatility and reduced drift formulation, the applications have stayed on target. Very excited that we received China approval for ENLIST corn, so that launch will happen in the U.S. and Canada in the 2018 season. On soy, I really don't want to get ahead of ourselves. We always knew that soy would be after corn, so we are on track from that perspective. We have done, we believe, everything within the Chinese regulatory process to have that application ready for approval and so at this point, it really is up to the Chinese government as to when that approval will happen. Andrew N. Liveris: I just want to chime in, because besides the obvious on the corn one and now the soy, Steve, you know besides the obvious. It's hugely political, so I'm spending a considerable amount of my time and my capital in China to get this one over the line just like we did with corn. That wasn't easy and it certainly was part of Trump 100 Day plan. We're not pessimistic. We're optimistic we can get the soy, but we don't want to overpromise and under deliver, but we're spending considerable political time on this. Operator : And next we'll move on to Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Robert Koort : Thanks very much. Another ag question if I might. I notice that prices were down in both crop chemicals and seeds. Could you talk about how that happened given maybe some expectations, some mix upgrades and then generally, what do you see for that pricing dynamic as corn and soybeans remain somewhat moderate levels here? Thanks. Andrew N. Liveris: Yeah, Bob thanks for the question. Look, we're still in a tough ag macro. I mean, the overall sector is still forecasted to be down on the top line, 1% or 2%. And I think our story this quarter was really about volume and the delivery of new technologies, but we did have price pressure, as you saw in both areas, but we were able to deliver EBITDA up 40% year-on-year, really on the Crop Protection side, the rice herbicide in China, generic impact, off-patent molecule and a high-level of channel inventory. Now, it came closer to normal than it was in the first quarter, but it's still slightly above average is the way I would talk about it. In Seeds, look, it's a highly competitive price environment. Our price cards were in line with the competition and so we're doing what we need to do. We're growing volume, we're delivering the new molecule and we're dealing with continued productivity to keep the EBITDA growing. Operator : And next we'll move to Peter Butler with Glen Hill Investments. Peter E. Butler: More on ag chemicals. Regarding the agricultural situation, the weather is always bad. What is Dow's meteorologists saying about the weather in the corn belt this year and does this impact when you think Dow thinks that the ag cycle is bottoming? Andrew N. Liveris: We have a meteorologist on the call. Howard would you like to try it? Howard I. Ungerleider: Let me channel my meteorology department. I guess, Peter, I would agree with you and of the two of us, Jim is more the ag guy because he's from Missouri and I'm from New York, but what I would say is in ag, I think you're right, but we're always one weather event or one pest event away from a \u2013 of a turn. We have been in this kind of ag session probably for two, almost three, growing seasons. So I believe we're at the bottom, and you can see it in our results. You can see it in several of the other peer results that have been published. You're starting to see earnings growth now through the sector, so everybody is right-sizing their productivity side of the equation. And when you look at the new innovations that we're putting out there, we have proven, with the Dow ag portfolio, that they've earned the right to be on the podium, and then when you combine that with DuPont, the weather future for the ag co looks extremely bright. Operator : And next we'll move on to Chris Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Thank you. This is just a derivative of Dave's question, but both you and DuPont have clearly done a solid job in purging costs and pruning various segments. That said, could we just get an update on how you would characterize these actions, not only in terms of past execution, but much more importantly, how investors and shareholders should perceive these efforts in terms of the potential future value creation of the separate company spins and what you're actually thinking about portfolio transformation, especially if there's going to be an announcement in the next 30, 45 days, I imagine you have some at least preliminary ideas? Thank you. Andrew N. Liveris: Jim, why don't you take the first chunk of that, and I'll add some comments. James R. Fitterling: Yeah, so just to go back a little bit. I mean, we completed, or we had a program that went back to 2012, that we completed in the first quarter of 2015, which was about a $1.75 billion productivity program, and that was an across-the-board program. It looked at, obviously, the structure of our organization, so how many layers and what were the spans of control in the organization. It also looked at what we could do from a procurement standpoint, what we can do from site management internally. We did a restructuring program, basically in 2015, that we just closed out this quarter, so that's $900 million. It was even more, some levels of automation, retiring old systems, investments in IT capabilities. If you look at where we are in this quarter, we generated greater than $200 million; I think it was $215 million of what I'd call productivity savings in the quarter. You could think about that as about 40% of that was self-help measures and productivity internal to the organization, independent of the deal, and the rest of that was silicones-related cost synergies that came out. And on silicones, you can think about leveraging scale and leveraging location, physical location. It was kind of unique to Dow. Obviously Midland, big locations like Shanghai, S\u00e3o Paulo and places where we had duplicate resources, we could leverage that. And we're just now starting to leverage on to the one IT platform. So I think those are \u2013 it's not one spot, you have to look at it as a matrix inside of the organization, but we've done it many different ways, at many different points in time. Andrew N. Liveris: Just the view going post-spin is, you really \u2013 if you think about this unique opportunity through this transaction, of the 300 years of corporate history, the rooftop point that Jim made is a good example. There are a lot of redundant processes and a lot of redundancies going inbound into the merger, there's a $3 billion of synergy a year number that we talked to many times. Remember, that's post Remedy, so when we first did the work on this, it was clear that there may be some upside, now that we've got 18 months behind us, the two teams, as I said on my opening remarks, are gun-ready to go. We're at the starting line. We believe we can get the $3 billion and MatCo's portion of that $1.6 million. That's a lot of cost out on what is in essence a very sophisticated asset swap. Under a holding company structure, you are asset swapping in a tax-friendly jurisdiction, and doing this in a way where shareholders will benefit from that cost out. Going forward, the tailwinds of the new MatCo, over $3 billion of new EBITDA coming based on the investments of the last five years, Sadara and the U.S. Gulf Coast assets are tailwinds, not headwinds, so the path of the new MatCo on a cost-out basis through the synergies, as well as these tailwinds based on our investments, not to mention the value-add strategy Jim spoke to and Howard spoke to, including the silicones integration, is what you'll see when we create the world's leading Material Science Company post-spin. Operator : And next we'll move to Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital. Arun Viswanathan : Great, thanks. Just had a question on \u2013 going back to the point of plastics growing over the next couple of years, EBITDA. You had spoken in the past, I think a couple years ago, about all your Gulf Coast investments this time around, adding around $2.5 billion to EBITDA, and that number has changed over the course of a little while, so where is that number now, and what does that kind of embed as far as chain margins in polyethylene? Thanks. Andrew N. Liveris: Yeah, thanks, Arun. I would say that number today, given what's happening in the oil markets, has probably moderated to a $2 billion number. And, again, remember those numbers will be kind of a through the cycle, at the average of the cycle-type of a result. That's the way we look at them. You can get into a peak of a cycle, it may go higher than that, and that's what we've typically experienced on these kind of investments. Operator : And our last question today will come from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Kevin W. McCarthy: Yes, good morning. A few pieces on Consumer Solutions. Would you comment on the sustainability of high single-digit volumes in the back half, as well as the size of the gain related to your Electronic Materials JV and the future flow through of the silicone synergies, in that segment as well as IS? Andrew N. Liveris: Yeah, I'll take the gain and then maybe Jim can talk about the performance. The gain itself was in the $25 million to $50 million range. And I would say \u2013 just one other point on that, just to clarify. Electronics Materials would have had an EBITDA record even without that gain, just to be clear. James R. Fitterling: And Kevin, let me just take the point on the market. So if you look at Consumer Solutions, it's the eighth consecutive quarter of operating EBITDA growth in that sector. Even if you exclude the Dow Corning integration in that sector, so the base business that's in there is performing very well. Automotive is on the 17th consecutive quarter of volume growth. Automotive, even though you've seen in Western Europe and you've seen in North America, things slowdown a little bit, the content per vehicle that we're getting out there, the number of solutions that we're getting on vehicles in the platform is really growing our business above the market and that continues to be the case. In Electronic Materials, it was the eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year EBITDA growth and that business is constantly retooling to fit the market. We're benefiting \u2013 obviously, semiconductors is a big part of the business, so on the CMP pads (1:02:00) side, we're benefiting from that. The whole market is benefits from the Internet of Things, putting more devices on, but also displays and handhelds which we've seen a blockbuster year this year in that area. Operator : And that will conclude today's question-and-answer session. At this time I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Neal Sheorey for any additional or closing remarks. Neal Sheorey : Thanks, Rochelle. Before we close the call, Andrew, would you like to make any final comments? Andrew N. Liveris: Yes, I would, Neal. This is a historic moment. We are on what is the current Dow's last earnings call and as already said by Ed on the DuPont call, this is a moment that we've been planning for over a dozen years, and it's hard to look in the past and reflect, but you've got to allow the moment here to come forward which is two historic companies coming together to form an incredible, incredible machine that will create these three incredible divisions and then ultimately the spins that we referred to. If you think about it from the point of view of this earnings call, this quarter is really the highlight reel of the last many years. So I think everything we've done from the revenue line, to the bottom line, to the productivity, to the innovation engine, to the re-crafting of the portfolio, to the bringing on of new assets, historic new assets from the Saudi assets to the U.S. Gulf Coast; we are starting up Texas 9 as we speak. That is in any other part of Dow's history that alone would be the highlight reel, but we have multiple highlight reels and I'm so proud of the Dow team as we've taken Dow, as Jim said, to a cracker plus five or cracker plus nine model to a integrated specialty company, integrated specialty materials company, a preeminent high-growth high-margin customer-facing company with low cost assets and productivity and still on its DNA. No other company has done that. Silicones is my poster child. It's a chemistry platform that's moved right into Dow. The EBITDA run rate of $750 million, moving to $2 billion. Three times is happening because, as Jim said, it's Midland after all. This is such a fit into the Material Science Company, it bears no recognition to what any other company could have done and certainly on its own could never have done. In addition, I want to sort of finish by saying the future not only is bright with the merger in front of us, but it's bright when the materials company gets created. We have an incredible relationship with the Saudi Aramco Company and Sadara. We're so proud of that relationship. It's going to go to another level. We have work we're doing as we speak on the future of Sadara and as we look at silicones being integral to that future as we announced when we were down in Saudi Arabia in May with the President, there is no question, silicones will be in the future of our Sadara/Saudi relationship. We are very, very, very, confident that we will continue to grow what is an incredible franchise through investments of the Saudis. We're strong going into the merger. We're creating a new Dow, a seminal moment and I am personally very excited and very proud of team Dow and my colleagues on the phone, Jim and Howard well done and we look forward to talking to all of you very, very shortly. Neal Sheorey : Thank you very much, Andrew and thank you, everyone for your questions. As always, we appreciate your interest in The Dow Chemical Company. For your reference, a copy of our prepared comments will be posted on Dow's website later today. This concludes our call for today. We look forward to speaking with you again soon. Thank you. Operator : And that will conclude today's call. We thank you for your participation.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, and welcome to Dow's First Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Also, today's this call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Neal Sheorey, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Neal Sheorey : Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us to discuss the financial results for the Materials Science Division within DowDuPont. We're making this call available via webcast, and we have prepared slides to supplement our comments during this conference call. They are posted on the Investor Relations section of Dow's website and through the link to our webcast. Speaking on the call today are Jim Fitterling, Dow's Chief Executive Officer; and Howard Ungerleider, President and Chief Financial Officer. Please read the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the earnings news release and slides. During our call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding our expectations or predictions about the future. Because these statements are based on current assumptions and factors that involve risks and uncertainties, our actual performance and results may differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Dow's Form 10 as well as our Form 10-K include detailed discussions of the principal risks and uncertainties, which may cause such differences. Unless otherwise specified, all historical financial measures presented today and all financials, where applicable, exclude significant items. We'll also refer to non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures are contained in the DowDuPont earnings release and on the DowDuPont and Dow websites. And as a reminder, because Dow operated as the Materials Science Division of DowDuPont through the end of the first quarter of 2019, the financial results shared during this call are based on the Materials Science Division's financial performance as disclosed earlier today in DowDuPont's earnings release. On Slide 2, you'll see our agenda for the call. We will start with an overview of the first quarter performance of the Materials Science Division of DowDuPont. We will also discuss the results for each of our operating segments. Then we'll move into a financial overview of the quarter, which will also include some comments on modeling guidance. And finally, we will close with a discussion on our go-forward views. There will be plenty of time for your questions. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim. James Fitterling : Thank you, Neal, and thanks, everyone, for joining us. I want to start by acknowledging the incredible accomplishments achieved by the Dow team to get us through our successful separation from DowDuPont on April 1. I want to thank every member of team Dow for all they did over the past 3.5 years to execute one of the largest and most complex spins in the history of corporate America. We are now fully operating as a stand-alone independent Dow with a streamlined and focused business portfolio that is well positioned to operate more productively, invest more prudently, grow more profitably and deliver higher returns to shareholders. With that, let's turn to our performance in the quarter on Slide 3. The Materials Science Division of DowDuPont reported top and bottom line results in line with the updated guidance we provided a few weeks ago. During the quarter, the resilience of the Dow portfolio was on display as we were able to moderate the impact of year-over-year margin compression in siloxanes, isocyanates and polyethylene products, which impacted our core business results and our equity earnings. We mitigated the headwinds in 3 ways : first, our continued demand growth in our differentiated applications was noteworthy, including silicones, polyurethane systems and packaging. This end market growth is an important highlight of the quarter as it reflects the ongoing strength we see from the consumer, and it speaks to our product and technology differentiation, customer relationships and value chain participation. This is not a new phenomenon for us as we have been growing in these applications for some time, and we continue to maintain our positive view of the fundamentals in these value chains. I will come back to this point later in the call. Second, we continued to drive our cost reduction actions. We delivered more than $125 million of incremental cost synergies in the quarter, taking our cumulative savings, since merger close, to nearly $1 billion. And we also removed the first $40 million of stranded costs in the quarter. We remain on track to deliver the incremental $600 million of savings this year. And third, we continued to benefit from our new U.S. Gulf Coast investments, which all ran at high rates in the quarter and contributed approximately 500 million pounds of additional polyethylene volume versus the same quarter last year. Finally, during the quarter, we established the initial shareholder return targets for Dow. We confirmed an industry-leading annual dividend payout of $2.1 billion and announced a $3 billion open share repurchase program. Our commitment to shareholder returns was something we first outlined at our Investor Day in November last year, and it is a top priority of the Board and the Dow management team. Turning to our segment results. On Slide 4, Performance Materials & Coatings operating EBITDA was $481 million, down 18% from the year ago period, primarily driven by lower prices for siloxanes and shipping restrictions from our Performance Monomers facility in Deer Park, Texas due to a tank farm fire at a nearby third-party facility. Consumer Solutions sales were flat with the year ago period as gains in volume and local price were offset by currency headwinds in EMEA and Asia Pacific. The business achieved broad-based local price and volume gains for silicones products. Those gains were offset by price declines in siloxanes. To put things in perspective, siloxanes' prices in China in the first quarter were approximately 30% below the peak pricing of the third quarter of 2018. But as we look ahead, we are encouraged that siloxanes pricing stabilized as we completed the first quarter. Coatings & Performance Monomers sales were also down primarily due to the shedding of lower-margin business as well as weather-related events, which shifted seasonal demand in the construction industry in the U.S., Canada and EMEA. On Slide 5, Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure operating EBITDA was $448 million, down 31% from the year ago period, primarily due to margin compression in isocyanates and MEG, which impacted both our core business results and equity earnings. Polyurethanes & CAV delivered higher volume in all regions, but this was more than offset by lower isocyanates pricing. As I mentioned in my opening, our polyurethane systems growth was the highlight, expanding year-over-year about 2x global GDP. Industrial Solutions reported lower sales on reduced local price and currency headwinds. However, the business grew volume in EMEA, U.S. and Canada in industrial, oil and gas applications as well as on strong demand for deicing fluids, lubricants and fuels. On Slide 6, operating EBITDA for the Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment was $993 million, down 24% from the year ago period. The key driver here was compression in integrated polyethylene margin. However, we were able to offset more than $100 million of this headwind through cost synergy savings, increased supply from growth projects and lower commissioning and startup costs. The Packaging & Specialty Plastics business grew volume on higher demand in Asia Pacific and EMEA, supported by our new capacity add. From an end market perspective, our growth was led by Industrial & Consumer Packaging and Flexible Food & Specialty Packaging, 2 core sectors for our packaging franchise. And finally, the decline in Hydrocarbons & Energy sales was primarily due to 2 factors : the first was our increased ethylene integration from startups of our new derivative asset; and the second was our tilt towards max ethane cracking in the U.S. Gulf Coast, which reduced coproduct sales in the quarter. I'll now turn it over to Howard to discuss our overall financial performance and our modeling guidance. Howard Ungerleider : Thanks, Jim. Turning to Slide 7. Sales declined 10% to $10.8 billion, in line with our guidance. Volume grew 1% with demand growth in many of our core businesses, including polyurethanes, Industrial Solutions, Consumer Solutions and Packaging & Specialty Plastics. These gains more than offset a decline in Coatings & Performance Monomers and a double-digit decline in Hydrocarbons & Energy. And as Jim mentioned, the hydrocarbons decline was primarily due to lower sales of coproducts. Excluding the Hydrocarbons & Energy business, the Materials Science Division grew volume year-over-year by approximately 3%. Local price was down 9%, largely driven by lower prices in isocyanates, siloxanes and polyethylene. Currency decreased sales 2% primarily driven by a stronger U.S. dollar against the euro. Operating EBITDA for the quarter was $1.9 billion, down 24% versus the year ago period and also in line with our guidance. The key driver of the decline was margin compression in polyethylene as well as isocyanates and siloxanes. And these factors, along with lower MEG prices, also drove our equity earnings decline. But importantly, we were able to offset a portion of this with cost synergies, contributions from new capacity adds and growth in the more differentiated portions of our portfolio. Now while Dow is not a stand-alone company in the first quarter, we were able to estimate our cash flow metrics on a new Dow basis. Free cash flow in the quarter was approximately $600 million or $200 million lower than the prior year period, primarily driven by reduced earnings, partly offset by a capacity reservation payment from MEGlobal related to our Texas-9 cracker expansion, which will support MEGlobal's new facility in Freeport, Texas. We also made further progress toward our targeted capital structure just after the quarter ended. We received the $2 billion deleveraging payment from DowDuPont. And as we said we would, we used that cash to pay down a portion of the Dow Corning term loan. That pay down was executed in early April, so you'll see it reflected in our second quarter financial statements. This brings the Dow Corning term loan balance to $2.5 billion. And finally, as Jim mentioned, we also put in place our initial shareholder return targets. In early April, Dow's Board of Directors declared a second quarter dividend of $0.70 per share. And we established a $3 billion open share repurchase program, a portion of which was designated under Rule 10b5-1, which involved a prearranged trading plan. Given our stock performance and spin, we have not yet repurchased any shares under the program. The the 10b5-1 is expected to expire in June. And from that point, we plan to be opportunistic with our share repurchases and will be disciplined with how we allocate our excess cash, taking into consideration all our priorities, including the dividend and deleveraging, to reach our targeted capital structure. As we said before, our target is to return approximately 65% of our operating net income to our owners across the economic cycle. Within that, the dividend is our top priority for returning cash and share repurchases are the flywheel. We're currently targeting share repurchases of approximately $500 million for the remainder of the year. This is our base case target and does not take into account any additional nonoperational cash inflows. Let's now take a closer look at the contributions from our joint ventures on Slide 8. During our Investor Day last year, we made a commitment to provide more transparency on our JV results. And today, we're providing those details. This slide gives you more granularity on the performance of what we call our principal JVs, our 3 most meaningful joint ventures, which account for the vast majority of Dow's equity earnings. Including all JVs, equity losses for the quarter were $10 million compared to equity earnings of $208 million in the year ago period. The reduction was primarily driven by margin compression in MEG at the Kuwait joint ventures and isocyanates at the Sadara joint venture. And as is typical in the first quarter, we also received annual dividends from many of our JVs, which totaled more than $750 million of cash inflow in the quarter. Now before I turn to our modeling guidance, I would like to review some of the reporting changes that we're making now that we've completed our spin. This was another commitment we made, and we are moving quickly to the new reporting. Slide 9 provides an initial look at the details to help you reconcile these changes and how they'll impact our historical results. There are 3 key changes that will impact our financial reporting and the way we discuss our results. First, as of our next quarterly report, we will switch to EBIT as our primary profit metric to reinforce the message that capital is not free. But we will still provide all the details for EBITDA as well for those of you who want to continue to track it. And as we shift to EBIT as our primary metric, we will also include the impact of foreign exchange in our definition of EBIT, which is how Dow historically defined our profit metric before the DowDuPont merger. Second, we will transition to full market-based transfer pricing. This change will have an impact on the profit across our operating segment, but it will be net neutral to total EBIT at the enterprise level. And third, we will also incorporate the impact of the new contracts and service agreements we will have with DuPont and Corteva. We plan to file a voluntary 8-K later this quarter by mid-June, which will provide you with quarterly recaps of our operating segment results incorporating these changes. Until then, you see on Slide 9 the estimates of what to expect for a few historical periods so that you can begin to incorporate these impacts into your models. While there are quite a few changes that we're putting in place, the net impact at historical EBITDA and EBIT is relatively modest. Moving to modeling guidance on Slide 10. Given the current environment and the fact that we've just spun out as an independent company, we have provided our modeling guidance today on a sequential basis versus the first quarter of 2019. For those of you who prefer to look at the year-over-year comparison, you'll find a similar slide with that view in the appendix of today's deck. On a sequential basis, we see overall demand remaining healthy in consumer and packaging end markets, which will continue to benefit businesses like our silicones, polyurethane systems and plastics businesses. We're also now seeing margins stabilize. And in a few areas such as polyethylene [ MDI ] and siloxanes, we're seeing the early signs of price increases starting with Asia Pacific. It's too early to tell how much traction we'll see in the second quarter, but these developing trends are a positive indicator for the second half of the year. We're also entering the typical seasonal high period for our turnaround activity, which will be a headwind sequentially. We expect our turnaround spending in the second quarter to be approximately $200 million higher than the first quarter or about even with our spending in the second quarter of last year. These are planned turnarounds that are scheduled in advance for crackers who are on a roughly 8-year turnaround cycle and for derivative plants that's approximately every 3 to 5 years. We will also be impacted by a fire that occurred at a third-party storage facility near our Deer Park, Texas site, which is limiting our ability to ship material. Our current assessment is that this limitation will continue through the second quarter and will result in approximately a $40 million impact sequentially. I'll now turn it back to Jim. James Fitterling : Thanks, Howard. Let's turn to Slide 11 and the outlook. Global economy is still expanding, albeit at a slower pace than 2018. We're seeing strength in the overall consumer confidence and spending supported by a strong labor market and wage growth. Manufacturing activity also continues to expand in support of this demand. But the trends are not synchronized globally. The U.S. remains a bright spot, while the EU and China are expanding at a more modest rate. And while personal consumption remains healthy, spending on big-ticket items, such as automobiles and home purchases and builds, remains tepid in some geographies. Additionally, ongoing trade negotiations remain front and center around much of the world. We think that a positive trade outcome could be a catalyst for increased economic activity. But that said, our plans as always are focused on what we can control. Looking more specifically at our portfolio, we see early signs of stabilization and improvement in our key fundamental indicators. After several months of inventory destocking in many of our value chain, we saw inventory levels settle in the mid-to-late first quarter on normal demand seasonality. While we still see prices down year-over-year in areas like MDI and siloxanes, they have stabilized sequentially, and we see the opportunity to regain margin with price increases under way. We expect MDI fundamentals to be balanced through 2021. And in siloxanes, we expect overall operating rates to remain high in the near term as demand continues to outpace supply. The global ethylene market is relatively balanced on a regional basis today with some links in the U.S. Gulf Coast. We expect polyethylene demand to outstrip the recent ethylene supply additions starting in the second half of 2019. Our view of the cycle has been consistent for several years, short and shallow, and we see no reason to change that view. In feedstocks, the naphtha-to-ethane spread is widening again after the large contraction in the fourth quarter of 2018. In some areas like Europe, this may be a near term headwind to margins. But over the medium term, it should be constructive to our product spreads. Also, the risk of an ethane price spike in 2019  has vastly reduced due to new NGL infrastructure capacity coming online, coupled with delayed ethylene capacity adds as well as the turnaround season in the second quarter. The result is a significant reduction in the market's forward view of ethane prices for the year. We still expect near-term ethane prices to be somewhat volatile as the industry works through the timing of new ethane demand versus supply. But fundamentally, we expect upward pricing pressure to be moderate and spikes, if any, to be short-lived. We saw a realized example of this in the back half of 2018. And I think what surprised many people outside of our industry was how quickly these energy and feedstock markets changed, which is something that is often underestimated. And additionally, people underestimate how quickly Dow's assets can shift. We have leading feedstock flexibility and commercial capability to adjust quickly to these markets, and we have full chain integration and a differentiated portfolio to further mitigate the impact of the swings. To that point, as I mentioned before, our focus on increasing the consumer-driven bias of our portfolio is paying off, particularly in consumer care, packaging and infrastructure sectors. There are a few examples on Slide 12. In our silicones franchise, we have prioritized the growing use of our siloxanes toward our performance silicones business, where we can convert that siloxane into differentiated silicones that provide our customers with tremendous value and use. And our efforts are delivering. Every quarter since we brought this franchise into our portfolio, we have driven silicones growth that has outpaced global GDP. And consequently, our teams are unlocking incremental capacity to continue to meet growing customer demand. So far this year, we have already completed 4 debottleneck projects, and we have more than a dozen still on deck with incremental expansions in every geography. Another example is in our polyurethanes business. The business has been able to partly dampen the impact of isocyanates margin compressions with continued above GDP growth in systems applications in furniture, bedding, white goods and other durable goods. As a result, our polyurethanes business has now achieved year-over-year demand growth for 23 consecutive quarters. And finally, in Packaging & Specialty Plastics, we've been growing volume for several quarters on our strength in Industrial & Consumer Packaging and Flexible Food & Specialty Packaging. These are parts of the value chain where we are the proven market leader. And for our global asset base, our new capacity and expertise in local markets have enabled us to place new pounds efficiently in the market and deliver them with the highest value application. The common thread across these examples is their connection to the consumer and everyday life. And for us, this is another indicator that consumer spending remains healthy. And that benefits the Dow portfolio. I'll close with a quick recap on our near-term priorities on Slide 13. These are the same priorities that we've shared with you over the past several months, and I'm proud of the progress that we're making against each. But there is still work to do. While we see the early signs of improvement in our value chain, it is still early days. That's why our focus remains on being very disciplined with where we allocate our capital and our resources. Nothing has changed in our mindset of preferentially driving lower risk, faster payback projects while keeping our CapEx well within D&A levels. We've made substantial progress against our cost synergy capture and stranded cost removal targets, but we still have work to do. Our focus on a lean cost structure is still very much in place, and we will deliver the $600 million of incremental savings this year. And as you've seen over the past few months and today, we're committed to a best owner mindset and an enhanced level of disclosure. To wrap up, first, I could not be prouder of our team for working through all the complexities of our successful separation from DowDupont. Team Dow embraces challenge and took it head on. Second, the resilience of our portfolio showed through in the quarter, notably in our consumer-driven businesses where we can take advantage of our innovation and differentiation. And third, we believe that the fundamentals in our key value chains are beginning to stabilize. And as we look through the second quarter, we see early signs of inflection points that could materialize in the middle of the year. Going forward, our capital allocation and disciplined focus on higher return on invested capital, incremental investments, while keeping CapEx at or below D&A levels, is the right approach in this environment. And the Dow team remains focused on the actions within our control, capturing cost synergy savings and removing stranded costs, growing our differentiated positions, running our assets efficiently and continuing to be disciplined resource and capital allocators to drive value growth within each of our businesses and across the company. Now I'll turn it to Neal to open the Q&A. Neal Sheorey : Thank you, Jim. With that, let's move on to your questions. I would like to remind you that our forward-looking statements apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. Operator, please provide the Q&A instructions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question today will come from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. David Begleiter : Jim, looks like in PE, you did get the $0.03 increase in April. Given that increase, what's the potential for maybe an increase in May as well?  And how should we think about earnings in the segment sequentially even with the headwinds from the turnarounds and going -- in this quarter? James Fitterling : Yes. So this week, IHS published up 3 for the month of April in the U.S. And we had expected that really in March. And that's why we had guided again in the middle of the quarter because that looked like it was sliding out. There are increases out there -- other increases out there for the second quarter, and we feel like we're building momentum into that. The core earnings are going to improve sequentially. That's what we've got in the forecast. And then we just called out the turnaround expenses because, sequentially, they're higher. Our turnaround expenses are about the same as they were second quarter last year, but they are higher than first quarter, and that's just because of timing. As you know, some of these turnarounds, crackers are on 8-year cycles, and some of these derivative plants are on 3- to 5-year cycles. This is the time of year to take them. And I think in this market environment, we decided to do them in second quarter and not try to push anything out. Operator : And next to move on to P.J. Juvekar with Citi. P.J. Juvekar: Jim, long-term big picture question. When you look at Aramco's crude-to-chemicals strategy, you look at Exxon and Phillips wanting to build more crackers, it seems like there is more interest  [indiscernible]  companies in cracker assets. What do you think?  Will they buy?  Will they build assets?  How do you strategically think about what oil companies are trying to do?  And where does Dow fit in? James Fitterling : Thanks, P.J. It's difficult for me to telegraph someone else's strategy. I would say I think what's happening, there've been many reports out there about the value creation in petrochemicals. It's been one of the sectors over the last decade, 14, 15 years that's created some high value. So I think people are interested in that. There are different driving forces for everybody. Our driving force for our strategy is to grow with those consumer-driven differentiated markets. And so we'll be focused on developing products like performance silicones, better packaging products, polyurethane systems. Our Industrial Solutions will go downstream, working on coatings. Both our architectural and industrial coatings portfolios, our adhesives portfolios to continue to grow that business. And then, of course, we'll look at the back integration. Is that a better make versus buy decision? Where is the best place for us to be? Is it U.S. Gulf Coast where you've got this tremendous NGL advantage and ethane advantage and where we can tie into the flexibility that we have and benefit from that. And that's a different driving force obviously than someone who's looking at maybe a future market that speak oil and looking at what are they going to do with different barrels of oil. There are different chemistries out there. There's a lot of things going on. There's different strategies, partnerships around the world. So you might take the oil and do partnerships. You might make acquisitions. But in most cases today, the industry has shifted to cracking lighter. And so if you're going to make acquisitions to think that you're going to convert oil to petrochemicals, in most cases, you would be making acquisitions that are today probably NGL cracking. So I think there are a lot of things that have to play out. I feel good about our investments and our position. We took advantage of the first wave of shale. We were up first. We got our projects done on time. We got them done under budget, and they're going to be the most efficient capital projects in that cycle. Operator : And next, I move on to Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Vincent Andrews : Yes. I've gotten a lot of questions this morning about 2Q and sort of what's in the slides. And maybe you could just help us with a little bit more detail on the 3 segments, more explicitly on sort of forget about all the turnarounds and so forth but just on an underlying basis, slight modest know, how much improvement should we see for the 3 segments sequentially? James Fitterling : So if I go to the slide that was in the deck, Slide #29 in the deck, you've got the sales drivers and the EBIT drivers for the second quarter. And really, the only thing that we called out is the specific headwinds from the turnaround costs. The core earnings I expect to be up. So Performance Material & Coatings, I think, we're going to see sales moving up. Siloxanes pricings have stabilized and started to move up, so that's going to help. Silicones pricing has held up well, and the issue there is just getting more capacity online to support that. So we had 4 debottlenecks in the quarter that came online, and we've got 12 new incremental projects for downstream silicones coming online through the year. In industrial intermediates, the big drag on industrial intermediates was really equity earnings, and it was ethylene glycol from the Kuwait joint ventures. The core business is growing there. Now we've announced some alkoxylates capacity. That won't come on in second quarter. That's a longer-term bet, but they're going to be up 3% to 5% in sales. And Packaging & Specialty Plastics is going to be up 3% to 5% in sales, and it's going to benefit from, obviously, the pricing that we're seeing coming through in April. And good to start the quarter with that and build that momentum. And then also the better cost positions we've seen on ethane. Two fracs came up in the quarter, and so they'll come up ahead of the ethylene capacity. And that's really what's put that ethane future's curve down. So I believe you're going to see the core earnings move up sequentially, Vincent. And we just called out the turnarounds to make sure everybody understood what the magnitude of that cost would be in the second quarter. Operator : Jeff Zekauskas with JP Morgan will have our next question. Jeffrey Zekauskas : I have a two-part question. Looking at Slide 12, it looks like perhaps your polyethylene sales volumes were up about 6% in first quarter year-on-year, which I think is about the level of your capacity expansion. And so is the meaning of that, that the global polyethylene industry or global polyethylene demand really didn't grow in the first quarter, but you were able to grow 5% or 6%? And then the second part is I think Howard said that no shares were bought back in the 10b5 program. So does that mean that the trip price at which you would buy back shares wasn't hit as Dow traded as an independent company? James Fitterling : I'll take the first part, and then I'll hand it over to Howard on the 10b5. Polyethylene sales were up. The demand there was good. And obviously, we had the additional 500 million pounds from the Gulf Coast assets. And those ran hard, so we moved that through the quarter. And also, we saw inventory levels through the quarter kind of come back to the normal level, so we're able to get some material moved out. Some things had backed up at the end of fourth quarter '18, as you know, in the U.S. Gulf. And so we saw some of that stabilize through the quarter. I think that's another big factor in why you see the pricing moving up. You've got inventories coming back to kind of the normal level in the Gulf Coast. On the 10b5, Howard can speak to that. Howard Ungerleider : Yes. So you're right, we put -- so the short answer to your question is correct. It did not trigger, but we put -- just to give you a little bit more context, we put the 10b51 in place before the quiet period expired in the first quarter or so, before mid-March. That is going to be in place until early to mid-June. Basically, we need to get the 8-K with all the accounting changes that I articulated in the deck, so I gave you the estimates in the slide deck. Once we're in the process of doing all the final accounting, we're going to get that done as soon as we practically can. As soon as that 8-K gets published, then we can be in the market because -- with an open program as opposed to the 10b5. The 10b5 was set up based on the feedback that Dow's stock could trade with substantial churn in volatility immediately postspin. So we put the algorithm in place to take advantage of the opportunistic intrinsic value, and the Dow stock traded very well. And so as a result so far, that hasn't kicked in. But like I said, the 10b51 is there until we get the 8-K out. Once we get the 8-K out, we'll be in the open market. And what I put in the prepared remarks this morning is our base case is approximately $500 million of stock buyback for the year. Operator : Our next question, we'll hear from Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Christopher Parkinson : Can you just comment further on your expectations for MDI and maybe TDI, understanding it's only at Sadara. Just following 2 of your primary competitors comments over the last couple days. Just -- there's been some inconsistent end market commentary. So if you could hit on your own regional demand outlooks and expectations for a new supply cadence, it would be greatly appreciated. James Fitterling : Thanks for the question. I expect MDI is going to continue to tighten through the year. I think you've got 2 things happening. The consumer-driven side of the business, so our systems business, where you had end markets like furniture, bedding, some level of white goods, durable goods, that business, some cold storage, cold chain businesses, has been relatively good. Where we see obviously some things have been a little bit slower are housing starts and housing sales. So that's kind of slowed. And so you've got also automotive, and automotive is a lot of content for polyurethanes. So some of the big-ticket items are also big-demand pull items in that chain. So I'd say the consumer strength is really showing up in the numbers, 2x GDP for the systems growth, and that's without the big-ticket items pulling. So as we get through the year, I think you're going to start to see automotive pick up. I would say in Europe right now, automotive is weak, and there's probably the biggest inventory of finished autos out on the lots and at the dealers that has to be worked through. So I'd say Europe sentiment right now is it's going to take a little bit longer to work that through. The U.S. is relatively okay. North -- I'd say North America is relatively okay.  And China's relatively okay.  So I think as the year progresses, we're going to see those bigger-ticket items pull through a little bit more. On TDI, as we said before, I think TDI is going to be long for most of the year. So we're not putting into our outlook any big increases in TDI prices or margins. Mostly the improvement will be on MDI. Operator : And next, I move to John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets. John McNulty : On Sadara, can you speak to some of the opportunities there to improve some of the profitability?  I know there was, I guess, some hope about potentially rejiggering the debt, expanding feedstock slates, et cetera. So can you help us to understand what leverage you can pull there to improve the profitability there? James Fitterling : Sure. We're making obviously some sequential improvement in the first quarter from the fourth quarter in Sadara. It's about $20 million better than it was in the fourth quarter. We're doing everything we can obviously to keep that moving. The pricing moves are obviously going to help Sadara. That will fall right to the bottom line. Sadara's been working actively on its own cost programs internally, and so they've been becoming more efficient in getting those costs down. And then obviously, we have been working with Aramco diligently on things that we can do to help that out, including looking at the debt restructuring. So now that we've done the lender's reliability test and we've actually kicked off a team between Sadara and the 2 parents actively looking at how we can restructure that debt. And we'll have more to say about that a little bit later in the year. That team is off and running and, I think, making some good progress there. Howard Ungerleider : And I would just add, John -- this is Howard. Every product manager who has accountability for an asset there is working on the sell upside of that, so that's optimizing the product mix, cutting the fourth quartile and adding to first or second quartile margins and look at the profitability on a margin velocity per hour of production, and that's how they're held accountable. Operator : And we'll move on to Jonas Oxgaard with Bernstein. Jonas Oxgaard : If I could continue the line of question of Sadara, it looks like MDI and TDI, to get to that, was it $27 million EBITDA for the quarter, MDI and TDI must have run at negative margins. Is there any consideration of shutting down those assets? James Fitterling : I don't believe that's a fair assumption. I'll have to ask Neal and the team to get back to you and walk through those numbers. But we would not have run them at negative margins. The teams are very disciplined about taking a look at that. So there may be some mix assumptions or other things that are in there. We've got a lot of activity going on within Sadara to try to get that mix shifted. We've got supply chain costs that we're working on, so we're optimizing around the supply chain to make things a little bit more efficient. The plant has been running well, so the asset has been good. We don't have any issues there. We've looked at obviously all the things we can do on the feedstock side to improve it, as you know. Sadara's feedstock position, that's really the naphtha crack is what goes downstream for all that integration into isocyanates. And so we've been looking at what we can do there to get some better cost position in there. But I think relative to where they are today, we're going to start to see things stepwise improve just on the basis of the market demand. And if we got a trade agreement through with China, I think that would be helpful. At least, it would be helpful in the near term on the market psyche, but it would be helpful into the second half of the year. Operator : And next, we move to [ Hassan Hammed ] with Olympic Global. Unknown Analyst : Wanted to sort of continue on the JV side. The Kuwaiti JVs, Kuwait in particular, continue to be quite weak earnings-wise. I would imagine, obviously, ethylene glycol was the culprit. Is there any sort of bottoming out of glycol insight. The polyester market continues to be quite weak as well. So how should we think about the equate earnings over the next couple of quarters? James Fitterling : Thanks for the question. Yes, the drag really on Kuwait JVs was ethylene glycol pricing. And if you look at the year-over-year pricing, it's quite a bit down. Now what we've seen through the quarter is obviously the inventory levels have started to improve in China. The demand pull, as you mentioned, hasn't yet kicked in. This is one of the areas in the China trade agreement. If you know, textiles had some tariffs coming back into the United States. That really put the brakes on some of the exports out of China, and that kind of backed up some of that capacity. So as we get this trade agreement through and we see what happens, if that gives a little bit more confidence to the textiles industry in China to be able to move some material in here, then that would be immediately visible in the marketplace. So that might give us some momentum on ethylene glycol pricing. The PET side of the equation has continued to be strong. So we really need the polyester side to pick up to see that pricing move. And I would also say that typically, when we pull out of one of these compression periods, PE and ethylene glycol is what you start to see turn. We've seen PE turn here in the month of April. So I think we could probably see also some cost push on the ethylene side in China that may start to move things up a little bit. Operator : And our next session, we'll hear from Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research. Frank Mitsch : Jim, you were discussing your consistent view on the cycle as being short and shallow. And I would imagine that given your outlook, you're expecting that 2020 would probably show some EBITDA growth in the polyethylene business. What is your outlook call in terms of the back half of the year?  Is there -- are you guys forecasting that you might be seeing year-over-year improvement in the back half of the year on polyethylene?  Or is that really more of a 2020 sort of event? James Fitterling : We're running right now at about 4.5% growth rate is what our outlook for the year is. And obviously, we started relatively slow in January and February. So I think that's going to pick up pace. Second quarter is shaping up well. I think third quarter is usually very strong, and we'll see how we finish the year. And obviously, I think we'll finish it a little bit better. The other thing that's happening is when you look at the supply that's coming on. Obviously, we think that demand is going to outstrip the amount of incremental supply that's coming on. And so you're going to see that in the back half of the year. A lot of capacity came on in the last 2 quarters of last year -- a lot of polyethylene capacity came on in the last 2 quarters of last year and was finding its way into the market in Q4, especially in December, when China went dark on us for the last 2 weeks. That backed up inventories. People were scrambling to move that around to the markets. You saw some of that actually hit Europe in a big way, and that really compressed some margins there. I don't think we've got that same kind of magnitude in the back half of this year. Operator : And we'll hear from Steve Byrne with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Steve Byrne : Jim, you mentioned higher naphtha pricing and just wanted to hear your view on cash margins for the top end of the polyethylene cost curve, particularly the Asian naphtha producers, and your outlook for naphtha pricing in that region and whether the margins in that area could affect those producers' behavior, whether it's on pricing or operating rates. James Fitterling : Yes. So I think a couple of things. I think the naphtha ethane and the propane naphtha spreads are both starting to open up, which will be beneficial. We've seen some move up, a little bit of a move up, in Asia on ethylene due to that. I think we could continue to see some more of that. I won't  try to predict what oil prices are going to do, but we kind of gone into this year thinking they would be in the $65 to $75 barrel range. I don't see any reason to think any differently. I do think we've tested lows on natural gas. So we've been at $2.50 on natural gas. And with all the oil that we've been producing and the associated NGLs, that's helped bring those forward curves down. So anything that we see in terms of these naphtha, ethane and [ pro-nap ] spreads is going to be helpful to us as we move through the year. Operator : And next, we'll to move to John Roberts with UBS. John Roberts : I wanted to go back to the JVs. You did a good job several years ago cleaning up the JVs. And what's the role of the Kuwait and Thai JVs in the portfolio?  Obviously, there's some strategic projects -- products in there like polyethylene to dab, but there's also some products that don't seem to fit longer term with your strategy. James Fitterling : Well, the Kuwait -- let me start with the Kuwait JVs and obviously, that was a very strategic one from a standpoint of ethylene glycol. It was a way to put together at the time when we did it, obviously, the world's largest ethylene glycol business together with the Kuwaiti. So MEGlobal is continuing to grow in that format and that structure, and that's been positive for us. And they've been also able to participate and continue that growth down in the U.S. Gulf Coast. So I think that's good. They clearly were already marketing ethylene glycol and carbide set that JV up obviously on its own to market the polyethylene so we don't do anything together there other than be an equity investor in polyethylene. Thailand was always an Asia growth play and continues to be that. And where we have strategic interests together, we'll look at that. And where we've got lines of business there that may be strategic to one of us and not the other, we'll look at options there. But both of those JVs are sustainable. They generate really positive cash flow and dividends. They've got good balance sheets. They're healthy. My first priority is getting Sadara to be sustainable, good balance sheet, generating the kinds of returns that we promised. So I'm not expecting big moves there. We did talk about obviously maybe doing some consolidation among the entities in Kuwait, and we'll still look at that. And if we can pull that off, that may be beneficial to us in '19. Operator : And we'll move on to Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Laurence Alexander : Just two quick ones. Just to clarify the comment about performance materials, the core earnings being up sequentially. Is that including the sequential headwinds you called out were only before the sequential headwinds?  Can you characterize inventory levels, and not in the polyethylene chain but in the derivative businesses?  Just what you're seeing and whether there's any inventory destocking that might be needed later this year? James Fitterling : Howard, do you want to take the sequential earnings question? Howard Ungerleider : Yes. Laurence, so if you look at the slide, I would say it's before. So it's the core earnings will be up, but will be offset by some of those sequential headwinds that we talked about on the call. James Fitterling : And we've seen -- I think I'd commented earlier on PE.  And what we've seen is inventories in the isocyanates, especially in the MDI side, start to come down. And the demand pull on silicones on siloxanes is obviously helping that. So we think that silicones demand growth is going to continue to tighten up that siloxanes spare capacity that's out there, and that'll happen through the rest of the year. Operator : And next, we'll move to Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs. Robert Koort : I was wondering, Jim, you guys obviously have one of the bigger exposures in Asia Pacific. Can you give us some sense on what's going on in China, both from the maybe the echoes of some of the plant problems over there and the environmental enforcement?  And then maybe what you see on the appetite for future ethylene expansion. It seems maybe one of the consultants is a little more pessimistic on operating rates with some China expansions over the next 3 or 4 years. So hoping you could address both of those. James Fitterling : Yes. Thanks, Bob. Thanks for the question. I would say we had a good quarter in China. In total, our sales volumes were up double digits year-over-year, so we continue to grow there, and it's across the board. It's in all the businesses : polyurethanes, packaging, Consumer Solutions, obviously. We don't have as much coatings exposure in China. We don't have too many facilities for coatings over there, and we don't have as much Industrial Solutions exposure. Most of that is exports out of Gulf Coast and out of Sadara. But I still feel good about the demand growth, and it continues to look good. I think the operating rates are probably been held down because of the cost curve and because of where some things are on the cost curves. There's just a big advantage in the U.S. Gulf Coast on the NGLs, and that's probably what's held them down. I think most of the environmental things are related to the incidents that have happened. And so you've had a couple of explosions and fires that typically always cause another relook at the industry and who's a credible operator and can operate safely and also who can operate at scale and return. I think the biggest challenge has been the pricing compression that we saw in the fourth quarter. And so as we see those margins recover, you may start to see people take a look in China again at whether they can have a good investment there and, long term, make some money there. But it's the feedstock challenge. That's the toughest part of that. It's hard to find a good competitive feedstock there, and I think that's why you see most of the oil majors looking. And it's mostly refinery integration discussion that you see happening. You see some ethane discussion, but that requires a lot of CapEx to build ships to take ethane out of the U.S. Gulf Coast. There's really not anywhere else in the world that you can get ethane export. And if you start to drive that price up too high, then you're going to be looking back at naphtha as an alternative. Operator : And next, we'll move to Aleksey Yefremov with Nomura Instinet. Aleksey Yefremov : I just wanted to return to Sadara quickly. If we look at last year's Q1 result of $96 million of EBITDA, that's arguably close to peak environment. If you were to return to the same, sort of cash margins in your key value chains for Sadara, would that number be higher today because there's more capacity or more efficient operations?  Or that's sort of the upper end of what you could achieve? James Fitterling : Yes. I'm going to look to Howard here for a minute, but I don't think the Q1 or Q2 last year was peak environment. I think peak probably actually happened before that. So Sadara wasn't fully operational and running when we were at the peak of the cycle. Howard, do you have some comments on what you think that could be? Howard Ungerleider : Yes, Aleksey. I would just say it would be far above that number if you had the same conditions because remember, to Jim's point, it was a startup year. You had -- we were going through the punch list to get ready for the LRT for the entire year, taking assets up, taking assets down. And there was no sell up. It was all sellout kind of mindset at the time. So as you move forward, everything else being equal, Sadara will improve just based on the sell upside of the equation would be what I would say. Operator : And next, we'll move on to Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Duffy Fischer : First, just want to say thanks. I think the way you laid out the financials and disclosures around the JVs is very helpful and enlightening, so I appreciate that.  Second, just on the question, Jim, U.S. ethylene versus ethylene derivatives, ethylene's obviously gotten long. As you look out the remainder of the build-out of the first wave here in the U.S., when do you think the derivative capacity gets to the point where you've got enough takeaway capacity for all the ethylene and then more the margin moves back to ethylene and away from the derivatives? James Fitterling : Duffy, thanks for the comment on the disclosure. Look, we're trying to be more transparent and to respond to everybody's interests and get it out there. So I think you'll find we've got nothing to hide here. And you know the priorities for us are to continue to work on returns out of those so that people can see the value out of those JVs. On the ethylene side, you're right. Because there hasn't been as much derivative capacity, that ethylene's been backed up. And what you see in the first quarter is people adjusting ethylene plant operating rates really to the derivative downstream operating rates. And derivatives are continuing to run hard in the U.S. Gulf Coast. So that's why we announced things like alkoxylates yield capacity expansions down in the Gulf Coast to convert more of that material. That's a high return to ethylene. I think by 2020, you're going to see that derivative demand's going to start to pull that excess ethylene that's out there. You also got a little bit of restrictions right now. There are not too many places that you can ship ethylene out, and one of them just had a large fire. And so that's caused us a little bit of more constraints. And so you've seen a lot of that margin in the short term disappear out of the ethylene part of the chain. But PE is holding up good, so I think if you think where we are in the cycle here and why we still say short and shallow is because PE margins are relatively strong. And we're seeing pricing coming back in April in polyethylene, so I think that's a good trend. Operator : And we'll move on to Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Kevin McCarthy : I have two-part financial question. First, I was wondering what your cash cost were in the quarter for restructuring. And then I think you had a plan previously to inject about $0.5 billion into Sadara, I wondering if there was anything in the quarter related to that. And then the second piece was I was wondering if you have a preliminary net debt figure to provide and whether that would be representative going forward. Howard Ungerleider : I'll try to remember all 3 questions. But Jim or Neal, keep me honest here. So the restructuring on that same basis, so Dow tower last year spent $1.4 billion on an apples-to-apples. We spent about $500 million in the first quarter. We are -- that is the peak quarter obviously because that was the spend quarter. That number should trend down over the course of the year, and we're in line with that commitment to take $200 million to $400 million off of that $1.4 billion. So kind of a $1.1 billion midpoint is a good number for the year. The official -- when we ended the quarter, we were at $20 billion gross debt. We had $3 billion of cash, so net debt, $17 billion. On April 1, we got that payment of $2 billion from the DowDupont tower, and we did delever. So our net debt on April 2, you won't see that until the Q2 earnings materials. And the net debt was $15 billion. Was there a third question? James Fitterling : That's it. Howard Ungerleider : Okay. James Fitterling : You got it. Howard Ungerleider : Thanks, Kevin. Operator : And that will conclude today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to Neal Sheorey for any additional or closing remarks. Neal Sheorey : Thank you, operator, and thank you, everyone, for joining our call. We appreciate your interest in Dow. For your reference, a copy of our transcript will be posted on Dow's website later today. This concludes our call. Thank you. Operator : And that will conclude today's call. We thank you for your participation.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, and welcome to the Dow Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Also today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Neal Sheorey. Please go ahead, sir. Neal Sheorey : Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us to discuss the second quarter financial results for Dow. We're making this call available via webcast, and we have prepared slides to supplement our comments during this conference call. They are posted on the Investor Relations section of Dow's website and through the link to our webcast. Speaking on the call today are Jim Fitterling, Dow's Chief Executive Officer; and Howard Ungerleider, President and Chief Financial Officer. Please read the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the earnings news release and slides. During our call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding our expectations or predictions about the future. Because these statements are based on current assumptions and factors that involve risks and uncertainties, our actual performance and results may differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Dow's Form 10 as well as our Forms 10-Q and 10-K include detailed discussions of principal risks and uncertainties which may cause such differences.  Unless otherwise specified, all historical financial measures presented today are on a pro forma basis. And all financials, where applicable, exclude significant items. We'll also refer to non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures are contained in the Dow earnings release, in the slides that supplement our comments today and on the Dow website.  On Slide 2, you'll see our agenda for the call. Jim will start with an overview of Dow's second quarter performance and highlights. Howard will then move into a financial overview of the quarter and will also provide some comments on modeling guidance. Jim will then cover the results for each of our operating segments, and we'll close with a discussion on our forward-looking view. Following that, there would be plenty of time for your questions. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim. James Fitterling : Thanks, Neal, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. Starting on Slide 3. Our performance in the second quarter reflected the benefits of Dow's streamlined and more focused portfolio and our disciplined operational and financial management. It was a quarter that proved to be more challenging than many of us in the industry expected, and you've heard this from many of our peers in the past few weeks. In spite of this, the Dow team was able to deliver top and bottom line results that were in line with our guidance and consensus estimates. And despite the macro and end market volatility, we achieved core earnings growth sequentially when adjusting for our previously communicated higher planned turnaround spending in the quarter. Our second quarter results were enabled by proactive and deliberate action. First, we captured demand growth in select consumer markets where the conditions have remained strong. For example, we grew volume in plastic packaging applications both sequentially and year-over-year, supported by our new capacity on the U.S. Gulf Coast. And in our polyurethane systems business, we grew our volume year-over-year for the 24th consecutive quarter. Second, we made full use of our industry-leading feedstock flexibility. Favorable NGL feedstock trends helped us expand operating EBITDA margin in the P&SP segment as we utilized our ethane flexibility in the U.S. and our LPG capabilities in Europe. Third, we continued to drive expense management. In addition to reduced discretionary spending, we delivered more than $175 million savings from cost synergies and stranded cost removal. You can see this traction in our numbers. In the second quarter alone, we drove $75 million of year-over-year savings in our combined SG&A and R&D. We've now delivered more than $1.1 billion of cumulative cost synergy savings since merger close and remain well on track to deliver the $600 million of synergy and stranded cost savings that we targeted this year.  Fourth, we quickly put in place actions to further tighten our capital spending in the quarter. Not only was the second quarter CapEx spending below last year, but our first half spending was below trend relative to our full year target. We are taking additional actions to reduce Capex, which I'll cover later in the call.  And fifth, we continued our focus on cash as we generated higher cash flow from operating activities and improved our cash conversion in the quarter. Part of our improvement was driven by a decrease in integration and separation cost outlays, which will continue to be a tailwind going forward. We remain on track to reduce this cash spending by $200 million to $400 million versus 2018.  Taken together, this is a solid result by the Dow team, and it underscores our ability to adapt as market conditions evolve. Going forward, we will continue to take prudent actions to manage near-term macroeconomic challenges while preserving our long-term competitive advantages. I'll share more about our plans in my closing remarks. I'll now turn it over to Howard to discuss our overall financial performance and modeling guidance. Howard Ungerleider : Thanks, Jim. Turning to Slide 4. Net sales were $11 billion, in line with our guidance. The decline was driven primarily by lower local pricing in polyethylene, siloxanes and isocyanates as well as lower sales of hydrocarbon co-products due to lighter feedslates in both the U.S. and Europe. Volume declined 3% year-over-year driven primarily by lower hydrocarbon co-product sales due to higher internal ethylene consumption from the startup of new downstream assets and our cracker feedstock selection. A notable volume highlight is our growth in the Packaging & Specialty Plastics business, which was up 3% year-over-year. Local price was down 9%, and currency decreased sales 2% primarily driven by a stronger U.S. dollar against the euro. Equity losses were $15 million primarily driven by margin compression in MEG and polyethylene at the Kuwait joint ventures as well as margin compression in isocyanates at Sadara. Operating EBIT for the quarter was $1.1 billion, and EPS was $0.86, in line with consensus estimates. The key earnings tailwinds in the quarter were volume gains in packaging applications, PU systems and isocyanates, contributions from new capacity in the U.S. Gulf Coast and savings from cost synergies and stranded cost removal. These gains were more than offset by margin compression in our key value chains which impacted both our core business results and our JV equity earnings.  Turning to our cash metrics. We generated nearly $1 billion of cash flow from operating activities in the quarter, an increase of $200 million year-over-year. And we also continued to improve our EBITDA to cash flow from operations conversion, which rose to more than 50%. And finally, we returned $800 million to our owners in the quarter including $500 million of paid dividends and $300 million of share repurchases. As you may recall, we set a target of $500 million of share repurchases for the year, and we remain on pace to achieve that.  Now let's look at our principal joint ventures on Slide 5. Equity losses for the quarter were $15 million primarily driven by margin compression in MEG and polyethylene at the Kuwait joint ventures, reduced cracker and polyethylene margins at our Thai JVs and margin compression in isocyanates at the Sadara joint venture. With regard to Sadara, as we have discussed before, one of the key items we are working on is receiving certification for passing the lender reliability test, the key milestone required for the JV parent to be released from the guarantees of Sadara's debt financing. The process to receive the certification typically takes 6 to 9 months, and we're progressing on that timeline. We have made good progress thus far and have essentially isolated the last gating item to a logistics services agreement. We are in active discussions with our partner, the JV and the lending syndicate to resolve this issue. Based on the progress to date, we are on track to formally receive certification in the second half of this year.  Moving to Slide 6 and our modeling guidance for the third quarter. As usual, we are providing specific guidance for our top line revenue expectations as well as several items below the EBIT line. With regard to our segment expectations, we are providing our guidance on a sequential basis in response to investor feedback and to reflect the most relevant comparison in today's environment.  At the total Dow level, we expect EBIT tailwinds sequentially including more than $40 million from cost synergy savings and stranded cost removal as well as more than $50 million of lower planned maintenance spending as these costs peaked in the second quarter. However, these gains are temporarily offset by a couple of third-party outages that are impacting our operations in the third quarter.  In Performance Materials & Coatings, we see siloxanes pricing in the third quarter remaining about at the same level as we exited the second quarter, which means that third quarter average pricing will be down sequentially. On the positive side, our formulated silicones demand and margins continue to hold up very well, showcasing the resiliency in our differentiated businesses that are closer to the consumer.  Moving to the Industrial Intermediates and Infrastructure segment. From a pricing perspective, current forecasts estimate MDI prices to trend relatively flat with the second quarter levels. And MEG prices, on average, are projected to soften on a sequential basis. As such, we expect equity earnings results to be lower than the second quarter due to these factors. Additionally, Sadara's operations are being negatively impacted by the reliability of a third-party industrial gas supplier which is limiting production in JV's polyurethane chain. The supplier is actively addressing the issues, and the JV currently expects to ramp to normal operations by the middle of the quarter. Sadara currently estimates this limitation to have a $20 million impact to Dow's equity earnings in the quarter.  And finally, in the Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment, we expect robust packaging demand to continue. We see feedstock price trends continuing to drive lighter cracker feedslates in the U.S. and Europe which will further reduce our top line sales of co-products. From an industry supply-demand perspective, new ethylene capacity that is expected to come online in the U.S. will likely put some upward pressure on the ethane prices. The segment will be impacted by a planned cracker maintenance turnaround in the Netherlands as well as an issue that we're dealing with in Argentina.  Late in the second quarter, there was a significant countrywide power outage in Argentina which also spread to neighboring countries. The power outage abruptly shut down our ethylene operations. We have teams on the ground assessing the damage and beginning repairs. And our best estimate today is that the facility will be offline for at least the entire third quarter and is expected to have approximately $100 million impact on our results. I'll now turn it back to Jim to cover the performance in our segments as well as our near-term outlook. James Fitterling : Thanks, Howard. On Slide 7, Performance Materials & Coatings operating EBIT was $214 million, down 27% from the year ago period primarily driven by siloxane's margin compression, higher planned turnaround spending and Performance Monomers shipping restrictions from our Deer Park, Texas location due to a tank farm fire at a third-party facility, which we highlighted in our modeling guidance on the last earnings call.  Consumer Solutions sales declined as price and volume gains in the U.S. and Canada were more than offset by price declines in Asia Pacific and EMEAI and volume declines in EMEAI and Latin America. The decline year-over-year primarily reflects lower demand in automotive and consumer electronics end markets. Coatings & Performance Monomers sales declined primarily due to lower volumes and local price. In addition to the Performance Monomers' shipping restrictions in Deer Park, the business was also impacted by wet weather that drove a delay in seasonal demand for coatings application in the United States and Europe.  On Slide 8, Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure operating EBIT was $154 million, down from the year ago period due to local price and volume declines and margin compressions in isocyanates and MEG that impacted both our core business and joint venture results. Polyurethanes & Construction Chemicals sales declined on lower isocyanates pricing and currency headwinds in Europe. Volume gains in isocyanates and systems applications were offset by declines in polyols, propylene oxide and propylene glycol. Industrial Solutions reported lower sales due to declines in local volume and price. Demand and growth in Asia Pacific and Latin America was more than offset by volume declines in the U.S. and Canada and EMEAI driven by softer demand in agriculture, automotive and electronics end markets as well as reduced supply due to planned maintenance turnaround. Equity losses for the segment were $78 million driven by margin compression at the Kuwait and Sadara joint ventures.  On Slide 9. Operating EBITDA for the Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment was $768 million, down 17% from the year ago period. Margin compression in polyethylene products and reduced equity earnings more than offset demand growth for packaging applications, benefits from new capacity on the U.S. Gulf Coast and cost synergy savings. Equity earnings for the segment were $74 million, down from the year-ago period based on lower earnings from the Kuwait joint ventures. The Packaging & Specialty Plastics business reported lower net sales due to reduced polyethylene product prices and currency headwinds. However, the business achieved 3% volume growth led by a double-digit gain in Asia Pacific and increases in EMEAI. From an end market perspective, growth was led by industrial and consumer packaging and health and hygiene applications. And in Hydrocarbons & Energy, sales declined on both lower volume and local price. The volume decline was primarily driven by increased internal ethylene consumption and our feedstock selection as well as a planned turnaround in Germany which led to a further reduction in hydrocarbon co-product sales.  Let's now turn to Slide 10, where I'll close with our near-term outlook. In light of the current market dynamics, we're taking several actions to continue to manage the operational levers within our control. First, the macro environment is cautious largely driven by geopolitical volatility and prolonged trade negotiations which continue today. The net result is the continuation of a short-term buying pattern and decreased visibility along value chain. Bottom line, today, we still see the global economy expanding, but the pace of growth is slower particularly in Europe and in China. The U.S. remains fairly robust in consumer nondurable sectors. However, spending on big-ticket items like home builds, autos, durable goods and consumer electronics remains tepid globally. And we're closely watching consumer confidence measures which showed some softness during the second quarter.  Second, pricing in our intermediates are expected to continue to move sideways in the near term as a result of the business environment. You will recall that prices dropped in the fourth quarter of 2018 on a rapid destocking across our product chain plus a sharp decline in oil. Prices settled in the first quarter of 2019, and we saw a positive signs going into the second quarter, but those trends reversed as macro uncertainties escalated. While we're not counting on any immediate trade resolutions, we are still of the view that a path forward on that front can be a catalyst for improved market sentiment and a return to more normalized supply chains and buying patterns. Third, feedstock trends have improved. Since our last earnings call, ethane prices in the U.S. continued to decline, and today, the forward curve has moved lower. We believe that ethane prices could rise modestly going forward as frac spreads are near 0 today. And we expect new ethylene demand coming online. But we continue to see a much more subdued price trajectory and a much lower probability of any ethane spike.  In Europe, LPG continues to be favored versus naphtha. This is important for Dow as we have industry-leading LPG flexibility in Europe with the capability to produce up to 60% of our ethylene from LPG. And as you would expect, throughout the second quarter and today, we have been utilizing this flexibility. In short, these feedstock trends play to Dow's flexibility strength, and they represent another operational lever that we continue to manage closely as we see opportunities.  Turning to Slide 11. Against this backdrop of macro and market trends, we have a clear execution plan moving forward. First, we will continue to leverage the strengths of our business model, and that includes benefiting from our feedstock flexibility, continuing to manage our margins and pushing for pricing recovery. Second, we will keep prioritizing cost control. We have more cost synergy savings and stranded cost removal to accomplish, and we have a clear line of sight to get to it. We will also keep a tight lid on discretionary spending.  Third, with the softness we see in our intermediates pricing, we need to continue selling up and optimizing our product wheel. That means staying focused on driving more captive use of our intermediates into higher value add products such as coatings and silicones formulations and PU systems. And finally, on our investments, we are reducing our 2019 CapEx target from $2.5 billion to $2 billion. This is the prudent action to take as it gives us time to slow down some investments that require more market visibility while maintaining our asset base, improving reliability and preserving our ability to invest in quick win, incremental expansions to deliver value growth even in the current business environment.  In our view, this is not the time to invest in a major greenfield project. Here are a few examples of the actions that we are taking. We have decided to postpone the advancement of our feasibility study for a new world-scale siloxanes plant as we have more near-term value creating, de-bottleneck opportunities to pursue. Building on that point, we continue to greenlight incremental de-bottlenecks in our silicones franchise. Year-to-date, we have completed 5 of the 18 downstream silicones capacity expansions that we have on deck for 2019. We recently agreed to acquire our partner's stake in our Thai HPPO joint venture for a net cash outlay of approximately $150 million. This transaction is expected to close later this year and will be immediately accretive to our ROIC. After a detailed analysis of project returns and future demand growth, we have decided to postpone our planned 450,000-ton polyolefins expansion in Europe. And we will continue to push forward select process innovations, especially those that move us down the cost curve, reduce capital intensity and lower greenhouse gas emissions. This is something in Dow's wheelhouse. Catalyst and process technology developments have historically represented hallmark investments for Dow and the industry. These near-term actions reflect our financial discipline and returns-oriented mindset. And they preserve the advantages that serve us well over the longer term. Our purpose-built portfolio and leading business positions, our leaner cost structure and our suite of incremental high return growth investments, these factors will continue to differentiate Dow and drive our earnings growth trajectory. In closing, we delivered a solid second quarter results in a tough environment. Going forward, you can continue to count on the Dow team to remain focused on driving a leaner cost structure, running our assets efficiently, optimizing the value of our integration, growing our differentiated positions and continuing to be disciplined capital and resource allocators. Now I'll turn it back to Neal to open the Q&A. Neal Sheorey : Thank you, Jim. With that, let's move on to your questions. I would like to remind you that our forward-looking statements apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. Operator, please provide the Q&A instructions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question today will come from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Vincent Andrews : Wondering if you could just sort of give us an update on where your views are on polyethylene supply and demand sort of not just for the back half of this year but maybe into 2020 and 2021. There seems to be a lot of debate out there, again, over exactly how much supply is going to come not just in the U.S. but also in the rest of the world, whether China or parts of Eastern Europe. So your updated thoughts there would be very helpful. James Fitterling : Vince, yes, on polyethylene, operating rates and supply-demand balances, our view is that we've kind of been in a plateau here of about 87%, 88% operating rates in polyethylene globally. And I think we're going to continue to see that extend out over the next couple of years. Mainly, we went back and took a look at what's happened with projections on capacity adds since back to 2007. And when you look at that whole track record of what's reported versus what actually happened, there were 64 projects that were supposed to start up in 2019 or beyond. Only 18 of those could be tied back to that original forecast. And 13 of the 18 were supposed to come online already, and every single 1 of them has been pushed back from its original start date. So I think some of these projections, whether it's about ethane prices spiking at the back half of the year or whether it's about plummeting operating rates, are a little bit tough to understand. The market's growth is there. We had good growth in the quarter. We had double-digit growth in China both in polyethylene and in downstream silicones. So the market demand growth is there. And I think that the biggest issue really in the integrated chain has to do more with the ethylene supply-demand balances, and that's because everybody in the U.S. has been integrating and so that merge in ethylene has driven some of the margin out of the U.S. ethylene integrated margins. Operator : And next, we move to David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. David Begleiter : Jim, Howard, just on the Q3 guidance, looking at Slide 6, you called out headwinds of roughly $270 million, tailwinds of $90 million, so I guess a net $180 million headwind. What other headwinds, tailwinds do you see from the base business in Q3 versus Q2? James Fitterling : I'll take a shot and then ask Howard to comment because I think there are 2 sides on this thing. I think you've got the headwinds and tailwinds in there. I mean, we see pricing moving sideways basically in the third quarter. I would say with 1 exception, I expect siloxanes in Asia Pacific, because of where we ended the quarter, that would have been an averaging effect in the third quarter. So that may have a little bit of downward pressure on siloxanes. The rest of silicones is holding up well. And the headwinds part is really heavily influenced by Argentina and the issues that Howard mentioned on the quote. So obviously, we're going to do everything we can to try to get back as soon as we can, but still, it's going to be the quarter to make those repairs, and our estimate there is $100 million. Howard, any other on the financial side that you've got? Howard Ungerleider : Yes. David, I would say just when you look at that slide, it's pretty balanced between the headwinds and the tailwinds. So you referenced and Jim talked about the $100 million in Argentina and the $20 million I talked about on the call in the prepared remarks on Sadara. And you got $90 million of lower turnarounds -- lower planned turnaround spending sequentially and the cost synergies coming out. So minus $90 million plus $120 million, it's kind of a balanced approach. James Fitterling : And then we had an increase in cash from operating activities in the quarter, so that was up $200 million year-over-year. And we continue to come off of those integration expenses. We've got a lot of integration projects and separation projects, actually, that wind up third quarter, fourth quarter. So that sets us up nice for 2020. And we expect the year-over-year decline in those separation costs of about $1 billion next year. Operator : And next we'll move on to Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan. Jeffrey Zekauskas : Some consultants think that polyethylene prices in June were down $0.03 a pound because of unofficial discounts. And other consultants think that prices were flat. Which do you think is more accurate representation of the June domestic polyethylene market? And then secondly, CP Chem is buying Nova Chemical. Did you guys bid for that? James Fitterling : Jeff, our view on polyethylene prices is they were flat in June. And I expect they'll continue to move sideways here into the third quarter. Regarding Nova, our only discussions with Nova obviously are around settling the issue we've got with them over the E3 cracker, so we had no other discussions with them. Operator : And next we'll move to Christopher Parkinson with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Christopher Parkinson : When you return your comments last year regarding the flat margin benefits in isocyanates, siloxanes, et cetera, that would act as '19 headwinds, can you quickly revisit your quantitative assumptions in this calculations and just give us an update on where we stand today given the initial magnitude? Just any thoughts would be helpful. James Fitterling : Yes. At the time, we saw a step-down obviously in China based on new capacity that came on in China in the siloxanes area. And so we saw that move down. And our view obviously is we were going to continue to invest downstream to convert more of our own siloxanes into finished materials. It's a little bit worse than we had forecasted at the time, and it's lasted a little bit longer than we had expected. But otherwise, everything else is on track. And the growth on the downstream silicones is on track. We had double-digit growth in China in the quarter. We had good growth around the world. So you see consumer markets like health and beauty care, you see large commercial, residential -- or large commercial buildings like skyscrapers and things, those continue to move forward. Some softness obviously in  applications that go into electronics and auto. But all else remains on track. Operator : And we'll move on to P.J. Juvekar with Citi. P.J. Juvekar: Can you talk about your feedstock slate into the crackers? You talked about ethane supply-demand. But looks like butane was the cheapest feedstock by almost $0.06 compared to ethane on a COE basis. So how much butane can you push into the crackers in the Gulf Coast? And then secondly, on polyethylene, we have had destocking since second half of last year. So where do you think inventories stand today relative to normal? And if you can address U.S. and China there, that would be great. James Fitterling : Yes. So butane was the cheapest, and we maxed as much butane as we could. In fact, in the quarter, we brought on a butane vaporizer in Louisiana to help us increase the amount of butane that we can put in there. So we continue to look at places where we can do that. It's a function of both how much butane can you get at a location and then how much can you vaporize to move into the cracker. So we'll continue to do that. The other big move, obviously, recently, has been propane. So propane-naphtha spreads have widened. And we've been cracking some propane in the fleet as well, propane, ethane. Ethane had been favored most the second quarter, but just here recently, propane actually moved into the money, so we moved in a little bit there. Look, all the investments we've made over the last 5 years were not just growth oriented, they were also to expand our NGL capability and expand our flexibility, and that's paying off. And the propane trend that I mentioned really has a big impact on Europe. So we've been back to maxing LPG cracking in Europe for most of the year. I would say I think the rest of the balance is on destocking, inventories are coming down, working capital is coming down. I think people are being a little bit more hand to mouth in their purchases. People are not being very speculative. And so we see that. I don't think that there's been any dramatic increase in any inventories in any part of the world. Operator : And next we'll move to John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets. John McNulty : So Jim, I mean it looks like the macro is certainly moderating. Maybe we're not in the global recession yet, but I guess how do you think about stress testing your model around cash flows and earnings if we do slip into some sort of a recession at this point given the pressures you've already been facing? James Fitterling : Right. Let me just talk about the market macros first, and then I'll have Howard then make a few comments on stress testing because it will tie back to what we talked about on last call about the work that we did on setting up the new Dow. I think the market is really kind of 2 different markets right now. So if you look at it geographically, China and Europe are having some big pressure right now more so than the U.S. So the U.S. economy is holding up relatively better. However, if you look at it from a market standpoint, automotive is down from last year. Last year was obviously a peak year for global light vehicle production, and we are down and those forecasts have continued to be revised down for the year. That has a lot of direct impact, but then it has an awful lot of indirect impact on content that hits our industry. Electronics are down, so it's the seventh consecutive month we've seen a contraction in new orders for electronics. That hasn't been that way since 2012. Home builds, the sentiment around Architectural Billing Index (sic) [ Architecture Billings Index ] is down about 400 basis points year-over-year. And durable goods have been down 3 of the last 4 months. And to me, this is the confidence factor in the market. And we typically see when people are concerned about the outlook, individual consumers, they tighten up on big-ticket purchases, and so that's reflected. The consumer nondurable side, health and beauty care, packaging purchases, things that people do every day, go out to eat, these kind of things, those number -- retail numbers are looking pretty good. And packaging silicone formulations, coatings formulations, PU systems, that's holding up pretty well. So I don't think we're in a recession. It doesn't feel like we're in a recession. I do think a trade resolution would bring some confidence back into people and brighten the outlook. And confidence is huge in these markets. Howard, may be just a little recon on cash and the focus on cash which we did this quarter to make sure that we are generating good operating activity cash flow. Howard Ungerleider : You bet. I would say on cash flow, our cash from operating activities was up $200 million even though earnings were down versus a year ago. On an apples-to-apples basis, you have to adjust for the AR securitization, and on apples-to-apples basis, it was flat. So we generated flat cash from ops. Even though earnings were down, we generated almost $1 billion of cash flow from operating activities. To your stress test point, if you just -- look, if you take the first half based on your moderating point, John, you take the first half EBITDA and then annualize it, you're looking at about a $7.5 billion annual run rate. You subtract out interest and taxes of about $1.5 billion, you're at $6 billion. You heard the guidance that Jim gave on the call of lowering CapEx from $2.5 billion to $2 billion, so now you're at $4 billion. We guided to $1 billion of integration and separation costs this year because of the separation and the spinout from DowDuPont. Most of that spending now in the first half is behind us. So that will sequentially be a tailwind. That's $1 billion for the year, so subtract that from the $4 billion, you're talking about $3 billion of discretionary cash for dividends, share buyback, other things. That doesn't include any benefit from nonoperating cash. That doesn't include any benefit from working capital improvements. I'm pretty proud of the Dow team, the focus on cash inside the company is very, very high and we'll be continuing to drive that cash flow conversion number up. So we feel really good about that going forward. Operator : And next we'll move to Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Dylan Campbell : This is Dylan Campbell on for Bob. Could you help on ethane costs? It seems like sentiment and demeanor in ethane market has shifted pretty considerably since prices spiked above $0.60 a gallon last year and have fallen pretty considerably since then. Can you help diagnose and maybe just give us a little bit more context on why you don't think prices spike in the back half of the year? Can you give a little bit kind of a diagnosis of what has occurred over the last year or so? James Fitterling : Sure. I think at a high level, Dylan, it delays in new cracker startups. And then some on-time and early startups of new fractionators. And what that did is obviously drove a change in what the forward outlook would be on that ethane curve. There is excess U.S. ethane supply throughout the period from now until 2023. So the balance is going to be long, and I think that hasn't changed. New cracker delays have taken that ethane down -- ethane demand down by about 275,000 barrels per day. So that means the inventories got bloated, and you saw frac spreads go -- they actually went negative at the end of the quarter. They are back to breakeven or maybe slightly positive. And honestly, I think they could stay here to maybe $1 frac spread in this near-term period. And a little bit will depend on the timing and success of some of these cracker startups. You've got good oil production out of the Permian, the Eagle Ford, the SCOOP, the STACK. Those are really close to Mont Belvieu. You've got 1.2 million barrels a day of new wide grade pipelines. They're going to feed Mont Belvieu by first quarter of '20. And then 6 new Gulf Coast fractionators have been announced for startup in early 2020, and those have a combined capacity of 800,000 barrels per day. 450,000 of that is purity ethane. So that's what's led to the situation that you've got here. Gas demand is going to be at -- gas inventories are going to be at a 5-year high -- or 5-year average at the end of this year. We haven't been there for the last couple of years. I think our view is we are going to see these kind of prices for ethane for the near term here. Operator : And next we'll hear from Jonas Oxgaard with Bernstein. Jonas Oxgaard : Though the disconnect between U.S. domestic P price and export price is now at a, I think, like a four-year high. And historically, these disconnects never last. But as export price is pretty much exactly in line with Asia price, the only correction that looks plausible is for U.S. domestic to come down. Can you give a little bit of color on why it has stayed so high for -- or the disconnect stayed so large for so long and how do you see that evolving? James Fitterling : Jonas, I think everybody had anticipated that with tariffs it would really shut off the whole China market. We haven't seen that. The demand for product in China has been strong. We were up double digits into China in the quarter. And I would also say you've got growth in other parts of the world which are sizable as well. So Southeast Asia, obviously coming. There's Africa. So I think there's enough market demand around the world that it hasn't forced that to happen. There are also some just built-in logistics hurdles here in the U.S. It's very much a railcar market, and so there's a delta that has to be maintained there and is protected there. But overall, I haven't seen that pressure on that. I think we've seen more pressure really on the ethylene market price on the integrated margins. And I think that's where we are going to continue to see that pressure until we see that derivative capacity and the links in the ethylene market really get back in line. Operator : And moving on, we'll hear from Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global. Hassan Ahmed : Jim, it seems that the glycol market continues to be pressured, right? And as I take a look at sort of a bunch of moving parts over there, obviously, polyester, a big sort of end user, so I would imagine the whole China trade war side of things is playing a role. But just beyond that, it seems inventories in China are quite high for glycol, and there is incremental supply coming online. So how are you guys thinking about sort of the near to medium term side of things within glycol? I mean is it a situation which will quickly get resolved if there is a trade war resolution, or are there sort of fundamental near-term issues there? James Fitterling : I think you're right, Hassan, that glycol pricing relative to last year is down almost as much as the drop we saw in oil price in the fourth quarter, about 35%, 40%. They have been pretty stable at these levels for quite a while. There is inventory in China obviously that the traders are trying to work down. You've seen some rate cuts at some of the higher cost manufacturers trying to dial down really to get their operating rates to balance demand. Polyester is running pretty well in China. So I haven't seen like a big demand drop on polyester in China. I think those operating rates are good. But I do think if trade came off, you would see some of the producers there being a little bit more aggressive. And some of the retailers here, specifically here in the U.S., would probably be a little bit more open to purchases and not looking to shift their supply positions to other countries away from China. Operator : Laurence Alexander with Jefferies will have our next question. Unknown Analyst : This is [ Nick Cicera ] on for Laurence. Just a quick follow-up comment on -- question on the MEG inventory. I was wondering how long it would take maybe to work down some of those levels in China. James Fitterling : That's a good question, Nick. Typically, we see these kind of corrections in MEG would typically take, under a strong growth format, maybe a quarter to work through. And I think you'll see some of these traders under pressure to get this -- from a cash flow standpoint, to get this worked out by the end of the year. So I think that's why people have been making adjustments on operating rates to try to balance things out. I would be surprised if they would want to carry these inventories through the year-end. Operator : And next we'll hear from Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research. Frank Mitsch : Jim, in your discussions about pricing, you indicated that you thought third quarter would really see flat sort of pricing although you did have a concern on siloxanes. But I look at Slide 10, and we see that IHS is forecasting MDI prices to move up through the quarter. And so I'm curious as to what your outlook is on MDI. Do you agree with that notion that MDI should be moving up? What is your outlook there? James Fitterling : Frank, I think some of these forecasts on pricing are really tough as you go out into the future. MDI has been stable at these prices. Even MEG being low, it's been stable at these prices. Siloxanes, I would expect maybe somewhere we thought that they might tick up a little bit, but they've been pretty stable as well. I would think for MDI to move up, you're either going to have to have some turnaround outages or you are going to have to see a real pull on the demand side of the equation to make that happen. Our outlook for them is flat. And I would just also say the forecast that we had on these ethane prices that they were going to go up dramatically at the end of the year, and we were not -- at that time, we were saying we don't see that happening. And as we sit here today, it didn't happen. So I just think in this macro environment, it feels like third quarter's going to be kind of a sideways quarter like second quarter. Operator : And we'll move on to Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Kevin McCarthy : Jim, I was wondering if you can compare and contrast what you're seeing in the polyurethane business in intermediates versus systems. And then on Slide 11, I think you have a comment about driving greater internal consumption of intermediates. Is that a reference to polyurethanes? Maybe if you could just provide a brief update on the strategy to go further downstream there as well. James Fitterling : Sure. Thanks, Kevin. Let me just touch the last one first. I think the biggest impact on internal consumption of our intermediates is really ethylene to polyethylene, ethylene to EO derivatives. We had historically been net short buying material. And as we've back integrated and take advantage of shale gas, we're using more of that for our own downstream consumption. So the reason we highlighted that on the release and in the speaking comments that Howard made is because that typically would have been trade sales of ethylene or some other product to the market, so with the revenue line can look lighter even though our downstream sales are good. And it's just an adjustment in those numbers. On polyurethane, I think the biggest impact right now has been on automotive. So in automotive, seating and different parts that go into the auto industry, as those light vehicle builds have slowed down, that's kind of backed up some of that change. Now systems going into things like spray foams, systems going into cold chain, refrigerated containers, going into insulation production for panels for especially commercial and big residential and commercial projects, that continues to look pretty good. And anything we can do into the adhesive space with the exception of obviously adhesives into automotive, which gets a little bit slowed down, has been pretty good. There are PU sales into appliances, so as those durable goods have slowed down, for example, in refrigerators and maybe in some panels for dishwashers and things, you will see a little bit of an impact there. I think that's the biggest impact on polyurethane. We'll continue to move more of those intermediates to downstream systems because we can work with the end-use customers to make finished products that really give them an advantage in their products and ability to capture higher value. And that's what we want to do long term, whether that's coatings, taking monomers into coatings or taking polyurethane intermediates into systems or taking more of our plastics into higher grade materials for packaging, health and hygiene, siloxanes into silicones, that's a consistent strategy. We're going to continue to do that across the board. Operator : And we'll move on to Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Steve Byrne : What's Dow headcount right now versus a year ago? And given these macro headwinds, have you reassessed opportunities to cut fixed costs? And similarly, what ability do you have with your joint ventures to push more aggressive cost cutting given the near-term outlook? James Fitterling : Right. So our target headcount for the new Dow, once we completed all of our streamlining -- and really to do this, we had done external benchmarking with the best of the best. Our idea was to be best in class competitive, was to get to a headcount of 37,000 globally. And we will be there at the end of this year. In fact, we've accelerated some of those moves that we've planned through the year. We've accelerated some of those. And so that's why you see cost synergy savings coming out in advance of what we've said. We always continue to take a look at that. Headcount is part of our fixed cost, but it is only a fraction of it. So when you get to the number of sites that we have around the world, you also have to look at contractual relationships, services and other things that we do. So there's a heavy emphasis right now in manufacturing, engineering and all of that. Peter Holicki and his team are obviously looking at what does the future Dow need to look like in terms of footprint. And where we have opportunities to consolidate we are doing that. And then the rest of this $600 million of savings we got to come out through this year is really getting after footprint consolidation, I would say, outside of manufacturing into things like getting lab consolidations done, which we've done a lot of this year, for example, in Europe and here in North America, office buildings and other things. So we are making good progress on that, and we keep doing that. We were fortunate that we were already in this mode coming out of the spin so that we have the machine moving. And we could go in at the beginning of the second quarter and say this is going to be a tough quarter. We got to keep the pressure on. So we did put some incremental targets in front of them. And then on top of that, we're going to put the CapEx numbers down there. And we'll get them down to $2 billion this year. And if it gets worse, I don't expect it's going to get recessionary, but if it gets into that kind of frame, we still have room to move. Operator : And we'll move to John Roberts with UBS. John Roberts : I think I heard you talk about discontinuing a European polyethylene project. But didn't you also have a 2022 start-up in the Gulf Coast planned? And is that still on track? James Fitterling : Yes, we did, John. Thanks for the question. We had a plant in Europe to take advantage of the link we had in ethylene there in and we had a plant in the U.S. Gulf Coast. What the business has done is gone and relooked at both of those projects. I think they do want to continue to pursue a U.S. Gulf Coast project because of the cost position that we have here. And they've decided to defer the one that's in Europe. And I would say postpone is the right answer. I think at some point in the future, it might make sense, but given all the things going on right now and the market outlook, it's probably not the right time to do that. Operator : And next we'll move to Aleksey Yefremov. Aleksey Yefremov : Jim, thanks for the color on CapEx. Would you consider keeping CapEx close to $2 billion in 2020 if demand and margins do not improve? James Fitterling : I'm going to keep it tight until I get better visibility on the market. I think we need to get a trade deal resolved to get some confidence back in the market, at least on the industrial side of things, right. I think the consumer is still strong. But on this industrial side of the market segment, and you've seen reports coming out from some big heavy equipment industrials that are also slowing down. We need -- those are high content uses for our materials. We need to see some pickup there. When we see some pickup there, then we'll take a look at what is the right time to move back in. Meanwhile, those silicones projects, we have a couple of EO derivatives projects that are underway right now. This $150 million to buy back the other half of the Thai HPPO joint venture, these are high return projects and immediately accretive. So we're going to do -- I don't want to postpone those. Those are right in the sweet spot of what we need to do. And we've got to make sure that we maintain these assets and keep their reliability. All of our CapEx does not necessarily go just into growth, it also has to make sure that we improve our cost position through this cycle so that the next cycle we're able to weather the next cycle as well. Operator : And that will conclude today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Neal Sheorey for any additional or closing remarks. Neal Sheorey : Thank you, everyone for joining our call. We appreciate your interest in Dow. For your reference, a copy of our transcript will be posted on Dow's website later today. This concludes our call. Thank you. Operator : And that will conclude today's call, we thank you for your participation.",

    "content": "\ufeff Neal Sheorey : Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us to discuss the Third Quarter Financial Results for Dow. We are making this call available via webcast, and we have prepared slides to supplement our comments during this conference call. They are posted on the Investor Relations section of Dow\u2019s website and through the link to our webcast. Speaking on the call today are Jim Fitterling, Dow\u2019s Chief Executive Officer; and Howard Ungerleider, President and Chief Financial Officer. Please read the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the earnings news release and slides. During our call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding our expectations or predictions about the future. Because these statements are based on current assumptions and factors that involve risks and uncertainties, our actual performance and results may differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Dow\u2019s Forms 10-Q and 10-K include detailed discussions of principal risks and uncertainties which may cause such differences. Unless otherwise specified, all historical financial measures presented today are on a pro forma basis. And all financials, where applicable, exclude significant items. We\u2019ll also refer to non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures is contained in the Dow earnings release, in the slides that supplement our comments today and on the Dow website. On Slide 2, you\u2019ll see our agenda for the call. Jim will start with an overview of Dow\u2019s third quarter and operating segment performance. Howard will then move into a financial overview of the quarter and will also provide some comments on modeling guidance and discuss Dow\u2019s progress against some of our key financial targets. And finally, Jim will provide a progress update on Dow\u2019s cost and growth targets and then close with a discussion on our forward-looking view. Following that, there would be plenty of time for your questions. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jim. Jim Fitterling : Thanks, Neal, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. Starting on Slide 3. Our results in the third quarter demonstrate the Dow team\u2019s focus on managing the levers within our control. We are also making progress against our operational, financial, and strategic priorities that we laid out for the new Dow at our Investor Day last year. At that time, we presented a clear set of priorities and targets along with a playbook to drive our execution. Since then, we have been diligently delivering on that plan. In the third quarter, we achieved top line performance that was in line with our guidance and bottom line results that exceeded expectations. In doing so, we delivered strong improvements from Q2 to Q3 across the board, EBIT margin, earnings and free cash flow. Here are some other notable highlights from our results. First, we continued to capture demand growth, particularly in sectors closer to the consumer where conditions remain favorable, excluding hydrocarbons and energy, Dow\u2019s volume rose by 1% in the quarter led by consumer growth and packaging, polyurethanes and silicones application. Second, we grew earnings and margin sequentially led by our plastics franchise. We leveraged our industry leading feedstock flexibility in the United States and Europe. In Europe, we capitalized on the LPG advantage versus naphtha. And on the U.S. Gulf Coast, we made full use of new butane capabilities that we put in place earlier this year. And we successfully achieved zero naphtha cracking this quarter, expanding our flexibility and avoiding and otherwise costly feedstock penalty. Additionally, we focused on recapturing price, a key improvement toward the end of the quarter in polyethylene. Third, we continued to drive down our cost structure. We reached a significant milestone in the quarter successfully completing our $1.365 billion cost synergy program. Furthermore, we removed another $40 million of stranded costs in the quarter. And fourth, our results this quarter showed the ability of Dow\u2019s portfolio to generate strong cash flow. We generated $1.8 billion in cash flow from continuing operations and $1.3 billion in free cash flow. We improved our earnings to cash flow conversion as well as working capital improvements provided a source of cash. The cash flow story this quarter is a noteworthy highlight and Howard will unpack this later in the call. We accomplished all of this while navigating a business environment with limited visibility and while overcoming operational limitations in Argentina where both of our crackers were down through the third quarter following a countrywide power outage in late June. And finally, we made important progress and our litigation with Nova Chemicals and in our deleveraging priorities. In September, a judgment was entered in Alberta, Canada ordering Nova Chemicals to pay Dow approximately $1.1 billion. On October 10, Dow received the related cash payment of approximately $800 million. Subsequently, we issued a make whole call for the full redemption of $1.25 billion of notes due in 2021 further reducing debt. This was another important step forward in strengthening our financial profile. Altogether, our results demonstrate the strength of the Dow portfolio and our continued focus on executing the operational, financial and strategic playbook that we laid out a year ago. Now moving onto our segment results and the business performance in the quarter. On Slide 4, Packaging & Specialty Plastics expanded operating EBIT margin nearly 200 basis points year-over-year. Our results reflected demand growth in packaging applications, margin expansion, cost synergies and contributions from new capacity on the U.S. Gulf Coast, which more than offset lower equity earning. And notably on a sequential basis, EBIT grew 4% and operating EBIT margin expanded 100 basis points. Further, the results are particularly notable considering that the segment overcame a $100 million headwind from a combination of lost ethylene production and repair costs in Argentina. Our two crackers there are now back up and running. In the third quarter, we saw a continuation of solid demand in packaging application. The Packaging & Specialty Plastics business grew volume by 4% year-over-year. We again saw growth in industrial and consumer packaging, flexible food and specialty packaging and health and hygiene applications. Regionally, volume growth this quarter was led by Asia Pacific and EMEA. In Hydrocarbons & Energy, the business reported both lower volume and local price. The volume declines were an outcome of our drive for lighter feedslates in Europe, which led to lower whole product production volume. In addition, we had slightly lower merchant ethylene sales in the United States as a result of enhanced ethylene integration enabled by our new derivative capacity. On Slide 5, Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure operating EBIT declined versus the year ago period primarily due to margin compression in the polyurethanes component and MEG as well as lower demand in industrial end-markets. In Industrial Solutions, volume declined modestly as a result of lower demand in energy, agriculture and automotive end-markets. This was partly offset by growth in catalyst application and demand in pharma end-markets. The business reported a significant drop in its equity earnings driven by margin compression for MEG at our Kuwait joint ventures. Polyurethanes & Construction Chemicals sales declined on lower local pricing in all regions led by lower components prices. However, the business achieved volume growth driven by gains in the United States and Canada on improved MDI supply year-over-year as well as continued demand growth in polyurethane systems. Our growth in systems reflects the businesses focus on driving its downstream agenda and moving the portfolio from merchant component sales to higher value formulated systems. It has been a multiyear journey and the progress we\u2019ve made so far has been impressive. This quarter marked the 25th consecutive quarter of year-over-year volume growth for the systems business. And finally on Slide 6. Performance Materials & Coatings operating EBITDA from the year ago period primarily due to siloxanes margin compression and lower demand in coatings and monomers. Consumer Solutions sales declined as volume gains in Asia Pacific and the U.S. and Canada. We are more than offset by local price declines in all region mainly driven by lower siloxanes prices. The business reported volume growth in infrastructure end-markets and improved demand for siloxanes in Asia Pacific. This was partly offset by soft demand in the automotive and consumer electronics end-markets. Coatings & Performance Monomers reported a volume decline. On the coating side, the business saw lower demand in the U.S. and Canada in architectural coating and soft demand in Asia Pacific in industrial coatings end-markets. I\u2019ll now turn it over to Howard to discuss financial performance in the quarter, modeling guidance and the progress that we made against some of our key financial targets. Howard Ungerleider : Thanks, Jim, and good morning everyone. Turning to Slide 7. Net sales were $10.8 billion in line with our guidance. The decline was primarily driven by lower local pricing. Volume declined 2% year-over-year. This was largely driven by changes in hydrocarbons and energy related to our cracker feedslates combined with lower ethylene trade sales volume. Excluding Hydrocarbons & Energy, volume was up 1% versus a year ago period driven by growth in packaging, polyurethanes and silicones applications. Sequentially demand was higher in Packaging & Specialty Plastics and an Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure. Local price declined 12% primarily due to decreases in lower global energy prices year-over-year. Currency decreased sales by 1% as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro. The earnings impact of currency was offset by year-over-year tailwinds from a lower tax rate and reduced interest expense. Equity losses were $44 million, a year-over-year headwind of nearly $180 million. The decrease was primarily due to lower results at the Kuwait joint ventures driven by margin compression in MEG and polyethylene. Equity losses at Sadara also increased primarily due to the impact of a third-party industrial gas supplier issue, which has since been resolved. In the appendix of our earnings deck, we have included our additional disclosure for our three principal joint ventures, which provides further details on their results. Overall operating EBIT was $1.1 billion. Tailwinds in the quarter included savings from cost synergies and stranded cost removal as well as contributions from new capacity on the U.S. Gulf Coast. These gains were more than offset by a year-over-year margin compression in siloxanes and isocyanates, lower equity earnings and the impact from the Argentina outage. On a sequential basis, operating EBIT rose 5% or nearly $60 million, representing our first sequential EBIT increase in more than a year. Our operating EBIT margin also expanded 80 basis points led by margin expansion in Packaging & Specialty Plastics. We generated $1.8 billion of cash from continuing operations, which reflected a reduced headwind from integration and separation spending and a $700 million release of cash from working capital. Relative to the year ago period, our cash from continuing operations was up $1.6 billion. But recall that we made a voluntary pension contribution last year of $1.1 billion. After adjusting for this, the underlying operations delivered a $500 million increase in cash flow versus the same quarter last year. And finally, we were turned $600 million to our owners in the quarter, including $500 million of paid dividends and $100 million of share repurchases. Since then, we have completed $400 million of share repurchases and we remain on track to achieve our target of $500 million for the year. Moving to Slide 8 and our modeling guidance for the fourth quarter. As we have for the past couple of quarters, we are again providing our segment guidance on a sequential basis to reflect the most relevant comparison in today\u2019s environment. At the total Dow level, we see four EBIT tailwind sequentially as headwinds from normal fourth quarter seasonality in coatings and infrastructure markets and modest impacts from turnarounds are offset by nearly $150 million of add-backs from onetime events in the third quarter, including the impact of our outage in Argentina. In Performance Materials & Coatings, we expect siloxanes pricing to remain at above the same level as we exited the third quarter. In coatings and monomers, we expect to see the normal seasonal reduction in profitability and the business will also absorb one third of the impact from our planned PDH turnaround that is currently underway. Moving to Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure, this segment will absorb the remainder of the PDH turnaround impact. And MEG prices on average are projected to be similar to the third quarter. And finally in the Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment, we see feedstock price trends continuing to drive the lighter cracker feedslates in the U.S. and Europe, which will continue to reduce our top line sales of co-products. We expect a modest sequential headwind as we complete a large turnaround in the Netherlands and we anticipate reduced catalyst and licensing earnings in the quarter, which by their nature are lumpy. On the positive side, our Argentina assets are now back online. So they will once again be positively contributing to our results. Turning to Slide 9, there are two areas where I\u2019d like to highlight the progress we\u2019ve made against our financial targets. The first is our capital structure, specifically the de-leveraging and liability management we\u2019ve done this year. As you recall from our Investor Day last year, we outlined our capital structure priorities and our deleveraging targets. And as you see on this slide, we have been delivering on our plan, making significant progress and improving and smoothing our debt maturity profile and maintaining our liquidity position. We have opportunistically refinanced upcoming maturities and we secure the option to extend the outstanding $2 billion on our term loan by an additional two years to the second half of 2023. So far this year, we have completed $2 billion of gross deleveraging and with our recent $1.25 billion debt redemption announcement, which was supported by the cash proceeds we received from Nova, we will complete more than $3 billion of gross deleveraging by the end of this year. The result of these actions is that we do not have a significant debt maturity due until 2022 and we have maintained our strong liquidity position, which is more than $10 billion. These accomplishments align to the financial priorities we outlined a year ago maintaining a strong capital structure, reducing risk, lowering interest expense, and preserving our financial strength and flexibility. Moving to Slide 10. The second financial highlight is the progress we have made in our cash flow generation and the potential we see to improve further from here. Looking at the trailing 12 months, we have delivered $3.2 billion of free cash flow. Our results do not yet fully reflect our underlying potential. The reason for this, as we highlighted at the start of the year, is that we have had short-term cash headwinds from two discrete factors, post-spin integration and separation activities and interest expense. On both fronts, peak spending is behind us. Through the third quarter, we have spent more than a $1 billion on integration and separation spending in 2019 and we expect a full year spend to be in the range of $1.2 billion in line with our target for the year. This spending is beginning to recede. And looking ahead, we expect the 2020 cash spend to be in the range of $200 million to $300 million for a year-over-year release of cash of about $1 billion. And on interest expense, as I highlighted, we have accomplished a substantial amount of deleveraging in liability management. This has put us in a position today where we see our 2020 run rate interest expense being a $100 million lower than where we started in 2019. These two factors alone represent more than $1 billion of cash flow uplift in 2020 that are completely within our control and independent of market conditions. We also continue to pursue non-operational cash inflows, notably the additional litigation we have pending with Nova and our teams continue to also focus on operational improvements such as greater working capital efficiency. These improvements will not only boost gross cash flow but should also lift our earnings to cash conversion. Our focus on cash is paying off and all other things equal, our free cash flow was poised to expand. This additional flexibility preserves our ability to deliver against our financial priorities, including our strong shareholder returns and further de-leveraging. Now, I\u2019d like to hand it back to Jim to discuss our progress and our cost and growth priorities as well as our near term outlook. Jim Fitterling : Thanks, Howard. Turning to Slide 11. I\u2019ll start with our cost-out priority. The progress we\u2019ve made on our cost reductions has been proceeding faster than we planned. In the third quarter, we successfully completed our $1.365 billion cost synergy program, which we finished about one to two quarters ahead of schedule. On the stranded cost removal side, we eliminated an additional $40 million and have already exceeded $125 million in cumulative savings. Just before our spin, we laid out a target to deliver $600 million of our remaining $800 million of cost energy savings and stranded costs removal in 2019. Based on the progress we\u2019ve made through the third quarter, we now expect to deliver approximately $700 million of savings this year, with the remaining $100 million to be realized in the first half of 2020. The Dow team has done an excellent job in putting together a robust cost out plan that identifies, delivers and tracks these savings and they have kept at that focus for more than two years to ensure our steady delivery against our target. Turning to Slide 12 and perhaps what I\u2019m most proud of is that the Dow story has not only been about cost, but we\u2019ve also continued to drive several high return growth projects. A year ago, we told you that the new Dow has a well-defined growth roadmap that includes a robust pipeline of attracted investment, projects that are lower risk, faster payback, lower capital intensity, and higher return on invested capital. As the macro environment changed, we quickly adjusted our capital spending target for the year to $2 billion and we intensified our criteria for approving and advancing projects. In the third quarter alone, we advanced several projects. We announced the retrofit of one of our crackers in Louisiana with our proprietary fluidized catalytic dehydrogenation technology to produce on-purpose propylene. We see the FCDh technology as a game changer for the industry. It promises reduced capital intensity, lower energy usage, and lower greenhouse gas emission. FCDh not only drives return on invested capital benefits, but it also advances our sustainability agenda when compared to all conventional PDH technologies. We launched Agility CE, a new resin made with 70% post consumer recycled plastics, which incorporates recycled plastic shrink film into low density polyethylene. We also announced two partnerships that showcase circular economy solutions for plastics. The Fuenix agreement allows Dow to incorporate recycled plastic waste back into our feedstock supply. And second, the UPM Biofuels technology enables plastic solutions made from bio-based renewable feedstock. Both solutions reduce carbon emissions without impacting the performance of our final products. In our silicones franchise, we continued to green light incremental debottlenecks. Through the third quarter, we have completed 14 of the 18 downstream capacity expansions that we planned for this year. We reached the final investment decision for our previously announced flexible alkoxylation capacity to support our customers\u2019 growth in infrastructure and home and personal care end-markets. This U.S. Gulf Coast unit is expected to start up by the end of 2021. Furthermore, we recently signed a 10-year supply agreement with a key customer securing the base load volume for this facility, representing $900 million of new revenue over the life of the contract. And on the digital front, we launched a new Dow.com, featuring an expanded e-commerce platform. Year-to-date, we have already achieved nearly $3 billion of sales through this channel and we\u2019re just getting started. These are just a few of the investments that we believe will fuel our growth, deliver productivity improvements, enhance customer experience, and further drive it toward our sustainability goals. Turning to our market outlook on Slide 13. As we look around the globe at key commodity products, our view is that in many cases the margin for high cost producers has essentially been bouncing around the breakeven point for at least the past two quarters. On this side, we showcase a few prime examples. In MEG, Asian spot spreads have been at or slightly below the breakeven point for most of the year and there have been reports over the past two quarters of high cost producers dialing back production. In MDI, we see spreads in Asia bouncing around the historic low point and in ethylene the high cost producer margins are thin and projected to go to zero, while the ethylene margin for producers in the Americas remains healthy. Our base case remains that the global economy will continue growing, albeit at a slower pace. In that scenario, based on historical spreads in our products\u2019 chains, we see a floor to further margin deterioration and a good upside to normalized levels when fundamentals tighten. In this environment, Dow remains well-positioned, thanks to our competitive positions on the cost curve driven by our feedstock flexibility, our scale and significant presence in lower cost region such as Canada, Argentina, and the U.S. Gulf Coast. To sum it up on Slide 14. 2019 has been our year to successfully reintroduce more focused, more streamlined Dow, execute our playbook and showcase our financial and capital discipline. We believe the results of our actions will continue to show in our earnings, deliver enhanced cash flows and preserve our financial strength. As you\u2019ve seen from us all year and especially in the third quarter, we are delivering as we promise. And as we look to the near term future, our mindset does not change. The current business environment demands discipline, and that is why we will continue to leverage our feedstock flexibility, advance our lower risk, higher return growth investments while staying in line with our $2 billion capital expenditure target this year and continued driving a best-in-class reduced cost structure by delivering the remaining stranded cost removal. In some steps that we are taking today positioned us well to leverage increased value when the industrial economy rebound. Now, I\u2019ll turn it back to Neal to open the Q&A. Neal Sheorey : Thank you, Jim. With that, let\u2019s move on to your questions. I would like to remind you that our forward-looking statements apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. Operator, please provide the Q&A instructions. Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first caller, David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead, sir. David Begleiter : Thank you. Good morning. Jim, good job on the cost side. Just looking at Q4, what should we expect for incremental cost savings and stranded costs removals in Q4 versus Q3? Jim Fitterling : Good morning, David. Thanks. In Q4, I think you\u2019re going continue to see somewhere in the range of $65 million to $75 million come out in additional costs. Our stranded \u2013 our synergy program is done as we communicated. We had the $300 million target for stranded costs. We are at $125 million year-to-date. You\u2019ll see another $75 million approximately come out and then another $100 million in the first half of 2020. So I think that\u2019ll get us out of the stranded cost removals. And then as Howard mentioned, we also see about a $100 million lower interest expense next year because of the work that we\u2019ve done on debt restructuring. Operator : All right. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Jeff Zekauskas : Thanks very much. On slide 12, you talked about headwinds for the fourth quarter, which is the absence of a lumpy catalyst and licensing activity of $85 million, which was in Packaging & Specialty Plastics. So I take it, what that means is that in the quarter you just reported there was an $85 million benefit from licensing activity that was I guess a little bit unusual and your sundry income after you make the adjustments was up $100 million. What is that and does that flow through to the individual segments? And if it does, where does it go? Jim Fitterling : Howard, do you want to touch on the polyethylene part? And then maybe we can also talk about what\u2019s happening with pricing and PE. Howard Ungerleider : Yes. I would say \u2013 so on the sundry income side, Jeff the third quarter was favorable, but that was really due to a certain improved forex hedging and that goes to each of the segments proportionally. It really wasn\u2019t a licensing and catalyst thing. On the licensing and catalyst, I would just say your description is not where I would go. I would say it\u2019s the delta change from Q3 to Q4, we\u2019re expecting to be $85 million. That was not the absolute number. Jim Fitterling : And Jeff on the licensing, that was a Univation license that was granted, and I think that\u2019s the comment on the lumpy demand and so Univation still continues to license technology as people are continuing to build polyethylene capacity. I would say on PE, I think, the thing to take away for fourth quarter is that we ended $0.03 higher than the IHS integrated margin spreads in the third quarter and you\u2019ve got ethane prices $0.18 roughly a gallon versus what everybody has expected to be greater than $0.40 a gallon. So I think as you look into fourth quarter with demand good, with inventories down in the third quarter and with that pricing outlook, I think, you should expect to see a decent plastics quarter. Operator : We\u2019ll next go to Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Vincent Andrews : Thank you and good morning everyone. Could you maybe talk a little bit about MDI and silicones and sort of what you think is going to happen through fourth quarter and into next year are we just going to bounce around these levels? Can MDI volume continue to compound at a mid-single digit rate or do we have to worry about that being a little bit lighter next year? Thank you. Jim Fitterling : Thanks Vince. MDI and I would say siloxane versus silicones, MDI and siloxanes are bouncing around at pretty low levels, as you mentioned and I would expect them to stay in there. A little bit of term in the industrial side of the sector and in the auto side of the sector will put a pull there that would start to bring that back up, but haven\u2019t seen that yet. With PMI really declining for the last four consecutive quarters, the big delta here is consumer has been really pulling all the volume growth and industrial hasn\u2019t yet. But I do think with inventories being low, I don\u2019t see any speculative activity out there and with downstream investments, like in our systems business downstream and our silicones business which are both continuing to hold up well that\u2019s going to create a pull on that supply demand balance. And with nothing new on the horizon, I think, you\u2019re going to see some steady improvement. We get a deal on trade if we get a phase one trade deal that obviously will be a tailwind. And I think the industry is poised right now for a little tailwind. Operator : Next question will come from the line of Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global. Hassan Ahmed : Good morning Jim. Jim, a bit of an interesting sort of quarter. Obviously, we had this incident happen out in Saudi Arabia, which I would imagine limited feedstock supply to a variety of producers out there. And I would imagine Sadara as well. So could you comment on whether or not you guys saw any curtailments in feedstock supply? Has that normalized out in Sadara? And was there any Q3 negative impact from that? And any residual impact we should expect in Q4? Howard Ungerleider : Thanks Hassan great question. We saw limited a reduction in feedstock supply. We were down about 20% for less than two weeks. So that wasn\u2019t the real drag on Sadara in the third quarter. The bigger drag was we had a industrial gas supplier that supplies into the complex that really had an outage that really costs us on the range of $25 million, $30 million on Sadara EBITDA. And I think that\u2019s the bigger impact. Sadara is running well right now. I don\u2019t see any long-term issue from that. And really good cooperation and response from Aramco, real solid response. Operator : All right, next question will come from the line of Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Christopher Parkinson : Great, thank you. So when you just generally think about the Dow story and how it\u2019s evolved since the initial spin up, what do you think are the two to three primary profit drivers as we enter 2020 is at synergy capture, cost run rates, facility downtime changes, changes in equity earnings? If you could just help us conceptualize the key puts and takes from your perspective over the next 12 months, it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you. Jim Fitterling : Hi Chris. It\u2019s a good question. I think what we have tried to do in 2019 is to prepare ourselves and get ourselves on solid financial footing as a new company and I believe we\u2019ve done that. We had to get the costs out, we had to get our balance sheet in the right space, we had to make sure that that industry leading dividend that we put out there was protected. And I believe that we\u2019ve done that. I think we\u2019ve positioned ourselves well for an upturn in the industrial economy. The consumer side of the business is doing great. And high return projects that we\u2019ve got for growth are really playing into that. So we don\u2019t have a demand problem right now. There\u2019s a little bit of supply demand imbalance that we\u2019re working through on those commodities and that\u2019s driven primarily by a slower industrial economy. We see strong growth in Asia, so we\u2019re up double digits out there. We see good growth around the world. And with a little rebound in the industrial economy, you\u2019re going to see a demand pull on the chain that we haven\u2019t seen for four consecutive quarters. When that happens, I think, you\u2019re going to see margin expansion and things are going to start to move up. Oil, goes up a little bit and you see the industrial economy come back. That typically pulls oil price up. That would help too. Howard Ungerleider : And Chris, this is Howard. I would just add everything that Jim talked about really sums it up into a cash story for next year. When you think about the lower interest expense that Jim talked about of $100 million, what I talked about in the prepared remarks of the billion dollars of cash coming out of restructuring costs, from 2019 into 2020, it really is a cash flow generation story as we head into next year. Operator : Okay. We\u2019ll take our next question from the line of Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Duffy Fischer : Yes, good morning guys. Question just on the relative pricing of polyethylene in North America versus Asia, it\u2019s been quite favorable, but with still a little bit more polyethylene to come online in the U.S. and us having to be a bigger net exporter going forward, do you see anything structurally changing in the relative price between North America and Asia? Howard Ungerleider : I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll see a dramatic change Duffy. I think demand in Asia has been good. We were up double digits in Asia Pacific. And I think we\u2019re going to continue to see strong demand there. I think the supply demand in North America, inventories went down 3% at the end of third quarter, about 176 million pounds and price went up in September. So I think that tells you there\u2019s some underlying good demand pull that\u2019s out there. And I think we\u2019re going continue to see that evolve that way. Duffy Fischer : Great, thank you. Operator : So we\u2019ll go to P. J. Juvekar with Citi. P. J. Juvekar: Good morning Jim. Jim Fitterling : Good morning. P. J. Juvekar: It\u2019s amazing that you went to zero in naphtha. I assume that\u2019s more of a U.S. Gulf Coast comment. And assuming that can you discuss your feedstock changes in Europe? And then I guess my question is if more and more companies follow your lead and pick out naphtha, what is the outlook for global naphtha and does that sort of lower cost for Asian producers? Thank you. Jim Fitterling : Good question PJ. Yes, the zero naphtha was the U.S. Gulf Coast component. And what that does is really it widens our feedstock flexibility. So it gives us another range of flexibility that we didn\u2019t have. And that was important this quarter because ethane was really low and also propane was low in the quarter. Propane being low meant we cracked pretty aggressively LPGs in Europe. And we think that we\u2019ll continue to do that through fourth quarter and first quarter in the next year. And sometimes in the winter time if gas prices tick up, you would see that might be limited a little bit. But the outlook for gas as we go into this winter and the inventories and the current prices, I mean, they were going to be cracking LPGs. I don\u2019t know if the changes that we have on cracking zero naphtha in the Gulf Coast is going to have a big impact on naphtha cost to everyone else. I would say that in Asia, the naphtha crackers today are at about breakeven margins and they\u2019ve been there for the \u2013 especially the fourth quartile producers have been there for the last couple of quarters. So I think that pressure is going to continue even if naphtha goes down. Naphtha probably would move more based on what happens with the oil price. Operator : All right. And we\u2019ll go next to Jonas Oxgaard with Bernstein. Jonas Oxgaard : Hi good morning guys. Jim Fitterling : Good morning Jonas. Jonas Oxgaard : I\u2019m a little bit \u2013 good morning. I\u2019m a little confused by your comments about the strong demand in Asia. I think we had this discussion last quarter as well. When you\u2019re talking about strong demand you\u2019re talking about your own volumes not the industry as a whole, right. And as a follow-up, yes. Yes, go ahead. Jim Fitterling : Go ahead. Jonas Oxgaard : Well as a follow-up I mean you are low cost producers, so your volumes should always be strong no matter what, right. From what we can tell from the industry magazines, et cetera, like the demanding Asia is nothing great lately, well lately, I mean the last several months. So can you come a little bit about the difference between you and the market as a whole? Jim Fitterling : I think the bulk of what we\u2019re moving in Asia is in food and flexible packaging, and health and hygiene materials. We also move obviously some materials into Ag films and some other Industrial & Consumer Packaging. The Consumer Packaging is holding up fine, the Industrial has been a little bit slower. But our volumes, have been good, the consumer side has been a strong pull for us around the world. And it was a very strong quarter for us in Asia. And having said that even with that demand we saw prices up at the end of third quarter up $0.03 higher than the IHS integrated margin levels. So I think that\u2019s a combination of our own pricing activity, as well as our ability to capture the spreads by feedstock flexibility that we\u2019ve got. We\u2019re continuing to add products to the line to expand that consumer side and to address some of the challenges on circular economy. So you saw Agility CE in there and we\u2019ve got a host of other recycle-ready products and things for the consumer side of the business that we think are going to continue to drive demand. Operator : All right. And our next question comes from the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Dylan Campbell : Good morning. This is Dylan Campbell on for Bob. When I look at free cash flow, it was a very impressive quarter, particularly compared to, I guess the last several quarters or it\u2019s about double that rate. Can you give a kind of just a bridge on what drove that strength this quarter relative to the last couple of quarters? Jim Fitterling : Yes, good morning. I would say, we saw in the second quarter we also saw a couple, $200 million, $300 million improvement on an apples-to-apples basis despite lower earnings. I would say this quarter, what drove the big $500 million beat and I\u2019m looking at apples-to-apples, so I\u2019m taking out the voluntary pension contribution that we made last year because if you do it on a purely reported basis, we were up 1.6. But on a plus $500 million basis, it really was working capital release. So we\u2019ve got everybody on the team really focused on improving working capital. That was the primary. And then the secondary was really the lower restructuring and spinout spending that we were talking about. But that\u2019s going to lead into the billion dollar release 2020 versus 2019. Those are the two big components. Operator : All right. And next we\u2019ll go to Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Arun Viswanathan : Hey guys. Good morning. Just a couple of questions around cash flow uses of cash flow. Could you rank order your usage of cash flow, I guess here? And maybe within the context of the recent Nova settlement as well as maybe within the context of your margin outlook, it looks like you had really strong performance on margins this quarter. But just curious on if that\u2019s gone much lower just given the polyethylene outlook, how you\u2019d allocate cash? Thanks. Howard Ungerleider : Yes so on the uses of cash this year on a full year basis you are looking at about a $1.5 billion on cash tax and interest expense, you are looking at $2 billion on CapEx, about $1.2 billion on restructuring and then the dividend of $2 billion and $0.5 billion on Sadara. And that\u2019s kind of the makeup of the key pieces that get you on the uses of cash. Relative to the Nova proceed you saw that we announced right after within a two or three days of receiving the cash we did the make whole call on the $1.25 billion worth of bonds. So that just helps us continue to improve our maturity profile and smooth it out. And it obviously will also help lower the interest expense going into next year. Operator : And next we\u2019ll go to John Roberts with UBS. John Roberts : Thank you. Do you think your coatings-related volumes were down more than the end coatings markets this quarter, or in line? And I think that was one of the businesses flagged for potential, strategic review, because it was one of the most significant underperformers over the past couple of years. Jim Fitterling : I think John it was in line with architectural coatings demand. And I would say the one other thing I would throw in there is there have been a couple of customers in architectural coatings that have taken a little bit of business captive. So that has been a bit of a drag on it. The other thing is that industrial coatings demand has been down. And we had a fair amount of industrial coatings business in China and that China industrial demand has been down. But that\u2019s, I think, in line with the rest of the market. We\u2019re continuing to work on the coatings business in terms of the business model. So you\u2019ll see that I talked about on the call we\u2019ve got a new dow.com portal out there. One of the things we\u2019re going to be doing in coatings is taking advantage of that e-commerce capability to try to broaden out our reach into that market segment. And that\u2019s going to help us fill up some assets and get more of that coatings volume. Operator : All right, your next question comes from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Steve Byrne : Yes, thank you. Howard, you mentioned that $0.5 billion to Sadara this year, just wanted to get your outlook for 2020. And then if I could you mentioned this $1.4 billion cost synergy, cost synergy program and is now complete. That program was conceptualized a couple of years ago. What do you think of that now? Is there more opportunity in actual synergies or are you assessing productivity opportunities given some of the sluggish and markets? Howard Ungerleider : Yes, look on Sadara I would say one of the things that we\u2019re working on with our partner Saudi Aramco is achieving project completion. We\u2019ve got one last step, which is finalizing a rail agreement with the Saudi rail authority in Sadara. That\u2019s in its final stages. Our plan right now and I\u2019ll be in the kingdom, in the next couple of weeks, our plan right now is to get PCB done before the end of the year. And then we\u2019ll be looking at negotiating with the lenders on re-profiling the debt. But I would say for modeling purposes, Steve, I would just use another $500 million next year. And then we\u2019ll have more to say as we get that refinancing done. Jim do you want to talk about productivity for next year, you might take it. Jim Fitterling : Yes, I think we\u2019re always looking at productivity gains that we can make. We\u2019ve hit our benchmark targets in terms of cost, and structure and head count that we\u2019ve been trying to achieve. We\u2019re working on trying to get more productivity out of working capital, we\u2019re working on trying to get more productivity out of our maintenance dollars. We\u2019ve done a lot on the digital aspect and what we can do with digital technology there. Those are both going to be important. And we\u2019ve done $3 billion year-to-date on our eCommerce platform. We\u2019re looking to that for some growth and productivity, as we move forward. Operator : All right, next we\u2019ll go to Matthew Blair with Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Matthew Blair : Hey, good morning everyone. I thought the results in II&I were pretty good with the quarter-over-quarter improvement despite some pretty tough conditions in MEG, as well as Asia MDI. I think you also called out that industrial gas supplier outage too. Could you just walk through what got better in II&I in Q3 2019 verses Q2 2019? Thanks. Jim Fitterling : Hi, Matthew. We had a turnaround in Q2 that really brought things down and so that we did not have that turnaround expense in Q3. Otherwise, I would say the business volumes and the quality of the business has been good. The real drag on II&I in third quarter was equity earnings from the Kuwait joint ventures and that was because of the margin spreads on MEG. Kuwait still a low cost producer for MEG and making good returns, but we haven\u2019t seen any demand pull to really bring that margin spread up on MEG. When that comes, I think, you\u2019ll see the real quality of III show through. Operator : All right. Your next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research. Aziza Gazieva : Hi guys. It\u2019s Aziza on for Frank. Looking back at the ways to incremental capacity additions you presented back during the Pre-Spin meeting, I was curious to get your latest thoughts on the project with particular interest on the 600 KTA PE expansion on the U.S. Gulf coast. Thank you. Jim Fitterling : Those projects are still under underway. I think the 600 KTA solution PE capacity will continue to go ahead. We mentioned that. We\u2019re going to take a look at the 450 KTA European expansion. I think, with the demand right now in Europe and with the market outlook, we don\u2019t see a reason to push that forward to any final investment decisions right now. Everything else on that list that we put forward is underway and on the timeline that we put forward. And we\u2019re continuing to look at some additional things like oxalate\u2019s flexible capacity that we announced on the call today. Operator : Next we\u2019ll go to Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Kevin McCarthy : Yes, good morning. Jim I thought you had an impressive results in Packaging and Specialty Plastics, not withstanding some pretty weak industry volumes for polyethylene. So I want to ask you about the latter going back to your Investor Day, you had assessed polyethylene demand growth rate at 1.4 times GDP. Year-to-date it looks meaningfully negative in North America, versus a growing economy. So can you speak to why that\u2019s happening? Do you see it as temporary or more lasting in nature? And will it have an effect on new capital investment in capacity across the industry? Jim Fitterling : I think a lot of what happened, Kevin as a new capacities came up is you saw some inventories build up and some product move out there. The demand obviously with industrial slowing down on the industrial side has been a little bit slower than what we had anticipated. The consumer side has been continuing to perform well. And so I think with some of the pressures that are on in that industrial side, that\u2019s really been the thing that slowed the overall growth. And you are coming off a very, very strong 2018 and so I think you\u2019re going to continue to see that there\u2019s good balance in the supply demand going forward. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any reason to think there\u2019s been a fundamental change in the 1.4 times GDP. Our outlook for GDP next year is still around 3% globally. And so, I believe that you\u2019re going to continue to see about 4% and 4.5% type of growth rates out of polyethylene. Operator : And next we\u2019ll go to Jim Sheehan with SunTrust. Jim Sheehan : Great. Thank you. Can you comment on the supply demand balance in silicones? Do you see that market is balanced right now? And do you expect capacity additions in 2020 to change that balance much? Jim Fitterling : Yes, if I can Jim, I would just say on siloxanes, I think, that\u2019s where the length and the market is today and the siloxane upstream materials. On the silicones downstream the supply demand balance is still fairly tight and there\u2019s a lot of growth in those downstream applications to continue. But on the upstream side when you get into areas of big volume use like, for example, large commercial buildings, big industrial build, some of that has slowed down and taken a little bit of pressure off of siloxanes. There\u2019s no new capacity coming on in siloxanes. We\u2019re working off a lot of capacity that got added in China over the last couple of years. And I think there\u2019s nothing on the horizon for the next two or three years in the siloxane space. So it should continue to tighten from here. If the industrial economy picks up a bit, and building construction picks up a bit, I think, you\u2019ll see that will tighten things up. Jim Sheehan : Thank you. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our last question from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Laurence Alexander : Good morning. With respect to the investments in the circular economy and the discussions around various types of recycled waste inputs is that part of the industry mature enough for you to benchmark whether the returns on capital or the appeal of the projects is competitive or advantaged or disadvantaged against conventional petrochemical investments, or is it still basically a subsidized research project? Jim Fitterling : Good morning Lawrence. Let me approach it this way, I think the real thing that\u2019s changed here is you\u2019re starting to get a sense that the pressure on the consumer goods companies from the consumers would indicate there\u2019s probably a change in people\u2019s willingness to pay for a more recyclable or sustainable product. And so I think that is probably the more important question than the cost of this versus virgin plastics from virgin natural gas liquids or another feed stock. If it was more competitive, that would have already been done. But the reality is there are pressures out there, and there are demands to go to a circular economy and there seems to be a growing consumer base that\u2019s willing to pay for that. Now we just have to work out what the value chain looks like. The second thing, on the consumer side is we have a waste problem, which none of us have our heads in the sand about. We have a plastic waste issue that needs to be resolved. And in order to drive that circular economy, we\u2019ve got to come up with a way to value the plastic waste so that it can come back into that feed stock supply. And that\u2019s probably the bigger challenge. I think we will come up with a way to do it. I think everybody in the value chain, that\u2019s part of the alliance that we\u2019ve put together, is trying to figure that out. But that\u2019s going to require some time and some things for us to work through. Meanwhile, the size of these projects that I\u2019m talking about are going to help us learn more about what the cost positions are, are going to help us learn more about what the customer acceptance is going to be for these products and what the price point for that will be. And I think in another year or so I\u2019ll have a better answer for you on what the relative values are. Neal Sheorey : Okay. Thank you, Jim. That concludes the Q&A. Thank you everyone for joining our call. We appreciate your interest in Dow. For your reference a copy of our transcript will be posted on Dow\u2019s website later today. This concludes our call. Thank you. Operator : And once again, that does conclude today\u2019s conference. We thank everyone for their participation.",

I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Neal Sheorey. Please go ahead, sir. Neal Sheorey : Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us to discuss the fourth quarter financial results for Dow. We\u2019re making this call available via webcast, and we have prepared slides to supplement our comments during this conference call. They are posted on the Investor Relations section of Dow\u2019s website and through the link to our webcast. Speaking on the call today are Jim Fitterling, Dow\u2019s Chief Executive Officer; and Howard Ungerleider, President and Chief Financial Officer. Please read the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the earnings news release and slides. During our call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding our expectations or predictions about the future. Because these statements are based on current assumptions and factors that involve risks and uncertainties, our actual performance and results may differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Dow\u2019s Forms 10-Q and 10-K include detailed discussions of principal risks and uncertainties which may cause such differences. Unless otherwise specified, all historical financial measures presented today are on a pro forma basis, and all financials where applicable exclude significant items. We\u2019ll also refer to non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures is contained on the Dow earnings release, in the slides that supplement our comments today and on the Dow website. On Slide 2, you\u2019ll see our agenda for the call. Jim will start with an overview of Dow\u2019s fourth quarter and operating segment performance as well as an update on Sadara. Howard will then move into a financial overview of the quarter, including details on our principal joint ventures and will also provide some comments on modeling guidance for the first quarter and full year. And finally, Jim will provide a review of Dow\u2019s performance against our 2019 targets and then close with our priorities for 2020. Following that, we will take your questions. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jim. Jim Fitterling : Thanks, Neal, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. Starting on Slide 3. The Dow team once again executed against our operational and financial playbook to close a pivotal year in the company\u2019s history. We captured growth, achieved another year-over-year improvement in cash from operations and delivered leading returns to shareholders. Our results showcased the resilience of our portfolio and our ability to leverage our core strength and our focus on delivering value to our customers and owners. Here are some notable highlights from the quarter. First, we continued to capture demand in key end markets, particularly those closer to the consumer. The trends in the fourth quarter mirrored what we\u2019ve seen all year : Solid demand in consumer-driven staples, offset by lagging or contracting demand in industrial segments and in applications related to big ticket items such as automobiles. Overall, excluding the Hydrocarbons & Energy business, we achieved volume growth of 2% in the quarter. Second, we continued to drive a lean cost structure. We removed more than $35 million of stranded costs in the quarter. And third, we remained focused on generating strong cash flow and utilizing our free cash flow in a balanced way, aligned with our capital allocation priorities. We generated $1.9 billion of cash flow from operations, up more than $500 million year-over-year. Our EBITDA to cash from operations conversion rose significantly to 110%, supported by the inflow of cash from the legal judgment judgment with Nova as well as the release of cash from working capital. These factors enabled us to execute more than $1 billion in deleveraging as well as return $600 million to our shareholders. I\u2019m proud of the Dow team\u2019s performance in the face of challenging industrial market and trade dynamics. Once again, we demonstrated our ability to control the things that we can control while pursuing growth opportunities in our targeted end market. And equally importantly, these results represent solid progress against the priorities we laid out a year ago, which I will review later in the call. Moving on to our segment results in the quarter. On Slide 4, Packaging & Specialty Plastics operating EBIT was $648 million. The benefits of stranded cost savings and volume gains in the Packaging & Specialty Plastics business were more than offset by lower polyethylene prices and reduced equity earnings. The Packaging & Specialty Plastics business delivered 4% volume growth, led by double-digit growth in Asia Pacific. We continued to see solid demand growth in our key packaging end market, including flexible food and specialty packaging, industrial and consumer packaging, and health and hygiene applications. Hydrocarbons & Energy reported both lower volume and price. Volume declines were primarily due to planned turnaround activity in Europe, which led to reduced hydrocarbon co-product sales. On slide 5, Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure operating EBIT was $221 million, primarily reflecting margin compression in polyurethane component as well as lower equity earnings largely driven by margin compression in MEG at the Kuwait joint ventures and in glycol ethers at Sadara. Industrial Solutions reported lower net sales, primarily driven by lower prices for chemical intermediate. Volumes also declined modestly, primarily in ethylene glycols, which was partly offset by growth in heat transfer fluids and pharmaceutical applications. The Polyurethanes & Construction Chemicals business reported modest volume growth driven by gains in construction chemicals applications, and this was more than offset by local price declines for polyurethane intermediates. And finally, on Slide 6, Performance Materials & Coatings operating EBIT was $233 million. EBIT rose year-over-year, in part due to lower cost in the Coatings & Performance Monomers business, which was impacted by an extended turnaround in the fourth quarter of 2018. Sales declined as a result of weaker local prices in all regions, primarily due to lower siloxanes prices. Consumer Solutions delivered flat volume versus the year-ago period. Growth in high-performance infrastructure applications globally as well as improved demand for siloxanes in Asia Pacific and the U.S. and Canada was offset by demand contraction in automotive and consumer electronics end markets. Coatings & Performance Monomers sales declined due to lower local prices and volumes. On a regional basis, coatings volume was primarily impacted by lower demand in the U.S. and Canada and Europe. Before I turn it over to Howard, I want to give an update on our progress at Sadara. As we mentioned last year, we had one remaining logistics service agreement to get signed by parties in the Kingdom in order to start the process of achieving project completion. I\u2019m pleased to report that the parties have reached agreement in principle and the official signing is imminent. And as a result, the remaining steps to achieve project completion are underway. As we\u2019ve discussed before, achieving project completion is an important milestone for several reasons. First, it formalizes Sadara as a fully operational venture. Second, it enables the parent guarantees that Dow has on Sadara\u2019s debt to be released. And third, Sadara will then move forward to reprofile its debt. The debt reprofiling is a critical next step for Sadara in providing the JV with enhanced financial flexibility. The JV expects these discussions to take place over the course of this year, and we will provide another update once they have more to share. Sadara offers an impressive suite of world-class assets, technologies and products. Both Dow and Saudi Aramco remain aligned as shareholders in getting Sadara to a self- sustaining financial position as soon as possible. Finally, as you look through our fourth quarter results, you will see that we recorded a write-down of our equity investment in Sadara. I want to emphasize that this action does not detract from our belief in the JV\u2019s ability to enhance its financial strength and achieve independence. Rather, it is a reflection of our view of the latest financial projections for the JV relative to the book value of our investment. I\u2019ll now turn it over to Howard to discuss our financial performance in the quarter and modeling guidance. Howard Ungerleider : Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 8. Net sales were $10.2 billion at the high end of our guidance range. Local price declined 12% year-over-year driven primarily by declines in polyethylene, isocyanates and hydrocarbon co-products. Currency decreased sales by 1%. Volume declined 2% year-over-year, largely driven by lower hydrocarbon co-product sales. Excluding the Hydrocarbons & Energy business, volume was up 2%, led by demand growth in packaging and construction chemical applications. Equity losses were $21 million. Operating EBIT was $1 billion. Tailwinds during the quarter included savings from stranded cost removal, contributions from new capacity on the U.S. Gulf Coast and improved earnings in the Performance Materials & Coatings segment. These gains were more than offset by year-over-year margin compression in our core value chain, lower equity earnings and higher planned turnaround costs. Operating EBITDA margins improved by 33 basis points year-over-year. And excluding equity earnings, it expanded 75 basis points. Our fourth quarter operating EBIT results also benefited by approximately $50 million from a few discrete project-related items. These included two items in our Industrial Solutions business, catalyst sales and a large concentrated solar power project. Below the EBIT line, we reported an unfavorable tax rate year-over-year and versus our guidance, resulting from a change in our mix of geographic earnings. Notably, we experienced a drop in earnings in Europe due in part to a reduction in integrated polyethylene margins as well as turnaround costs related to the planned maintenance outage at our cracker in the Netherlands. This was offset by favorable interest expense, D&A and share count. Operating EPS was $0.78. On a GAAP basis, we reported a loss per share due to significant items that totaled $3.92 per share. This was driven by several items in the quarter. We recorded a noncash impairment charge of $2.85 billion, which included a $1.75 billion write-down related to Sadara that Jim mentioned, as well as a $1 billion impairment of goodwill associated with the Coatings & Performance Monomers reporting unit. These write-downs were conducted following our annual financial projection reviews, which determined that the carrying values were higher than the fair values. Moving to cash flow. As we laid out at our Investor Day in 2018, we\u2019ve been applying a much greater focus on enhancing cash flow. And once again, the Dow team delivered a strong quarter on our cash metrics. We generated $1.9 billion of cash from continuing operations, which was driven by improvements in earnings-to-cash conversion supported by a more than $400 million release of cash from net working capital. Finally, we allocated our free cash flow in a balanced way, in line with our capital allocation priorities. We paid down more than $1 billion of debt in the quarter and returned $611 million to our owners, including the remaining $100 million of share repurchases left to achieve our $500 million share repurchase target for 2019. Turning to our principal joint ventures on Slide 9. Equity losses for the quarter were $21 million. This was primarily driven by lower results at our Kuwait joint ventures as a result of margin compression in MEG and polyethylene as well as reduced cracker and polyethylene margins at our Thailand JVs. Sadara reported a modest improvement in earnings as the benefits of volume gains and cost control more than offset price declines. Moving to Slide 10. We continue to provide modeling guidance on a sequential basis as we believe this is the most relevant way to explain the dynamics, given the current market conditions. We see first quarter being stable with where we ended the fourth quarter. As I mentioned before, we had some project-based items in the fourth quarter that benefited our results. After adjusting for those items, the key drivers are tailwinds from lower turnaround costs and normal seasonal recovery from the fourth quarter, headwinds from an ongoing third-party supplier outage near our Tarragona, Spain site; lower results in our JVs, primarily due to compressed spreads in Asia; and a nonoperational headwind from higher pension expense as a result of lower discount rates at the end of 2019. In Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment, we entered the year expecting overall stabilization with some regional recovery. With negative integrated polyethylene margins in Asia and European margins low as well, we expect price increases to gain traction from the low point at the end of 2019. If they don\u2019t, we expect high cost producers to come under pressure. And in fact, we\u2019ve already seen some competitors trim back rates in the fourth quarter for that very reason. The Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure segment will benefit from the lower turnaround costs compared to the prior quarter. However, as I mentioned, we\u2019re currently impacted by a third-party supplier outage near our Tarragona, Spain site, which has forced us to take some EO derivative capacity offline. And finally, in Performance Materials & Coatings, we expect siloxanes pricing to remain relatively flat with the fourth quarter. In Coatings & Performance Monomers, we expect a normal seasonal uplift in profitability. The core business performance, however, will be offset by higher planned turnaround activity at our Performance Monomers site in Texas. Turning to full year 2020 on Slide 11. There are several items for consideration as you update your models. We\u2019ve provided the income statement and cash flow items that we can forecast at this time. We expect our 2020 JV equity earnings to be lower than 2019, largely due to the averaging impact as key spreads did not bottom until the second quarter of 2019. We also anticipate planned turnaround spending to be flat year-over-year. And as I mentioned before, we expect higher pension expense of $125 million year-over-year, and we provided the estimated split of that headwind by segment. Below the EBIT line, we once again anticipate lower interest expense as a result of our lower debt level. We see our tax rate range moving higher this year as we\u2019re forecasting a change in our geographic mix of earnings, particularly due to lower earnings in Europe. And finally, our share count estimate includes base case share repurchases to offset dilution. Some selected guidance for cash items is included on the right and on the next slide, we have provided a review of our known cash upsides and downsides to give some context for our free cash flow optionality this year. So with that, let\u2019s turn to Slide 12. There is no change in our cash priorities for 2020. We remain focused on generating solid cash flow from operations and improving our cash flow conversion, and we will continue to prioritize our use of free cash flow between deleveraging, incremental CapEx targeting lower-risk growth opportunities and returns to shareholders. Our base case operating cash flow upsides and downsides are shown here. Cash upsides include reduced integration, separation and restructuring spending, slightly lower required cash contributions to our pension plans, interest expense savings and an inflow of cash from a fence-line customer for an ethylene capacity reservation fee, which we expect at the end of 2020. Regarding CapEx, we see our spending in a range of $1.5 billion to $1.75 billion this year, which gives us an additional $250 million to $500 million of flexibility to either apply toward our free cash flow priorities or pursue incremental growth investments. And given that there is still work ahead for Sadara, we\u2019re conservatively assuming that our contributions will remain flat with 2019. Downsides include a decrease in JV dividends as the JVs pay their dividends based on the previous year\u2019s earnings. Our base case does not assume any nonoperational cash inflows related to our remaining legal proceedings with Nova and therefore, we show a year-over-year decline. With that said, we continue to actively pursue resolutions in our favor on two items, reclaiming the tax withheld on last year\u2019s pre-2012 judgment and obtaining a judgment on the post-2012 case. The most important takeaway here is that we expect our cash generation in 2020 to leave us with free cash flow optionality. We have a few key priorities that will dictate how we deploy this cash. The dividend remains our number one priority. We are currently on the high side of our capital structure targets, and so deleveraging continues to also be a key priority as well as putting more investments into our businesses where we see lower-risk, quicker payback opportunities. Should market conditions show improvement, we could also lean more toward returning additional capital to shareholders. Further cash optionality could also come from nonoperational items. The items listed on this slide hold additional free cash potential of approximately $1 billion. All of these items are in motion, and we will continue to provide updates on them as we make progress. In sum, we\u2019re confident about our ability to deliver against our disciplined financial playback this year, and we will continue to deploy free cash flow in a responsible manner that balances our actions to improve our debt profile, strengthen our financial flexibility and reward our owners. With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Jim. Jim Fitterling : Thanks, Howard. Turning to Slide 13. Just over a year ago, we laid out to investors a clear set of near-term priorities for Dow that reflected our more focused, disciplined and market-oriented company. And in 2019, we delivered on these priorities. We controlled the factors in our control and we showcased our resilience. I\u2019ll spend the next few minutes highlighting the key progress we made in 2019 against our objectives, starting with Slide 14. Our focus on profitable growth helped us navigate the headwinds that we faced throughout 2019. Our U.S. Gulf Coast investments enabled top line volume growth in the Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment as well as bottom line contribution, thanks to the U.S. Gulf Coast\u2019s global cost competitiveness. Even in the midst of a year of market challenges, our packaging business grew volume year-over-year every quarter in 2019, which ultimately reflects our business\u2019 global competitiveness. Our silicones franchise completed 16 incremental growth projects, unlocking additional downstream capability and driving higher captive siloxanes consumption. This will continue to be our focus going forward as downstream silicones applications can deliver up to 1,000 basis points of margin uplift over commodity siloxane. We reached final investment decision on our flexible alkoxylation capacity expansion and signed a 10-year supply agreement with a key customer, and we announced plans to retrofit an ethylene facility in Louisiana with our new proprietary fluidized catalytic dehydrogenation technology to produce on-purpose propylene. Our digitalization efforts helped us improve our customers\u2019 experience. In 2019, we launched an expanded e-commerce portal on dow.com. We achieved nearly $3 billion of revenue on the portal in 2019, and we have plans to continue growing sales through this channel. Turning to Slide 15. We demonstrated a balanced and disciplined approach to capital allocation. First and foremost, we redoubled our focus on cash and improved our cash flow conversion to 78%, which was 37 percentage points above the conversion rate we had in 2018. In the fourth quarter alone, we achieved a conversion rate of 110%, as we benefited from a combination of operational and nonoperational cash improvement. We also prudently managed capital spending, responding to the softer market conditions by proactively cutting CapEx spending to $2 billion or $500 million below the target set at the beginning of the year. More importantly, we tilted our growth cap toward the highest return businesses, pushing forward our wave two investments in our packaging, silicones and industrial solutions businesses. These actions enabled us to deliver $3.8 billion of free cash flow in 2019 which we deployed to drive toward our capital structure targets and to reward our shareholders. We strengthened our debt maturity profile by paying down more than $3 billion of debt, and we conducted opportunistic liability management such that our next material debt maturity is not until the second half of 2022. We did all this while also delivering $2.6 billion to our shareholders through our strong dividend and share repurchases. Turning to Slide 16. We continue to reduce our cost structure. We achieved more than $600 million in cost synergy and stranded cost savings in 2019. This included more than $160 million of stranded cost removal and the completion of a $1.365 billion cost synergy program. As a result of streamlining and optimizing our organizational and management structure over the past few years, we closed 2019 at the headcount that we targeted at our Investor Day a little more than a year ago. These actions were also shaped by our enhanced focus on benchmarking, which brings me to our final pillar, best owner mindset on Slide 17. We followed through on our commitments to increase transparency and disclosure. We moved to ethylene market-based transfer pricing, shifted our primary profit metric from EBITDA to EBIT and disclosed our key product capacities. We enhanced our focus on benchmarking to develop a clear picture of our competitive position in the market and share that output with shareholders on a periodic basis. These were critical steps to drive towards best-in-class performance. On the portfolio management front, we completed a number of incremental transactions aligned with actions to clean up and simplify our footprint. During the fourth quarter alone, we shut down a polyurethanes facility in Australia as well as a coatings manufacturing facility in the U.S. We transferred ownership of a coatings emulsion plant in Germany to Trinseo. We sold our acetone derivatives business and associated assets, site infrastructure, land and utilities in West Virginia to ALTIVIA; and finally, we sold our La Porte, Texas site. In summary, we did what we said we would do. And the framework we used in 2019 applies once again to our priorities in 2020, which we outlined on Slide 18. In terms of growth, even though we plan to keep our capital spending restrained, we will still progress our suite of higher-return, lower risk growth investments. On the immediate horizon, we expect the two new furnaces at our Texas-9 cracker to come online by the middle of second quarter 2020, with commissioning projected to start toward the end of first quarter. This will bring the cracker\u2019s capacity to two million metric tons, making it the world\u2019s largest ethylene facility. And today, we\u2019re announcing plans to incrementally expand capacity at our ethylene facility in Western Canada by approximately 130,000 metric tons with the addition of another furnace. Dow will co-invest in the expansion with a regional customer, evenly sharing the project costs and ethylene output. This expansion leverages our unique cost-advantaged feedstock position in Western Canada. The additional ethylene will be consumed by existing polyethylene assets in the region, making the investment immediately accretive once it comes online in the first half of 2021. Dow will fund will fund this project within our stated CapEx spending targets. We also have more incremental silicones investments on deck in 2020 as we\u2019re targeting another 12 debottlenecks this year. We expect to complete stranded cost removal by capturing the remaining $140 million of savings, and we\u2019ll also focus on continuous productivity, not only in terms of cost, but also manufacturing efficiencies. As Howard mentioned earlier, we have plenty of operational and nonoperational cash flow actions that we are pursuing. Finally, we will continue to apply a best owner mindset to all we do. The Dow team continues to evaluate additional incremental footprint cleanup options, much like the ones we completed in the fourth quarter of 2019. We will provide updates through the year as we have information to share. Before I wrap up my comments, I will provide our current outlook, which is on Slide 19. Many of our key product lines were challenged throughout 2019. However, our advantaged positions on the cost curve, global diversification and differentiated products have allowed us to continue capturing volume growth around the globe. So far in 2020, we have seen similar conditions to those at the end of 2019, but the dynamic is now beginning to shift. As macro conditions weakened into the end of 2019, third-party industry reports indicated that high-cost producers in many chains were struggling with breakeven or negative cash margins. For example, in polyethylene, capacity in Europe and Asia that utilizes naphtha feedstock, which represents a significant amount of global capacity, was at zero or negative margins for much of the fourth quarter. MDI spreads around the world have continued to bounce around what we believe are breakeven levels and siloxane prices in China have also hovered at breakeven levels for at least the last six months. For these reasons, third-party industry reports have suggested that producers with fourth quartile cost position are considering or implementing rate cuts or extending planned turnaround. And in the past few months, we have seen public announcements by some producers delaying new capacity additions. And with inventory levels normalizing in some of our chains, we see a good environment for an inflection to gain traction. In our view, it is still too early to claim sustainable improvement. And in fact, it could take some time for the dynamics to play out. But that said, we are seeing early signs that support gradual improvement in the near-term from the lows that we reached at the end of 2019. So to close on Slide 20. As we enter 2020, we are taking a conservative view given the macro and micro trends that we are seeing. Recent trade resolutions should be a positive for sentiment, but it may take some time before we see this translate into improved fundamentals. Even after the Phase 1 U.S.-China agreement, a majority of the original tariffs are still in place, which will continue to weigh on supply chain as well as consumer and investor sentiment. As such, the same discipline that we showed in 2019 will guide our actions in 2020. We\u2019re not counting on end market conditions to determine our success. Rather, we have a suite of actions and advantages within our control. We will continue to be financially disciplined. Our portfolio will remain competitive, thanks to our operational and footprint advantages. We will continue to generate strong free cash flow and responsibly allocate that capital along the lines of our priorities, and we will continue to institute self-help measures. These factors will serve us well as our end markets stabilize and reset. And just as important, they put us in the best position to continue serving our customers and rewarding our shareholders. Now, I\u2019ll turn it back to Neal to open the Q&A. Neal Sheorey : Thank you, Jim. With that, let\u2019s move on to your questions. I would like to remind you that our forward-looking statements apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. Operator, please provide the Q&A instructions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question we\u2019ll hear from Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets. Arun Viswanathan : Thanks. Good morning. I\u2019m just curious, it sounds like basically, you\u2019re seeing a potentially supply-driven inflection point, there is maybe some rate cuts by competitors on the motivation of weak margins. I guess I\u2019m just worried that if demand does improve and we see some slight improvement, industrially speaking, would that prevent some of these supply shutdowns going forward and kind of crimp up the recovery that you're potentially seeing? Maybe you can just offer some thoughts on how that materializes over the next couple of quarters? Jim Fitterling : Good morning. We\u2019re on this Jim, thanks for the question. I think what we saw and what we've seen out of the third-party reports is that you had some fairly significant deltas on cash margins for some of the \u2013 especially Naptha producers in Asia and a little bit in Europe, too. In fact, we got to a couple of periods in the last several weeks where it was negative to as much as $0.10 to $0.12. So that\u2019s a lot to absorb if you're at the bottom of the cycle. So I'm not sure that we would see it all come back on, but you can always bump around here a little bit.  I would also point back to \u2013 we had very strong demand in plastics. So plastics was up 4% in the quarter. Four consecutive quarters of volume growth in plastics. So I think demand is out there, and I think our cost positions are good. And that's really what's helped us out. All the investments we made over the last five to seven years really brought us down on the cost position, feedstock flexibility as well as just the lower cost of the crackers, and that's what's going to help us navigate through here. Operator : Then next I\u2019ll move to Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global. Hassan Ahmed : Good morning, Jim. A two-part question on China. First, obviously, relatively new news about this plastic ban. How should we be thinking about that? And again, early days, but what are your thoughts about the demand impact from the coronavirus? Jim Fitterling : Thanks, Hassan, for the question. First, on the plastics ban. From a Dow perspective, we don't produce materials that go into most of those products that were banned. So straws and lightweight ag films and some of the T-shirt bags is not a market for us. Most of what we're selling into China goes what we're selling into China goes into more durable packaging, goes into flexible food packaging, and that demand continues to be strong. Health and hygiene markets obviously continue to be strong. Nonwovens is a big market for us as well. On the coronavirus. I had the experience to live there during the SARS epidemic, and it feels like to me, what we went through during the SARS time period. You're seeing an impact on tourism, people staying at home, people not going to restaurants. The service industry gets hit a little bit. People may be making a run at the grocery store to stock up on things. You're seeing some pull on demand on things like materials that are going into household cleaners or disinfectants, nonwovens that are going into masks or wipes. So we're seeing some of that pull on demand. And I know our counterparts at DuPont are also seeing that. For example, on pull on some of their nonwovens and their surgical masks and things as well. Once we figure out how to treat this, things will start to return to normal. And I think it took us in SARS a few weeks to really, WHO and CDC, to figure out how to treat it, and then everybody started to kind of get back into normal life. Customers have not gone back from Chinese New Year yet. So when I talked to the businesses yesterday, they're still seeing customers take an extended Chinese New Year. But I would imagine in another week, they're going to have to go back because demand for some of their products is starting to pick up, too. Operator : And next we\u2019ll move on to Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Vincent Andrews : Thank you. And good morning everyone. Just to come back to the Asian margins on polyethylene. It seems that we've noticed is that a lot of the negative margin has come from the increase in the naptha feedstock cost rather than a decrease in the price of, I guess guess, spend slightly weak. So oil prices have been flat. So can you give us an assessment of what's going on in the naptha market. And what would happen if naphtha prices retreat, but PE prices, therefore, don't improve in terms of the sort of expectation for a recovery in the first half? Jim Fitterling : Thanks Vince. Good morning. That\u2019s a good question. And I do agree with you that, that naptha movement up and down is a big contributor to what we saw happen with those margins, both in Europe and in Asia Pacific, the Asian pricing has been stable. So that's been a good thing, even at the end of the year. And typically, at the end of the year, you would see people doing some destocking, you might expect that product to get depressed, but it held up pretty well. But I think it's holding up well because the breakeven costs over there are much, much higher.  So if we're running at the bottoms right now on Asia and on Western Europe, and we've still got this advantage on Canada, Argentina, U.S. Gulf Coast. I think it speaks to the fact that the high cost producers are going to be under pressure for a while. And I think that's why the third-party reports are out there saying people are pushing out expansion. People are talking about shuttering in some capacity. We'll see how that develops.  The other thing I would mention is that, typically, in March to June, that's the heavy turnaround season for ethylene. And usually, historically, you have about 8% of the capacity offline. A lot of the third-party reports that are out there right now and turnaround activity have as much as 15% of that capacity offline. So I think as we go through the quarter and some of that capacity comes off, we're going to see some opportunity there for some pricing and margin expansion. Operator : And next we\u2019ll hear from Jeff Zekauskas with J.P. Morgan. Jeff Zekauskas : Thanks very much. And what was the \u2013 is the $500 million that you plan to put into Sadara optional on your part? Or was it part of a contractual obligation? What's the theory behind the additional investment? And are there any obligations that you'll face in 2021? Or is this the end of the end of the investment? Howard Ungerleider : Hey Jeff, good morning. This is Howard. That $500 million is what we had to put in last year. As you look at Sadara, where we are in the cycle with chain margins and polyolefins, and isocyanate, they've got enough cash flow that they're generating to cover their own costs and to cover their interest expense. But the project was project financed, and that project financing all is now that the project is fully operational, the principle is coming due, and they don't have enough cash to generate to pay all of that principle. So that $500 million is roughly our expectation that 2020 conservatively will look like 2019. And in 2019, we had to put in $500 million, which was our 35% ownership of the principle. And so what we talked about, what Jim talked about on the, I think, in the prepared remarks, is that we've got agreement in principle now on the last logistics agreement to \u2013 that's the last remaining step, signature of that document is imminent. At that point, we will have achieved project completion. And then we \u2013 Sadara will work with the support, obviously, of both Dow and Aramco to reprofile the debt with the lender group. And so that's our focus. Our expectation is that will take us through the better part of this year to get that done. So conservatively, for modeling purposes, we said, look, we'll put the $500 million in there just to \u2013 as a precaution. Operator : And moving on, David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank will have our next question. David Begleiter : Thank you. Jim, just looking back on Q4, just a two-part question. First, PM&C. Can you just comment on how it was so strong given some weak siloxane margins? And second, the $60 million of catalyst sales and other benefits, solar fill benefits, were those expected to be realized in the quarter when we last spoke back in October, November? Thank you. Jim Fitterling : So thanks Dave. A good question. One of the main things we had was we had lower cost this fourth quarter than last year because there was a turnaround fourth quarter of 2018, and we didn't have that in the fourth quarter of 2019. We also saw lower propylene raw material costs. So we had PDH out in turnaround and propylene prices actually came down pretty significantly. So that rolled through on the acrylics chain. So you see some of that impact. We did get some margin expansion. So we saw siloxanes pricing slightly improve, and we also saw some volume gain in siloxanes versus what we had expected. And to your point on the two onetime things, catalyst and the solar fill. We had expected those to come. You never know exactly when the timing of those is going to happen because they're capital of those is going to happen because they're capital projects. So when the solar fill charge comes when they tell you, hey, deliver the material, we're ready to load up the plant, and that just happened in the fourth quarter. So I think that one, you can look at and say that one wasn\u2019t expected in Q4. Operator : And we\u2019ll move on to Jonas Oxgaard with Bernstein. Jonas Oxgaard : Good morning guys. I was wondering if we could talk a little bit about your capital policy for 2020. As far as I can tell, there's no buybacks in the guidance. But it does look like you should have some CapEx \u2013 or some cash left over. Am I missing something here? Jim Fitterling : Let me talk a little bit, Jonas, about how we're approaching CapEx and then I'll get Howard to talk about cash priorities for the year. So we're going to start the year here with a target of $1.75 billion of Capex. We'll keep all of our incremental high-return debottlenecks in place. Talked about the furnace add in Canada, that's on the capital list. The two furnaces that going on to Texas-9 will go into commissioning in March. So that's on \u2013 finishing up, that is on the capital list. About a dozen debottlenecks in siloxanes and the alkoxylation facility that we're putting in place to support that 10-year contract. Additionally, we're making the investment to retrofit FCDh into one of the Louisiana crackers, and that is really to be able to deliver propane-to-propylene economics at a much lower scale than PDH, but also do it with like 20% less greenhouse gas emissions, 20% less energy cost. So we're going to be able to really do PDH scale economics that we did over PDH 1 at 150,000 to 200,000 tons. That's a big breakthrough for us. And then that becomes a great licensing opportunity for us.  Now we paid down $3 billion of debt in the year. But we wanted to pay down a little bit more than that. So when we look at remaining capital, we have to keep it balanced between deleveraging and what we all want to do for share buybacks. And what's in the base case here is we will cover dilution. I think you'll see from our share count that we've been doing a good job of making sure that shareholders don't get diluted. So that's first priority. Howard, do you want to talk about the other priorities? Howard Ungerleider : Yes, thanks Jim. Good morning Jonas. I mean I think Jim covered it well. Our target that we laid out at Investor Day is to cover dilution every year at a minimum. So when we look at the margin compression that we had last year, and we look at the capital \u2013 we look at our capital structure targets over the economic cycle, we're on the higher end of that range. We did a very good job of doing $3 billion, as Jim said, of debt paydown last year, but we want to do a little bit more. So as we enter 2020, the primary focus after the dividend and after the $1.75 billion of CapEx is really to incrementally continue to delever with operational cash flows.  With that said, Jonas, and I think your point is very valid, and you look at the slide that we put out in the deck, we are a cash-generating machine. And so as we continue to drive higher cash flows. You can expect a balanced approach with additional debt paydown and additional shareholder remuneration. But we just felt like it was prudent, given the capital structure targets, to start the year with a preferred focus on debt paydown. Operator : And we\u2019ll move on to Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research. Frank Mitsch : Hey good morning folks. I want to come back to the Polyurethanes & Construction Chemicals business. You reported some positive trends on the construction chemical side. I was wondering how sustainable that was. And then again, on Slide 19, in terms of polyurethanes, you're showing MDI as having \u2013 the MDI spread as having bottomed in September, and so I'm wondering if you could talk about what your outlook is there. Are we going to flatten out? Or is this a sustainable sort of recovery there? Any sort of color there would be very helpful. Thank you. Jim Fitterling : Good morning Frank. I think on the MDI spreads, I think the current levels that we're at are probably sustainable. You could see some pressure down on some of that. But I'm hopeful with the U.S.-China deal done that that gets some confidence back in the markets and some of those downstream derivatives start to pull demand and that'll firm things up a little bit. As it comes to construction chemicals, we've seen good volume and good demand in the housing side. And I think it's held up better for longer than we had expected. It's going into a wide number of applications, which has been good. And it's offset good. And it's offset some softness that we've seen in some other parts of the PU business, for example, systems into automotive and into furniture and bedding. You don't think of it, but sometimes a mattress is a high-ticket item. But they were under some pressure because of the price of a mattress, it's one the things that consumers, if they're tightening the belt a little bit, will kind of slow down purchases on. But no, construction looks good, and I think we're off to, with the weather, we're off to a pretty reasonable start to the year. Operator : And next up, we'll have Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Steve Byrne : Yes thank you. I wanted to ask you a little bit about your best owner mindset. What's your long-term view of the value proposition of your key joint ventures? And is your ownership of those the best use for Dow? And then also related to this best owner mindset. I was curious as to whether your recent benchmarking analyses has identified any new opportunities for you for a headcount reduction. You mentioned the e-commerce platform is gaining traction. Is that an area where you think that might ultimately lead to trimming the sales force? Jim Fitterling : Yes thanks Steve for the question. On joint ventures, we do joint ventures for several reasons. The three key joint ventures that we have today, we have strong partners with, and they were for the reason of market access and to make sure that we had access to low-cost feedstocks. So when you look at that, you have to think about it in context of how do I serve the market with my customers if I don't have access to that partnership and that feedstock? Our priority on the ventures is we want them to be self-sustaining and self-funding and stand alone. That's why we're doing what we're doing with Sadara. The Kuwait joint venture is already in that spot. The Thai joint venture is also in that spot. And then they can \u2013 as they improve, they can yield dividends and pay back or they have the ability to fund their own growth as they move forward. All of our partners in the JVs are committed to that mindset, have the same mindset as we do. And obviously, what we need to do with Sadara is get through this debt reprofiling to get it in the best long-term sustainable solution. We're doing a lot of work on footprint. Most of that would be, think of divestiture work, like what we did in the fourth quarter, exiting a facility in a market that has declined, like Australia in polyurethanes was not competitive. Looking at our La Porte, Texas site, moving that capacity over to Freeport, getting off of that site, selling that site to somebody who really wants to come in and expand there. It's a good site. It's a good location. We only have one asset on that location. So we needed to make a change there. And then, obviously, we will look at product chains that inside Dow may not get investment money like we did with acetone derivatives in West Virginia. That's \u2013 there's a better owner for that business. And we're continuing to look at that. On digital, I believe digital is going to help us in two ways. If I look at the silicones business, Consumer Solutions, they are one of the most Sadara efficient businesses that we have. They're doing about $3 billion of sales through that digital portal. What they do then is they focus their Sadara capabilities on application development and very close customer contact. So they pull through a lot of demand through that chain. But what digital really does for us is help us get that end customer and that end-to-end signal back into our plants. So in polyurethanes, to give you an example, as we are able to get good demand signals, and that's a very complicated integrated chain through that polyurethanes chain, we can run the assets differently. In some cases, we can free up as much as 10% to 20% of incremental capacity off of an asset.  So it isn't just about Sadara. It's also about how we run the asset, how we get working capital out. We did $400 million of working capital out in fourth quarter by the old-fashioned way. When we get digital rolling, I think we're going to have the capability to see more working capital improvements. Operator : Next, we'll hear from John Roberts with UBS. John Roberts : Thanks. Congrats on an upside quarter. When you reprofile the Sadara debt, do you get paid back on these $500 million contributions right away? Or does that somehow get rolled into your investment in your equity? Howard Ungerleider : Yes good morning John. Hey, I don't want to have that negotiation with the lenders on this earnings call. What I would say, though, is I wouldn't expect that. I mean because that's been a historical principle. I really think our focus is really trying to get \u2013 to use Jim's words, to try and get Sadara to a cash flow self-sufficiency. So looking to the lenders and working with them to extend the tenors and/or to adjust the amortization tables, not to take a haircut. And that's our primary focus of what we're going to be working with them on. Operator : And Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse will have our next question. Christopher Parkinson : Thanks. Just a corollary to the question before. Can you just comment on your \u2013 any updates on your intermediate-term outlook for the MDI SD, just break out some key variables in the context of some capacity delays and so on and so forth. Just any update on your longer-term spread expectations. Thank you. Jim Fitterling : Yes. MDI, I think MDI's exposure in the marketplace, Chris, is basically in those areas that I talked about that have been a little bit slow, automotive; some of the more rigid polyols and so appliances, those things pull on the MDI chain. That's been what's been the softest. There have been announced delays in capacity expansion, which makes obviously a lot of sense given where we are in the market and the spreads. And there's enough capacity out there to satisfy the demand for a while. So I think you'll see these are not easy facilities to build and they're not easy facilities to operate. My sense is now that we've got a little bit of confidence coming back in after the trade deals and we start to see maybe some people seeing their way through higher demand if automobiles start to pick back up, you're going to see things tighten a little bit and these spreads have the potential to go up. Operator : And next up we\u2019ll hear from P.J. Juvekar with Citi. P.J. Juvekar: Yes, hi, good morning. A question on recycling. It seems that specialty and engineering plastics continue to grow while the commodity plastics come under pressure, your bags, your straws. How much of Dow's portfolio is in specialty category? And is there an update on recycling initiatives from the Alliance? And is it mostly focusing on recycling \u2013 mechanical recycling? And do you have any long-term view on polyethylene demand growth? Thank you. Jim Fitterling : Good question P.J. I would say our portfolio today is probably running around 40% of the higher-value materials. So all of our functional polymers business would be in that category. That's about 25% of what we sell out of P&SP today. And then another 15% on the high end of P&SP would be in things like health and hygiene products, et cetera, which are probably not in that same space.  Recycling and these bands have been targeted at low-end single-use, I would say, commodity types of materials. And people just aren't getting their heads around the need for behavioral change at the consumer level to make that happen. So what we're working on with the Alliance, we now have more than 46 members in the Alliance, and it's growing every day. We're focusing on chemical recycling back to feedstock so that we can make recycled plastic out of taking the plastic, going back through chemical recycling and back through the cracker and the plastics plant. We're looking at mechanical recycling and going into high-volume applications like construction materials, pallets, crates into asphalt for roadways, any number of those applications, they're going to be waste-to-energy facilities. There's a large facility right now in Indonesia, 500,000 tons, mixed-use recycling, waste-to-energy, chemical and mechanically recycling both. We have several projects like that with the Alliance. We have a project with Nobel Prize laureate, Muhammad Yunus, working on a Zero Plastic Waste City in India, showcasing what can be done there.  You're seeing, across the board, tremendous amounts of recycling activity. One of our customers, Sealed Air, just announced that they've taken bubble wrap to post-consumer recycle. We launched AGILITY CE last year, which is up to 70% post-consumer recycled material. You're going to see that go into things like collation shrink for water bottles or beverage cases. And we're getting it into a whole host of other applications.  So this has taken off in a big way. Big announcements, like Nestle saying they're going to spend $2 billion to buy post-consumer recycled packaging, are great because we need that demand pull on the chain to make this work. Operator : And next up, we'll hear from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Don Campbell : Good morning this is Don Campbell on for Bob. Quick question on your U.S. cracker fleet. We saw propane prices come up in the fourth quarter. So I'm curious on kind of your ability to flex your U.S. cracker fleet in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter. And then in early January, I think \u2013 or thus far in January, propane prices have come back in. So I guess kind of what your ability is to flex in the first quarter relative to the fourth quarter? Jim Fitterling : Yes, a good question Don. We have the ability to flex \u2013 we can flex every day, but that doesn't sometimes make sense. But every week, we're looking at the flex that we need to take. Ethane has been in rejection here recently. So it's been advantaged. But there were periods in the fourth quarter where our variable costs from cracking propane were extremely low and butane has been in the mix all year as well. I'd say, with what's going on with TPC and the C4s, we're watching butane because we create a lot more C4s out of that that, and so we don't want to get ourselves into a jam on C4s. But propane has been advantaged. Propane advantage is a big advantage for Dow because we have more flex in the industry. We can crack up to 70-plus percent propane in the fleet in the U.S. Gulf Coast. And it's been an advantage for Europe as well. So we've been able to crack LPGs all through the fourth quarter, and we're cracking now in Europe. Operator : And we'll move on to John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets. John McNulty : Yes thanks for taking my question. With regard to the silicone's debottlenecking, the new furnaces at Texas-9. Can you kind of ballpark the opportunities in terms of the earnings add that, that can give you this year? And then also, do you have any incremental cost-cutting or efficiency levers that you can pull just given the difficult backdrop? I know you have a little bit of the \u2013 still working on cutting out some of the costs tied to stranded costs from the separation, but anything beyond that, that we should be thinking about? Jim Fitterling : Good morning John. We've got another $140 million of stranded costs to come out this year, and we're well on track to deliver that number. And we're obviously looking to liberate more out of working capital, as I talked about and get that cash and some nonoperational things like the remaining settlement of the 2013 to 2018 part of the Nova litigation case, which will come in there. We're doing a lot with all the businesses and functions on what we can do for efficiency. So in fourth quarter, leveraged services in Dow was down 13% in terms of cost. So they're wringing a lot of efficiencies out. Digitalization will help that, and I think that will be a difference. I'll throw it to Howard. Do we have a number on Texas-9 and on Canada? Howard Ungerleider : Well, we didn't give a number this morning on the Canadian except for the capacity, John. So what I would say is you take 130,000 tons of ethylene, we're going to use our portion of that. We're not all of that. We're going to use our portion of that to make additional polyolefin. We've got the reactor capacity already there, and so that's going to be the primary focus. The other thing that I would say that wasn't in Jim's list is $1 billion of cash that we'll get back from the lower transaction costs. We spent almost $1.2 billion in cash last year to finish the DowDuPont spin \u2013 spinout for Dow, and that \u2013 we'll get $1 billion of that back this year and then another $200 million in 2021. Operator : And that will conclude today's Question-and-Answer Session. At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Neal Sheorey for any additional or closing remarks. Neal Sheorey : Thank you everyone for joining our call. We appreciate your interest in Dow. For your reference a copy of our transcript will be posted on Dow\u2019s website later today. This concludes our call. Have a great day. Operator : And that will conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.",

I would now like to turn the call over to Colleen Kay. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am. Colleen Kay : Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us to discuss the first quarter financial results for Dow. We\u2019re making this call available via webcast, and we have prepared slides to supplement our comments during this conference call. They are posted on the Investor Relations section of Dow\u2019s website and through the link to our webcast. I am Colleen Kay, Investor Relations Vice President for Dow and joining me on the call today are Jim Fitterling, Dow\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Howard Ungerleider, President and Chief Financial Officer. Please read the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the earnings news release and slides. During our call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding our expectations or predictions about the future. Because these statements are based on current assumptions and factors that involve risks and uncertainties, our actual performance and results may differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Dow\u2019s Forms 10-Q and 10-K include detailed discussions of principal risks and uncertainties which may cause such differences. Unless otherwise specified, first quarter 2019 historical financial measures presented today are on a pro forma basis, and all financials where applicable exclude significant items. We\u2019ll also refer to non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures is contained in the Dow earnings release, in the slides that supplement our comments today, and on the Dow website. On Slide 2, you\u2019ll see our agenda for the call. Jim will begin with the first quarter highlights, share details on Dow\u2019s response to Covid-19 and discuss the operating performance of the segments. Howard will provide an update on Sadara, then move into a financial overview of the quarter, and provide our modeling guidance. And finally, Jim will close with some remarks on key factors that differentiate thereof. Following that, we will take your questions.  With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jim. Jim Fitterling : Thank you, Colleen, and thanks, everyone for joining us this morning. Before we begin, I\u2019d like to first recognize Neal Sheorey for the tremendous role he has played in our Investor Relations team over the past four years. We are glad to have him leading our Coatings & Performance Monomers business. And also a very warm welcome to Colleen Kay, who succeeded Neal as our new Investor Relations Vice President this quarter.   Starting on Slide 3, I\u2019ll begin with some notable highlights from the first quarter. We delivered net sales in line with our adjusted guidance. As we met strong demand in our consumer staple non-durable application, such as food, health and hygiene, packaging and surfactants and solvents for cleaning products.  Our volume excluding Hydrocarbons & Energy declined 1% reflecting the impact of reduced economic activity in China with the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic and containment interventions. Our volume in China was down 25% sequentially as seasonal decline due to the Chinese New Year was intensified by the sudden demand reduction due to the virus.  Cash flow was again a noteworthy headline. We generated a solid $1.2 billion in cash from continuing operations, a 79% conversion of operating EBITDA to cash from operation and our free cash flow increased by $240 million year-over-year. This was underpinned by three actions. One, our quick response to shifting trends in global energy prices and regional demand, which enabled us to liberate cash from working capital. Two, tight capital and expense controls including more than $30 million in stranded cost savings. And three, a non-operational cash inflow as we recovered a $259 million tax withholding from the Canadian Tax Authorities related to the 2019 judgment against Nova.  We ended the quarter with approximately $12 billion of cash and available liquidity and we took further actions to reinforce our financial strength and flexibility. Early in the quarter, we opportunistically executed a 2.25 billion euro-denominated debt issuance, achieving a weighted average coupon of about 1%.  We immediately used the proceeds to repay debt, extend our debt maturity profile and reduce our financing costs. As a result today, we have no major long-term debt due until the second half of 2023. And finally, we did all of this to also prioritizing returns to our shareholders. We returned nearly $650 million to owners through our industry-leading dividends, as well as opportunistic share repurchases.  The quarter presented us with unprecedented headwinds and we responded by flexing our operational and financial capabilities to protect our employees and facilities, meet customer demands and fortify our financial position.  This brings me to our Covid-19 pandemic response on Slide 4. I am incredibly proud of the determination and resilience shown by the Dow team. For the many heroes on the phone lines helping to ensure the health and well-being of our communities around the world, thank you.  These are unique and trying times for every one of us and it has been inspiring to see the global community rally together to help solve this challenge.  The Dow team has our share of heroes as well, particularly those employees on the front-line who have kept our operations running, staying close to our customers, and adapting with their needs and making sure that our essential products needed around the world are still flowing from Dow plants to our customers\u2019 gates. In these challenging times, Dow people are at their very best and most resourceful. Turning to Slide 5, safety is always our first priority at Dow and protecting the health and safety of our employees and communities is the first thing we did. We rapidly deployed our crisis management framework and activated site-by-site plans to maintain business continuity and secure, safe, reliable operations.  Today, two-thirds of our workforce is working from home and Dow sites continue to operate with reinforced health, safety and security protocols, in fact, close to 100% of our sites are operational. In addition, our business and government affairs teams are working with Federal, State and local officials and agencies to share best practices and help unlock solutions to enable the continued flow of critical goods and products, as well as recommendations for how to get the economy reopen safely.  Moving to Slide 6, as an industry considered essential to global infrastructure, the chemical industry and Dow have a critical role to play. We\u2019ve remained agile by modifying our manufacturing processes and product wheels to meet increased demand for all materials used to produce disinfectants, PPEs, food ingredients, and packaging.  We\u2019ve adapted five Dow sites around the world to produce hand sanitizers for donation to local hospitals and other healthcare organizations. And just recently, we\u2019ve developed a simplified face shield design, to help protect healthcare professionals on the frontline.  We collaborated internally to produce and donate 100,000 face shields to Michigan hospitals and we also made the innovative design openly available to fabricators around the world in order to help accelerate production rates of critically needed PPE globally.  These are just a few examples of how Dow is utilizing our material science expertise to combat Covid-19, which is spurring new innovation ideas for the future. Moving to Slide 7, we understand the extreme stress with these unprecedented times plays on our communities and people. So we\u2019ve committed $3 million to Covid-19 relief efforts for immediate support and to build community resilience in the recovery phase.  The outpoint of support from our workforce has been inspiring and we\u2019ve given them creative ways to provide their time and expertise above and beyond the things that they are already doing to help Dow and our customers.  I\u2019ll close my comments on the first quarter with a quick review of our segment results on Slide 8. Packaging and Specialty Plastics operating EBIT was $580 million, down from the year ago period. The benefits of consumer-led packaging demand growth and additional stranded cost savings were more than offset by lower polyethylene and global energy prices, as well as reduced equity earnings.  The Packaging and Specialty Plastics business delivered a 1% volume growth supported by strong end-market demand, particularly in health and hygiene, rigid packaging and flexible food and specialty packaging applications. The business delivered volume gains in Asia Pacific versus the year ago period despite the demand reduction in China from the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic.  Hydrocarbons & Energy reported both lower volume and price. Volume declines were primarily due to reduced ethylene sales from increased internal derivative consumption. Industrial Intermediates and Infrastructure operating EBIT was $175 million, down from the year ago period, as demand growth in the Industrial Solutions business was more than offset by market compression in polyurethane application, as well as equity losses.  The segment also benefited from lower year-over-year planned maintenance turnaround costs. The Polyurethane and Construction Chemicals business reported lower net sales, primarily driven by a lower global energy prices and decreased demand, particularly in furniture and bedding, automotive, appliance and aircraft deicing applications. Industrial Solutions reported volume growth supported by strong demand in surfactants and solvents using cleaning applications, volume grew at all geographic regions, except EMEA, which reported a modest decline.  And finally, Performance Materials & Coatings operating EBIT was a $162 million, as volume growth in Coatings end-markets was offset by a decline in silicones applications and local price decreases. Consumer Solutions reported demand growth in upstream siloxanes and home and personal care end-markets in the U.S. and Canada.  However, these were more than offset by volume declines in other regions, which included the impact of Covid-19 in Asia-Pacific.  Coatings & Performance Monomers reported volume growth primarily driven by increased demand in Performance Monomers. Coatings volume grew in the U.S. and Canada, led by road markings and wood coatings, but was more than offset by reduced architectural coatings demand in Asia-Pacific and EMEA driven by impacts from Covid-19.  Finally, I want to showcase the swift and early actions the Dow management team continues to take as these unprecedented events play out. We are actively working to preserve our financial strengths and flexibility, while also maintaining business continuity and still to-date, we are announcing another set of proactive measures, which are summarized on Slide 9.  Let me be clear, Dow\u2019s operational and financial playbook have put us in a very good position. The actions we are announcing today build upon our focus to provide additional agility, drive cash generation and adjust our spending to current reality. To that end, the following near-term interventions are already underway and we will gain momentum as we move through the remainder of the year.  We have targeted a further $500 million release of cash from working capital. We are reducing expenses by $350 million and we are decreasing our capital expenditures target to $1.25 billion, a reduction of $750 million versus last year. We are achieving this further reduction in a way that we\u2019ll maintain our long-term competitiveness and our most attractive growth projects.  Also, we are taking actions to idle facilities or reduce operating rates in line with demand trends in the U.S., Europe and Latin America. We are working with our customers to get orders placed with enough lead times, so that we can make the best asset decisions across our network and manage bottlenecks in the supply chain to deliver products where it\u2019s needed.  In Plastics, to balance production to current demand, we are temporarily idling three polyethylene and two elastomers production units for at least 30 days. The plants have an aggregate annualized capacity of approximately 2 billion pounds and are located on the U.S. Gulf Coast and in Argentina. This equates to approximately 10% of the business\u2019 global annual capacity. Our polyurethanes business has strong participation in Durable Goods segments, such as automotives, furniture and bedding, appliances and construction. These segments are being heavily impacted by government mandated shutdowns around the world, as a result, we are running our polyurethanes assets including propylene oxide and MDI at reduced operating rates.  And in silicones, we are running reduced rates across our global grid of siloxane trains and our Zhangjiagang production facility in China will remain down on an extended plant turnaround into May. We also benefit from full flexibility at our silicones finishing asset allowing us to quickly respond to demand in all formulated silicones applications around the world.  We are taking these actions with a thoughtful approach that will allow us to quickly respond as demand improves when economies around the world reopen, and while the timing and shape of a recovery remain uncertain these actions position Dow to emerge even stronger when the global economy rebound. With that, let me hand it over to Howard. Howard Ungerleider : Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 10, I\u2019ll start with an update on the key milestones reached at Sadara. On our last earnings call, we shared that Sadara was very close to signing its final logistics service agreement. I am pleased to report the JV has now achieved that milestone. This agreement was important as it was the final substantive step to project completion. As a result, Sadara and the JV partners have now begun the debt reprofiling process and are in parallel currently engaged in discussions with its lenders, we expect this dialogue to advance over the course of this year and we\u2019ll provide further updates as that unfolds.  While that financing discussion is progressing, Sadara is making good progress on executing its longer term operating structure improvements and from issue Dow remains on track with its planned loans to Sadara which remains in the range of $500 million.  Moving to Slide 11, net sales were $9.8 billion, at the company level local price declined 8% year-over-year driven primarily by lower global energy prices, currency decreased sales by 1%, volume declined 2% year-over-year or 1% excluding the Hydrocarbons & Energy business. Equity losses were $89 million, primarily driven by lower results at the Kuwait and Thai joint ventures. Operating EBIT was $843 million and operating EPS was $0.59. Positive drivers during the quarter included demand growth in food packaging, health and hygiene and cleaning applications on resilient consumer purchasing trends in response to COVID-19, as well as continued stranded cost removal.  These gains were more than offset by year-over-year margin compression, notably in the polyurethane and silicones chains, as well as lower equity earnings. Overall, the financial impact of COVID-19 and the substantial decline in crude oil prices was in line with our expectation of an approximately $200 million headwind in the quarter.  Moving to cash flows, we generated $1.2 billion of cash from continuing operations, and increased our free cash flow by $240 million versus the year ago period. Our earnings to cash conversion of 79% represent the significant improvement year-over-year.  All of these metrics were helped by a solid release of cash from working capital, lower transaction costs, as well as a cash inflow from recovery of $259 million from Canadian Tax Authority related to the 2019 judgment against Nova.  Finally, we allocated our free cash flow in a balanced way, in line with our capital allocation priorities. In addition to the dividend, we repurchased $125 million of our own shares, going forward as a prudent measure given the economic uncertainty, we are temporarily suspending our share repurchases for the balance of the year.  We will however continue to reevaluate this lever, in light of macro trends and our free cash flow generation. Moving to Slide 12, Dow remains well equipped to navigate the current environment and ensure our financial flexibility through the cycle. We ended the first quarter with nearly $12 billion in total liquidity including $3.6 million in cash and equivalents. In the first quarter, we prudently drew down $800 million on our uncommitted lines to further bolster our cash position.  Recall that last year, we extended our $5 billion revolver out to 2024 and importantly, all of our more than $8 billion of committed facilities remain untapped. With our solid liquidity position, we have clear capital allocation priorities to maximize value, ensuring safe and reliable operations continues to be our number one priority and financially, the dividend is our top priority followed by additional debt pay downs. In fact, over the past year, you see us take proactive liability management actions including over $3 billion of gross debt reduction in 2019 and extensions to our maturity profile and we continued this practice this past quarter.  We opportunistically tap the Eurobond market issuing 2.35 billion euro of debt at an all-in rate of approximately 1%. We used the proceeds to repay debt and further extend our maturity profile. As a result, today, we have no substantive long-term debt maturities due over the next three years. These actions have also benefited earnings as our net interest expense runrate is now more than a $100 million lower in 2019 and $200 million lower than 2018. As you can see, our financial strength and flexibility provides us solid foundation to navigate the current environment and you should expect us to continue being active and opportunistic in further fortifying our financial position.  Before I move into modeling guidance, I want to take a minute to discuss how we view the quarter ahead and the range of potential scenarios we are planning for. These are clearly uncertain and unprecedented times and due to the limited board visibility, we felt it\u2019s more critical that we provide an assessment using the best information available to us year-to-date how the second quarter and the rest of the year could unfold and the assumptions behind our range of potential outcomes.  Our forward guidance is based on a expectation that virus containment will continue in the coming weeks and the global economy will gradually and sustainably resume as the industries and businesses return to work and global governments take hold.  The progression of containment and recovery that we saw in China is now playing out in Europe and we expect similar patterns to evolve in the U.S. and other countries. For our quarter, our potential outcomes assumes that the second quarter will show the largest global economic and chemical industry impacts from COVID-19 and the collapse in energy prices.  Using China as a reference, our modeling guidance assumes recovery for Dow begins as economies reopen. Reports suggest that overall activity in China did improved quickly year-over-year in February to March, but improvements have been uneven across the industries.  Should the restart of the global economies be materially different than our assumptions, we intend to provide you with updates as the quarter progresses. With that being said, let\u2019s move to Slide 13, where we highlight adjustments for the full year items that we shared in January based on current realities. As Jim mentioned in his comments, our 2020 earnings should benefit from tailwinds of $350 million of expense reductions. We expect higher equity losses as our JVs also face similar trends as our core business.  And we now expect a higher tax rate to the shifts in the geographic mix of earnings in our core business, as well as lower equity earnings. To preserve flexibility in a slower macro environment, we have reduced our CapEx spending target by $750 million versus 2019. We will have a cash tailwind of more than $400 million related to lower integration and separation cost for the balance of the year.  And as I mentioned before, we have put further share repurchases temporarily on hold at least we until we get better visibility on cash flow.  Getting into the details of the quarter ahead, let\u2019s please turn to Slide 14. We see second quarter sales in the range of $7.5 billion to $8.5 billion on our assumption of demand reduction peaking the second quarter with the spread of COVID-19 and slowing the economic activity globally. We have outlined on the slide our current sales expectation by segment and on normal fashion. We are also providing quarterly this quarter along with high and low volume estimates. So you understand the range of scenarios we see as possible for each segment. This is an attempt to give you a level of forward visibility in a very difficult period to forecast. Let me please reemphasize though, these are estimates only.  As usual we were highlighting the key EBIT drivers in the quarter on a sequential basis. In the Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment, while we expect continued robust consumer-driven demand for our food, health and hygiene and packaging applications, we see this being more than offset by demand softness in automotive, and infrastructure applications, as well as lower average energy prices.  With the dramatic shift in oil dynamics, we expect naphtha cracking could continue its advantage which should support our European cracker margins, as well as keep demand relatively resilient there. And our actions in the Americas to idle capacity should help balance supply and demand until the economies around the world reopen.  In the Industrial Intermediates and Infrastructure segment, we are seeing high demand in the Industrial Solutions for our solvents and surfactants that make clean product effective to combat COVID-19. However, we expect that\u2019s only partly offset trough and DI spreads and weakness in end-market demand for our polyurethane products particularly in consumer durable, construction and automotive applications. And finally, Performance Materials & Coatings, we expect demand softness for industrial application in Coatings as well, as weakened fundamentals at our upstream siloxane and acrylics building blocks, which are experiencing the challenging pricing environment on new supply and demand fundamentals.  During the second quarter, we also anticipate that we will begin to see the positive effects of China continue this slowing reversal declines of the first quarter and as the global economy continues to come back online beyond the second quarter, we also expect to see these discrete impacts related to the virus begin to reverse globally.  I would like to just stress again that the near-term guidance since the year is based on our assumptions for how the COVID-19 containment and recovery could play out as we move through the second quarter and are based on the outlined assumption. Given the limited visibility, we will remain strongly focused on cash flow and protecting our enterprise priorities.  With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Jim. Jim Fitterling : Thank you, Howard. Turning to Slide 15, I want to emphasize several factors that we believe set Dow apart and support our competitive position. Given our more than a 120 year history, Dow has a strong track record of successfully navigating periods of uncertainty. And as a result, we have built competitive positions and asset flexibility to be prepared through situations like those that we are experiencing today.  We call these are points of distinction and today, I will highlight a few points that set Dow apart. On Slide 16, Dow\u2019s unmatched feedstock flexibility and superior product mix are key factors that underpin the higher and more resilient margins that we deliver across the cycle. We also have a geographic mix of assets to provide a structural hedge to feedstock dynamics.  For example, in today\u2019s environment, we are able to capture improved cracking margins in Europe and Southeast Asia, which offset some of the margin compression we see in other regions. We have a leading Packaging & Specialty Plastics portfolio with assets designed to be flexible, and adapt to feedstock volatility.  Our feedstock flexibility enables us to crack a wider mix of feedstock. For example, we have two to three times more propane capability than our peers. We can implement this at a furnace-by-furnace level in our crackers as heavier feedstock by naphtha become advantaged, another limitation could be co-products.  If not managed adequately, ethylene units may be forced to cut rates or switch feedstocks and we\u2019ve seen some signs of these strains in the industry as demand for co-products are tied to automotive and fuel end-markets which are currently experiencing weak demand. But here too Dow has advantages. We have aromatic processing units in Europe and on the U.S. Gulf Coast, which give us flexibility to consume and process pygas from the crackers.  We have capabilities of handling increased seaport strains from the cracker, which includes co-cracking to reprocess the seaport in our furnaces. In short, our feedstock flexibility and co-product management capabilities prove they work over the cycle time and time again and this period is no different. These capabilities preserve our low-cost to serve position regardless with which feedstock scenario is advantaged.  For the downstream, our product mix is another differentiating factor. Our mix of polyethylene and functional polymers products delivers a more resilient and higher margin profile, which begins to stand out in softer periods like we started to see in 2019 and we are seeing today. The benchmarking we delivered over the past two years has highlighted this performance as well. You can find our 2019 benchmarking data in the appendix of this earnings slide presentation and on Dow\u2019s investor website.  Another point of distinction comes from the market segments that we\u2019ve been targeting and the consumer orientation that we have in our products and solutions which I\u2019ll cover on Slide 17.  With our primary market verticals of Packaging, Infrastructure and Consumer Care, our business portfolio is tilted toward the consumer and in today\u2019s situation, we find that a substantial part of our business is essential to some of the most critical end-markets that consumers value. Related to the pandemic, Dow has a breadth of solutions that are in high demand. We see a strong poll in applications such as intermediates for clean products, pharmaceutical ingredients, packaging and non-wovens for gowns, wipes and masks and food packaging to secure the freshness and safety of our food supply.  These are moments when our material science expertise and technologies proved their work and play a significant role. For example, in the Pharmaceutical and Health & Hygiene markets alone, the following are examples of just some of the products enabled by material science innovation and our diverse set of chemistries.  Silicone technology that enable disposable gloves and tissues, detergents and hard surface cleaners, soaps and shampoos. Plastics that are vital for syringes, medical tubes, bio hoses, valves, device in pharma packaging, stripes, gloves and gowns. Polyurethane Solutions used for hospital beddings, rigid installation for medicine refrigeration and transport, and safety shoes.  Coatings applications for medical devices and tapes, portable water pipes, paper food packaging, and paper cuts. And our Industrial Solutions team recently found an innovative way to reconfigure existing underutilized assets to increase our volume of isopropyl alcohol by up to 50%. This is a critical raw material for hand sanitizers. Out of periods of change, new ways of living, working and staying healthy are developing across the diverse markets that we serve such as improving the performance, comfort and convenience of PPE, smart building and infrastructure solutions for multi-purpose status, restaurant takeout food packaging, all-in surface care solutions, and anti-microbials.  Dow\u2019s material science knowhow and strong design collaborations with customers can help enable new solutions to these developing market needs.  On Slide 18, the last point of distinction I want to highlight is the global scale of our operations. This is something we often take for granted, but the years far has emphasized just how much of an advantage it provides to our ability to meet customer demand, rapidly adjust and innovate, and take advantage of shifting downstream and upstream dynamics.  We have world-class manufacturing sites in every geography with well-developed agile, regional supply chain and a deep understanding of the needs of our customers in all of our markets. Our geographic diversity serves as a national hedge for our business operations and uniquely positions us to shine in times of crisis and uncertainty.  In fact, all of these strengths were on display in the first quarter as our teams rapidly worked through regional and global supply chain complexities, manufacturing limitations and shifting consumer trends. And as we move through the rest of the year, I see these strengths continuing to provide Dow with unique advantages.  Altogether, Dow\u2019s point of distinction, unmatched feedstock flexibility, a superior product mix, participation in critical end-markets and geographic diversity set us apart and give us a competitive edge today and throughout the cycle.  In summary, Dow is prepared for what\u2019s ahead. Our balance sheet is strong and we have plenty of liquidity to meet our obligations with no significant long-term debt due over the next few years. We continue to take proactive and thoughtful actions both operationally and financially with a focus on safety and cash flow, which we firmly believe will serve us well through this period.  We have unique points of distinction that differentiate Dow and position us for upside when the genomic recovery began. We have a remarkable team who continues to inspire and deliver every day and we are focused on navigating through this challenging time, emerging even stronger and continuing to execute our growth playbook.  With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Colleen to open the Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll take our first question from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Go ahead sir. Vincent Andrews : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. It sounds like everyone is doing well which is great. Maybe, I could just ask about how you are thinking about in Packaging especially Plastics, if you look at the price decline that you guided to for 2Q, could you just talk about how much of that\u2019s coming out of \u2013 do you think it\u2019s going to coming out of the U.S. market versus just the weak export market or the EU?  And how are you thinking about ethane and propane through the quarter? There has been some volatility in ethane over the last month and propane seems to be pretty stuck \u2013 being pretty stubborn relative to move in crude, so far. Thanks. Jim Fitterling : Yes, good morning, Vince. Everybody is doing great here. And thanks for asking. We hope you are too. Most of the pricing \u2013 and I think what you are seeing on pricing is that, you are seeing things kind of come to a global kind of a price right now and that you would expect that with what\u2019s happened. I think you are going to see a little bit more come out in Europe than in North America, little bit less in Latin America, and little bit less in the Pacific.  Actually, we started to see exports to China stepping up pretty dramatically. China has reduced the tariffs coming in and the Chinese economy is turning to rebound versus March. I would say, we start to see activity there in late March and through the month of April. So the industrial part of the economy is trying to get rolling again.  Consumer part still a little bit uneven. And then, obviously, we did what we did on supply, just to balance off demand. So, we had a good strong first quarter. Volumes were flat, slightly up in Packaging and Specialty Plastics. But we are going to see some impacts on volumes in the industrial part of the sector in the second quarter, which is why we tightened up some of the supply.  And that was primarily due to industrial shipping, industrial applications, automotive applications. We are starting to see the automotive industry talk about coming back here in the month of May and also in the month of May in Europe. So, hopefully, we will see them May, June turn in the economy on the industrial side here in North America, Latin America. Operator : And next we\u2019ll move to John Roberts with UBS. John Roberts : Thank you. And you all sound pretty well here, as well. So I am glad to hear that. Can you comment on other industry closures you might be seeing? We don\u2019t usually think of Dow\u2019s high cost although ethane is kind of flipped here currently, but, are we seeing other closures we haven\u2019t heard about yet from competitors in the marketplace? Jim Fitterling : Yes, John. Thanks for the question. We are not closing the high cost assets. We are closing the balance demand. So, look, all of these are reasonable cost assets, but the reality is, there has been a pretty significant amount of industrial capacity shutdown on the downstream. And so, we don\u2019t feel like in this environment, really ploughing a lot of material into inventory is the right thing to do. So, that\u2019s why we are dialing back the capacity. I have seen some delays and indefinite suspensions of projects, there was one this week in Ohio, the Thai project that was going to go ahead. So, we are starting to see some of those kinds of announcements. We are seeing reduced rates across polyurethanes, across the globe basically and we\u2019ve got polyurethanes MDI capacity down in China right now, not us, but competitors do.  Really to balance out the fact that downstream automotive and appliances and construction for insulation materials has been slow. So I think that\u2019s what you are seeing. I think it has less to do with the cost position and more to do with the supply demand. Operator : And David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank will have our next question. Please go ahead. David Begleiter : Thank you, Jim. On the same point, the idling of the Americas ethylene polyethylene plants, is you are efficiently influenced at all by the cost competitiveness of these plants given the recent drop in oil prices have not, are you concerned about losing any share to competitors who are not being as disciplined as you are? Thank you. Jim Fitterling : No, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll lose share, David. Actually, we were glad to say we were in share in the first quarter across our plastics business and ethylene costs are still very low in the U.S. Gulf Coast. So we haven\u2019t idled anything on the ethylene side. In fact, right now, probably 9% to 10% of ethylene production capacity is out on the U.S. Gulf Coast.  So we will balance that out. We\u2019ve been operating very well from a working capital standpoint and I think what we are trying to do here is, just make sure that we don\u2019t plough a lot of material into inventory until we see a good demand signal coming on the back-end. We are starting to get good signs. We are starting to get positive signs out of many states in the United States for a May opening. And some parts of Europe like Germany, Austria, Switzerland. And then, I think as confidence builds, testing comes along, people are going to be more certain about going back into manufacturing and consumers will be back in the market.  And at that point, it\u2019s easy to fire these polyethylene units back up and meet that demand. Operator : And next we\u2019ll move to Jonas Oxgaard with Bernstein Jonas Oxgaard : Hi. Good morning, guys. I have a follow-up on the previous question there. The 5% to 10% no ethylene that seems to be higher than the industry at average. How much of that is reselling your own inventory from TX-9? And maybe a sort of a hypothetical if TX-9 have not been down, do you think you would be forced to reduce rates more in line with industry average? Jim Fitterling : Yes. Thanks, Jonas for the question. Texas 9 is back up. So it\u2019s at the $2 million runrate right now. Most of that expansion on Texas 9 was for MEGlobal for their consumption for MEG, and so they\u2019ve been buying ethylene in the markets to really get themselves started and up and running. So this supply has been in the marketplace. And I haven\u2019t seen any reduction in volumes there. I think the other thing that\u2019s happening is, as you see in the automotive industry, go down, people that are cracking naphtha or cracking heavier don\u2019t have much place for some of the aromatics and some of the off grades to go. And so, the rubber industry has been slow. Automotive industry has been slow.  So that has brought rates down in some other crackers and then you\u2019ve had some more turnaround and outage in other crackers. So as we go into the quarter, we feel like the toughest quarter here is going to be Q2 and so, we want to make sure that we balance supply and demand through Q2 and position ourselves to be able to turn things back on and come up as the industry starts to come back. Operator : And we\u2019ll move on to Jeff Zekauskas with J.P. Morgan. Jeff Zekauskas : Thanks very much. What\u2019s your cash tax rate? Is it between 30% and 35% or is it lower or higher? And in the United States, how will your feedstock slate in producing ethylene change versus 2019? In 2019, what were your rough percentages of ethane, propane and naphtha? And what do you think that\u2019ll be this year? Jim Fitterling : Let me get to Howard to cover the tax rate, while I have to do some CEO math on your cracking question. Howard Ungerleider : I\u2019ll wait for you - the CEO math. Hey, Jeff. Good morning. So, look, the P&L tax rate that we published this morning for Q2 and for the full year is between 30% and 35%, slightly higher than what we had guided to earlier and really three issues, lower equity earnings, different geo mix of earnings and then some discrete items.  But I would say, on your question on tax. Tax is lower than that range. I would guide you to something in the mid-20s. Jim Fitterling : And to your question on cracking, Jeff, and I\u2019ll just focus on U.S. Gulf Coast here, because as for the bulk of a flexibility is, I would say, we were in the 75%, 80% ethane cracking through the year. The balance of the propane and butane and very little talk for the back half of the year is zero in naphtha. Naphtha has come down, but honestly, ethane is still the best crack. And so, if ethane gets tight and we start to see prices rise and propane comes into the slate, we will swing over to our propane flex. And it\u2019s you know, we can swing 70% of the capacity over to propane. So, we got that flexibility built in to what we are modeling and I am optimistic that this is a more resilient gas market than people are estimating. Operator : And we\u2019ll move on to Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global. Hassan Ahmed : Morning, Jim and Howard. I just wanted to sort of continue with this team of the feedstock side of things. Let\u2019s just assume for a second that the feedstock environment that we are in right now is the new normal in terms of roughly where crude oil pricing is.  This assertion that in this lower crude oil pricing environment, obviously, you will see curtailments and cuts on the shale side of things, maybe ethane is advantaged as it used to be. So now, sort of beyond the extreme near-term, if that is the feedstock cost environment, how do you see the second wave of cracker in derivatives sort of units play out?  I mean, in theory, the CTO, MTO side will not look that competitive and maybe naphtha looks a bit more competitive. Certainly, whoever has flexibility will be better off than those that don\u2019t. And then, you have this whole sort of notion of a lot of capacity in theory coming online eventually in China.  A lot of the facilities here in the U.S. just being pure ethane-based facilities. I mean, how do you see those \u2013 all of those sort of different factors playing out if feedstocks continue to act the way they have over the last couple of months? Jim Fitterling : Thanks, Hassan. That\u2019s a lot in that question. But I would say, right now, if things continued where they are today, we\u2019d say there is about 21 million metric tons, about 11% of C2 capacity is at risk. That\u2019s either due to age or the scale or the high conversion cost or their feedstock, cracking capability. I think one of the assumptions that everybody made was, naphtha coming down was that the whole world was going to switch to naphtha cracking.  But what people forget is that, you make so many byproducts on naphtha and there is no home for those byproducts. So those byproduct credits go away. At the end of the day, ethane and propane still remain the most competitive crack and we think that\u2019s going to continue.  The other assumption that goes into this then, is what happens to oil price and oil has responded to just an unbelievable slowdown in demand, which is primarily because we told everybody to stay at home and nobody is traveling. But what we are seeing in China is, people are going back, traffic rates in China, for car traffic and truck traffic are back up to 80% of what they were pre-COVID.  And I think when people come back here, they are going to come back into their cars. That\u2019s going to tighten up the demand side or the demand side on oil, at the same time some of these supply adjustments are going to come back in. So I am not predicting that we are going to go to this is the oil demand for the rest of the future.  I think if you look over a long, long time, that oil demand grows tracks population and what\u2019s going on around the world with the development of the economy. We\u2019ll get back to that. The question for everybody is just what\u2019s the timeframe?  Are people going to \u2013 if we get a test and we get a treatment, our people going to get optimistic and go back faster or is this going to take longer than people think. Howard Ungerleider : And Hassan, on your CTO, MTO question, I would say about $6.5 million of that $21 million is CTO, MTO, which with oil below 50 bucks that\u2019s \u2013 those are really stressed assets. Operator : And we\u2019ll move on to P.J. Juvekar with Citi. P.J. Juvekar : Yes, Jim and Howard. Good morning. Jim Fitterling : Good morning, P.J. P.J. Juvekar : Just a quick question again on this co-product. You mentioned that there is no demand for co-products and prices are coming down. How would that change naphtha margins? And then, can you compare today\u2019s ethylene margins in U.S. versus Europe? You are in a good position to do that. And any thoughts on new China ethylene crackers that were coming online. Thank you. Jim Fitterling : I think what we\u2019ve seen so far P.J. in terms of the cost curves on ethylene is that, naphtha has come down, but lighter cracking ethane propane cracking is still advantaged to $100 and more than $100 a ton. And so, that is a byproduct of the byproduct credits. And when you learn these naphtha crackers, typically, you are running them to produce ethylene and you take credit for all the byproducts that you sell in the market and net that back against the ethylene capacity.  When there is no margin on the byproducts, there is no netback credit. And so, that\u2019s what we are looking at is, there is no place for the sea ores to go, the butadiene demand is down, rubber demand is down.  And so, at some point, you flip those markets upside down and at that point, people just slowdown rather than crack more naphtha. So that\u2019s what we are looking at and I think that\u2019s what we are going to see play out. Operator : And we\u2019ll move to John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets. John McNulty : Yes. Thanks for taking my question. On the cost side, can you speak to the $350 million cost assets that you are looking to pull out, how quickly that can be phased in? And then, I guess, also in terms of the cost and efficiency improvements that you are looking for in Sadara, how can we be thinking about that play in through throughout the year, as well? And if that maybe expedited in any way? Jim Fitterling : Yes, let Howard can put a good timeframe to that. Howard Ungerleider : Yes, yes. Hey, John. Good morning. On the $350 million, I would say, I would look at about 20% of that realized in the second quarter and then, the 80% pretty evenly split between the third quarter and fourth quarter, maybe a little bit of a lighter third quarter and a heavier fourth quarter just as we continue to take those cost out.  Relative to Sadara, look these, if the naphtha margins hold, you\u2019ll actually see a margin expansion in Sadara as the second quarter progresses. And then on the cost out, the team continues to do a good job of reducing cost pretty evenly through the year.  In fact, if you looked at our equity earnings in the first quarter, it was a one JV that actually was flat or up on the same quarter last year or prior quarter basis and that\u2019s really because, they saw the same thing that all of the other JVs saw, which was some margin compression, because of the demand disruption. But they were able to offset that with the cost.  The other thing that they are also working on is just the sell up. Remember, we brought 26 operations on pretty much in about a twelve month period. So we sold them out. But now we\u2019ve got to sell them up until the teams are working on that and that\u2019s not going to be a one or two quarter activity. But that\u2019s over the course of about three or four years. Operator : And we\u2019ll move on to Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research Frank Mitsch : Hey. Good morning. And Jim, I\u2019d like to echo your appreciation and congrats to Neal and offer a warm welcome to Colleen. So, Dow has spoken in the past about multiple Monte Carlo simulations and I am not sure if you\u2019ve factored in a pandemic or a oil collapse in those simulations.  But here we are, if I am looking at the first half of 2020, we are running at a runrate below $6 billion in EBITDA. So, I guess, my question is, at what level decline in profitability do you start to get concerned about the dividend? And if you could offer any comments regarding that that would be very helpful. Jim Fitterling : Sure, let me have Howard do that, because he went through a tremendous amount of this work pre-spin as we came out of the spin. Howard? Howard Ungerleider : Yes, Frank, good morning. Look, we are really smart. I don\u2019t know that we factored in a pandemic into the Monte Carlo simulation. But let me use the current most bearish Wall Street number that\u2019s out there on our 2020 earnings around $5.1 billion, $5.2 billion of EBITDA. If you take out interest and taxes, that leaves you with about $4 billion. And then, from there you got a $2.1 billion dividend.  You\u2019ve got what we said today was $1.25 billion of CapEx and $500 million of Sadara. So, you\u2019ve got plenty of room even if that bearish number to do just with operating earnings and more than cover the dividend. We are also working on the non-operating side of the house.  So, part of our cash flow in the first quarter was the $250 million that we got from the Nova judgment, on the tax side, obviously, if earnings are that kind of depressed and oil was down, we are going to see at least a $500 million release in cash on working capital. And then, we\u2019ve got some of the other non-operating things that we are working on which is the all-in payments that\u2019s expected in contractually obligated at the end of the year of about $500 million. So, even at that level, we are more than comfortable and adequately able to cover that dividend and we\u2019ve got $12 billion of committed liquidity including $3.6 billion of cash on hand. Operator : And we\u2019ll move on to Chris Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Chris Parkinson : Great. Thank you. Can you just walk us through your various Sadara assumptions? Just regarding the structural op improvements you referenced and just also update us on your debt reprofiling discussions? Thank you. Jim Fitterling : Sure. Howard, do you want to hit Sadara, all our assumptions and our debt reprofiling? Howard Ungerleider : Yes, so, look, I mean, what we said in the prepared remarks this morning, we are very pleased that Sadara got that last remaining rail agreement, logistics agreement signed. That is the final substantive step to achieve PCD.  Now, we have a series of, what I would call administrative steps that Sadara has got to work through things like registration of their security docking until the lenders, verification of the project cost and some of those other things. Those should be well underway as we approach the end of the second quarter if not completely done. As a result of the logistics agreement being done, the Sadara, Saudi Aramco and Dow Treasury teams have jointly begun the lender reprofiling discussions. In fact, those discussions got actively started this week.  I would say, for modeling purposes, it\u2019s going to take the balance of the year to make that happen. You\u2019ve got ECAs in the mix, you\u2019ve got the co-financing and you\u2019ve got international banks. So it\u2019s going to be a complicated discussion.  And that\u2019s why we say look, $500 million of cash this year in line with last year makes sense from a modeling purpose standpoint. But we are pretty focused on making sure that we get that done by the end of the year. That is the goal. Jim Fitterling : And if you see, Chris, Sadara\u2019s first quarter results were relatively flat with last year. We are taking lots of actions Sadara and Aramco and Dow to make sure that they can continue to deliver performance similar to last year and we put into model $500 million which is our contribution to repayment of principal for the year. So that\u2019s how much cash we\u2019ll be looking at putting in this year. Operator : And we\u2019ll move on to Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Steve Byrne : Yes, thank you. I wanted to drill in a little more on the $350 million of cost cuts. Can you describe what functional areas and businesses these came from? And perhaps you can talk a little bit about the learnings from your benchmarkings analysis? Any specific productivity initiatives that have come out of that? Jim Fitterling : Yes, Steve. So let me try to hit it and then ask Howard if I miss anything to comment. So, it isn\u2019t - I think most people go to this and say that it\u2019s headcount-related. We have tried not to do that. Obviously, we\u2019ve got almost all of our plans learning today. So, we are trying to support our customers. We are idling some capacity. But we aren\u2019t laying off people in order to do that.  We\u2019ve cut discretionary spend and then obviously, big buckets of spend like travel and other things are near zero. And so, there has been a shift in some of the spending. We\u2019ve moved out some turnaround activity. Factories with it obviously some discretionary expense that goes along. And so, we\u2019ve looked at different types of activities like that where we can cut discretionary spend out and we\u2019ve got that modeled out for the rest of the year.  But we haven\u2019t given that this is a pandemic and one of the biggest challenges around the world has been the number of people that are unemployed. We have not tried to add to that, because that\u2019s a burden right now for a lot of governments around the world. Howard Ungerleider : We\u2019ve also done a fair amount of digitalization as we brought the DuPont assets in and set up four regional back-office centers. One in China, one in the Netherlands, one in the U.S. here in Michigan and then another in Sao Paulo. So, we\u2019ve been able to do a lot of streamlining, as well. Operator : And next we\u2019ll move to Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Arun Viswanathan : Hey, good morning. Thanks a lot. Thanks for what you are doing on the frontlines, as well. I guess, I just wanted to ask about both polyethylene and polyurethanes. Both markets have gone through some structural changes here polyethylene on the feedstock side and potentially demand side. Polyurethanes on the demand side with reduced demand for consumer discretionary items.  I guess, would you agree with those characterizations and I guess, when you think about that, thinking longer-term, do you foresee any changes in your strategy and polyurethane as you talked about adding Systems Houses and PE, you talked about selling. Are those still valid in this environment? Have you seen new customers trade down or change their strategy, as well? Thanks. Jim Fitterling : Arun, I think, we\u2019ll get back to the growth playbook as we mentioned in the script. And I think it\u2019s just a matter of timing here. So, it doesn\u2019t make sense right now to continue to plough cash and capacity when the demand in Europe and North America and Latin America has slowed down, because people are staying at home.  So that\u2019s why we are taking some of the actions that we are taking right now. It\u2019s just to balance that demand. But that demand will come back. People are not going to stay at home forever. We are helping governments right now with safe ways to return to work and we are operating safely. 14,000 Dow people go to the sites every day and we are operating safely and people are healthy.  So, we know it can be done. But it\u2019s just going to take some time before the consumer confidence to come back and that\u2019s why we are doing what we are doing. Downstream, expansions in our Industrial Solutions and in our Functional Silicones products are still continuing. Systems House will come back as the automotive business and the Installation and Construction business comes back and we\u2019ll continue to look at downstream on plastics. Operator : And that will conclude today\u2019s Question-And-Answer Session. At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to Colleen Kay for any additional or closing remarks. Colleen Kay : Thank you everyone for joining our call today. We appreciate your interest in Dow. For your reference, a copy of our transcript will be posted on Dow\u2019s website within 24 hours. This concludes our call and have a safe day. Operator : And that will conclude today's call. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

They are posted on the Investor Relations section of Dow\u2019s website and through the link to our webcast. I am Colleen Kay, Investor Relations Vice President for Dow and joining me on the call today are Jim Fitterling, Dow\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Howard Ungerleider, President and Chief Financial Officer. Please read the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the earnings news release and slides. During our call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding our expectations or predictions about the future. Because these statements are based on current assumptions and factors that involve risks and uncertainties, our actual performance and results may differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Dow\u2019s Forms 10-Q and 10-K include detailed discussions of principal risks and uncertainties which may cause such differences. Unless otherwise specified all financials where applicable exclude significant items. We\u2019ll also refer to non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures is contained in the Dow earnings release, in the slides that supplement our comments today, and on the Dow website. On Slide 2, you\u2019ll see our agenda for the call. Jim will begin with the second quarter highlights and discuss the operating performance of the segments. Howard will provide a financial overview of the quarter and an update on Sadara, he will share the additional actions we are taking to address current market condition and then move into modeling guidance. Jim will close with some remarks on our outlook and Dow\u2019s competitive advantages for growth. Following that, we will take your questions. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jim. Jim Fitterling : Thank you, Colleen, and thanks to everyone joining us this morning. On behalf of the Dow team, we hope that each of you and your families are healthy and safe. Starting on Slide 3, despite the impact the COVID-19 pandemic had on Dow\u2019s financial results this quarter, the Dow team continued to stay focused prioritizing cash and maintaining our financial strength. We electively lowered our operating rates to meet demand, reduced the inventory and focused on cash to deliver on our priority. Importantly, we generated $1.6 billion in cash flow from operations, up more than $600 million year-over-year and free cash flow of $1.3 billion, up more than $800 million year-over-year. Our disciplined focus on cash generation has resulted in an improved cash flow conversion every quarter since spin delivering 110% conversion on a trailing 12 month basis. Once again, we ended the quarter with approximately $12 billion in cash and committed liquidity, and we continue to see additional cash flow upside. From a top line perspective, net sales were near the high end of our guidance range driven by solid demand in pandemic related application and in geographies that are leading the economic recovery. We delivered volume growth in consumer staples, including packaging, health and hygiene, home care and pharma end markets. However, it was more than offset by declines in consumer durable end markets. We achieved notable improvements in Asia Pacific with 3% year-over-year volume growth and 13% quarter-over-quarter, largely driven by China as Asian economies continued to reopen and gain momentum. And while Europe and North America were generally slower to restart, especially with the delay in key industries like autos and construction, we are now seeing positive demand indicators across most of our segment. In line with our focus on cash generation, we maintained our financial and operational strength and flexibility. In the quarter, we released $526 million of cash from working capital driving our cash flow from operations higher in yet another quarter consistent with the expectations that we shared in our first quarter earnings call. We continue to deliver on the expense reductions we previously committed and strategically idled assets to balance production to demand. And we're taking additional actions to maintain our strength and flexibility by increasing our expense savings target and initiating a restructuring program to ensure our competitiveness, while the economic recovery gains traction. Howard will talk more about this in a moment. Our strong cash generation enabled us to also deliver on our capital allocation priorities. We maintained safe and reliable operations, returned $516 million to shareholders via our industry leading dividends and paid down $600 million in debt during the quarter with net debt reduction of approximately $740 million year to date. And finally, we continued to advance the key pillars of our ambition for long-term value creation, which you'll see on Slide 4. We stayed close to our customers to manage through this historic period, introducing GPS shipment tracking to help customers better monitor their deliveries and plan their operation, something that has proven to be exceptionally valued by our customers. We launched our new MobilityScience platform to enable easier and better access to our solutions for the transportation sector. And as the transportation industry recovered, our expertise, relationships and unmatched product portfolio enable us to innovate across the value chain, increasing our competitiveness. We also launched an ambitious set of new sustainability targets as well as a set of action that Dow will take to advance anti-racism, inclusion and diversity. We believe these actions are the right thing to do, and they will further drive long-term competitive advantage and value for Dow and all of our stakeholders. I'm proud of the Dow team for their disciplined execution and their focus on operational excellence and cash generation, which are critical to navigating in this challenging environment. As the economy gradually returned, we will continue to leverage our financial and operational flexibility, deliver differentiated value and advance our ambition generating superior shareholder return for the long-term. I'll close my comments on the second quarter with a review of our segment results on Slide 5. Across the company, we took action early in the quarter to idle certain assets and adjust operating rates to match supply demand dynamics caused by the pandemic. Packaging and specialty plastics operating EBIT was $318 million, down $450 million from the year ago period. We saw a strong demand in consumer staples like packaging and also benefited from the targeted expense reductions announced last quarter. However, these gains were more than offset by weaker demand in consumer durable end market as well as lower integrated margins. In the packaging and specialty plastics business, total volumes were flat as gains in EMEA and double digit gains in Asia Pacific were offset by declines in the U.S. and Canada where the market was impacted by both weaker demand and excess supply. Total business volume is up year-to-date and sequentially. The business reported 7% volume growth in packaging application. We saw margins began to improve at the end of the quarter with improved price in June and the return of the U.S. Gulf Coast ethane advantage. Industrial intermediates and infrastructure operating EBIT was down $374 million due to reduced demand, margin compression and increased equity losses. This segment experienced an almost 20% volume decline based on its broad exposure to COVID impacted consumer durables market. Polyurethanes and construction chemicals reported reduced volumes due to weak demand for consumer durable application, including construction, furniture and bedding and automotive as a result of the pandemic. The team responded quickly to the evolving market challenges, lowering operating rates to match production to demand, reducing inventories and operating assets to maximize cash. As the quarter progressed, the business did see double digit volume improvement in June off of the May lows, including volume growth in Asia Pacific and the business order book through July is also up double digit. Industrial Solutions reported volume growth as gains in pharma and home care were more than offset by declines in industrial and oil field applications, as well as consumer athleisure apparel. In response to the pandemic, the business strategically shifted its focus to capitalize on pockets of consumer demand, strength, including materials for cleaning and disinfection. And finally, Performance Materials & Coatings reported operating EBIT of $27 million, down $187 million from the year ago period, primarily due to margin compression in siloxane and lower demand primarily as a result of the COVID-19 related lockdown. Consumer solutions reported lower volumes as 8% demand growth in home care was more than offset by declines in automotive construction and personal care end markets with consumer activities limited by COVID related government mandate. Despite the workplace challenges through the quarter, the business continued to commercialize new innovative products, which will enable growth as the U.S. and European economies continue to recover. Coatings & Performance Monomers also saw a volume decline due to slower global construction activity as a result of the lockdown, which was partially offset by growth in architectural coatings in the United States and Canada as consumers spend more time on do-it-yourself projects at home. The decline in professional contractor demand due to the pandemic resulted in demand shifting into the do-it-yourself segment benefiting Dow\u2019s coatings business. With that let me turn it over to Howard. Howard Ungerleider : Thanks, Jim, and good morning everyone. Turning to Slide 6, I'd like to start by providing an update on Sadara. Since we last spoke, Sadara and the joint venture partners have continued to make good progress on project completion and debt reprofiling. As we mentioned on our first quarter earnings call, we announced the final logistics service agreement was signed. This was a final substantive step to achieve project completion. Sadara is now in a position to declare project completion, but is considering withholding the final administrative step as long as meaningful progress on the debt reprofiling is made. Negotiations with the lead agency creditors are underway with a firm target to complete the reprofiling no later than the end of 2020. Sadara is working in good faith with support from Dow and Saudi Aramco to advance a term sheet acceptable to all parties. We look forward to progressing the negotiations in a timely fashion as it\u2019s in the group's collective interest to complete the reprofiling by the end of the year. Dow and Saudi Aramco remain aligned in the steps needed to facilitate Sadara, maintaining a position of cash flow self-sufficiency throughout the tenor of the reprofiling. Together Sadara, Dow and Saudi Aramco have also made good progress by executing a framework for longer term structural operating improvements, which are conditional on a successful profiling and include a 10-year supply agreement for additional ethane allocation and a five-year extension to the natural gasoline allocation, further enhancing the crackers feedstock flexibility. And as indicated previously, Dow continues to expect to contribute approximately $500 million to Sadara this year. Moving to Slide 7, as Jim mentioned earlier, the team remains focused on generating cash flow to continue to fortify our financial position and fund our priorities. Since the beginning of the year, we delivered a series of costs and a cash levers in response to the current environment, as well as several unique non-operational cash inflows that provide us with additional free cash flow optionality through 2021. These actions have further improved working capital and reduce the operational and capital expenses in light of the current macro environment. Year-to-date, we've already achieved $1.5 billion of the targeted $2.6 billion of in-flight actions, including $750 million of year-over-year saving related to separation from DowDuPont. Notably, we have now successfully completed all IT separation-related activities in the second quarter. And we've also made good progress on the expense reduction we announced last quarter, which will continue to be a tailwind moving forward. We also expect to benefit from several one-time cash contributions totaling up to $1.5 billion, which includes the contractual reservation payment of approximately $450 million we received from Olin during the second quarter. In addition, we announced earlier this month, a definitive agreement to divest our rail infrastructure assets and related equipment at six major North American sites to Watco Companies for over $310 million. This transaction continues our commitment to apply a best owner mindset and aligns with our strategy to grow our core business in a capital efficient manner. And consistent with that transaction going forward, we will continue to evaluate ownership of additional non-product producing assets across our global portfolio. And today we're sharing further proactive actions to ensure our cost structure remains competitive in a market recovery that may be gradual and uneven. This includes increasing our 2020 operating expense reduction targets from $350 million to $500 million. We are also initiating a restructuring program targeting more than $300 million in annualized EBITDA benefit by the end of 2021. Program includes a 6% reduction of Dow\u2019s global workforce as well as actions to exit noncompetitive assets that are closely linked to markets impacted by the pandemic. Once finalized, the charge for the program will be taken in the third quarter and we expect full payback within approximately two years. These are very difficult decisions to take; however, they are necessary to ensure our financial strength continues through the cycle. Turning to our third quarter modeling guidance on Slide 8. We see third quarter sales in the range of $8.5 billion to $9 billion on our expectation of gradual demand recovery through the quarter. We have provided our best estimate of current sales and volume expectations by segment as well as provided corridors again this quarter for high and low ranges, reflecting the potential for an uneven recovery. And although forward visibility remains challenged, we did deliver sales and volumes in all segments and system with the guidance ranges provided last quarter. And we are now narrowing those ranges this quarter to try to provide even better transparency to our expectations. As usual, we are highlighting the key EBIT drivers in the quarter on a sequential basis. In the Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment, we expect continued robust consumer driven demand for our food packaging, health and hygiene applications, and the beginning of a recovery in our functional polymers business, which is highly aligned to durable end markets. This demand growth combined with industry planned and unplanned outages, as well as industry inventory level that are now hovering your five-year loans, we believe we'll continue to tighten up the market and support the $0.05 per pound polyethylene price increases expected for both July and August. In the Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure segment, we're seeing the beginning signs of consumer durable recovery in the automotive, construction and furniture and bedding markets. We're also seeing stable demand from the higher levels we saw in the second quarter for our solvent and surfactants that help make cleaning products even more effective. It's worth pointing out, however, that we remain at trough MDI spread. And finally in Performance Materials & Coatings, we expect continued DIY coating demand strength in the quarter, which benefits Dow as our portfolio is tilted toward retail DIY versus the professional contractor space, an area still challenged by the pandemic. And we expect to see gradual improvement in automotive, construction and electronic segment, as well as beginning signs of stabilization in the global personal care market where our silicone offerings provide notable performance benefits. We're also providing an updated full year tax rate at higher versus our previous guidance, as the pandemic has reduced our full year earnings expectations and altered the mix of both equity and core earnings resulting in upward pressure on the operational rate. I'd like to emphasize again that the near-term guidance you see here is based on our assumptions for how the COVID-19 recovery will progress as we move through the third quarter. Starting to reverse the declines of the first half, we are in the beginning phases of what is likely to be an uneven recovery, which the additional expense savings we announced today will help to mitigate. We remain focused on cash flow, protecting our enterprise priorities, and driving shareholder value creation. With that, I'll turn it back to Jim. Jim Fitterling : Thank you, Howard. Please turn to Slide 9. I want to take a moment to highlight how our operational lever and our differentiated portfolio competitively position us today and for the long term. This quarter, we intentionally adjusted our operating rate lower to meet demand, reducing inventory and prioritizing cash. Operating rates across the integrated ethylene envelope remain strong at 82% down only 1% from the year ago period, reflecting resilient demand. However, in our polyurethanes business, we quickly brought operating rates down to the low 50% range as the extent of the durable end market shutdown became apparent. We will continue this dynamic management of our assets and in polyurethane, as end markets recover, we expect to quickly ramp back up above breakeven operating rate. Our operational excellence, combined with our purposeful focus on cash and liquidity, are critical differentiators at this point in the cycle. We saw the benefit of our disciplined approach as we released more than $500 million of cash from working capital during the quarter and we used that strength to pay down $600 million of debt. And as many of our chains have experienced compression over the last few quarters, we're starting to see rationalization take place in the industry with delayed and canceled ethylene, polyethylene and isocyanates projects. This will help Dow accelerate upward and capture growth opportunities as the recovery strengthen. As demand returns the fundamentals in the markets that we serve remain unchanged and will continue to grow well above GDP. Applications in our core market verticals of packaging, consumer, infrastructure and mobility represent a total of $650 billion in addressable market opportunity. In addition, as we discussed last quarter, our feedstock flexibility and product mix enable us to deliver lower cost and higher, more resilient margin than our peers through the cycle. The approach that we've taken to structurally improve our margin combined with our cash generation capability will allow us to capture further incremental uplift as the recovery takes hold. And as the global economy continues to recover, we will leverage our competitive advantages to drive growth above the market within these market verticals. Let me close by sharing our view on the outlook. The extended pandemic related lockdowns created a delay in the ramp up for consumer durable applications, but as economies continue to reopen and industry has got back to work, we saw continued demand improvement across all of our businesses through the end of May, all through June and continuing into July. Oil demand and pricing have increased as economies continue to reopen. This is providing support for the higher downstream derivatives pricing. The oil to gas spread has more than doubled from the lows in the second quarter with considerable ethane in rejection and available for current and future use. Recent economic indicators show U.S. industrial production up 5.4% in June and consumers are starting to spend more with June retail sales up 7.5%, plus U.S. housing starts up 17.3% for June all favorable trends for continued broad economic improvement. On the geographic front, economic recovery patterns have developed generally as expected, with China seeing rapid improvement, reporting last week that their economy has now returned to growth for the first time since the pandemic started with second quarter GDP up 3.2% year-over-year. This is evident in Dow\u2019s 31% volume growth in China versus the prior quarter and 13% volume growth versus the year ago period, a positive indicator for the rest of the world although the pace of recovery may vary by region. European and North American economies have been slower to recover, but began improving in June. Latin America remains challenged, but we expect them to follow a similar recovery pattern in the second half of the year. We're seeing these patterns in our order books with monthly volumes, improving sequentially in key markets and geographies and shipments trending upward across all of our businesses, which we expect to support improved operating rates and margins moving forward. On Slide 10, as I mentioned earlier, our solutions play into a diverse set of end markets that grow well above GDP. And we also have advanced feedstock flexibility, multiple technologies and geographic reach that uniquely position us to outperform our competitors. This allows us to not only deliver superior operational performance at the trough, but also gives us the flexibility we need to take advantage of shifting dynamics across our portfolio, positioning Dow as a leader throughout the cycle and driving value for shareholders. Finally, with this disciplined operational and financial focus, we continue to reward owners with our industry leading dividend supported by our strong financial profile and cash flows. In summary, we will remain agile, taking swift and decisive action to enhance our competitiveness, advancing our digital capabilities to better serve customers, increasing our operational and financial flexibility and capturing greater value from the market recovery and growth opportunities ahead. With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Colleen to open the Q&A. Colleen Kay : Thank you, Jim. Now, let's move on to your question. I would like to remind you that our forward-looking statements apply to both our prepared remarks and following Q&A. Operator, please provide the Q&A instruction. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. David Begleiter : Thank you. Good morning. Jim and Howard, on your modeling guidance for Packaging & Specialty Plastics, looking for volumes and sales, both to be flat to up 5%, I guess that implies pricing is flat, but you did get pricing up in polyethylene in June and likely in July, maybe even August. So how is pricing flat sequentially given that tailwind from polyethylene? Thank you. Jim Fitterling : Good morning, David. Thanks for the question. We do expect volumes to continue to improve like we saw in the second quarter. We are going to have a little bit of a tailwind from our headwind from some turnaround costs that are in the third quarter. Some turnaround activities have stretched through this year because of the COVID-related issues of workforce. But we do have pricing on the table for July and for August up five in July, up five in August. We were successful in getting price of $0.04 in the month of June. And so I think we're watching what's happening there also with input costs and feedstock costs to see what the net is on an integrated margin. So this outlook would have the whole integrated margin relatively flat and all the increase on volume. Operator : We'll take our next question from John Roberts with UBS. John Roberts : Thank you. You highlighted MobilitySciences in both Slide 4 and Slide 9. You gave up most of Dow automotive in the DuPont separation. Do you still have a Dow automotive kind of integrated organization or is it just spread around all the businesses and how big is automotive today and what are your strategies there longer term? Jim Fitterling : Good morning, John. Thanks for the question. We do have a fair amount of business today into the automotive industry, the transportation industry. In the neighborhood of $2 billion to $2.5 billion of sales that goes in there, it's different than the mix of products that went with the transportation and high performance polymers to DuPont. What went to DuPont was glass bonding adhesives and crash durable adhesives. But remember we still have a very large platform of elastomers, silicones into a number of applications in the automotive construction, also polyurethanes and other materials that go into the interior of the cars, coatings for noise vibration and harshness. So what we did was we pulled together a mobility platform that we can put out to the industry to have that face to the industry. And then what we're doing is pulling the resources that know that industry together from the existing businesses, to be able to focus on them and to drive that growth, especially as we see them making changes as they come out of this pandemic to really lean in on next generation mobility platforms, vehicles, and some of the needs that they have there. Operator : Our next question comes from Jonas Oxgaard with Bernstein. Jonas Oxgaard : Morning, guys. Jim Fitterling : Good morning, Jonas. Jonas Oxgaard : I'm wondering about \u2013 good morning, I'm wondering about Sadara. I'm looking at your page 17 and debt is flat year-over-year. But according to the repayment schedule, you should have paid back around $250 million. So can you comment on why that debt isn't moving? Jim Fitterling : Yes. I am going to ask Howard to take that, Jonas, because he and the treasury team have been doing the heavy lifting on Sadara. Howard Ungerleider : Yes, Jonas. Good morning. I mean, look, Sadara had a challenging second quarter, just like all of our chains because of really the COVID pandemic. So when you look at their equity earnings, to us, they were essentially flat versus prior quarter, but down versus same quarter a year ago. I think some of the comments that I made in the prepared comments, I mean, at the end of March, we did achieve that rail agreement. So that was the last substantive step to project completion. So now we are in a position \u2013 Sadara is in a position to declare PCD. We're withholding that at the moment as we are working to negotiate a term sheet that's acceptable to all sides. I would say the other thing that we did in the quarter is we essentially executed a framework for structural improvements. That includes a 10-year supply agreement for additional ethane and a five-year extension to the natural gas allocation that further enhances the crackers feedstock flexibility going forward. Those changes are conditional on a successful re-profiling. So we're working through that. We've engaged all the lenders in the negotiation. I would say it is on track, and it's in everybody's interest to get that done by the end of the year, and that's our target. Operator : Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Vincent Andrews : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. If I could just ask, in II&I and PM&C, if I look at your volume guidance, and maybe we can focus on the low end and the high end, how should we be thinking about the incremental margin sequentially as that volume comes back? Jim Fitterling : Good morning, Vincent. We\u2019ve got volumes up 10% to 15% in II&I and 5% to 10% in Performance Materials & Coatings. I would think about it in this way. I think, it's more around operating rates and the ability to get those volumes moving and get up above breakeven operating rates in polyurethanes and also seeing some increase in the industrial activity. In II&I, a lot of solvent applications there go into industrial coatings, so they would go into things like the automotive industry, the aerospace industry, the oil and gas industry, also oil and gas production. So those have been relatively flat. So I think as those operating rates come up, we'll see an improvement there. Just to give you an example in Polyurethanes. In the second quarter, we saw automotive rates down 50% year-over-year. They're back in third quarter. They're going to be still below last year, but they'll be about 20% below last year. And some of the other sectors like consumer durables, where they were off 30% year-over-year in the second quarter. We expect them to come back to about 10% below year-over-year. So as that operating rate improves, you're going to see polyurethanes, our target is to be it breakeven operating rates or above in Q3. They'll be about \u2013 probably about 9% below last year in terms of volumes. I would say that will be the main thing. I don't expect they'll get a lot of benefit from pricing. They may get some benefit from raw material costs because we have seen ethane still stay relatively available. So the ability to have a good price on ethane as we go through the quarter looks stronger than it did in the middle of the second quarter. Howard Ungerleider : Hey, Vincent. This is Howard. Good morning. Just to give you some numbers on decremental margins. I would say, industrial intermediates was low 40s versus same quarter a year ago and PM&C, which was a little bit better than that, was kind of high 30s. Industrial intermediates, as you would expect, has the more durable exposure. So that's why their number was a little bit worse. Operator : Our next question comes from Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global. Hassan Ahmed : Good morning, Jim and Howard. Just wanted to revisit Sadara. If I heard you guys correctly, you said that you had sequentially flattish sort of earnings contribution over there. Just trying to get a sense, I mean, obviously, volume-wise, was a very strange quarter with the pandemic and the like. But in terms of margins, I'm just trying to suss out what happen in Sadara, particularly keeping in mind how some of the heavier feedstocks, how dramatically they sort of came down and kind of went up thereafter. Did you guys \u2013 did Sadara actually benefit from the steep sort of slightly heavier feeds, oil price declines and the like, margin-wise? Jim Fitterling : Good morning, Hassan. Sadara\u2019s input costs are relatively fixed. And so \u2013 and a lot of the volume in Sadara is going into the Asian markets and the Middle Eastern markets. And so we did see a recovery in those markets in the second quarter. So I'd say the ability to move those was good. They were down some on operating rate because just the impact of the automotive and the construction sectors had on them. But as the oil price recovered through the quarter, that actually helps Sadara. That helped pricing in Asia, and that obviously helps our margin. They also had \u2013 have done well and continue to do well on plastics. So quite a big portion of their output is on the plastic side of the equation. Low-density has done pretty well. They have a nice low-density asset there. And packaging has continued to be strong throughout this pandemic. So I think that combination of things has helped them out. And they've been doing a lot, obviously, on their own to keep costs under control and minimize costs. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Jeff Zekauskas : Yes. Thanks very much. I also have a couple of questions on Sadara. So the EBIT at Sadara has been negative for a few quarters. So is the way that we should understand that, that losses in MDI are offsetting income contributions in polyethylene. Is that the main dynamic? Or are there other dynamics? And secondarily, in the changes in the supply agreements, does this mean that Sadara is being expanded? Or does it mean that it's staying the same, but the raw materials flowing in might be different? And then lastly, do you expect to still contribute money to Sadara in 2021 or 2022? Or you won't? Or you can't tell? Jim Fitterling : Good morning, Jeff. Thanks for the question. Three questions in one. So I think that\u2019s\u2026 Howard Ungerleider : It's one question with three parts. I think\u2026 Jim Fitterling : I think, I can't comment on the EBIT of the different business units in Sadara. I don't have that in front of me. But I can tell you that plastics has performed better than isocyanates and polyurethanes, and that is improving. And so maybe, Howard, you could comment a little bit on the other two parts of Jeff's question on the feedstock agreement and the next steps? Howard Ungerleider : Yes. So the feedstock agreement, first, Jeff, I agree. We don't disclose that level of detail, but you're absolutely right. I mean, the polyolefin chain is definitely doing much better. On the \u2013 what was the second question? Jim Fitterling : It was about the feedstock. Does that mean\u2026 Howard Ungerleider : We are not \u2013 no, that we are not expanding Sadara. The framework agreement is executing additional feedstock flexibility. So it's additional ethane allocation as well as extending the natural gas allocation for a number of years. So basically, that increases feedstock flex in the range of 30% to 40%, but it's not expanding it. And then your third question \u2013 or your third part of the first question, around 2021 and beyond. Look, we're going through the lender re-profiling today. We still expect $500 million in cash to go into Sadara this year, but our target remains that starting in 2021, Sadara will be cash flow self-sufficient. That is the target. And it obviously is contingent on the successful re-profiling of the debt. Operator : We'll take our next question from Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research. Frank Mitsch : Good morning, folks. A bit of a broader question. Obviously, there's been a lot of restructuring that's been going on with the combination and then the separation of DowDuPont, and then you announced this morning the 6% headcount reduction, which was a bit of a surprise, at least, to me. Over what time period do you plan on executing that? And I guess, this might be a little bit unfair. But I mean, should we be taking this as a sign that Dow is not seeing a return to pre-pandemic levels for several years? Or how should we think about it? Jim Fitterling : Good morning, Frank. I think a couple of things to take into consideration as we look at it. Obviously, we're seeing volumes come back. We also need to see margin improvement to get back to pre-COVID levels. We have some industries that we serve that have been hit pretty hard. So automotive and construction have been hit pretty hard. We're seeing people go back to construction sites, but on existing projects, and we're watching closely to see how new construction projects get permitted. And a fair amount of product that we sell goes into products that help support the construction market. So we're watching that. On the consumer side, those demands and volumes look much better. And so we need to see ourselves get to a point where operating rates and margins improve before we get ahead of ourselves. We did finish in the second quarter, all the IT separation from DuPont. So that's good. We're going to swing IT activities over to digitalization to help better serve our customers. We've had good success there in silicones. We're making great progress there in coatings. We want to take the whole platform over to an e-commerce platform that can make it easier for customers to interact with us. We turned on a lot of capabilities for them in the second quarter. So what we're trying to do is look at how to be more efficient as we move forward and also look at our structure in terms of the fact that we \u2013 I don't expect us moving CapEx up until we get back to pre-COVID type volume levels and margin levels, and so that would mean probably a couple of years before you see us ramp back up into that kind of space. Howard Ungerleider : Frank, this is Howard. To answer your question on run rates, our target is to be a 50% run rate on that restructuring program by the end of second quarter next year and 90% by the end of next year. Operator : Our next question comes from P.J. Juvekar with Citi. P.J. Juvekar: Yes, Hi, good morning. Jim Fitterling : Good morning, Juvekar. P.J. Juvekar: My question is related to your ethylene crackers, and how did U.S. ethylene cracker margins compared to your European assets, let's say, for the month of July because 2Q is kind of crazy with raw materials. So maybe you can talk about July? And Jim, you had talked about that the limit on feedstock flexibility was your ability to dispose of butadiene. So as the economies open up and butadiene demand improves with autos and all that, do you anticipate change in your feedstocks in U.S. or Europe as butadiene becomes more in demand? Jim Fitterling : Good morning, P.J. Ethylene margins came under some pressure in the U.S. at the beginning of the second quarter, obviously, because what had happened was U.S. and the Canadian economies were essentially shut down for the quarter. And it took a while for the export channel to open up for polyethylene and volumes to start moving back into Asia and other economies around the world. So very dynamic difference between the first six weeks of the quarter, first two months of the quarter, and the last month of the quarter where we saw volumes increasing almost everywhere. I'd say European ethylene margins improved because naphtha got as low as $150 in the first part of the quarter in April, but then it steadily ramped up as oil came back. So we got whipsaw a little bit the industry did by this massive drop in oil and then the recovery through the rest of the quarter. So it's improving now. I would say, we're starting to see some margins come back in ethylene. Ethylene has been tightening up. There's been some outages that have extended. There are some outages coming in Q3 that we expected were going to happen in Q2, but have been delayed for some reasons into Q3. And so, I think, we're going to see things and ethylene remain relatively tight. We are co-cracking more C4. So we have the ability with flexibility to co-crack C4. There's a little bit of a penalty for that. But the biggest problem on that, the cracking on the Gulf is just the byproducts. With refinery rates down, they\u2019re back into the 70s now, but that's still relatively low with the gasoline pools and the other pools being low with rubber being down due to automotive demand and construction demand. What you see is that it's very heavily favoring ethane cracking and ethane and propane cracking because you create less byproducts. So I think we were able to navigate that relatively well because we were basically 80 :20 ethane propane on the Gulf in the quarter. And we were able to co-crack the crude C4s. And so I think that gave us a little bit of an advantage and we didn't have to fire sale byproducts and we didn't have to cut rates just to manage those balances. Operator : Our next question comes from John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets. John McNulty : Yes. Thanks for taking my question. In the second quarter, you had a number of facilities that you temporarily shut down or idled and reduced the production levels. Is there a way to quantify what that negative impact or the cost was of doing that? And as we look to 3Q, should we be kind of reversing that? And then I guess an associated question would be as far as some of the fixed cost absorption issues, should we be thinking about any hitting in 3Q on maybe inventory working its way through the P&L that might be a little bit higher cost because of all those actions, how should we be thinking about all that? Jim Fitterling : Yes, Howard, why don't you take a shot of that? Howard Ungerleider : Hi, John. Yes, when you think about the assets that we idled because of the pandemic, I would say it's roughly about $140 million of lost EBITDA as a result of those idlings. Obviously, as we bring that back, you'll start to see the incremental margins come back. It really is operating rate related. And you look at the guidance that we gave for the third quarter; clearly, we're looking for, I would say, the biggest increase, but obviously off of a much lower base in Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure as a lot of those durable good manufacturers start \u2013 started back their production like the automotive folks. But you'll see improvements \u2013 you should see improvements in all three segments, Industrial Intermediates the most, P&SP the least just because it was the most resilient. I think we talked about in the prepared comments, but our polyethylene demand was up sequentially and up versus the same quarter last year, 6%, that went into packaging. Jim Fitterling : And I'd say on your inventory question, John, our inventory units were down 10% year-over-year. And so as those units come back on, we'll be meeting that demand with improved operating rates. So, we're not planning on putting a lot of material into inventory. We're planning on maintaining tight working capital discipline as we talked about earlier in the year, all throughout the year, and then matching Dow\u2019s operating rates to the demand that we see coming through. Operator : We'll take our next question from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Bob Koort : Thank you. Good morning. Jim, I'm curious how you see regional dynamics in the polyethylene world playing out. It seemed like at the height of the pandemic problems, the U.S. took capacity down, inventories got pretty lean and now you're getting some pricing power, but maybe the naphtha based crackers are starting to lose that ray of light they had is \u2013 is your expectation as we go through the second half and into 2021 that if global demand is \u2013 is a little less than supply, you'll start to see what we saw at the end of 2019, where maybe the Asian crackers or maybe the Europeans start to take some of that excess supply out and the U.S. industry starts to produce at rate again? Or do you think it's more measured globally where all regions are going to maybe keep rates in check in order to keep the supply demand balance? Jim Fitterling : Good morning, Bob. Thanks for the question. With what we saw in China coming out of the third quarter and going into the fourth quarter and volumes plus the fact that naphtha had moved up to $350 a ton, so it's almost a $200 ton increase from the beginning of the quarter until the end of the quarter. That's also helped support pricing movement up in Asia. And I think the volume and the pricing movements are going to continue. Our outlook on oil obviously as this is going to continue in this range, maybe higher, could get as high as $48 by the end of the year, but somewhere in the range of where we are today in that kind of a ballpark. I would say as the demand comes back in automotive, especially in construction, and that complements the really positive demand that we've seen in consumer food packaging, especially packaging, health and hygiene markets. I think you're going to see rates tighten up. We are seeing right now in some of the naphtha crackers them at reduced rates, so maybe down 20% off of the rates that they were at the beginning of second quarter. We have some that are idled. MTO is essentially out of the money until oil gets back above something like $50 a barrel. So I think what you're going to see as the European crackers have improved, margins have improved. That was our results in the second quarter. I think IHS data would support that. And with the ethane advantage coming back and enough ethane and rejection in the U.S. Gulf Coast, that's going to help the U.S. position. And I think we're starting to see some polyethylene come on. So the ethylene side of the house is starting to tighten up a little bit. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Chris Parkinson : Thank you. Just on the polyurethane side and construction and II&I, and just how do you see the demand spectrum, you hit on this a little bit, how do you see the demand spectrum evolving in 2021 versus 2019 level? So put simply if you were to index your outlook for the key end markets to 2019 versus where you see supply trends heading into 2021, just how would you assess supply demand dynamics as well as spreads? Just any additional color there. Thank you. Jim Fitterling : Yes. So I think when you look at volumes in PU and you look at that segment, we talked about volumes being down 20% and prices being down on top of that. What we're starting to see is automotive production is coming back. Automotive is back at about 80%, maybe as much as 90% of where it was in Asia. It's not back to those levels yet in the U.S., but it's trending back in that direction. I think, it will take polyurethanes a little longer to come back than plastics for example because that demand is going into much more ratable consumer applications. So, our view would be, you'll probably see polyurethanes back above breakeven operating rates before the end of this year. And then next year, you'll start to see them building some positive trends and maybe pre-COVID levels may be out to the 2022 kind of timeframe. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Steve Byrne : Yes, thank you. Your monthly volume trend slides were helpful. Jim, you mentioned that you're seeing some cancellations in ethylene, polyethylene and isocyanate projects. Can you elaborate on that and perhaps frame it by just addressing what you see in terms of the global supply and demand outlook for those commodities over the next year? Jim Fitterling : Yes. So operating rates obviously came down just mainly because the economies were shut down. If you go back to the beginning of the year, January, February, we were off to a rocking start at the beginning of the year. And then it was the economic shutdowns that really locked everything in during the months of March and April and May, April and May being the two worst. And so, I would say, operating rates for us on ethylene and polyethylene right now are pretty much like they were last year and the volumes are continuing to build. We're seeing some \u2013 obviously projects that we thought were going to be completed this year are still being under construction and haven't started up and they're moving out and we're also seeing investment decisions moving out and we're seeing projects, including ones that we had on the books moving out. And what I've said to the team here and to all of you is that we need to get ourselves back to pre-COVID type demand levels before we start talking about CapEx and growth beyond that. And we've got to get some better visibility. I like what I'm seeing in the month of June. I like what I'm seeing in July and the outlooks for August. But we got to get ourselves a longer term visibility here and some buildup in rates and some momentum going into this. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Kevin McCarthy : Yes. Good morning. As part of your new $300 million restructuring plan, I think you mentioned you'll be exiting some uncompetitive assets in addition to the workforce reduction. So I wonder if you could comment on, on the nature of those assets, what the aggregate size of that bucket would be and what timing we should expect for those announcements? Jim Fitterling : Yes. So let me just make a comment on the top. So we announced $300 million in workforce reduction, and that is just people related. The asset shutdowns and any charge we take for that would be over and above that number. We're working through all the details of that right now. The way we looked at that, Kevin, was we looked \u2013 we had done some work here to take a look at the footprint of the company and where we wanted to be in a decade. And with this pandemic, I think, it challenged us to take a look at which of these assets are struggling right now and may for the long-term struggle to be competitive in any scenario. And that's what we're focusing in on. So it isn't a wholesale business unit. It's one-off assets here and there that are at the long \u2013 the wrong end of the cost curve. And that's what we're focusing in on. And Howard, maybe you can help him a little bit with how to quantify that. Howard Ungerleider : Yes, I mean, Kevin, good morning. I would say, look, we're still working through the accounting, obviously in each one of the decisions, but if I would to ballpark it today, it'll be roughly a total charge of about $1 billion plus or minus $300 million is kind of the range that that we're in, Obviously, $300 million of it related to severance. And then the other two thirds then related to either asset \u2013 asset actions or contract termination fees that would have to be paid based on the assets. Almost no cash out this year. And the vast majority of the cash out in 2021 and 2022 and a little bit of a tail there at the end. Operator : Our next question comes from Matthew Blair with Tudor, Pickering and Holt. Matthew Blair : Hi, thanks. So good morning, everyone. Just want to clarify on the $350 million OpEx expense savings. How much of that was realized in Q2? And do you have any targets for Q3? And then also, do you have a breakdown by segment? Thanks. Jim Fitterling : Yes, I would say \u2013 yes, good morning. So, 20% of that $350 million was done in the second quarter. So you'll have 80% of that $350 million that will come through in Q3 and Q4. And then obviously this morning we upsized the $350 million to $500 million. So all of that upsized $150 million will come in the third and the fourth quarter as well. Operator : Our next question comes from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Jim Fitterling : Laurence, good morning. You there? Laurence Alexander : Good morning. Sorry about that. Can you just sort of flesh out a little bit your thoughts on permanent shutdowns versus new projects that are delayed. In your restructurings, how much capacity over the last \u2013 I say last year, and then what you have planned now? What's your kind of net volume reduction across the portfolio? And are you seeing sort of permanent \u2013 permanent asset closures of existing assets in the different chains that you operate in? Or is it just the new projects are being delayed? Jim Fitterling : Laurence, good morning. I would say I'm seeing right now rate cuts in Asia on crackers, as I mentioned, as much as 20%. We've seen some new projects that are sitting idle such as the rapid project in Malaysia. We've seen some shutdown of older crackers, not much where newer crackers were built and have been started up, but we haven't seen much of that yet. And the margins that have been in have meant that there has been positive cash out of running the unit. So we haven't seen that kind of pressure on those margins. We're seeing a little bit of issues on that are going to positively impact operating rate due to operation of the asset. So it could be things like byproducts and the inability to move byproducts. It could be things like maintenance. These assets are designed and they run better when they run hard. So when you try to run them at reduced rates, sometimes things happen. And so, we've seen some of that. We've seen postponements of turnarounds. So maybe about 8% capacity losses in EMEA in July right now in spite of the fact that you had a couple of outages that were pushed out. So you're seeing the age of some of the fleet start to show up and \u2013 start to show up when you're trying to flex things and I think that's having an impact. Howard Ungerleider : Laurence, I also think you got to look at the CTO MTO assets. There's about 6.5 million metric tons of CTO MTO, and those are hard pressed to generate positive cash flow if oil is below $50 a barrel. So those are also potentially in jeopardy as if oil stays in that range. Jim Fitterling : Yes, our look right now is that if you just looked at the cost curve today, there's about 21 million metric tons, that's about 11% of ethylene capacity. That's at risk either due to age, scale, high conversion cost, the vast majority of that's in the Pacific and in Russia. So more than half of that is in Pacific and in Russia. 3 million to 4 million tons in the U.S. and in North America. So those are the ones that we're keeping an eye on. And we can talk to you offline about it as well if you want to talk about individual projects. Operator : That concludes today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I will turn the conference back to Colleen Kay for any additional or closing remarks. Colleen Kay : Thank you everyone for joining our call today. We appreciate your interest in Dow. For a reference, a copy of our transcript will be posted on Dow\u2019s website within 24 hours. This concludes our call. Thank you, and have a great day. Operator : Once again that does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

On behalf of the Dow team, we hope that you and your families are healthy and safe. Starting on Slide 3, in the third quarter, the Dow team delivered strong operating cash flow in line with a year ago period, despite lower earnings as a result of the pandemic. As the global economy began a gradual recovery, we captured demand growth from second quarter lows across all segments. Our polyethylene business achieved 3% volume growth year-over-year. And on a sequential basis, total company volume increased 9% with all businesses and regions achieving demand gains. We saw a strength across furniture and bedding appliances, packaging, construction and automotive end markets. These results enabled us to deliver revenue that exceeded our original guidance and a more than 700 basis point improvement in operating EBIT margin versus the prior quarter. Sequentially, every segment and business posted margin gains led by the polyurethanes business and the Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment. Dow generated solid cash flow, delivering $1.8 billion in cash flow from continuing operations. Free cash flow was $1.5 billion, up more than $150 million versus the same quarter last year, continuing our track record of improvement every quarter since spin on a year-over-year basis. Our cash flow conversion was 119% versus 96% in the same period last year. We returned $518 million to shareholders through our industry leading dividend and continued to reduce net debt by approximately $1.1 billion in the quarter, down a total of more than $1.8 billion year-to-date. These results were underpinned by the early actions we took at the beginning of the pandemic, which enabled us to benefit from the start of the recovery. Last month, we announced details on our restructuring program, which will deliver $300 million in annual structural cost improvements. We finalized the sale of our North American rail assets in September and announced a second infrastructure divestment for select U.S Gulf Coast marine and terminal operations. Both actions are aligned with our best-owner mindset and are expected to deliver total cash proceeds of nearly $1 billion by year end. We also enhanced our financial flexibility, increasing our cash and committed liquidity to greater than $13.5 billion and improving our liability profile with a $2 billion debt neutral bond issuance. We now have no substantial long-term debt maturities due until the second half of 2024. And we are on target to deliver on our previously committed 2020 operational expense reduction of $500 million. Finally, we advanced our efforts in sustainability to create opportunities for growth, drive innovative solutions for our customers and increase efficiencies throughout our operations. Dow's discipline and focus on capturing value from the unfolding recovery has positioned us to keep building on our strong performance, further enhancing our competitiveness and advancing our ambition. On Slide 4, I'll provide a review of our segment results. The improving economy, though uneven, allowed us to increase our operating rates across the enterprise, which are now approaching first quarter levels. Operating EBIT for the enterprise increased by $704 million sequentially. Volume in the Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment rose 1% year-over-year as plastic demand remain resilient, and our year-to-date polyethylene volumes exceeded the same period in 2019. While company net sales declined 10% versus the year ago period, primarily driven by lower global energy prices, Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment price increases supported a 14% improvement in sales versus the prior quarter. Operating EBIT was $647 million, down from the year ago period as targeted expense reductions and volume gains were more than offset by overall margin compression. However, on a sequential basis, the segment grew operating EBIT by $329 million and expanded operating EBIT margins by 630 basis points, driven by solid consumer and industrial sector rebounds. The Packaging & Specialty Plastics business captured strong year-over-year demand growth in flexible food and specialty packaging, infrastructure of consumer and transportation packaging, and health and hygiene application. And compared to the prior quarter, the business delivered local price gains in all regions and double-digit gains in the United States, Canada and Latin America. Moving to the Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure segment. Operating EBIT was $104 million, down from the year ago period due to weaker demand and margin compression. On a sequential basis, the segment grew operating EBIT by $324 million and expanded operating EBIT margins by more than 1,200 basis points driven by significant volume recovery in polyurethane applications as demand rose for durable goods and construction end markets. The polyurethanes and construction chemicals business reported a net sales decline year-over-year, despite benefiting from demand growth in furniture, bedding and appliances. Compared to the prior quarter, the business delivered double-digit volume growth in nearly all regions with particular strength in consumer durables, construction and automotive and markets. As a result of rising demand, we increased operating rates by approximately 20% over the second quarter. The Industrial Solutions business reported lower net sales versus the year ago period, driven by decreased local prices and volume. Sequentially, the business captured increased demand primarily from solvent and intermediate as industrial markets began to recover. And finally, the Performance Materials & Coatings segment reported operating EBIT of $75 million, down year-over-year primarily driven by margin compression in merchant siloxanes and reduced demand due to the pandemic. However, sequentially, the segment grew operating EBIT by $48 million and expanded margins by 220 basis points, led by demand recovery and formulated silicones products and coating. The Consumer Solutions business reported a decrease in net sales versus a year ago period. Continued resilient demand in home care applications was more than offset by weaker demand year-over-year in automotive, construction and high-end personal care as a result of the pandemic. Compared to the prior quarter, the business delivered volume gains as industrial manufacturing activity, high-rise building projects and mobility and transportation began to improve. The Coatings & Performance Monomers business achieved volume growth in all regions except the United States and Canada, which were flat versus the year ago period. Demand increased in architectural coatings as residential construction market dynamics strengthened and consumers continued do-it-yourself projects. As a result, the business captured sequential double-digit gains in nearly all regions. Turning to Slide 5, our feedstock flexibility was again a key enabler of margin expansion, contributing to sequential operating EBIT margin improvement in the quarter. Feedstock costs were higher than anticipated entering the quarter. However, our flexibility and agility to optimize feeds in real time asset-by-asset and furnace-by-furnace allowed us to capitalize on our cost curve advantage and drive incremental margins. We purposely built this capability, both people and assets around the world over many decades to take advantage of raw material and co-product market dynamics. On the U.S Gulf Coast, ethane and propane have been the cost advantage feeds for more than 90% of the time over the past decade. Dow's leading ethane and propane flex capabilities and our ability to reduce an assets of zero have given us a competitive advantage. This is especially true in these volatile derivative markets, which have constrained operators who are more reliant on NAFTA. Altogether, this will continue to drive substantial value for Dow not just in North America, but also in Europe were Dow's LPG range is 4x greater than the industries. And these advantages extend to Dow sites in Argentina, Canada, and then our joint ventures in Asia Pacific and the Middle East, where we have optimized mixed feed cracker capabilities. Dow's feedstock flexibility advantage is reflected in the strength of our margins as showcased in our annual benchmarking results. And with that, let me hand it over to Howard for more color on our financial results. Howard Ungerleider : Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Moving to Slide 6. Through 2020, we have continued to improve our liquidity and liability profiles, execute against our unique cash levers and strengthen our competitive cost structure. Our discipline delivered a cash flow conversion of 117% on a trailing 12-month basis, which is more than doubled since spin. This cash generation has further strengthened our financial profile. We increased total cash and available committed liquidity by $1.5 billion at quarter end to more than $13.5 billion, representing a 28% increase over the end of 2019. Over the same period, we also reduced net debt by $1.8 billion with an in-quarter reduction of $1.1 billion. As Jim mentioned, we also continued to prudently manage our liability profile as well. We extended our next substantive debt maturity out by another year now to mid 2024 with a debt neutral bond issuance in the quarter. This disciplined approach to prioritizing cash has enabled us to continue to improve our balance sheet, even through the pandemic. Something that has been a challenge to many in our industry. In fact, our best-in-class free cash flow yield and conversion rate have driven a further reduction in our net debt to cap ratio since year end 2019, reflecting our improved leverage and positioning us well for the recovery. We also continued to advance our unique Dow cash levers, which are set to deliver over $1.5 billion in discreet cash tailwinds for the year. Entering the third quarter, we had already delivered more than $700 million in cash. We were able to close our rail infrastructure assets sale 3 months earlier than originally planned, resulting in a cash proceeds of more than $300 million. And we announced plans to divest select marine and terminal infrastructure assets. The targeted close for this transaction is early December with more than $600 million in cash proceeds expected. These transactions strategically targeted non-product producing assets and demonstrate our best owner mindset and culture of benchmarking, while locking in long-term cost advantage access to these services. Early in the year, we took additional actions to further streamline our cost structure and boost our competitiveness in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Last quarter, we increased our 2020 operating expense reduction target to $500 million and we are on track having delivered approximately 60% year-to-date. And our focus on releasing cash from our balance sheet has resulted in a decrease of more than $700 million in working capital over the last 12 months. This has been aided by our structure of working capital interventions, which contributed to the $137 million release of cash for the quarter, even with sequentially higher sales. And we will continue to target additional structural working capital improvements going forward. We also finalized our restructuring program in the quarter, recording a $575 million charge comprised of severance, exit and disposal activities and asset write downs. With a 2-year payback period, the program is expected to deliver total annualized EBITDA savings of more than $300 million achieving a run rate of 50% by mid 2021 and substantially complete by the end of 2021. The asset shutdowns target primarily small scale production facilities as we continue to balance supply to regional needs and will not impact our ability to meet customer demand. Altogether, our actions are producing increased financial flexibility and enhancing our competitiveness as the economic recovery gains momentum. Now moving to Sadara on Slide 7. Consistent with the growth captured in our core packaging and polyurethane businesses from the ongoing economic recovery, Sadara is also benefiting from end market resilience and market supply tightness. As a result, the JV's financial and operational performance continues to improve with an equity earnings uplift of approximately $100 million year-over-year. And Dow's expected contribution for 2020 has now been reduced by 20% to no more than $400 million. In addition, the structural changes that will be implemented to enhance Sadara's long-term feedstock flexibility through additional ethane and an extension of natural gasoline lean allocation will improve its position on the global cost curve. Dow, Saudi Aramco and Sadara continue to make good progress toward debt reprofiling with the lenders. We remain on target to have an agreement to reprofile Sadara's project financing debt by year-end. Turning to our market outlook on Slide 8. In the first half of the year, we took aggressive action in response to the pandemic to reduce production to match demand, well ahead of the industry. The economic recovery has generally progressed as we expected. However, the pace in the third quarter, particularly in durable good end markets was faster than anticipated. In response, we quickly increased operating rates by double digits across the enterprise from the June low. This deliberate approach has enabled us to build cash and reduce net debt. Going forward, Dow is positioned to capture a significant upside as the economic recovery strengthens. Indicators are signaling stabilization in key markets and geographies. PMI, for example, has increased across China, EMEA and the U.S and the U.S housing market is up 20% year-on-year. The underlying demand trends combined with continued low inventories are leading to tight market conditions, which presents additional opportunity for our portfolio to ramp our operating rates higher. Turning to our modeling guidance on Slide 9. Moving to the fourth quarter, we expect the economic recovery will continue to improve, driving sequentially higher business results, but tempered by typical seasonality, which has historically been anywhere from a 3% to 5% sequential impact on sales and a 5% to 10% impact on EBIT. For modeling purposes, we suggest to use the midpoint of those ranges. And as the quarter progresses, if things materially change, we'll be sure to provide an update. We see total sales in the range of $9.5 billion to $9.8 billion. The strength we saw in the third quarter in key value chains like polyethylene and isocyanates is expected to continue as durable good end market demand further rebounds and packaging demand continues to be resilient. As usual, we're highlighting the key EBIT drivers in the quarter on a sequential basis. In the Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment, we expect a robust consumer driven purchasing behaviors to continue for our packaging applications. And with industry inventory levels at 5-year lows, we see support for the recently nominated October price increase. In the Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure segment, continuing demand recovery in the automotive, construction and furniture and bedding markets should continue to support price increases in the fourth quarter with some offsetting seasonality. And finally in the Performance Materials & Coating segment, as usual, normal seasonality in the Northern hemisphere will be a headwind for coatings in the quarter. However, orders in automotive, electronics and construction end markets should provide demand gains for our differentiated silicone offerings. We do expect $100 million higher turnaround spend sequentially as we had a delay from the third quarter due to the hurricanes on the U.S Gulf Coast. However, we are still on track to lower our turnaround costs by a $100 million for the full year versus 2019 and deliver our $500 million expense savings as well. I'd like to emphasize that this near-term guidance is based on our assumptions for a continued yet uneven recovery. We expect to rebound off of first half lows that benefited our third quarter results to continue, growing at a moderate pace from the fourth quarter, absent any significant second wave pandemic impacts. We remain confident that the decisive actions Dow has taken this year will continue to differentiate us in that environment. With that, I'll turn it back to Jim. Jim Fitterling : Thank you, Howard. Please turn to Slide 10. In addition to our strong financial performance throughout this turbulent year, Dow also launched breakthrough sustainability targets earlier this year, focused on reducing our carbon footprint and addressing plastic waste. Sustainability is not a new concept to Dow. In fact, for decades, it has been a defining factor in how we make decisions, run our operations and innovate new products. These new targets reflect our longstanding commitment to apply our material science expertise to address the world's most pressing issues. We announced our intention to reduce Dow's net annual carbon emissions by 15% by 2030, and achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. New enabling process technologies will bring carbon efficiencies to our operations and provide higher earnings such as our FCDH technology being scaled up at our cracker in Plaquemine, Louisiana, as well as increasing Dow's renewable energy purchases at very competitive costs across the United States and Latin America and accelerating technology to electrify ethylene steam crackers. We also continuously innovate new products and solutions to help our customers meet their sustainability commitments and lower their carbon emissions. For example, our SunSpheres bio SPF booster and MaizeCare style polymers are products that meet our customer's requirements for more sustainable personal care solution. Secondly, we announced several actions to further our leadership role in driving a more circular economy. By 2030, Dow will help stop the waste by enabling 1 million metric tons of plastics to be collected, reused or recycled through direct actions and partnerships. For example, our work with partners around the globe to construct the infrastructure, like polymer modified asphalt roads and to make products with post consumer recycled plastic. And by 2035, we will close the loop enabling 100% of Dow products sold into packaging applications to be reusable or recyclable. We are developing circular economy solutions such as investing in advanced recycling and offering recycled plastics with our recycle ready technology as part of our product portfolio. We are already seeing the benefits of our actions as the market adoptions for these new solutions continues to grow and enabled us to drive lower costs and higher sales throughout our businesses. Sustainability will continue to be a critical driver of long-term value for Dow and our shareholders. In closing, on Slide 11, our strengthened financial flexibility, disciplined focused on cash and the actions we have taken to reduce structural costs, position us well to continue delivering value for Dow and our shareholders. Most of our markets have already seen significant improvement. And as the recovery broadens, we will begin to see higher margins as differentiated parts of our portfolio returned to more normalized growth. Our functional polymers polyurethane systems and silicones businesses as highlighted in our annual benchmarking, deliver premium margins and represents significant EBITDA and margin uplift as social and workplace activities resume and durable goods demand continues to increase. In the meantime, we remain focused on strengthening our financial position, unlocking additional cash upside and successfully reprofiling Sadara's debt. This financial flexibility will further enhance our competitiveness as we move forward, affording us an ability to see the right opportunities for growth. We're also advancing Dow's commitment to ESG as we pursue our long-term ambition to become the most innovative customer centric, inclusive and sustainable material science company in the world. Driving long-term growth as consumer demand rises for innovative more sustainable solutions. These actions are underpinned by a unique consumer focused portfolio that has broad geographic product and market reach as well as industry leading feedstock flexibility, combined with our focus on low capital intensity investments, digitalization and innovation. We will continue to drive superior performance relative to our peers. Now I'll turn it back to Colleen to set up the Q&A. Colleen Kay : Thank you, Jim. Now let's move on to your question. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will hear from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. David Begleiter : Good morning. Jim and Howard, in terms of your capital allocation as your strength has improved, especially with the debt refinancing, you have a lot of free cash over the next 2, 3 years. How do you expect to use that cash? Which could be buybacks, could be some bolt-on M&As, could be investment in the business organically. Thank you. Jim Fitterling : Good morning, David. Thanks for the question. And obviously we've done a great job managing cash and delivering cash from the machine. And as you say, we've paid down about $2 billion of debt this year. So as we look at next year and in the next couple of years, we're working on scenarios where we could be able to with discipline, increase that CapEx from the $1.25 billion that we have this year. Most of that $1.25 billion is going to safely and reliably operate the plants today, and growth capital in downstream businesses like our Industrial Solutions business, polyurethane systems and formulated silicones businesses. As we free up a little bit more CapEx, it's going to go into quick payback projects, especially anything that hits reliability and really improves things like cracker reliability come to the bottom line pretty quickly. So you should see that. And then once we get back above COVID demand growth levels, we'll start to look at more downstream CapEx investment. But I would say we'll open it up gradually and we'll ramp it as we see the demand improve. As far as M&A, I would think any bolt-on M&A would be relatively small. I don't know, Howard, if you want to comment on that. Howard Ungerleider : Yes. No -- but no big bang M&A, Dave, and I would say that in addition to continuing to support our leading dividend, we also want to continue to delever. So we haven't set a target yet for next year. We are ahead of pace this year, as you pointed out. We'll set a target, I'm sure on the next earnings call. But it will be in the $500 million to a $1 billion range as a first pass based on what we see today. Operator : Next, we will go to Jonas Oxgaard with Bernstein. Jonas Oxgaard : Good morning, guys. Jim Fitterling : Hi, Jonas. Jonas Oxgaard : I have a two part, if you don\u2019t mind, on Sadara. I\u2019m looking at the closures you had, and you're talking about $400 million cash in. If I'm looking at the combined EBITDA, even if I assume Q4 is the same as Q3, its only about $160 million with $250 million of interest and your debt is not going down. So my first part of the question is where has all that cash gone? Is that to do the changes in the plant that you're talking about? And then the second part of the question is how should I think about 2021 here then? You're talking about cash -- sustainable cash flows, which I'm assuming means zero cash-in from Dow. How do you plan to get there? That seems to require a pretty significant increase in EBITDA for '21. Jim Fitterling : Yes, Jonas, I'm going to let Howard unpack it. But just remember the cash that's going into Sadara is our portion of the principle repayments on the project financing, which is why the debt reprofiling by the end of the year is a big target for us. So, Howard, why don\u2019t you unpack like the EBITDA recon and also progress on how we're doing on debt reprofiling. Howard Ungerleider : Yes. Jonas, good morning. Look, I think, let me start with the Sadara's operation -- operational performance. And I would say that they're on -- their third quarter numbers were a $100 million improvement from an equity earnings perspective versus the same quarter a year-ago. They also saw sequential improvement. And I would also say that they are on track right now to have a better 2020 then 2019, which I would say most folks in our industry can't say that. So I think their operational performance is doing very well. They've taken cost out. Obviously, they're also benefiting from the snapback in demand that we've seen in the durable goods areas in the urethane chain as well as the resilient demand that we've seen in our core business in packaging. When you think about where the money is going, Jim, hit it on the head, which is remember right now it's project financed. Project financing means they've got about a $1 billion of principal that are coming due every year, so that money is going to principal pay down. That's why we're so focused on the reprofiling. And I would tell you that we made really substantive progress with the ECAs that are in the syndicate in the third quarter. We are now in the process of engaging with the commercial lenders and the investors, and we remain on track to get a deal done by the end of the year. So we're feeling really good about that. And remember that reprofiling -- our targets on reprofiling is for Sadara to be in a position of cash flow self-sufficiency by January 1. And so that is the thought process and we're on track to make that happen. We don't have it done. We still have work to do, but watch this space. I'm really pleased with the team. We got Saudi Aramco, Sadara and the Dow treasury teams that are working collaboratively with each of the lenders in the lending syndicate. So more to come, but good progress so far. Operator : Next, we will move on to Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Vincent Andrews : Thanks and good morning, everyone. Building on your comments about the strength in polyethylene markets and your expectation for pricing in October. Maybe you could just help us understand how you're anticipating the balance of the quarter playing out. Normally November and December, in particular, we tend to see some price decline. So do you think those will be -- there'll be price declines, or do you think that the demand strength that you're seeing there is robust enough to keep those at a minimum despite the fact that there's a good amount of Chinese capacity coming. And then just what's your expectation for ethane as these new crackers starting out as these as crackers restart post the hurricane outages. Thanks. Jim Fitterling : Good morning, Vincent. Good question. And let me -- I'll take the first and then I'll come back to ethane. I think one of the reasons we had a better performance in third quarter was demand was stronger for longer than we expected and inventories were lower than anybody expected. We also had higher operating rates at Dow, but also throughout the industry. And we did have some impact from quite a bit of capacity offline as we ended the third quarter. My expectation is demand is going to continue to be strong. It's been stronger. Polyethylene demand has been stronger year-over-year every month, all year long, even through the second quarter which was a very sharp downturn. So I think that bodes well for pricing through the quarter. And I think our average price through the quarter will probably tick up slightly. Remember, it started low and it ended up about $0.12 through the quarter in the third quarter in the U.S. I would say we'll hold on to that and maybe pick up slightly on average for the quarter. On ethane, there's been a lot of speculation on what's going to happen. With that saying, I would say natural gas looks to me like it's going to stay about where it is. It might rise to as much as 3.50 through the winter, but I don't see anything that would indicate that there's going to be a big spike up in natural gas. And on ethane you have to remember that frac spreads as they improve, bring a lot of ethane to the market. What we saw in June and July, frac spreads got up to a $1.50, a million BTU, and that was enough to bring 300,000 barrels per day of ethane to the market. So I expect frac spreads will increase a little bit. We might see ethane prices bump up a couple of cents in the fourth quarter from where they've been. But as those frac spreads increase people are going to bring some more capacity into the market. Operator : And next we will move on to Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Jeff Zekauskas : Thanks very much. In your geographic description of your growth, I thought the results were different than what I would have expected. In that -- in the U.S and Canada, your volumes were down 9; in Europe, they were up 4; in Asia, they were flat. And I would have thought that Asia would have been stronger and Europe weaker, maybe the U.S stronger. Can you talk about those overall trends and whether you expect them to continue? And then quickly for Howard, accrued and other liabilities moved from $2.7 billion to $3.4 billion in the quarter. Sequentially, what's a normal number for accrued and other liabilities for Dow? Jim Fitterling : Good morning, Jeff. I'll take the geographic question and I'll let Howard talk about the liabilities. I would say the recovery is probably more market driven globally than it is geographically driven. We've seen similar patterns in all the geographies on what's coming back in the market. So food and specialty packaging, industrial packaging, we saw big tick up in construction. We saw durable goods, electronics all up, appliances up, and we saw that across all the markets. We saw automotive make a big comeback. I would say, what you get into region-by-region would just be differences that you might see in a region. For example, siloxanes was a bit slow in the third quarter in Asia and we have a pretty sizable footprint there. And then polyurethanes, obviously is a big footprint in Europe. And while it ticked up globally, we still have some room there to grow. So I wouldn't read much into it from a geographic standpoint, I think the markets are continuing to improve. I think Latin America probably made one of the stronger snapbacks that we saw, especially Brazil in the third quarter. So we'll keep an eye on that, but it's really more market driven. And, Howard, do you want to touch liabilities? Howard Ungerleider : Yes, Jeff, great question. I'm impressed with your diligence in the back of our press release. Look, I would say that the $3.4 billion number has definitely increased. The biggest driver is the restructuring, right? So we announced this. We announced the restructuring of 6% of our labor costs. And so we accrued in the quarter for all of the charges, and that obviously comes into the accrued and current liabilities. The other items is with the higher performance, there is a slight increase in the performance comp expectation. That's an annual bonus program. We'll see how the fourth quarter turns out, but those are the two big drivers of the increase. So that $3.4 billion number will move around. But as you get through 2022 and 2023, it'll come down by about a $300 million, which was the biggest chunk of the step change because of the accrual. Operator : We will move on to Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research. Frank Mitsch : Good morning, folks. An impressive quarter. And it came in 18%, 19% higher than the guidance that you offered in the middle of September. So, obviously you ended the quarter on a tear. Can you talk a bit more about how that surprised you? And here we are 3 weeks into the fourth quarter, how sustainable is that higher level of performance? Jim Fitterling : Yes. Good morning, Frank. Thanks for the question. And I would say a few things that changed. We had expected to have turnarounds in the third quarter and because of the hurricanes turnarounds came in lower by $50 million in the quarter. Now some of that slides now into the fourth quarter, because we had to take the plants down. And we had about $200 million of improved polyethylene and isocyanates pricing strength between when we guided and the end of the quarter. So I think those are the two big things. The other thing I would say, and just credit to team Dow, fantastic job of blocking and tackling price volume management and running the assets. We move quickly in the second quarter to take operating rates down to match demand, and manage cash and liquidity and we did that really well. And then we brought them up quick, as we saw in third quarter, that things were improving. And I think we capitalize on both ends of that curve. And so -- and then on top of that, we were a little bit lucky, we have to say that, that we did not get a direct hit from the hurricane. So we were able to navigate through that and get the plants back online relatively quickly. Those would be the big moving parts. Operator : Next we have Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Bob Koort : Thanks very much. Jim, I'm wondering with such volatility in regional margin pads for the polyethylene business over the last year. Do you see ramifications sort of broadly on future expansions? Do you think this is going to chill some ambitions globally, or can you give us some perspective on how you see this next wave of polyethylene that might come into the market over the next couple of years? Jim Fitterling : Yes. Good morning, Bob. Good question. I think it has chilled some substantially and I think it will continue to chill some more. And on top of what you talked about on demand, you've got to remember there's a lot of pressure on the industry right now to be able to get carbon reductions and get CO2 emissions down. So as you continue to bring on new capacity, people are going to look at that new capacity and they're going to look at your carbon footprint and try to determine what are you doing to your total carbon footprint. That's one of the reasons that we're working on about four technologies in the process technology side, in the ethylene production and propylene production area that are all geared towards being able to build future plants that could potentially be zero carbon crackers. And also being able to retrofit existing plants where it might be able to get a 20% to 40% reduction in CO2 footprint. So we're doing that for ourselves, but we're also doing that because we think that could be a revenue on licensing stream for us going forward. So I would stay tuned, but I think you're starting to see people pull back a little bit on projects, and that's why we pivoted pretty quickly to manage cash and liquidity through this so that when we get through the pandemic, we come out with a strong balance sheet and we have the capability and the flexibility that we need to not only grow, but to do it in a way that helps bring that carbon footprint down. Operator : John Roberts with UBS will have our next question. John Roberts : Thank you. Two of the contributors to polyethylene strength I think were low channel inventory going into the recession and a temporary switch away from recycled plastic towards virgin. Have inventories normalized in the channel? And are you seeing any signs of a move back towards recycled? Jim Fitterling : I would say inventories at the end of third quarter continued to be low. In fact, they probably went down at the end of the quarter from where we started at the end of the second quarter. So I don't see any change there. And on virgin plastics, John, I think today with recycle rates and we see this as well when people are looking to recycle plastics back into new materials, it's requiring virgin materials to blend with that capability. So I don't think recycling necessarily displaces all the virgin material. I think you still need plenty of virgin materials to make the quality that you need for that end spec. I think that'll change over time, but that isn't going to be an impact over the next couple of years. Operator : And up next we'll hear from P.J. Juvekar with Citi. P.J. Juvekar: Yes. Hi, good morning, Jim and Howard. Jim Fitterling : Good morning, P.J. P.J. Juvekar: Quick question -- quick question on siloxanes. It's weak due to excess supply in siloxanes. So how quickly can you get your merchant siloxanes into downstream silicones and would that cause over capacity in silicones? And my second question is, you've talked about best owner mindset, you've done some divestitures here. Would Sadara be a long-term holding for you, post your bank agreements? Thank you. Jim Fitterling : Yes, P.J. on the siloxanes question, I think the real issue is just addressing the merchant siloxanes capacity. So we've done some things obviously to take some of that capacity idle, and that was part of the third quarter charge that we put in there. So we're going to idle a little bit of capacity in siloxanes. For downstream silicones, very diverse markets. I think we can continue to invest in downstream silicones, formulated silicones investments and continue to chew up that merchant siloxanes business without getting into an oversupply situation. So we see it in automotive. We see it in construction, all very strong. It goes into appliances. It goes into all kinds of food packaging and specialty packaging. So I think you're going to see there are plenty of growth areas for the downstream of siloxanes -- silicones without really overpowering that. And as for Sadara, first things first. Our goal here is to get Sadara refinanced and get that $500 million a year off. So a $500 million cash improvement every year for Dow. And then when we get past that, we'll start to have a look at long-term what we think can happen. Sadara is improving. You can see it in the rates of third quarter, and we're not at cycle averages yet in terms of EBITDA growth. So this is what Sadara can do at some pretty low levels. We've probably got another 20% up before we get the cycle averages on EBITDA. And we'll take that into account and look through the cycle and what the outlook is before we get into any discussions about that. Operator : Next, we will move to Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Steve Byrne : Yes. Good morning. I wanted to drill in a little -- more on this $300 million cost savings initiatives. How much of that would you say is actual headcount reduction versus workforce costs, like T&E and another bucket could be the asset rationalization? And what do you think the net benefit could be in 2021 in COGS and SG&A? Jim Fitterling : Howard, do you want to take that and kind of unpack what the costs are? Howard Ungerleider : Yes. Look, I would say from a hard dollar savings standpoint, you should expect about $150 million to drop to the bottom line in 2021. And then the balance of the $300 million, another $150 million in 2022. It includes a 6% reduction in our workforce costs. So that doesn't mean 6% headcount. I mean, obviously we're trying hard to trim the high-end of the pyramid. Obviously, we're also looking at streamlining. When you think about it from a segment level perspective, it's about a little bit more than a third in P&SP, and then the balance split between Industrial Intermediates & Performance Materials and Chemicals. Operator : And we'll move on to Lawrence Alexander with Jefferies. Laurence Alexander : Good morning. I have a question about the costs or burdens from your ESG initiatives or the direction you're going. I guess, could you touch on your current thinking about the CapEx or return on capital on recycling versus virgin plastic. And for the carbon neutral targets, how disruptive would it be for Dow to pull forward that target by, say, 10 or 15 years if that's the direction the political winds end up blowing? Jim Fitterling : Yes, good morning, Lawrence. Let me talk a little bit about on the carbon side. Clearly the source of carbon emissions comes from generation of power, burning natural gas and burning natural gas in the furnaces, in the cracker. On energy, alternative energy, we have a target to create to contract as much as 750 megawatts of alternative energy, wind and solar. And most of that is competitive or less expensive than what we produce today. So that has a net value add to it. Obviously, we can do everything. There becomes a limit on what I can do with wind and solar because I need 24/7 available dispatchable power and I need steam. And so as we look at the future growth, we're looking at cracking and process technology around FCDH, which is a way to make propylene out of propane and do it with about a 20% lower carbon emissions. And that, I think, can be equal to or better than a return on capital than what we typically approve in our projects. We're also working on, and these are all smaller dollar right now, pilot scale activities. We're also working on that same technology for ethane to ethylene. It's obviously a little bit tougher to make that happen. That could be as much as a 40% reduction in CO2 footprint. Obviously, pulling things forward will depend on those technologies proving themselves and then looking at the total capital that we have to spend over time to make that happen. And as you know, some of these assets are very profitable. So you want to have a game plan for how you do this over time. I would say the other area that we've got to be sensitive to is that on the recycling side is recycling is going to need public policy as well as recycling targets to make things happen. One of the reasons it doesn't happen today is because it's more expensive to recycle than it is to make virgin material. So one of the things we're working on around the world, Europe, United States, as well as what is the policy need to look like. In a linear economy, the cheapest thing to do is for your plastic waste to go to a landfill. And obviously, if we stay in a linear economy, we run the risk that there's more plastic waste ends up in places like the ocean. If we want to close that, we've got to create the right incentives to close that loop and bring it back. And there's technology to do it today. More than 80% of what we make today can be completely recycled, but it isn't. And that really has to do with local policies and costs and we've got to tackle that issue. Operator : And we'll move on to Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Kieran de Brun : Good morning. This is Kieran on for Chris. Jim Fitterling : Good morning, Kieran. Kieran de Brun : I was just wondering, demand for polyurethane -- good morning. Demand for polyurethane has clearly improved substantially in this quarter. I know it's a little bit early, but can you discuss any preliminary demand trends you're seeing in 4Q and maybe how you view 2021 versus 2019 demand levels, that would be helpful. Thank you. Jim Fitterling : We saw double-digit volume growth quarter-over-quarter, and it primarily was driven by consumer durables, appliances, construction and automotive end markets. So they're up. Although some of them are still below last year's levels. Automotive, for example, is up, but it's still below 2019 levels. I think it's going to continue. Appliances are still very, very strong and there's a lot of backlog on appliances and the supply chains after what we went through in the second quarter and into the third quarter, the supply chains are tight in some areas. So you're seeing a lot of backlogs and we're catching up with that demand. So I think it's going to continue through the fourth quarter for sure. And then we'll keep an eye on how it goes beyond that. China, I would say already in almost all markets has returned to pre-COVID levels. And so we may actually start to see overall growth in China, which would be good. I would say some markets in the rest of the world, like appliances, like packaging are at pre-COVID levels, but not all. In automotive, it's still shallow to pre-COVID levels and probably will be for a couple of years, I expect. Operator : And we'll move on to Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Kevin McCarthy : Good morning. Jim, just to continue the dialogue on polyurethanes, I was curious to hear your thoughts on the supply side. We've seen a number of force majeure declarations. Can you speak to where you think inventory levels are in MDI and Polyols as well as operating rates and prospective pricing outlook in the chain? Jim Fitterling : Yes. Good morning, Kevin. Things are tight as a drum right now on MDI and propylene oxide. I'd say Polyols maybe a little bit better, but it's propylene oxide that's pretty tight right now. And I think that's going to continue. Obviously, when you have an upset in isocyanates operation, you want to get it back as soon as you can, but it sometimes takes a while to get back up and get lined out. So I think things are going to be tied to the fourth quarter. Could extend into the first quarter. We are managing. We are working very closely with customers to try to keep them running and try to keep enough allocation to everybody, so that we can support them through. But it's a lot of heavy lifting by the team right now. Operator : And we'll move on to Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Arun Viswanathan : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, I just wanted to get your thoughts similar type of question, but there's been some chatter of potential restocking in certain end markets, maybe the first half of '21. I guess, would you agree with that? I'm just curious, just because it seems like some of your markets you're back to normal levels, maybe in construction and so on. And you mentioned China is kind of back there, but maybe if you can touch on automotive and construction in some of these areas, do you expect more restocking in the first half of next year, or are we kind of back at normal levels? Jim Fitterling : Arun, I'm not sure I would characterize it as restocking or just getting back to target levels of supply. I think we've dipped in some of the supply chains below target inventory levels, and that's made them the supply chains less robust. And on top of that you've got global trade issues, which really complicates some of the supply chains as well. So I think people would like to get back to normal inventory levels. I'm not sure I would call that restocking or stocking up. I think just get back to a more resilient supply chain, because we're doing this today and it's taking a toll on people. The second thing I would say is that coming out of COVID we're pivoting to more digital capabilities. And one of the things that we're able to do with digital channels is have better line of sight to market demand and we're able to match operating rates to demand. And so I think you're going to see a change in behavior in terms of how people operate, that they're going to have a much better visibility on the demand side and they're going to be able to titrate that. So you won't see big swings up and down in inventories. You'll see things be more tightly managed, especially in a period of time like this where cash is king and you need to focus on cash and liquidity. Operator : And we will move on to John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets. John McNulty : Yes, thanks for taking my questions. So maybe a bit of a follow-up to what you were speaking to earlier. On the Packaging & Specialty Plastics area, when I look at the outlook that you guys have for 4Q versus 3Q, the flat to up 3% or so. I guess, to me, it seems like something is missing here because the pricing looks like it should be solidly better than that. The demand environment, given low inventories, also sounds like it should be at least a modest improvement. So are there other puts and takes that we should be considering, or is it just a conservative outlook? I guess, how should we be thinking about that? Jim Fitterling : Yes. Remember, I talked about the turnaround. So the turnarounds that were in third quarter that got moved in the fourth quarter are going to hit packaging, especially plastics segment. And so they get most of that $100 million cost. You can add back -- we had about a $50 million impact in the third quarter from hurricane Laura, you can add that back. So $100 million of turnaround costs, take $50 million off of that. So you\u2019ve got that, which is weighing on it. And then we are expecting ethane price to go up a couple of cents during the quarter. Those are the biggest moving parts. Operator : And next, we will move on to Jim Sheehan with Truist Securities. James Sheehan : Good morning. Just on your sustainability initiatives, what are the incremental costs of reducing the carbon emissions and collecting the 1 million tons of plastics for recycling by 2030? And on closed the loop, would that increase or decrease your mid cycle EBITDA, and then roughly by how much? Jim Fitterling : Jim, I don\u2019t know that I would characterize the carbon reductions as incremental costs. I think as you look forward, it will be reflected in where we decide to spend our capital spending and how we decide to improve those assets. We want to do this in a way that\u2019s neutral or positive to the company's results. That\u2019s why we\u2019re focusing in on process technology and catalysis as a way to do it. And those are the near-term improvements that we're looking to make. And also remember that we\u2019ve older assets in the fleet. And so some of those that are at the end of life, have some of the higher carbon intensity and carbon footprint. So we decide to do with older assets can have a big impact as well. On closing the loop, it isn't like we are going to pay to close the loop in the marketplace. There's market demand for recycle materials, and so we\u2019re working with partners to create innovative solutions to make that happen and we are working with the marketplace to get the capital markets involved. So we are working with people like the recycling partnership, close loop partners and we\u2019re trying to come up with business models that, in and of themselves, are sustainable, and that will allow that plastic to come back in. And in some cases get blended with virgin plastics to make the final end product. Operator : And that will conclude today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to Colleen Kay for any additional or closing remarks. Colleen Kay : Thank you everyone for joining our call today. We appreciate your interest in Dow. For your reference, a copy of our transcript will be posted on Dow\u2019s website within 24 hours. This concludes our call. Have a great day. Operator : So that will be the end of today's call. We thank you for your participation.",

We hope that you, your families are healthy and safe. Starting on Slide 3. In the fourth quarter, the Dow team delivered results that exceeded expectations with sales and EBIT growth year-over-year and a sequential net sales increase of 10%. And as the global economy and market fundamentals continue to improve, demand drove volumes above or in line with pre-COVID levels across all operating segments. We captured strong durable goods and construction demand, we grew volumes and do-it-yourself architectural coatings and home care sectors, and we continue to benefit from solid demand and pricing momentum in packaging applications, supporting a sequential net sales increase of 12% in our Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment. This volume increase, combined with improved pricing and margins, particularly in polyethylene and polyurethane applications, delivered 5% revenue growth and higher operating EBIT year-over-year. We supported these strong top line results with a cash flow conversion of 93% in the quarter, driving our full year rate up 30% versus 2019. Cash from continuing operations was $1.7 billion in the quarter, and free cash flow was $1.4 billion. Working capital was a $236 million source of cash, even with increased sales. We completed the sale of select U.S. Gulf Coast marine and terminal operations and assets, delivering another strategic nonoperational cash lever. And improved financial and operational performance at Sadara was a key contributor in delivering positive year-over-year equity earnings. We also maintained our disciplined approach to capital allocation, completing additional deleveraging as we reduced net debt by $837 million in the quarter. And we continue to reward our shareholders through our industry leading dividend. Overall, our fourth quarter performance was a strong finish to a year where team Dow successfully overcame significant macroeconomic and other external challenges. On Slide 4 is a brief recap of our full year achievements. We adapted quickly to the global pandemic and our agile approach to managing volatility in the markets, combined with our prudent adjustments to capital expenditures, proactive cost reductions, working capital interventions, plus delivery of unique cash levers supported demand growth year-over-year in packaging applications, a nearly $500 million structural improvement in working capital, a strong uplift in cash flow from operations, free cash flow of $5 billion and more than $2.6 billion in net debt reduction and continued cash returns to shareholders through our industry leading dividend. We achieved all this, while also making significant progress toward our ambition to be the most innovative customer-centric, inclusive and sustainable materials science company in the world. We found new ways to serve customers in a virtual world, we launched Dow\u2019s mobility science platform to better serve an attractive market vertical, we reinforced Dow\u2019s commitment to inclusion and diversity through a bold framework to address systemic racism and inequality and followed through with actions aligned to that framework, and we launched new aggressive targets to help eliminate plastic waste and reduce carbon emissions. I\u2019m incredibly proud of how the Dow team delivered solid performance and showed tremendous leadership on critical issues throughout 2020. Moving to our segment performance on Slide 5. As I mentioned earlier, ongoing improvements in the macro environment drove sequential sales gains across all segments and geographies, allowing us to reach year-over-year revenue growth during the quarter for the first time since the start of the pandemic. In the Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment, operating EBIT was $780 million, up more than $130 million versus the same quarter last year and sequentially. Resilient demand, tight market supply, low inventory levels and disciplined price volume management enabled strong polyethylene pricing momentum and margin expansion. Notably, operating EBIT margins expanded 180 basis points year-over-year and 100 basis points sequentially. Compared to the prior quarter, net sales increased 12%. Price gains continued across all regions and most applications, particularly in consumer packaging, and the business delivered higher volumes with broad-based demand growth. The Packaging & Specialty Plastics business continued to see strong momentum through the end of the year. Sales were up year-over-year, primarily driven by steady volumes and improved polyethylene pricing, particularly in Food & Specialty Packaging as well as health and hygiene applications. Compared to the prior quarter, the business delivered local price gains in all regions, including double-digit gains in the U.S., Canada and Latin America. Moving to the Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure segment. Operating EBIT was $296 million, up $75 million year-over-year and up $192 million versus the prior quarter. Supply and demand fundamentals in polyurethanes and construction chemicals as well as higher equity earnings from improved performance at Sadara drove this result. On a sequential basis, significant improvement in margin over raw materials drove operating EBIT margins up more than 500 basis points, more than offsetting typical seasonality. The polyurethane and construction and chemicals business reported a double-digit increase in net sales year-over-year and sequentially. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to higher local prices with gains in all regions, except Latin America. Compared to prior quarter, sales growth was driven by strong local pricing and furniture, bedding and appliance end markets. The Industrial Solutions business reported flat net sales versus the prior year period. Currency tailwinds and higher volumes in solvents for coatings, industrial fluids, electronics and pharma applications were offset by pricing in industrial manufacturing applications. Compared to the prior quarter, net sales were up double digits due to sequential improvement in price and volume as industrial markets continued to recover and consumer end markets remained strong. And finally, the Performance Materials and Coatings segment reported operating EBITDA of $50 million, down year-over-year. Volume growth in downstream silicones and coatings applications was more than offset by price and volume declines in siloxanes. On a sequential basis, operating EBIT was down $25 million as margin expansion in silicon applications was overcome by seasonality in coatings end markets. The Consumer Solutions business reported a decline in net sales. The business captured solid demand growth in home care, consumer and electronics and high-performance building applications. These gains were more than offset by continued weak volumes in upstream siloxanes and in high-end personal care applications, such as cosmetics, as a result of paused social and workplace activities. On a sequential basis, volumes improved on recovery in mobility and transportation as well as consumer and electronics and markets. The Coatings and Performance Monomers business achieved higher net sales year-over-year, with volumes up double digits. The seasonality impact was moderate, and the business captured resilient demand for architectural coatings as consumers continue to focus on do-it-yourself projects at home. Sequentially, the business also experienced positive pricing momentum, particularly in acrylates, which was more than offset by seasonal weather-related declines for coatings applications in the Northern Hemisphere. And now, I will turn it over to Howard for an update on Sadara, our financial outlook and our plans for digital acceleration. Howard Ungerleider : Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 6. The strong supply and demand trends that continue to benefit our packaging and polyurethanes businesses this quarter also benefited Sadara. The joint venture again delivered improved financial and operational results, driving equity earnings higher by more than $130 million year-over-year. We expect solid market fundamentals and an improving economy to continue to benefit the joint venture in 2021, supported by Sadara\u2019s feedstock flexibility and enhanced global cost curve position. We are also very pleased to report that Sadara declared project completion in the fourth quarter, removing Dow\u2019s $4 billion share of the guarantees that supported the joint venture\u2019s debt. In addition, in January of this year, Dow, Saudi Aramco and Sadara reached an agreement in principle with the remaining lenders and Sukuk investors on key terms for its debt reprofiling with formal agreements expected to be completed within the first quarter. As a result, Sadara is expected to be cash flow self-sufficient going forward. Key provisions of the reprofiling include an extension of the contractual debt maturity from 2029 to 2038; a modified repayment schedule aligned with Sadara\u2019s projected cash generation profile, including a grace period until June 2026, during which interest-only payments are required; no upfront payments of principal; and limited support in the form of much lower sponsor guarantees of Sadara\u2019s reprofiled debt, in proportion of the sponsor\u2019s ownership interest. The impact to Dow\u2019s commitments are expected to include the following, which are in proportion to Dow\u2019s 35% ownership interest in Sadara. Dow will provide guarantees for $1.3 billion of Sadara\u2019s debt, effectively replacing approximately $4 billion of prior guarantees. Dow will provide guarantees for its portion of Sadara interest payments due during the grace period. Our pro rata share of any potential shortfall, which based on Sadara\u2019s current performance we do not expect, will be funded by a new $500 million revolving facility in Sadara, guaranteed by Dow. This is expected to be established in the first quarter of 2021. And finally, Dow\u2019s existing $220 million letter of credit related to the guarantee of one future Sadara debt service payment will also be canceled. As a result of these actions, the company does not expect to provide any further shareholder loans or equity contributions to Sadara. Let\u2019s now turn to our modeling guidance for first quarter on Slide 7. We exited the fourth quarter with increasing strength, which is carried over into the first quarter. The ISM manufacturing new orders index is trending at its highest level in 10 years. In addition, low interest rates are supporting a resilient housing market and deurbanization trends are driving U.S. housing starts to their highest point since 2006. We expect sequentially higher business results in the first quarter with total sales in the range of $10.7 billion to $11.2 billion, driven by ongoing strength in our polyethylene and polyurethane value chains, improvement in our silicones franchise and supported by our U.S. Gulf Coast ethane advantage. We will see some headwinds sequentially with higher turnaround costs and the reversal of approximately $50 million in onetime benefits from the prior quarter. In the Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment, we entered the year with good pricing momentum, continued solid demand and elevated breakeven points for high cost naphtha producers as a result of increasing oil prices. We expect these dynamics to be sustained through the quarter. The Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure segment will continue to benefit from strong consumer durables demand, supported by automotive and housing sectors and improvement in industrial end markets. These trends, combined with industry supply limitations and low inventories, should support pricing uplift, although we do see some cost increases from rising propylene pricing as well. And finally, for Performance Materials and Coatings, we expect silicones to benefit from ongoing demand expansion in consumer end markets, particularly in electronics, home care and mobility, where our innovation advantages will continue to allow us to capture additional growth opportunities. In Coatings, we expect DIY demand to remain elevated through the first quarter as consumer home improvement trends continue. There will be some turnaround headwinds in the quarter, including completion of a turnaround at our siloxane plant in China that we shortened in the first half of 2020 due to COVID-related labor and supply issues. Turning to Slide 8. Looking at the full year, we see strong market fundamentals in many of our key value chains continuing to drive improved operating performance year-over-year. And although we expect the pace of recovery to moderate, it is still likely to be uneven quarter-to-quarter as the vaccine distribution and new strains evolve. As usual, we are providing you with our best full year estimates of several income statement and cash flow items, which are noted on the slide. Consistent with our capital allocation priorities, and based on our improved forward outlook versus 2020, we are increasing our capital expenditure target year-over-year to $1.6 billion, and we are targeting an additional $1 billion in deleveraging. Sadara, as previously mentioned, will be a $350 million tailwind for the year with no planned cash contributions. We expect equity earnings to be flat year-over-year as the margin resiliency we see across the portfolio is offset by higher planned JV turnaround expenses. Total turnaround spending will be up versus the prior year as we continue to ensure the reliability of our facilities. And as mentioned last year, we expect our $300 million EBITDA restructuring program to be substantially complete by year-end. We are also providing a share count estimate for the year. However, assuming a sustained EBITDA improvement, we will look at reinstituting our share buyback program later in the year for the purpose of covering dilution. And finally, we expect a full year tax rate in the 23% to 27% range. Moving to Slide 9. The events of 2020 provided an opportunity for us to rapidly accelerate our focus on the value of digitalization. Through our digital advances and capabilities, we were able to continue innovating, improving the customer experience, and optimizing our operations. It has become clear that the escalation of digital interactions and transactions driven by COVID-19 will only help us accelerate the delivery of our ambition and be an important part of our customer experience in the future. So building on this solid foundation, today, we are announcing plans to further advance our digitalization efforts by investing in three key areas : First, expanding digital tools like machine learning and advanced digital modeling to accelerate material science innovation and put innovation capabilities directly in the hands of our customers. Second, further enhancing our e-commerce buying and fulfillment experience for our customers; and third, adopting additional real-time digital manufacturing insights, operational data intelligence and demand sensing, all to enhance the productivity and reliability of our operations. We expect these actions to deliver more than $300 million in incremental annual run rate EBITDA generation by year-end 2025 with an additional onetime $100 million improvement in structural working capital efficiencies. To realize these gains, we will spend approximately $400 million over the next two years with an attractive risk-adjusted return on investment exceeding our internal hurdle rate and an expected payback of less than three years. Our goal is clear, our digital acceleration will help us continue to transform how we work, and importantly, how we engage with our customers. With that, I will turn it back to Jim. James Fitterling : Thank you, Howard, and please turn with me to Slide 10. For more than 3 decades, sustainability has been an imperative to our business. And last year, we announced new brake targets focused on reducing our carbon footprint and addressing plastic waste. We see these targets as a catalyst for growth and innovation. We have discussed with you our progress on key initiatives to advance the circular economy for plastics. And today, we want to provide visibility on our comprehensive approach to reducing carbon emissions. Over the past 15 years, Dow has reduced our overall emissions by 15%, while growing our business. And we see a viable pathway to reduce our net annual carbon emissions by another 15% by 2030. This pathway begins with targeting further efficiencies and optimization at our sites, sourcing renewable energy and clean power, and implementing new emission management technologies. We are working with utilities and regulators to supply clean purchase power to a majority of Dow sites by 2030. We are making good progress. Last year, we increased our agreements to purchase cost competitive renewable energy in Kentucky, Texas, Brazil and Spain, and we are preparing for the full transition of our Terneuzen operations. We are also working to optimize the energy efficiency of our sites by lowering our energy use and developing breakthrough technologies, such as electric, ethylene steam crackers, carbon capture and sequestration, and the potential use of blue hydrogen, now to be among the first in the industry to do so by 2030. We recognize that achieving these goals will also require partnerships with governments, regulatory agencies and other external groups to support the economics of these technologies and evolve regulatory frameworks to focus on emissions reduction. Widespread support for decarbonizing emissions is driving demand across the value chain, and Dow is well placed to continue to lead and benefit from this evolution. Many Dow products lower our customers\u2019 emissions more than the carbon emissions used to produce them, like enabling lighter, safer and more fuel-efficient automobiles; more energy-efficient buildings; and food that stay safe and fresh longer, all critical for a world set to add two billion people by 2050. Ultimately, Dow wins by making our cost to implement this transition lower than our competitors and the value of our products higher. Our objective is to establish a resilient portfolio of lower carbon footprint products to meet rising demand, capture market share and grow value, while reducing emissions for Dow, our customers, and the planet. Moving to Slide 11. As we look to 2021 and beyond, we are well positioned to capture additional value growth. Throughout the pandemic, new consumer behaviors emerge that have driven strong demand for our products, and we expect these trends to continue benefiting Dow\u2019s consumer-led portfolio even as the pandemic diminishes. Consumers have become accustomed to new ways of purchasing and interacting, increased in-home delivery and takeout dining, paired with heightened awareness of food hygiene and security will sustain demand strength for food and consumer packaging. The resilient housing market is creating higher demand for durable goods, such as furniture and appliances, and more time at home also leads to consumer spending on home improvement, including do-it-yourself coatings. Ongoing public caution about COVID-19, even after widespread vaccine distribution, will support continued demand for health and hygiene applications. We also believe that as vaccination rates increase and we turn the corner on the pandemic, there will be improving demand as travel, entertainment, sports and construction industries and other social activities return to normal. Market indicators are showing above GDP growth across several sectors, and as a result, we are beginning to see economic recovery broaden across our portfolio and in many of the end markets that we serve, which is benefiting our higher-margin consumer solutions business. Similarly, this increased confidence is also improving demand in our functional polymers portfolio, which serves mobility, infrastructure, and construction sectors. Finally, as we look ahead, Dow\u2019s unmatched materials science portfolio is uniquely positioned to address global megatrends and shifting post-COVID trends, providing additional higher-margin growth opportunities for Dow. Dow solutions meet increasing consumer needs for new sustainable innovations, such as post-consumer recycled plastics and renewable energy made polyethylene. In 2020, we tripled sales of product made with renewable bio-based feedstock. As the need for renewable energy increases globally, so will demand for Dow solutions that enable wind power and solar production facilities. Our heat transfer fluids are used in more than 40 large-scale concentrated solar power plants around the world. And through our DowAksa joint venture, we provide polyurethane, carbon fiber systems that deliver a stronger and lighter composite material for wind blades. Electric vehicle sales are on the rise with 2021 growth projections exceeding 2020 records. And our mobility science platform focuses on delivering innovative products to enhance automobile connectivity, light weighting, comfort, safety and sustainability. Lastly, we see meaningful opportunities to support the rollout of 5G broadband networks. For example, last year, we launched new high-performance thermal gel that promotes both environmental sustainability and efficient assembly of essential 5G infrastructure. Underpinning these tailwinds are the global foundational advantages and discipline that set Dow apart. Our unmatched portfolio, global scale, low-cost structure and industry-leading feedstock flexibility give us a competitive edge. Further, the actions that we took in 2020 to bolster our financial position, including the execution of our restructuring program and our disciplined focus on cash generation provides the financial strength and flexibility to support our growth trajectory in line with our financial and operating playbook. To close, 2020 was a challenging year for our world. But I could not be more proud of team Dow\u2019s performance nor could I be more confident in our future. Dow\u2019s competitive advantages are clear, we have significant growth opportunities ahead of us and the actions that we have taken position us to outperform our peers. With that, I will turn it back to Colleen to open up the Q&A. Colleen Kay : Thank you, Jim. Now let\u2019s move on to your questions. I would like to remind you that our forward-looking statements apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. Operator, please provide the Q&A instructions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question, we will hear from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Robert Koort : Thank you so much. Good morning. Jim, I was hoping maybe you could give us your appraisal of what is going on, particularly in the polyethylene markets. 2020 was certainly a surprise. The resilience of demand is quite good. And I guess, the fear of the wave of capacity over looming the industry didn\u2019t materialize. But how do you sort of see the supply demand setup looming in 2021? James Fitterling : Yes, Bob, I think as the year progressed, we saw continued strong demand in polyethylene. And toward the end of the year, we saw ethylene start to tighten up and ethylene margins improve. And so that led to some pretty sharp increases in the fourth quarter. You saw PE margins were up in the fourth quarter, about $0.07 a pound in the U.S., about $0.13 in Europe, and up about $0.10 in Asia. I think the other thing that happened was as those ethylene margins increased here, you had some wintertime activities that drove some of the cost to manufacture up in China. So you saw competing technologies like cold olefins, where coal prices were up to $200 a ton, mainly because of a polar vortex and the fact that they were having some squabbles with the Australians about coal imports. So they weren\u2019t able to get it. We also saw LNG exports and LNG demand up sharply throughout Europe and also into Asia. And so that helped. Demand strength on top of the fact that you had these rising prices and inventory levels were low, really all came together to drive that. And by the way, demand still continues to look good in the first quarter, inventory levels are still low, operating rates are good. In the U.S. Gulf Coast, our operating rates were in the mid-90s in the fourth quarter. So we are going to continue to see, I think, good margins in the PE business. Operator : And next, we will move to P.J. Juvekar with Citi. P. J. Juvekar: And congratulations on your goals for sustainable energy and renewable resources. So about this sustainable electricity that you talked about to get into your crackers, how do you plan to do that. Would you outsource all that to utilities or would you invest in renewable energy, possibly with some partners? How do you get to that goal by 2030? And what kind of CapEx do you need for that? James Fitterling : Yes. Good morning PJ. Look, I think you think about sustainability for us from an electricity standpoint on two fronts. We have a lot of electricity uses that are not for the crackers. And obviously, there, we are looking to alternatives, wind and solar, to replace current capacity. And those are cost competitive today. And so we have made a big move in that direction. We have about 580 megawatts of alternative energy under a contract. And we are increasing every year. Our goal is to have 750 megawatts or more by 2025. And I mentioned some of the sites on the script that will go through that. The second thing I would say is in the crackers, we are looking at a combination of things, not just electrification. We have a partnership with Shell going on right now to try to prove out electric cracking. That is a longer term development. In the near term, we are also working on a form of fluidized catalytic cracking to go from ethane to ethylene. I\u2019ve talked about our FCDH process to make propylene out of propane. We are piloting that in Louisiana. That will be built this year and up and running next year. And we believe that can give us a 20% reduction at least in CO2 emissions and a very good scale technology. We can achieve economies of scale at maybe 150,000 tons per year kind of CapEx. If you look at what we are doing in parallel, we are looking at EDH. And that could have the potential to reduce our emissions by 40% or more, still using gas as a feedstock in the crackers or gas as a fuel and the crackers. So we have got several technologies that we are looking at, and we are also looking at blue hydrogen also as a way to try to get a more concentrated CO2 stream so that we can combine that with carbon capture and sequestration to be able to reduce carbon emissions. Operator : And next, we will move to Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Jeffrey Zekauskas : Hi thanks very much. Propylene is going up really quickly. Are your acrylate prices going up as fast as propylene prices are going up, that is are acrylate margins likely to be squeezed in the early part of the year or widen in the later part of the year, how do you assess that? And for Howard, in the operating cash flow in 2020, how much of operating cash flow came from asset sales or legal settlements? James Fitterling : Good morning Jeff. Let me see if I can cover propylene first, and then I will flip it over to Howard. Spot prices have increased. And it is a combination of reduced supply because ethane has been the preferred crack in the crackers and propane has been much more expensive, again due to that polar vortex I was talking about in Europe and Asia, driving these prices up. That means ethane has been the crack, and so you don\u2019t have as many byproducts. And that shortest bit on propylene. And then on purpose propylene, you have had a raft of issues through on purpose propylene production, which has meant there hasn\u2019t been as much there. And so that has tightened things up. I think acrylates are holding up well because demand has been good, downstream demand has been good. So there has been some price improvements. Do It Yourself, architectural coatings are growing. In fact, they were the big winner last year in terms of market share. I expect the contractor side will come back this year. Howard, do you want to talk about the cash? Howard Ungerleider : Yes. Good morning Jeff. The two best owner infrastructure sales of a little bit more than $900 million, if you add them together between the marine one that we did this past quarter and the fourth quarter, and then the rail infrastructure that we did in the third quarter. And then I would probably top it up to $1 billion with some of the other miscellaneous land sales and asset sales that we did that were smaller. Operator : Next, we will move to David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. David Begleiter : Thank you. Jim, polyurethane has strong end to the year. How do you foresee that business progressing into Q1 and through the rest of the year, both on prices and margins? James Fitterling : Good morning David, thanks for the question. The markets that I mentioned, automotive, furniture, and bedding, appliance and construction are very solid right now. In the energy space, the oil and gas space, it is a little bit challenging. And so we see the trajectory that we had in isocyanates and polyols in the second half continuing to move up in first quarter due to supply limitations. It is hard to keep things on the shelves like mattresses and furniture, while we have got these strong housing drives that are going on. We are seeing the automotive sector come back. Obviously, we saw it big electric vehicles, we have set records in 2020, and I think we are going to crush those in 2021. But internal combustion engine vehicle is coming back as well. And that is good demand and strong order patterns, even without some of the bigger capital-intensive markets being back on stream. So like the large-scale industrial construction, those types of markets. So I think we have got a good demand at and ahead of us. Housing starts is a very, very solid sign, highest we have seen since 2006. So that drives a lot of content for our products. Operator : And we will move on to Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Laurence Alexander : Good morning. I guess, two housekeeping questions. It has been a while since we have had normal seasonality. So how do you think about normal seasonality playing out with respect to Q2 and Q3, relative to Q1? James Fitterling : I think I understand your question, so let me see if I get it, and then I will ask Howard in case I didn\u2019t. Normal seasonality that we would typically see a strong second quarter but having said that, we go into first quarter this year with supply chains being relatively lean, very little inventories in almost all of them. And we have got strong demand going into the first quarter. So it feels like you have a first quarter, second quarter pretty strong season, and we typically see second quarter and into third quarter being the strongest part of the year. I think because of tightness, you are going to continue to see that. Secondly, last year, there was a lot of unplanned activities in things like polyethylene that took a lot of capacity off-line. This year, there is a lot of planned activity for turnarounds because of activity that didn\u2019t happen last year due to COVID. So you are going to have, on a planned basis, almost the same amount of capacity off-line as we did last year, before you ever get into any unplanned events. And those things, to me, a pretty strong start to 2021. And I\u2019m optimistic that as the vaccination rates improve, we are going to start to see people return more to normal. And we certainly are making progress on getting people vaccinated. Anything I missed, Howard? Howard Ungerleider : No. Maybe just to put some math on the turnaround numbers. I mean, last year, we really crunched down the number of turnarounds. This coming year, we will have about $400 million of higher turnaround spending. $300 million of that in our core business, about $100 million in our joint ventures. And as Jim said, that the bulk of that is going to be in Q1, Q2 and Q3. So just to factor that into a bit of a headwind, Laurence. Operator : And we will move on to Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Vincent Andrews : Thank you good morning everyone. Just looking at some of your businesses that haven\u2019t recovered as quickly. The high-end personal care, it is unfortunately, easy to understand why that is been soft. But I\u2019m just wondering, maybe if you could talk about how you are anticipating that coming back and when? And, in particular, if customer inventory levels, I\u2019m assuming they have been worked down pretty hard. So do you think that they are going to need to rebuild before the second half, assuming the vaccines are reaching critical mass by then and hopefully, some return to normality is taking place or are you more likely to see just sort of a smoother recovery there? How do you foresee that playing out? And then just as a housekeeping question, well, never mind, I will just leave it there. James Fitterling : All right. Thanks, Vincent. I would say 2021, we are seeing strength in some of those specialty growth rates right now. So I think building and construction is going to be probably up in the 3% to 4% range. Electronics, 6% or more. Industrial, up 9%. Industrial was off quite a bit last year. Mobility, maybe up 11%. Home and personal care will still be up, even though probably not as high as 2020 because you had some of that pre-COVID buying and that surge that we saw in the third quarter, second quarter to third quarter. And I do think personal care will come back. I think it will come back probably up 4%. We are taking advantage of - we had some scheduled turnaround time in first quarter last year when the pandemic hit in China. We are actually completing that work right now in China. So that is got some siloxanes capacity offline. But because building and because the high-end personal care demand haven\u2019t been there, that is been okay. So we will get those things done in this quarter. The other thing we have been doing is debottlenecking a lot of our downstream capacity. So we have done a lot of projects downstream to get our what we call our specialties business ready. And I think we are getting ahead of what will be some pent-up demand once we hit an inflection point on these vaccinations. Certainly, people are tired of being at home. They want to travel. They want to get back to life as normal, and that will open things up. And we are gearing up that we should see some of that in the second half of the year. Operator : And next we will hear from Jonas Oxgaard with Bernstein. Jonas Oxgaard : Hey good morning. I was hoping if you could comment on what is happening with your JVs in a bit more detail, particularly the Thai JV, for looking at your Page 14 here. Your EBITDA went down a lot, but your net income went up. And so I\u2019m wondering how well, what happened and how are you going to think about this going forward? And then on Sadara, do you have any preliminary ideas of how we should be thinking about the repayment schedule? James Fitterling : I will hit Thailand, and then I will have Howard cover Sadara. Thailand had some turnaround activity in the quarter, so that was spending that hit them. And then I talked a little bit about that wintertime situation. Essentially, you had a drive up in naphtha costs as all the alternatives went up and so that put some squeeze on in the marketplace. So I don\u2019t think there is anything out of the fourth quarter results that you should look at and think that it is something you should project forward. I think it is very situational. And Howard, maybe you want to talk about Sadara and the payment schedule? Howard Ungerleider : Yes, Jonas, look, thanks for the question. I mean, I couldn\u2019t be prouder of the Dow, the Saudi Aramco and the Sadara team. It is about 18-months worth of work that got us to this point where we have got the agreement in principle with the entire lending syndicate of commercial banks, ECAs as well as the Sukuk investors. So we have got a five-year great period where no principal is due until June of 2026. We have matched the principle from 2026 out to 2038 with the projected earnings and cash flows. And in terms of the next five-years, on a 100% Sadara basis, you are looking at about between $300 million and $350 million of interest expense. So our share would be about $100 million to $125 million a year. But I would say based on Sadara\u2019s current performance as well as all the plans that they have in place, they will be cash flow self-sufficient for this year and going forward. So we do not expect to put any cash into Sadara. So that is a $350 million tailwind year-on-year. Operator : And next, we will move to Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research. Frank Mitsch : Hey good morning and a nice end to the year folks. A very impressive operating rates, Jim, you mentioned for polyethylene on the U.S. Gulf Coast. I was wondering if you could talk at a higher level of what the operating rates for Dow were by the - roughly what they were for the various segments, and what your expectations are as we head here into the first quarter? And just overall, you did mention some debottleneck. There was some start ups. How do we think about the net capacity at Dow 2021 versus 2020? James Fitterling : Yes. Thanks, Frank, for the question. On an average, for the whole company, we were above 80% operating rates for the fourth quarter, and we continue that strength into the first quarter. We were at higher levels than that in our Packaging & Specialty Plastics business. The crackers ran very strong, as I mentioned, in the Gulf Coast. But actually, we saw good performance around the globe, and it continues to tighten up. And you noticed that MEG prices are also starting to rise. So that is really making things move there. We also saw a big step-up in Industrial Solutions. So they are running strong, and we have got new capacity coming to support their growth this year. We had less performance in siloxanes, and that is the one that has the big upside, which I talked about with Vincent\u2019s question in the second half. And then polyurethanes and construction chemicals got back to the 80-plus percent operating rate in the fourth quarter, and that continues into this year. So we still have upside to deliver. We are going to continue to run the assets hard. We have been spending on reliability to make sure that we can deliver more out of those assets. Texas 9 has been a stellar asset in terms of its production. And we have done a lot of work on debottlenecking and reliability in some of the other spaces. So I think we are in a good room for the rest of this year. Operator : And next, we will move to John Roberts with UBS. John Roberts : Thanks and nice quarter, guys. We are reading a lot about how much shipping activities are challenging and freight costs are up a lot. How much is it contributing to the tight markets and higher pricing? And is it impacting more than just polyethylene? James Fitterling : Yes, right, we have seen some shipping rates on marine pack cargo, primarily due to the fact that you have got a container dislocation. China has had some pretty high export levels. And so some empty containers have been moving back to China. Mostly that is been reported in the Ag sector, not so much in the plastic sector. I think our supply chains are pretty well stocked in terms of containers, but we keep a close eye on it. So I don\u2019t anticipate anything that is long-lasting. I think we will work through this. And they just assigned some of the supply chain imbalances. China came back fast from COVID, and we are coming back now. And so things can, from time to time, get dislocated. Operator : And we will move on to Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global. Hassan Ahmed : Good morning Jim. Jim a question around 2021 outlook. Look, I mean, as I sort of heard all your comments about the different product chains. I\u2019m taking a look at the exit pricing sort of levels for be it ethylene, polyethylene and DIY, as we exited 2020, significantly higher than 2020 levels, right average levels. And then it seems supply-demand fundamentals, ethylene, polyethylene, DIYs, should tighten up through the course of 2021. You were alluding to how the turnaround schedule for spring and summer for most of these products is pretty heavy, right? And there seems to be a perception that in the back half of the year, as the vaccine rollout happens, people hit the streets more and the like, oil prices go up higher. So I mean, as I sort of piece together all these things, it seems 2021 earnings could be significantly higher than 2020. I mean, am I missing something here? I mean, is there a fly in the [ointment] (Ph)? James Fitterling : Thank you for the question, Hassan. I think you are on the right path. We not only beat in the fourth quarter, but we guided higher. I want Howard to walk you through the first quarter guidance, and I think that is instructive to the way you are looking at the year. Howard Ungerleider : Yes, Hassan. I mean, we think about it in a very similar way as you. But I mean, look, let\u2019s start one quarter at a time. So if you go from Q4 where we printed the [178] (Ph) from an EBITDA perspective and you look at your comment about margins expanding, you look at polyethylene margins, isocyanate margins, MEG margins, I would bucket about $250 million of higher EBITDA sequentially between all three of those chains just because of your point about ending the year at higher margins and margins moving up. Then I would say you got to take two deducts. There is about $50 million of higher turnaround spending sequentially, really related to the Zongjian plant in China in the siloxanes plant that Jim talked about in the prepared comments. And then there was about $50 million of onetime items that we had in fourth quarter that won\u2019t recur. A couple of land sales as well as an IPO that happened that we were able to monetize in or out of our venture capital. So overall, earnings are going to be up sequentially, and your point is right. They should be up year-on-year. I think the open question, and Jim, maybe give some comments on the back half of the year. But all things right now are pointing up. James Fitterling : Yes. I think the first half looks solid. And I believe that as we get more people vaccinated around the world, I think we are going to see more economies open up and things get back to more normal types of activity. Operator : And next, we will hear from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Kevin McCarthy : Good morning. Question for Howard on cash flow prospects for 2021. Howard, I think you already spoke to the uplift related to Sadara as well as some maintenance activity considerations. Just wondering if you could step through other non-earnings related cash considerations, such as working capital, some of the digital investments you talked about, any cash required for restructuring or other considerations that would help you or be a headwind on the cash generation front versus the impressive conversion numbers you posted for this year? Howard Ungerleider : Yes. I mean, look, I would point you to the full year 2021 modeling guidance slide, but just a couple of the high points. So CapEx is going to be $350 million higher. Mandatory pension will be flat. The restructuring program will be about a $350 million cash outflow, but we won\u2019t have any outflow. We finished the DowDuPont separation. So those basically offset each other. On the digital side, we will spend about $150 million, but Sadara will be $350 million tailwind as I talked about. The dividends from our JV companies will be down about $200 million just because we get those dividends from - in about a year in arrears. So with earnings down in 2020, we will see dividends down in 2021, but that should reverse in 2022. And then I would say, look, we had a number of non-operating cash flows in 2020, and we are probably not going to be able to deliver the same number because that was a big number. We delivered $5 million of free cash flow out of this machine, which was the best performance since 2013 on an apples-to-apples basis as best you can construct it, but we will have additional tailwinds. So we are working on additional structural improvements in working capital. In the fourth quarter, you saw some of that shine through. We had working capital be a source of cash, even though sales was up, which is hard to do. So we will look to get another $250 million or $300 million of structural improvement in working capital. We still have the top-up payment from the second Nova litigation. That is still going through the court. So we will see if that is a 2021 event, but that should still be several hundred million dollars. And then we are still working on best owner lens that don\u2019t sail. So I don\u2019t have a number for you. But if we are able to deliver on those projects, that should also be several hundred million dollars, probably in the back half of the year. Operator : And we will move on to John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets. John McNulty : Yes. Thanks for taking my questions. So I guess to that, like the cash flows are coming in certainly stronger-than-expected and at really high levels, and the balance sheet\u2019s really been cleaned up. You have been doing this best owner approach and have sold off some assets. Looking at it from a slightly different angle, are there assets out there where Dow should be viewed as kind of the best owner? And should we think about M&A as an opportunity for you as we look forward or is the cash flow that you generate really just going to be going down to paying down debt and whatever is left over taking down the share count? How should we be thinking about that? James Fitterling : Good morning John. Let\u2019s walk through capital allocation priorities real quickly. Still, first and foremost, is safely and reliably operate the plants. That costs us about $1 billion a year. Continues to support that dividend, that is about $2 billion to $2.1 billion a year. We have got some further incremental deleveraging that we need to do in 2021, keep us on trajectory with what we have committed to the ratings agencies. We have got additional priorities to make sure that we are ready for the, I think, the pent-up demand that is coming as we reach these vaccination rates. So we have bumped up incremental growth CapEx. And as Howard said, we will have some cash to buy back shares toward the end of the year to cover dilution. Although if you look at our share count, we have been very steady since the spin. And now on top of that, to your point, most of the divestitures and the cash generation have been taking assets that are nonrevenue generating, where there are infrastructure companies out there today that value those and can use those as a growth platform and liberating those from our balance sheet, we will continue to do that. On the other side, we will look at bolt-on M&A. We have talked about that being not in the billions, but smaller. And that is where we can bring in a technology or a gap in our platform and take advantage of our global footprint to really rapidly grow that as well as get that into our machine and get some economies of scale out of it. So those are some of the things we are looking at, and there are areas that are driven by the market trends that we are seeing on building and construction, mobility space, 5G, these are some of the areas where we want to continue to try to build in the areas of adhesives, sealants, coatings types applications. Operator : And our next question, we will hear from Chris Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Christopher Parkinson : Great, thank you. On the PE front, obviously, throughout 2020, there is a lot of volatility in feedstock throughout the cost curve. When we look ahead and for normalized P&SP EBITDA, just how is your team overall thinking about the slope of the cost curve as we head into 2022 and 2023? And what are the key considerations they are monitoring? Thank you. James Fitterling : Right. I think we get back primarily to feedstock and what is going to happen with feedstock volatility. And, of course, we saw such huge volatility in oil last year. Most of our feedstock is natural gas liquids. And gas production has been very resilient. And I think gas production is going to continue to be strong next year. We didn\u2019t see much of a decrease last year, maybe 10%, and we are already getting back to the levels that we had prior to the COVID pandemic. The other thing that people aren\u2019t forecasting in some of the natural gas outlooks is the fact that there are so many drilled and uncompleted wells out there, and companies are moving up the learning curve on being able to get those wells completed. And so I think that is going to bring back a lot of supply in the back half of the year. Even with that ethylene tightness I talked about, even with propane going up because of wintertime and even with naphtha going up because you didn\u2019t have as much refining capacity, the reality was ethane was still in supply, even at 75%, one million BTU crack spread. And I think it is going to continue to stay that way, that natural gas production is going to bring back more ethane to get split out here. So I feel good about our position. We have the capability to capture that better than anybody in the industry. And I think we are in for a year ahead where our view, natural gas is kind of range bound and $3, one million BTU is probably the high end. Operator : And next, we will hear from Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Arun Viswanathan : Great, thanks for taking my question. Good morning, congratulations on the quarter and the year. I guess my question is back to the cash flow. So it looks like you are guiding to about $250 million overall reduction from some of those bucket items, Howard. But EBITDA is likely to be up year-on-year in 2021, just given the absence of that weak Q2. So you have seen up the balance sheet. When we started this journey, I think you guys have laid out a plan to return about 65% of your free cash flow to shareholders. So maybe you can just comment on what you think about free cash flow for 2021, and why not allocate a little bit more to the capital return side, the buyback side, do you see free cash flow above that $5 billion and again, is there a preference maybe to increase towards buybacks? Thanks. Howard Ungerleider : Yes. I mean, Arun, good morning. What I would say is, look, our target, which has been our target since before spin is really a long-term rating agency adjusted net debt-to-EBITDA target of between 2.5 and three. And so we are above that today by about 150 basis points, really mainly because of the lower EBITDA as well as the lower interest rates, which really drove another $1 billion increase on the pension side of the house. So we still have some work to do, and that is why we are going to do about $1 billion roughly of deleveraging. It is our target for 2021, on top of all the other things that I said. But we understand your point, and we agree with it. And certainly, as earnings continue to improve, we will take another hard look at share buyback at a minimum to cover dilution. And then we will see how the back half of the year goes. We will all see how some of those best owner projects that we are working on goes. And if we have excess cash, we will use that excess cash, aligned with Jim\u2019s capital allocation priorities that he walked through earlier. Operator : And that will conclude today\u2019s question-and-answer session. At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to Colleen Kay for any additional or closing remarks. Colleen Kay : Thank you, everyone, for joining our call today. We appreciate your interest in Dow. For your reference, a copy of our transcript will be posted on Dow\u2019s website within 24 hours. This concludes our call. Have a great day. Operator : And that will conclude today\u2019s call. We thank you for your participation.",

Please go ahead, sir. Pankaj Gupta : Good morning. Thank you for joining Dow\u2019s first quarter earnings call. This call is available via our webcast and we have prepared slides to supplement our comments today. They are posted on the Investor Relations section of Dow\u2019s website and through the link to our webcast. I am Pankaj Gupta, Investor Relations Vice President for Dow and joining me on the call today are Jim Fitterling, Dow\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Howard Ungerleider, President and Chief Financial Officer. Please read the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the earnings news release and slides. During our call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding our expectations or predictions about the future. Because these statements are based on current assumptions and factors that involve risks and uncertainties, our actual performance and results may differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Dow\u2019s Forms 10-Q and 10-K include detailed discussions of principal risks and uncertainties, which may cause such differences. Unless otherwise specified, all financials, where applicable, exclude significant items. We will also refer to non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures is contained in the Dow earnings release, in the slides that supplement our comments today and on the Dow website. On Slide 2, you will see our agenda for the call. Jim will begin with the first quarter highlights and will discuss the company\u2019s operating segment performance. Howard will provide our modeling guidance and our latest benchmarking performance. And then Jim will close with an update on our plastics circularity roadmap and market outlook. Following that, we will take your questions. With that, I will turn the call over to Jim. Jim Fitterling : Thank you, Pankaj and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Before we begin, I would like to recognize and thank Colleen Kay, who announced her retirement from Dow after over 31 years of outstanding service and also to welcome back Pankaj Gupta, who many of you already know. Starting on Slide 3, our results for the first quarter once again demonstrated the focus and agility of Team Dow which enabled us to quickly recover from the impact of winter storm Uri on the U.S. Gulf Coast. This event had a far-reaching impact across our industry and broader market. Our colleagues quickly and safely got our units back online some of which began coming up within a week of the storm. All impacted Dow units are back online and we have reached pre-storm operating rates by the end of March ahead of plan. Our team\u2019s efforts, combined with improving demand and tight industry supply conditions, drove results higher than the updated guidance we shared last month at the JPMorgan Investor Conference. At the company level, Dow achieved double-digit growth on the top and bottom lines, both year-over-year and sequentially. A few highlights in particular. Sales were up 22% year-over-year, with gains in all operating segments and in every region. We continued to benefit from strong price momentum with improvements in all segments, businesses and regions. Volume was in line with the year ago period as gains in construction, mobility, electronics and consumer durables end markets as well as higher energy demand were offset by supply constraints from the storm and we continue to improve our working capital efficiency with a net improvement of 3 days. Sales were also up sequentially with growth in all segments and regions. This top line growth and our continued focus on cost discipline led to bottom line growth and our highest EBIT quarter since spin. We achieved more than $700 million of EBIT growth from the year ago period and $500 million sequentially. We delivered equity earnings improvements of more than $300 million led by Sadara. Earlier this month, Sadara with help from Dow and Saudi Aramco worked to bring its mixed feed cracker back online faster than anticipated and downstream production units are also back at expected rates. We also completed key structural changes to our U.S. defined benefit pension plans in the quarter, which reduced the company\u2019s pension liability. Cash flow from operations was more than $750 million, excluding a $1 billion elective pension contribution. And Dow, Saudi Aramco and Sadara completed the joint venture\u2019s debt re-profiling, which will provide approximately $350 million cash tailwind to Dow in 2021. Sadara is now expected to be cash flow self-sufficient. In summary, Team Dow remained agile in an extremely dynamic business environment to deliver strong top and bottom line growth, positioning Dow for greater value creation going forward. Moving to our segment performance on Slide 4, in the Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment, operating EBIT was $1.2 billion, up nearly $650 million versus the same quarter last year and $448 million sequentially. Resilient demand, tight market supply, disciplined price volume management and polyethylene inventory levels at 5-year lows enabled momentum in polyethylene earnings. The Packaging & Specialty Plastics business achieved double-digit sales gains year-over-year and sequentially driven by local price momentum in all regions. Versus the year ago period, local price gains were led by improvement in industrial and consumer packaging and flexible food and beverage packaging applications. Moving to the Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure segment, operating EBIT was $326 million, up $151 million year-over-year due to strong supply and demand fundamentals in polyurethanes and construction chemicals and higher equity earnings led by continued improvement from Sadara. Sequentially, operating EBIT improved $30 million despite significant impact from winter storm Uri. The polyurethanes and construction and chemicals business achieved a double-digit net sales increase compared to the year ago period, led by local price momentum in polyurethanes. Demand growth in consumer durables and appliances and industrial end markets was more than offset by volume limitations on the U.S. Gulf Coast and other third-party supply constraints related to the storm. These pricing and volume dynamics also drove sequential sales growth. The Industrial Solutions business delivered net sales in line with the year ago period as higher prices in all regions were offset by volume constraints primarily due to winter storm Uri. Improved demand in textiles and electronics applications was more than offset by supply limitations. Net sales were also in line sequentially due to the same drivers. And finally, the Performance Materials & Coatings segment reported operating EBIT of $62 million down year-over-year as local price gains across the portfolio and strong demand for architectural coatings and silicones applications were more than offset by the impact of the winter storm as well as planned maintenance. Sequentially, operating EBIT was up $12 million. The Consumer Solutions business achieved higher net sales year-over-year on local price increases for siloxane and robust demand for consumer, electronics and mobility applications. These gains more than offset the impact from planned maintenance. Sequentially, the business delivered local price gains across all regions and achieved sequential volume gains in all regions except Asia-Pacific, where strong gains in performance silicones were more than offset by planned maintenance downtime at our Zhangjiagang siloxanes asset. The Coatings and Performance Monomers business delivered higher net sales year-over-year, driven by price gains in all regions, notably in acryling monomers due to strong supply and demand fundamentals. Supply constraints from winter storm Uri and planned maintenance at our Deer Park asset more than offset continued demand strength for architectural coatings. Sequentially, the business achieved price gains, particularly in accruing monomers due to increases in raw material costs. I will now turn it over to Howard to review modeling guidance and the results of our annual benchmarking. Howard Ungerleider : Thank you, Jim. Moving to Slide 5, as we turn to the second quarter, market demand remains robust in packaging, electronics, mobility, architectural coatings as well as consumer durable end markets. While sectors like home care have begun to normalize, we do expect additional upside on continuing economic recovery in the industrial sector. And as travel, workplace and social activities resume, they will also provide a boost in demand for higher margin personal care applications as well as across the service sectors of the global economy. These constructive market trends will continue to support top and bottom line growth across all Dow operating segments in the second quarter. We are entering turnaround season in the Northern Hemisphere and we expect increased spending of approximately $125 million sequentially, particularly in the U.S. Gulf Coast, including a turnaround at one of our crackers in Louisiana. We also expect an additional $100 million from outages, including a third-party supply disruption on the U.S. Gulf Coast. Collectively, robust demand, tight supply, low inventories and increased raw material costs are providing support for prices across many of our value chains. We expect the constrained industry inventory levels to continue in the second quarter, preventing inventory builds until later this year as we focus on clearing the growing backlog of customer orders. All combined for the second quarter, we expect approximately $750 million to $800 million in higher earnings versus the prior quarter from a combination of earnings momentum in our key chains and lower sequential costs from winter storm Uri. This earnings growth will be partially offset by approximately $200 million to $250 million in higher costs from turnarounds and the third-party outage I mentioned. Altogether, we expect second quarter to be our strongest performance since spin. Moving to Slide 6, we are also updating a few key items in our full year modeling guidance. The positive momentum I just mentioned will also benefit our joint ventures, particularly Sadara. We also expect to see slightly higher turnaround spending than previously anticipated as winter storm Uri has put some upward pressure on the cost of materials and labor in the U.S. Gulf Coast. Finally, our decision to freeze our U.S. pension plan accruals and contribute $1 billion to the U.S. pension plan, along with the subsequent remeasurement, provides an approximately $200 million tailwind to pension expense year-over-year. Overall, for the remainder of the year, we continue to see broad-based economic momentum, recovery from winter storm Uri and elevated consumer demand. Moving to Slide 7, today, we also released our annual benchmarking update, which is available on our investor website and in this earnings presentation. I continue to be very proud of our team\u2019s efforts to achieve top quartile results across most of our peer comparison performance metrics. To summarize our results, at the enterprise level, our focus on cash extended Dow\u2019s advantage on EBITDA to cash flow conversion and enabled free cash flow performance above peers, above the industry as well as above the broader market. This supported our continued leading dividend yield and further strengthened our balance sheet even through the pandemic. We also maintained our top quartile cost management and margin performance. At a segment level, Packaging & Specialty Plastics outperformed the pure median across adjusted operating EBITDA margin, free cash conversion and SG&A and R&D spend. And Dow\u2019s operating EBITDA per pound of polyolefins capacity continues to outperform peers, expanding further in 2020. Both industrial intermediates and infrastructure as well as Performance Materials and Coatings, outperformed the pure median on cash conversion as well as on SG&A and R&D spend. We do see near-term opportunities to improve adjusted operating EBITDA growth by continuing to implement our faster payback, higher ROIC expansions. This includes our ethylene cracker expansion in Canada, our FCDh retrofit, our polyglycols expansion and our downstream silicones expansions as well. And projects like the South China Specialties Hub will enable us to capture higher value polyurethane systems and alkoxylates demand in the fast growing Asia-Pacific market. Looking ahead, we are well positioned to grow earnings and maintain our track record of cash generation. Our differentiated consumer-led portfolio with leading positions across most of the markets we serve enables us to capture growth in our key value chains and ongoing market recovery in automotive and personal care. For example, in the mobility global megatrend alone, electric vehicles use 3x to 4x more Dow silicone products than traditional vehicles. Together, our strong operational, financial and commercial playbook supported by the broadening economic recovery, positions Dow well for future earnings and cash flow growth. With that, I will turn it back to Jim. Jim Fitterling : Thank you, Howard. Moving to Slide 8, before discussing the market outlook, I want to reinforce how sustainability continues to be another growth driver for Dow. Last quarter, we shared our roadmap to achieving our 2030 carbon reduction targets. And this past week, Columbia University and the Nature Conservancy announced our partnership to better account for the role of the materials and sustainable applications play in achieving emissions reduction, including plastics. Plastics have a lower carbon footprint than traditional materials and we are leading the way to a circular economy for plastics. Through our stop the waste and close the loop targets, we are enabling 1 million metric tons of plastics to be collected, reused or recycled by 2030 and targeting 100% of our products sold into packaging applications to be reusable or recyclable by 2035. These targets require innovation and collaboration in mechanical and advanced recycling, as well as in designing for recyclability. To that end, through collaboration across the value chain with Dow\u2019s Pack Studios, we are working to accelerate sustainable packaging solutions, tailor-made for those customers and consumer brand owners, many of which have set targets to incorporate 25% or more post consumer recycled material in their products. We are helping consumer brands design their packaging to be fully recyclable. Our collaborations to develop fully formulated recyclable packaging solutions include developments with Kellogg\u2019s Kashi Bear Naked granola, Reckitt Benckiser\u2019s finished dishwashing detergent and China\u2019s leading laundry brand, Liby, each enable a larger addressable market and sales of higher value Dow materials. We sell products containing mechanically recycled materials in every geography and now we are beginning to scale a family of products that can be used in either flexible or rigid packaging applications. Dow is also developing advanced recycling technologies that convert used plastics into their feedstocks. We continue to scale up these capabilities with our partner, Fuenix Ecogy Group. And today, we announced a partnership with Mura Technology to convert plastics back into the oils and chemicals from which they were made for use in new virgin equivalent plastic products. This revolutionary advanced recycling technology can convert all forms of plastic into feedstock, including many considered to be unrecyclable. We are also actively engaged as a founder of the alliance to end plastic waste and with key stakeholders around the world to help solve critical challenges to plastics recycling. For example, through our collaboration with Circulate Capital, Dow is bringing material science capabilities to Lucro Plastecycle and Marico Limited, one of India\u2019s leading consumer brands to enable sustainable, flexible film packaging with recycled content. Our actions to advance plastic circularity are value-accretive to Dow, and our differentiated product slate, downstream knowledge, intimacy with consumer brands and strategic partnerships give us a leading edge to capture this growth. Turning to Slide 9, as Howard mentioned, Dow remains well positioned to benefit from improving industry and market conditions. We see several positive leading indicators, including momentum and job growth, consumer spending, a return to air travel and expanding manufacturing and industrial activity for global manufacturing PMI to a 15-year high in March. These trends are further supported by government stimulus measures and accelerating vaccine rollouts globally. The spending elements of the U.S. infrastructure plan, if passed, will further support growth in our downstream markets. Similarly, incentives aligned to more sustainable energy solutions should be beneficial to our business and to attaining our own sustainability targets. These programs are not currently included in our assumptions, but could drive additional growth if enacted in a manner that supports manufacturing competitiveness. These macro trends translate into a 1x to 2x GDP growth across key end markets including packaging, infrastructure, mobility, consumer durables and industrials and home and personal care. Given this backdrop, we see demand in our key value chains continuing to outpace supply throughout 2021 and staying balanced in the near-term across ethylene, polyethylene, polyurethanes, acrylics and silicones chains. Some industry views call for softening conditions in the near-term, largely based on their view of planned capacity additions. However, these views do not account for industry project delays or cancellations nor do they account for the maintenance activity or reliability impact from weather related events like the winter storm. Industry delays and cancellations of planned capacity additions, along with elevated demand growth as the global economy continues to reopen, will likely lead to tighter than predicted market conditions, all of which will result in continued earnings, margin and cash flow growth for our core businesses and joint ventures in the near-term. And while we capture these improved earnings over the next several years in our core businesses, our current slate of lower capital, faster payback and higher return capacity expansions will add nearly $1 billion of accretive earnings to our bottom line. Dow\u2019s points of distinction continue to raise our earnings and cash flow potential relative to peers. The market growth we expect in our business, combined with our industry leading feedstock flexibility, global scale and advantaged cost positions, our top quartile cash generation and our innovation and leadership in high growth end markets enable Dow to continue to deliver value for our owners through 2021 and over the foreseeable future. With that, I will turn it back to Pankaj to open the Q&A. Pankaj Gupta : Thank you, Jim. Now let\u2019s move on to your questions. I would like to remind you that our forward-looking statements apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. Operator, please provide the Q&A instructions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will move to our first question from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. David Begleiter : Thank you. Good morning. Jim and Howard, in plastics, how are you thinking about sequential earnings improvement here given the price margin growth we are seeing, can you get to $2 billion of EBITDA in Q2, is that possible? Jim Fitterling : Good morning David, as you noted, obviously, we continue to see strong demand growth in plastics. And if you look at our sales, we are looking at 3% to 7% higher sales in the quarter. And obviously, operating rates should be much improved given that we won\u2019t have the impact of winter storm Uri. We do have some turnarounds, as Howard mentioned, so we have a Louisiana Cracker that\u2019s down. But having said that, it looks like supply is going to be greater than demand for the foreseeable future. I don\u2019t anticipate we will be looking at any kind of an inventory build until probably the fourth quarter. And so with that, kind of a year that feels like 13 months of demand and 11 months of supply, and it looks like raw material costs are going to continue to remain low. Operator : And next, we will move to Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Bob Koort : Thanks. Good morning. I appreciate the benchmarking information. That was helpful. I am curious you showed already a pretty considerable cash flow yield, and that\u2019s before the ramp in earnings. I think you have outlined a couple of projects, handful there that would get you maybe an incremental $1 billion of EBITDA. Can you give us a sense of the cost and cadence of that incremental earnings growth? And then how are you going to deploy all the excess cash given those industry outlook slides that was on Page 9? Look pretty darn good for quite a while. So are you going to change your capital deployment strategy here? What are your plans there? Jim Fitterling : Yes. Thanks Bob for the question and a lot in that question. And I feel good, given that we had about a $400 million impact from winter storm Uri in the quarter, we delivered $750 million of cash from operations. Obviously, we took an elective pension contribution in the quarter, but our cash flow generation continues to remain strong. We stepped up CapEx this year to a little over $1.6 billion to get our growth CapEx coming back up. And all of that is on faster payback types of projects. So for example, we started up a polyethylene glycol facility in the first quarter down in the Gulf Coast, which will be accretive this year. We also just brought on another furnace in Fort Saskatchewan. The furnace part is active. So about half of the benefits of that will start now, and we will do some work on the back end of the cracker towards the end of the year and bring on the other half of that capacity. So, if you think about the incremental projects that we have to deliver that $1 billion, I feel like we can be increasing capital towards depreciation and still be able to deliver that $1 billion of EBITDA growth. And then obviously, we want to continue to support the dividend. And if you think about our capital allocation priorities, they are in order safely and reliably operate the plants, continue to support that industry leading dividend, the growth CapEx, I mentioned, some incremental gross deleveraging. So, we have got another $1 billion of targeted gross deleveraging to get our net debt to EBITDA ratios where we targeted them. And then share buyback to cover dilution. And right now, that\u2019s where we will stop on share buyback. Anything you want to add, Howard? Howard Ungerleider : You covered it. Operator : And next, we will move on to Jeffrey Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Jeffrey Zekauskas : Thanks very much. Are you satisfied with your returns in Performance Materials & Coatings? And what does that segment need to do to raise its operating output? And secondly, on pension expense, you talked about a $200 million pension tailwind, what exactly is your pension expense roughly in 2021? Jim Fitterling : Yes, let me take Performance Materials & Coatings, and I will have Howard talk about the pension expense. Both businesses in Performance Materials & Coatings had some downtime and some maintenance costs in the first quarter. So, I think when you are looking at first quarter results, that isn\u2019t reflective of the market demand in the marketplace. We had the siloxanes plant in China down, and we had the Deer Park facility down for maintenance. And then, of course, the winter storm really lengthened that maintenance. The demand for both of the products is improving and the pricing for siloxanes, which has been one of the bigger drags on consumer solutions, is starting to move in the right direction. And a lot of that is because automotive demand is coming back and construction is coming back. And we have yet to see personal care, which I think is going to come back through the year. And on top of coatings and monomers, monomers were strong in the quarter. Architectural coatings and specialty do-it-yourself continues to be strong. Industrial is starting to show improvement as automotive comes back. And of course, as air travel begins, we will start to see a big part of industrial come back as well. Howard, on pension? Howard Ungerleider : Yes. Jeff, good morning, pension expense, when you look at pension and OPEB, it\u2019s around $100 million is our expected expense this year, which is going to be down a couple of hundred million dollars as we talked about in the prepared remarks. Operator : And next, we will move to P.J. Juvekar with Citi. P.J. Juvekar: Yes. Hi, good morning, a couple of quick questions on polyethylene, the peak like margins that the industry is seeing today in that $0.40, $0.50 range per pound. If that remains elevated, could you see incentive to add more supply, particularly in China? And then just on sticking to polyethylene, Jim you guys have done a great job on circular economy and alliance to in plastic waste. On bioplastics, there are these small companies coming up. You had that PLA technology down in Brazil. Does that still exist within Dow now? I know that was shutdown. And can you revive that if the demand takes off in biopolyethylene? Jim Fitterling : Good morning P.J., and the margins in polyethylene, I think, are reflective of a couple of things; improved spreads in ethylene, and that obviously has been driven by the fact that ethane costs remain low, natural gas costs remain low, and oil has recovered from kind of an unreal scenario a year ago today. And that\u2019s raised, obviously, the naphtha pricing and that\u2019s raised the floor around the world. The other thing that\u2019s happened though is we had growth in plastics and packaging, even through COVID. And so most people were expecting businesses to be down during that time. And I think they underestimated how much growth is there. We are seeing growth over 2020 in plastics. We would have seen in the first quarter without the winter storm. And so we are going to see that continue to grow. So, I think we have got continued outlook for high earnings through the year on plastics. On bioplastics, we are doing some work right now on biomaterials to make plastics, really looking at wood byproduct derivatives that we can use to blend in with naphtha. We are doing some work with Fuenix Ecogy Group to bring recycled materials back in. One of the challenges with bioplastics is not so much the degradability that everybody in the market likes, but it\u2019s their thermal stability in terms of being able to form them and do what you need to do with them, and then have them have the kind of durability you need for food packaging. But we are open to collaborations in those areas, and we are always looking for new things that we can do in that space. Operator : And we will move on to Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research. Frank Mitsch : Hey, good morning and good to hear your voice again, Pankaj. As I look at these results, pretty impressive results, and you had 14% price improvement in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter. How does April stand relative to the first quarter? And just more generally, what\u2019s your expectations on price throughout 2021? Jim Fitterling : Good morning Frank, we have got $0.09 up for April and another $0.05 up for May in the U.S. and the April order book is very solid. So, I think that\u2019s a strong, strong probability. Look, in most of our businesses beyond even plastics, the order book for the first quarter is very solid. A combination of some backlog that got created from the winter storm and just the normal demand by the year-over-year improvements we see in construction, we see in automotive, we see in consumer durables, we see in electronics. So, my feeling is that it\u2019s constructive for the year and our outlook for raw materials costs are going to continue to remain low throughout the year. Operator : And Steve Byrne with Bank of America will have our next question. Steve Byrne : Yes, thank you. Jim, you made a few remarks earlier about outages, you have got turnarounds, you have got new supply coming, a lot of moving parts in industry operating rates. And I just wanted to ask you to put that into perspective on your \u2013 on the Slide 9 that has your multiyear outlook on industry operating rates for polyethylene, MDI and siloxane. How would you compare those forecasts to current industry operating rates? Jim Fitterling : Yes. Good morning, Steve. It\u2019s a good question because I think most of the third-party views out there are kind of taking the worst case scenario. And so that would be the bottom end of what we think the ranges of operating rates are. We are going to be in the 90s in both ethylene and polyethylene for the quarter, unless there is some unplanned event. And as we sit here today, there is probably about 15% of that capacity off-line, which is well in excess of what we normally have. We normally have probably 6% to 8% off-line. Same is true for polyurethanes and isocyanates. You see the downstream demand pull is very strong. And siloxanes pricing improvements is all driven by downstream demand improvements. So, my sense is that we are going to be in strong operating rate territory for the entire year. I don\u2019t think we will be building inventory until maybe possibly the end of fourth quarter, which \u2013 and that all depends on whether we have a slow fourth quarter or not. But there is upside in automotive, there is upside in travel, there is upside in construction and home, there is backlog in appliances and long lead times. Everything is pointing in the direction of high operating rates. Operator : And next, we will hear from Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global. Hassan Ahmed : Good morning Howard and Jim. I wanted to sort of quickly ask you about the sequential guidance you guys gave. If I heard Howard correctly, it sounds as if he is talking about a sort of between the positives and negatives, around a $600 million uptick sequentially. So call it $2.8 billion, $2.9 billion in Q2 EBITDA. So, my question is that if that is the guidance, what sort of pricing is being baked into that guidance? Meaning, obviously, you guys talked about around of April price hikes, there seems to be another round of price hikes on the table for May. So that guidance that you are giving, is it capturing both April and May price hikes, meaningful realization of those hikes? Jim Fitterling : Yes. If you look at IHS forward view on pricing, they have got $0.12 a pound quarter-over-quarter for the United States. And in Europe, they have actually got a reduction, a slight reduction, and Pacific they have got a slight reduction. My sense is that the U.S. margins are going to see that and I think we\u2019re going to continue to see demand strong in China. We\u2019ve seen a good rebound there. And then in Europe, we\u2019ve seen good demand. It hasn\u2019t been as strong as the rest of the world. Obviously, the virus, it\u2019s had a little bit more impact. And Latin America has been similarly hit a little bit hard with the virus. But I think as the quarter progresses, I think we have the potential to see that firm up a little bit. Howard Ungerleider : Hassan, this is Howard. The only thing I would add is your math that you articulated in your question is spot on. Operator : And John Roberts with UBS will have our next question. John Roberts : Thanks. Good morning guys. Could you talk a little bit about the Sadara restructuring? I think Dow\u2019s exports from Sadara was a key part of Dow\u2019s Asia growth strategy. So do you need something else now to backfill as you lose a little access here to some of the Sadara output? Jim Fitterling : Yes, I\u2019m going to ask Howard to talk about that because he and the team did a lot of heavy lifting to get that done. But on the growth side, that\u2019s where we will be looking at some incremental investments, including on the ground in China for specialty hub to be able to convert differentiated PU and alkoxylates for high-growth in Asia Pacific. And we\u2019re also looking at incremental expansions that we could make in the U.S. to be able to supply more material over there. Howard? Howard Ungerleider : Yes. John, good morning. The Sadara re-profiling is done. As you know, it was \u2013 it took us about 2 years to get it all done, but we got it done within the timeframe that we committed to. The maturity date is now extended out to 2038. There was no upfront or prepayment of any of the outstanding debt. There is a grace period until June of 2026 on any principle, and the guarantees were significantly reduced. When you look at Sadara\u2019s operating performance, it really was a standout. I mean, all of our joint ventures did well in line with our core earnings growth that we reported. But when you look at the threee joint ventures, Sadara actually had the best earnings growth, both year-on-year, as well as sequentially. And if they keep up this pace, they likely will be paying off some additional principal still this year, which was not expected when we did the re-profiling. So really strong performance from Sadara. Operator : And next, we will move to Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Laurence Alexander : Good morning. On the plans that you sketch out for advanced recycling, can you \u2013 do you have initial thoughts on likely capital intensity or where they\u2019ll fit on the cost curve? Would it be competitive of naphtha? Jim Fitterling : Yes, Laurence, and thanks for the question. This is one of the things I think that everybody is trying to wrestle with, and it\u2019s a very local issue because it gets into a variety of moving parts, including what\u2019s the cost to landfill materials. I would say that the demand pull is there from the brand owners and from the marketplace for more recycled content, and that\u2019s what\u2019s driving the investments. To date, most of the investments have been around mechanical recycling because it\u2019s very low cost, and it\u2019s also low energy intensity. And so the growth in those applications is great. But there is a limit to what that can do. So when you get into flexible packaging and a few other areas, you need advanced recycling. And there you get into technologies like pyrolysis and gasification to make that happen. And that\u2019s a little bit more expensive. So as we move forward, I would think we\u2019re going to need to see a market-related price on carbon, which has been discussed in the EU and is also going to start being discussed here in the United States to help create that gap and that value will drive that return. And it\u2019s a little bit early to get into huge capital numbers or return numbers. What we\u2019re doing today is piloting different technologies, trying to prove out business models that work. And then once we see what works and we can replicate it, we will come back and we will talk more about what the investment looks like. Operator : And Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley will have our next question. Vincent Andrews : Thank you and good morning. Just a quick housekeeping for Howard. What is the unfunded pension liability post the $1 billion contribution? And then maybe, Jim, just a follow-up on the prior discussion, you put this press release out by the partnership between yourselves and Mura on a new game-changing advanced recycling solution. I\u2019ve just been eyeballing it, and I can\u2019t tell if you\u2019re making a financial contribution or if you\u2019re just taking the off take and sort of what you think the time frame and scalability of it is, but maybe you could give us just a little bit more discussion of this new partnership. Thank you. Howard Ungerleider : Hi, Vince. Good morning. This is Howard. So our underfunded status on the pension plan at the end of the quarter was $6.4 billion, and that was a decrease or an improvement of $2.3 billion versus year-end 2020, which is a combination of the voluntary contribution plus the remeasurement that we took at the end of the quarter. Jim Fitterling : Yes, and on Mura, it\u2019s really taking advantage of their technology to use all forms of plastic waste, some of which I mentioned are unrecyclable today. So we will make an investment, it\u2019s not a material investment in terms of dollars to help scale the technology, but we will also increase the amount of advanced recycled material as feedstock for our own assets. The pilot facility is going to be in the UK and it\u2019s a hydrothermal plastic recycling solution that is developed by Mura. And we will continue to work with them to prove that out. And to help develop products that will perform in the marketplace to drive growth in that sector. Operator : And we will move on to John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets. John McNulty : Yes. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, maybe two quick ones. Just on the equity line, it looks like you\u2019re guiding to $400 million to $500 million for the year, you just did just about two and quarter in the first quarter. Is there some seasonality or some one-time thing that we should be thinking about in that? And then just on the inventory side, I think you mentioned specialty or packaging, specialty plastics is going to be really tight through into the fourth quarter. I guess, can you give us some color as to what you\u2019re seeing in the Performance Mats and Coatings area and the II&I area if it\u2019s equally as tight on the inventory front or if there is a little bit more cushion there and maybe can be made up quicker? Thanks very much. Jim Fitterling : I think on \u2013 when you get into Polyurethanes and II&I, Polyols is very tight right now, and I expect that to continue to be the case. And isocyanates will have good operating rates through the year as this demand in construction and also automotive continues to grow. If you looked at coatings, I expect monomers to be tight through the year given the improvements in downstream coatings. And obviously, architectural has been strong. If we see a boost up in the do-it-yourself or the contract side of coatings market, then we could see another leg up and some more tightness in that sector. Howard Ungerleider : Yes. And I would just say on, John, on the equity earnings line, your math is right. There is some seasonality to think about MEG out of equate, but also there is higher turnaround expenses. So you got a higher turnaround expenses in Sadara this year, as well as Thailand, as well as the Kuwait. So you\u2019ve got to subtract that extra $100 million plus from the turnaround as well. Operator : And next, we will move to Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Kevin McCarthy : Yes. Good morning. If I look at your second quarter guide, it seems to imply for the first half that you would earn somewhere north of $5 billion in EBITDA and annualized that, of course, would be more than $10 billion. How would you compare and contrast that sort of level versus your view of Dow\u2019s future peak earnings power when you take into account your price margin outlook, the organic investments that you talked about and other sources of growth? Jim Fitterling : Thanks, Kevin. And I think normally, when we go into the year, second quarter and third quarter tend to be our peak quarters. Obviously, things tighten up in first quarter, and so we saw a really strong first quarter result as well. So my sense is we had gone into this year, trying to get back to mid-cycle earnings. I think we\u2019re ahead of that in some sectors and we will be that way. And with our spending on really these fast payback projects, some of them which have payback less than 3 years. I think that has the ability to move the top side up. Howard, do you want to comment on the range on what peak earnings could look like? Howard Ungerleider : Yes. Kevin, look, when we came out at spin, we were looking at the capital structure and that whole discussion. We talked about trough earnings around $6 billion. Last year, it was $5.6 million. So we were definitely in a trough. We got there because of the pandemic more than anything else. And peak earnings with the portfolio at spin was between $12 billion and $13 billion. And now we continue to add additional incremental growth projects from there. So you pick a number, but we still have a significant amount of upside as you head into, hopefully, a continued economic up cycle from here, even with that first half annualized that you talk about. Operator : And next, we will move to Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Arun Viswanathan : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the strong results here. I guess, similar question. When you think about the segments here, first off with PM&C, obviously, continues to struggle. What is it really going to take to get that business back to normal? Is it just a resumption of personal care and mobility as you discussed earlier? And then similarly, with II&I, we\u2019ve seen a pretty strong move in MDI, especially in China and in Asia earlier. Do you expect that to kind of come over to North America and Europe in the coming months? Thanks. Jim Fitterling : Good morning, Arun. Look, I just want to go back to the first quarter comment on PM&C. So I don\u2019t think the first quarter is reflective of the market for PM&C. And I don\u2019t think the business continues to struggle. Downstream silicon is the high-margin part of Silicones downstream got hit pretty hard during COVID, obviously, personal care applications. But also we saw construction down really last year, and it\u2019s starting to come back. So right now, you\u2019re starting to see strength in siloxane, you\u2019re starting to see strength in construction. Mostly it\u2019s been residential construction, but it\u2019s moving back into high rise buildings. Again, consumer electronics is driving it. Industrial manufacturing is driving it, and mobility, as Howard mentioned. EVs is really positive for us on a Dow overall standpoint. We get about twice \u2013 50% more content on an EVs than an internal combustion engine. On a silicon standpoint, we\u2019ve got about 3 to 4x more than an internal combustion engine. So we\u2019re seeing surges there. So I think you\u2019re going to see PM&C improve as the year goes through. And obviously, we\u2019d had a much better quarter without the Deer Park downtime and the extension of that due to the winter storm Uri. So I would say, let\u2019s look at PM&C as the year progresses. I think you\u2019re going to see a good story coming out of that business. Howard Ungerleider : The other point on PM&C is really the Zhangjiagang asset. So we have three big pillar plants that produce siloxanes around the world, one in the U.S., one in Europe and one in China. And the one in China was out for a big chunk of the first quarter. So obviously, we were unable to produce, and we had all that fixed cost that was \u2013 that went unabsorbed that dropped to the bottom line as a negative impact, as you saw. Operator : And next, we will hear from Alex Yefremov with KeyBank. Alex Yefremov : Thank you. Good morning everyone. Jim, you just mentioned capital costs could start trending towards depreciation. Just to clarify, do you mean D&A that I think you\u2019re guiding to about $2.9 billion or just the depreciation part of it? And also, how quickly do you think you\u2019ll get there? Is it something you should consider for next year already or over the next 2, 3 years, perhaps? Jim Fitterling : Yes, good question. And I think we will ramp into it. A lot depends on what we see in downstream demand. And if we continue to see these downstream demand pools, we\u2019re going to have to ramp into that post this year. We\u2019ve also got to look at investments that we\u2019ve been talking about on sustainability as well. Our depreciation level is about $2.2 billion. And so I think our first ramp would be to that level. And then we have discussions here and with our investors as we get opportunities to go beyond that. And obviously, you have to look at the value creation of that. Operator : And we will move on to Mike Sison with Wells Fargo. Mike Sison : Hey, good morning. Nice quarter and outlook. In terms of the $1 billion of earnings you talked about on Slide 9, how much of that can hit in \u201822? And I know it\u2019s a little bit early, but given some of these incremental investments, and your outlook relative to the industry consultants, should EBITDA in \u201822 continue to grow from \u201821? Jim Fitterling : Yes, I think when it comes to additional capacity, I think the answer to that is yes. I think the demand is going to continue to grow. Obviously, you can see the leverage that we have to the upside on margins. So I\u2019ll leave that \u2013 what the margin spread for \u201822 looks like out of the equation. But we probably got $100 million, maybe $150 million of additional accretive earnings based on these new incremental expansions in \u201822. And these things that I mentioned earlier, polyethylene glycols came online in first quarter, just about a month ago. And the furnace at the Fort is up and has half of its rate already, and it will get the other half of its rate at the end of the year. And then we\u2019ve got some other alkoxylation investments that will come on next year in II&I. We\u2019ve got some investments in, obviously, silicones. Last year, we did more than 15 incremental investments. This year, we\u2019ve got another 15 for high-margin downstream Silicones materials. And so those will come on. And then we\u2019ve got miscellaneous debottlenecking going on everywhere to try to get incremental growth out. Operator : And we will move on to Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Duffy Fischer : Yes. Good morning. Two kind of housekeeping questions. First is the Sadara marketing agreement winds down to the new terms, how visible will that be in your P&L and cash flow? And then on the pension voluntary, how did you think about the return on that $1 billion? And should we expect more voluntary cash to go into the pension over the next several years? Jim Fitterling : My expectation on the PMLA changes, Duffy, will be that you\u2019ll see that gradual over time. I think it will take a number of years. For our marketing to reflect our equity stake and obviously, for the Aramco side to do the same. So it won\u2019t happen overnight. I think it will happen over time. And I think you\u2019ll see it more on the revenue side than you will on the earnings side. Any other thoughts about that, Howard? Howard Ungerleider : Yes. If anything, Duffy, I would say you should see our unit margins improve, because right now, we\u2019re marketing 90% plus of the Sadara volume, but we obviously only own 35% of the equity. So that really \u2013 and we get a very \u2013 we only get a very, very small marketing fee on those volumes. So as that shifts more to our equity ownership in the JV, our unit margin should actually increase just because of that dilution. And remind me what your pension \u2013 what was the specific pension question, we might not \u2013 going back. Duffy Fischer : Do you think you will put more voluntary cash into the pension over the next 2, 3, 4 years? Howard Ungerleider : Yes, so I mean, look, with the pension smoothing that went in with the last bill, we don\u2019t have really any mandatory pension payments that we need to put in, in the U.S. plans for the next several years. So that was about \u2013 it\u2019s probably about a $300 million to $400 million savings. From a voluntary standpoint, look, I am a believer that interest rates will move up over time. And so it doesn\u2019t take much from an interest rate perspective and maybe 1 year of additional EROA to really get that plan close to fully funded. So with that said, we will be opportunistic. And if it makes sense economically, I mean that $1 billion voluntary pension payment was a very good economic decision for the company. And so we will continue to look at that year-by-year from an economic perspective. And if it\u2019s value creating, we might do it, but we will compare that to the other capital allocation priorities that Jim laid out earlier on the call. Operator : And that we will conclude today\u2019s question-and-answer session. At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to Pankaj Gupta for any additional or closing remarks. Pankaj Gupta : Thank you. Thank you for everyone. Thank you to everyone for joining our call. We appreciate your interest in Dow. For your reference, a copy of our transcript will be posted on Dow\u2019s website within 24 hours. This concludes our call. Thank you very much. Operator : And that will conclude today\u2019s call. We thank you for your participation.",

Pankaj Gupta : Good morning. Thank you for joining Dow\u2019s second quarter earnings call. This call is available via our webcast and we have prepared slides to supplement our comments today. They are posted on the Investor Relations section of Dow\u2019s website and through the link to our webcast. I am Pankaj Gupta, Dow Investor Relations Vice President, and joining me on the call today are Jim Fitterling, Dow\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Howard Ungerleider, President and Chief Financial Officer. Please read the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the earnings news release and slides. During our call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding our expectations or predictions about the future. Because these statements are based on current assumptions and factors that involve risks and uncertainties, our actual performance and results may differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Dow\u2019s Forms 10-Q and 10-K include detailed discussions of principal risks and uncertainties, which may cause such differences. Unless otherwise specified, all financials, where applicable, exclude significant items. We will also refer to non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures is contained in the Dow earnings release, in the slides that supplement our comments today and on the Dow website. On Slide 2, you will see our agenda for the call. Jim will begin by reviewing our second quarter highlights and operating segment performance. Howard will share modeling guidance and outlook going forward, and then Jim will close with an update on our earnings drivers. Following that, we will take your questions. Now, let me turn the call to Jim. Jim Fitterling : Thank you, Pankaj and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Starting on Slide 3, Dow continue to capture strong demand across our value chains during the second quarter. Team Dow is focused on execution, cost discipline and balanced capital allocation, enabled us to deliver our strongest quarterly earnings performance in the company's history, both pre and post spin with substantial growth in net sales and earnings year-over-year and sequentially. We achieved double-digit sales gains in all operating segments and businesses. A 66% increase in sales relative to the year-ago period, was led by local price improvement of 53% combined with a 9% volume increase. Robust demand and the recovery of the global economy continues from the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Sales increased 17% sequentially, underpinned by tight supply and demand fundamentals across all of our value chain. We delivered higher operating EBIT of $2.8 billion year-over-year and $1.3 billion sequentially, with improvements in all segments and businesses. These gains were fueled by strong top line growth and margin expansion. We also benefited from increased equity earnings, up more than $370 million year-over-year, led by higher margins at Sadara and the Kuwait joint ventures. Sequentially, equity earnings were up $54 million primarily from the Thai joint ventures. Cash flow from operations was $2 billion and free cash flow was $1.7 billion, up significantly both year-over-year and sequentially. This enabled a balanced execution of our capital allocation priorities. We continued our proactive liability management actions by reducing gross debt by more than $1 billion in the quarter, and reducing our annual interest expense by $35 million. Today Dow has no substantial long-term debt maturities due until the end of 2025. We also returned more than $700 million to shareholders in the quarter through our industry-leading dividend and we resumed our share buyback program to cover dilution. Finally, we continue to advance Dow's ESG priorities by releasing our consolidated ESG report, INtersections, which provides enhanced transparency on our environmental, social and governance priorities. The interactive digital report can be found at the top of our corporate website. In summary, Team Dow maintained a relentless focus on meeting increasing customer demand despite lingering supply impacts across many value chains and marking a strong rebound from Winter Storm Uri. We continue to execute on our operational and financial playbook, delivering another strong quarter and a solid first half performance. Turning to our segment performance on Slide 4, in the Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment, operating EBIT was $2 billion, up nearly $1.7 billion year-over-year and more than $780 million sequentially. Price gains in both businesses and in all regions led to integrated margin improvement and increased equity earnings. On a sequential basis, the segment expanded operating EBIT margins by 810 basis points on continued local price gains in olefins and in packaging applications. The Packaging and Specialty Plastics business reported sales gains year-over-year, driven by improvement in packaging applications for industrial and consumer packaging, and flexible food and beverage packaging and markets. Volumes declined year-over-year and sequentially due to the lower polyethylene supply from the lingering effects of Winter Storm Uri and our own planned maintenance turnarounds. Compared to the prior quarter, the business delivered local price gains in all regions. Moving to the Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure segment, operating EBIT was nearly $650 million, up more than $860 million year-over-year, primarily due to the pandemic recovery combined with tight supply and strong demand in both businesses. Sequentially, operating EBIT was up $320 million and operating EBIT margins expanded by 640 basis points, driven by margin improvement and offset somewhat by continued supply constraints from Winter Storm Uri. The Polyurethanes & Construction Chemicals business increased net sales compared to the year-ago period on strong local price in all value chains, demand recovery and durable goods and appliances and construction end markets and currency tailwinds. Despite industry supply chain challenges across a number of end markets, including mobility, the business delivered sequential sales growth on increased local price and volumes. The Industrial Solutions business delivered a net sales improvement compared to the year-ago period as a result of local price gains in offerings for coatings, industrial and electronics end markets across all regions. Improved demand for materials used in industrial manufacturing, coatings and infrastructure were more than offset by planned maintenance turnarounds and some third-party supplier limitations. Net sales also increased sequentially on local price gains in all regions. And finally, the Performance Materials & Coatings segment reported operating EBIT of $225 million, up nearly $200 million from the year-ago period. Operating EBIT margins increased 760 basis points on price gains and strong consumer and industrial demand recovery. Sequentially, operating EBIT was up more than $160 million due to price momentum and lower planned maintenance costs. The Consumer Solutions business achieved higher net sales year-over-year as demand recovery for silicones products led to local price and volume gains in all regions. Sequentially, the business achieved broad based volume growth due to lower planned maintenance activity and strong demand in silicones applications, including personal care, as certain geographies began to experience an increase in travel and a return to workplace and social activities with notable improvements in China. The Coatings & Performance Monomers business delivered higher net sales year-over-year, driven by price gains in all regions. Increased demand for coatings application was offset by lingering raw material and logistical constraints from Winter Storm Uri. Sequentially, the business achieved local price gains on tight supply and strong demand fundamentals and increased raw material costs, as well as increased volume from strong seasonal demand for industrial and architectural coatings. Now, I'll turn it over to Howard to review our outlook. Howard Ungerleider : Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Moving to our third quarter modeling guidance on Slide 5, strong consumer demand trends continue in retail, housing and the manufacturing sectors, and inventory levels remain low across most of our value chains. We expect these dynamics to continue to support price strength in the third quarter as the industry continues to work to fulfill pent-up demand. In our Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment, downstream converter and brand owner inventories remained at all-time lows with balances very tight. Recent small increases in producer inventories are due to a heavy turnaround season for the industry and yet industry days demand and inventory actually declined nearly 8% month-over-month on tight supply, coupled with increased domestic and export demand. This data includes Dow where we expect an approximately $150 million increase in the third quarter turnaround spending sequentially for planned maintenance at our crackers in Canada and in Spain as well as $100 million lower earnings from non-recurring licensing activity, which occurred in the second quarter. ACC data indicates domestic demand for packaging applications reached its strongest level in history in June and we expect a continuation of these positive demand trends as customers are reporting 45 to 60 day backlogs. Moving to Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure, strong consumer demand for durable goods continues underpinned by order strength throughout the value chain. Housing and construction markets particularly in the U.S continue to support robust demand for polyurethane applications. Industrial and oil related end markets are expected to continue to see gradual recovery sequentially, providing additional support for solvents and other industrial solutions. We also expect $30 million of additional planned maintenance turnaround spending at our joint ventures in the quarter. And in Performance Materials & Coatings, we expect a continuation with strong demand for electronics, mobility and infrastructure silicone solutions. We expect to benefit as social activity increases on easing pandemic related restrictions, including sequential improvement for personal care applications. These trends are supporting price momentum across the silicones value chain, and we anticipate increased turnaround spending of approximately $30 million in our consumer solutions business in the quarter, including a turnaround at our siloxane [pillar] (ph) plant in Barry. Demand for do-it-yourself architectural coatings remains robust, and we expect to see an increase in contractor related demand as new home builds increase and consumer and home social engagements begin to resume. Altogether with robust demand expected to continue, our advantage portfolio is positioned to capture significant value moving forward. We've updated a few full year items which can be found in the appendix of the slide presentation. Notably we are expecting higher equity earnings and with the improved earnings profile at Sadara, we now anticipate approximately $50 million of cash inflow to Dow in 2021. Turning to Slide 6, around the world increasingly positive trends indicate we remain in the early stages of economic recovery with an extended runway for growth. While industrial production is up nearly 20% over the year-ago low, it still has not reached pre-pandemic levels. Retail inventory to sales is at its lowest levels in more than three decades and strong demand continues to counter near-term potential restocking efforts. U.S housing starts increased again in May, and are projected to continue rising, supported by limited supply of single-family homes due to a decade of under building. And the proposed U.S infrastructure bill has the potential to further elevate the already strong GDP estimates projected around the world. As vaccination rates increase around the world and economies continue to reopen, pent-up consumer demand and increased personal savings built over the past year should also provide an additional boost to the global economy. Consumer confidence continues to climb on conviction that economic conditions will continue to improve, supporting continued purchases of homes, automobiles and other durable goods. Business travel sentiment continued to improve in May with more than half of U.S companies planning to resume domestic business travel within the next 3 months. The personal care market, which has been one of the slowest to recover began to see a rebound in the second quarter. The increases in U.S cosmetics and beauty products sales on rise in consumer demand. And as borders reopen, recreational activities and international travel should also boost economic activity, while we're mindful that there will absolutely be some regional variations in the timing and the pace of the recovery. Along with these trends, we anticipate the strong demand we experienced in the second quarter across our polyethylene, polyurethane, acrylic and silicone chains to extend through the second half of 2021. Polyethylene demand growth, for example, is projected to outpace supply additions in the near-term with pricing strength and resilient margins on a sustained and favorable oil to gas ratio with the majority of industry capacity adds coming in the higher end of the cost curve. Altogether, we expect these strong market dynamics, tight supply demand fundamentals and ongoing economic expansion across our key chains to continue to drive earnings and cash flow growth. With that, I'll turn it back to Jim. Jim Fitterling : Thank you, Howard. Turning to Slide 7. Dow's consumer driven portfolio is uniquely positioned to benefit from the demand trends that Howard outlined a moment ago, which continued to translate into an attractive $650 billion addressable market with approximately 1.3x to 1.5x GDP growth across our packaging, infrastructure, mobility and consumer care and markets. These demand trends in our fast growing markets are underpinned by an accelerated transition toward more sustainable materials, providing ample opportunities for Dow to continue to innovate with our customers and brand owners to enhance the sustainability of our products and value chains, while advancing our net zero carbon and circular economy targets. For example, as the mobility sector continues its transition to more sustainable solutions, electric and autonomous vehicles offer upside of approximately 50% more revenue across multiple Dow chemistries versus traditional internal combustion engine vehicles, including high value polyurethanes, silicones and silicone hybrid based adhesives and engineering sealants widely used in battery assembly, noise and vibration reduction, drivetrain, comfort and heat management applications. Our new Dow silicone technologies for electric and hybrid vehicle applications help OEMs to meet the evolving needs of automotive electrification, while advancing vehicle performance, reliability and sustainability. And we recently introduced SPECFLEX C, a new polyurethane solution sourced from recycled raw materials to help automotive OEMs meet demand for more circular products and their sustainability goals. We also continue to align our growth CapEx to address this growing market demand for sustainable materials. This quarter, we outlined our roadmap to reduce CO2 emissions by more than 40% by 2030 from our manufacturing operations in Terneuzen, The Netherlands. And Dow and Shell demonstrated progress on our joint technology to electrically heat steam cracker furnaces receiving partial funding from the Dutch government and together we are evaluating construction of a multi megawatt pilot plant with start up in 2025. We plan to share more detail on our strategic and financial priorities to continue creating long-term value for all our stakeholders at our upcoming 2021 Investor Day on October 6, which will be hosted both virtually and in person in New York City. Stay tuned for more details, we look forward to engaging with you. On Slide 8, as we shared last quarter, we continue to see demand across our ethylene, polyethylene, polyurethanes, acrylic and silicones value chains, outpacing supply through 2021 and stay in balanced in the near-term. These market dynamics will be further supported through 2022 and beyond by the GDP fueled market growth trends we just discussed. Some industry views call for softening conditions, largely based on their view of announced capacity additions. However, they do not account for industry delays and cancellations and when coupled with elevated demand growth from continued reopening of the global economy will likely lead to tighter than forecasted market conditions, all of which will result in continued earnings, margin and cash flow growth for Dow in the near-term. And while we capture these improved earnings in our core businesses, our current slate of lower capital, faster payback and higher return capacity expansions will generate an additional $1 billion of accretive earnings over the next several years, with many projects delivering earnings already this year, such as our ethylene derivatives at the Thai joint ventures, polyethylene for high-performance packaging applications at our Alberta operations, and surfactants for leading brand owners laundry and home care end markets. And notably, in the second quarter, we progressed our polyethylene glycol incremental expansion, completing customer qualification ahead of schedule and beginning shipments of our industry leading CARBOWAX SENTRY, polyethylene glycol, active pharmaceutical ingredients. Combined with favorable supply and demand fundamentals, these projects further enable Dow to continue to deliver significant value for our owners over this foreseeable future. We'll close on Slide 9. Our steadfast execution of the operational and financial playbook that we outlined at spin, combined with our agile response to market conditions over the past year have enabled us to deliver strong performance and enhanced value to our shareholders. We are uniquely positioned to continue building on that strong foundation today. Our value proposition starts with our differentiated portfolio and an asset base that is characterized by first our feedstock flexibility and position, which supports our low cost position and enables us to drive higher asset utilization and maximize cash margins as we quickly balance our feedstock and product mix to supply and demand dynamics. And second, our leading scale global footprint and differentiated portfolio provide us with access to high growth and markets in all major regions. We have achieved strong performance in this early part of the economic recovery and remain advantage through our participation in higher margin functional polymers, silicones and formulated systems. We continue to develop innovative solutions to address our customer's needs and capture the opportunities arising from critical market trends. Our high value adhesives and innovative packaging solutions support the rapidly growing e-commerce sector. Through our mobility science platform, we are targeting low carbon enabling mobility, electric and autonomous vehicle opportunities. More broadly, across our portfolio, we are enhancing the sustainability of our solutions and the value chains they serve. For example, deploying lower carbon energy solutions in gas trading, carbon capture and concentrated solar power at our operations. And through value chain collaboration, we are increasing post consumer recycled content in our products, and enabling the design of fully recyclable packaging. Today, more than 80% of Dow products for packaging applications are reusable or recyclable. And our research and technical teams are working actively on the remainder to achieve that same goal. Beyond the strength of our portfolio and our innovation investments, our deliberate focus on operating discipline and balanced capital allocation approach are critical elements of our value creation playbook. We have achieved top quartile cost structure and cash conversion and our restructuring efforts will yield an additional $300 million in earnings, all while maintaining a best owner mindset. We also delivered a return on invested capital of greater than 14% on a trailing 12-month basis. At the same time, we have prioritized investments in our downstream higher margin, faster payback opportunities and upstream investments that expand our leading ESG profile, while increasing our capital expenditures by $350 million this year. We reduced net debt by approximately $5 billion since the end of 2018. Dow's strong operational and financial performance this year resulted in a credit rating upgrade by S&P and an upgraded outlook by Fitch, supporting our strong investment grade balance sheet. And we continue to return significant cash to shareholders through our industry leading dividend. In closing, Dow is uniquely advantaged to continue delivering value through our best-in-class consumer led portfolio, our leadership in innovation and sustainability and our strong operating and financial discipline. With that, I'll turn it back to Pankaj to open the Q&A. Pankaj Gupta : Thank you, Jim. Now let's move on to your questions. I would like to remind you that our forward-looking statements apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. Operator, please provide the Q&A instructions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from P.J. Juvekar with Citi. P.J. Juvekar: Yes, good morning. Jim, the arbitrages between U.S. prices for polyethylene and other commodities versus Asia are growing. And this was evident in your pricing where U.S. pricing was 2x that of that in Asia. So how much of this is driven by the shipping tightness? And is the shipping tightness or logistical challenges impacting your business? Thank you. Jim Fitterling : Good morning, P.J. Thanks for the question. Obviously, days sales and inventory in North America went down. And I think what you saw was ourselves and most producers actually exported less into China. That was part of it. Also, you had a big rise in the cash flow part of the cost curve. So even though the arbitrages are where they are, most of the producers and China are running at cash flow breakeven. So our outlook is that demand here and around the world continues to be strong. I don't think you'll see a chance for us to build any inventory through the third quarter, there are still a fair number of planned turnarounds. And our view is with these GDP growth rates, or 6% for this year, and currently forecasted at 4.5%, maybe 5% for next year there's going to be quite a demand for polyethylene. Operator : We'll take our next question from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. David Begleiter : Thank you. Good morning. Jim, consultants are calling July to be the peak for integrated ethylene, polyethylene margins and then erosion to the rest of the year. What's your view on these margins and the cadence of declines in the back half of the year? Jim Fitterling : Thanks, David. Good morning. Right now, the July order book is stronger than we saw through the second quarter. I expect that we'll continue to stay that way through the quarter. In some views, we probably had our highest raw material prices in the second quarter, because of the ethane frac spreads went up fairly dramatically. I do expect we'll see some of that soften as we move forward. I think long-term we expect natural gas prices to be between $2.75 and $3 a million BTU. So that that's positive. And with these oil to gas ratios, I think we're going to see that continue. One of the things that happened with oil, obviously, as everybody looked at the oil supply coming on, but I think they failed to look at demand for oil. And as the economy reopens, there's going to be another step up in demand. So I think some of that supply is just necessary to get ready for the increase in demand that's coming. Operator : We'll take our next question from Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research. Frank Mitsch : Good morning, folks and congrats. Jim and Howard, you guys have previously spoken that peak EBITDA at Dow would be $12 billion or greater. And as I look at the first half of the year, we're essentially at that run rate. So question is, are we at peak? And if so, how sustainable is it or would you like to take this opportunity and offer a -- offer an upgrade there? Jim Fitterling : Good morning, Frank, and thanks. Look, we're at a pretty good run rate right now. Our expectation for third quarter is fairly similar. We really only have a couple of items that are negative on third quarter, just a couple of more turnarounds and some one-time catalysts sales that don't repeat. But given that, that looks good. In addition, I talked a little bit about incremental growth projects. Those projects, some of which are already starting up this year give us the ability to add another $1 billion of EBITDA to those numbers. So I think we're showing with the work that we've done on the balance sheet with the work that we've done on reliability, and the incremental expansions that we're making, as these other geographies come out of the pandemic like India, Brazil and Southeast Asia, and we see personal care, plus the industrial and service markets come back I think there's a potential for more. Howard Ungerleider : Frank, this is Howard. I would just add to that there's also self help. So we've got the restructuring from last year, that's going to continue to be a tailwind for us this year and into next year. That's a $300 million tailwind total over the 2-year period. And then the investments we're making in digital, we expect will be at least another $300 million. So if you add that to Jim's numbers, you're talking about more than $1.6 billion of organic indoor self help regardless of the macros. But the macros, as Jim talked about earlier, are very, very strong and we don't see that abating in the near-term. Operator : We'll take our next question from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Vincent Andrews : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Just looking at Slide 8 on the PE, MDI and siloxane S&D and utilization rates, the three utilization rate ranges that you have, I just look at siloxane, and it is very narrow, the range of outcomes on S&D in '22 and it gets wider as you get out to '26. Whereas it looks like it's the opposite for PE and MDI. So what is it about siloxane that creates more of an uncertain medium term outlook from an S&D and capacity utilization perspective? Jim Fitterling : Yes. Thank you, Vince. The siloxane business hasn't seen a lot of recent capacity as obviously we've been working on reliability and doing some turnaround work in our own assets. I think a lot of it is really end market driven and the positive side on the demand for downstream silicones is that you've got a tremendous draw as you move into things like electric vehicles. We're still seeing strong growth in housing, and also in large building projects around the world. So I think that's going to continue. My other thought is that our sustainable portfolio from our standpoint, when you look at the sourcing of our silicone metals, is going to allow us to be able to meet some of our brand owners sustainability demands, and that's going to be positive for Dow. You've got some older assets out there. You've got to keep an eye on that about 4% to 5% of the industry capacity is older, high cost and has a pretty high CO2 footprint. And so we're keeping an eye on that. Operator : We'll take our next question with Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Jeffrey Zekauskas : Thanks very much. Also on Slide 8, you talked about a Canada cracker expansion. In the old days you used to talk about expanding PE by 600,000 tons a year, which was supposed to happen in the second half of 2022. Is that what that is, or is that something different? And when you did previously talk about a 600,000 ton expansion, is that still going through? And then secondly, on Slide 14, you said your turnarounds this year were $500 million higher than last year. Is that a normal number? What's your normal turnaround costs in a year? Jim Fitterling : Thanks, Jeff. Two good questions. In Canada, that expansion is an addition of another furnace and some work on the debottlenecking of the backend of the cracker up there. And we have the available capacity in Canada to convert that to polyethylene. So that add is probably about half of that 600 kt that you're talking about in terms of available pounds. There was a project that we had slated to build in the U.S Gulf Coast of 600 kt. And when COVID hit, we pushed out and we're dusting that off right now and we're going to make a decision on that sometime this year. So we are continuing to look at expanding in the plastics portfolio downstream. And with the work we've done on reliability, we've got the ethylene within our portfolio to be able to fuel that and make that happen. On turnarounds, again, with cash flow being tight last year, we pushed some into this year. Maybe, Howard, you can comment on what is a more normal number going forward? Howard Ungerleider : Yes, I mean, look, Jeff, last year, as Jim says, we pushed a lot of turnaround. So 2020 versus 2019 was down about $200 million. We expect this year, as you said, to be up about $500 million. It really does depend. I mean, we've got cracker assets around the world, as you know. And I would say in a typical year, we do between one and three. And so if you want to say on average, it's two a year. That would tell you that the average turnaround is probably in the range of $1 billion plus or minus. And this year, it's going to be a little bit above trend line because of push out from last year. Operator : Our next question comes from Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Duffy Fischer : Yes. Good morning. Just wanted to triangulate if I could. Pricing for polyethylene is up about 6% as we exited the quarter versus the average for Q2. But when you gave your guidance for the sales growth from Q2 to Q3 for that segment, it's flat up 2%. So if you just flat line price and you kept the volume the same, you should be up roughly 6%. Can you just triangulate back that 4% as missing? Is that a lack of volume? Or do you see the price rolling over in the back part of the quarter that would get us to equal there? Jim Fitterling : Yes. Thanks, Duffy. Inventories are real tight right now. And as I mentioned, we haven't been able to really build anything. So with turnarounds in front of us in this quarter, we've been a bit conservative on the volume that\u2019s in that third quarter outlook. Obviously, we are going to try to be able to beat that. And I would say on pricing, we are still seeing some positive upward price movement on certain grades of product. High density, for example, right now is pretty tight. And so I think you're going to continue to see some price movement upward there. But overall, as we get through the turnarounds in the third quarter, I think you're going to see that we are going to have plenty of available volume to move, and that will start to add toward the end of the quarter and into the fourth quarter. Operator : We'll take our next question from Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global. Hassan Ahmed : Good morning, Jim and Howard. As I heard your commentary, it seems, obviously, the fundamentals are looking very strong, near to medium term at least. Obviously, that\u2019s reflected in your strong cash flow. And then again, you made a comment about no sort of significant debt payments due until 2025. So my question is, how are you guys thinking about share buybacks? I mean, you guys did around $200 million of buybacks in Q2, enough to offset dilution. But with the way the balance sheet is right now, the way the fundamentals seem to be, are you guys thinking about a more significant buyback program? Jim Fitterling : Good morning, Hassan. Let me take a shot at that, and I'll ask Howard to chime in as well. As of the end of second quarter, we've paid out about 88% of net income in dividends and share buybacks since the spin. So that\u2019s well above our 65% through the cycle guideline. And we just brought back buybacks in the quarter to start to cover dilution. And what we bought was about $200 million worth of shares during the quarter. So that's our priority. I would also say that, remember, we have organic growth in front of us, and so we're going to need some money to go into incremental growth CapEx. This year, we will be at $1.6 billion. We need a couple more years to get up to depreciation levels, which is about $2.2 billion and we have the projects, and they're good projects, lined up to do that. Howard, any other comments? Howard Ungerleider : Yes. The only other thing I would say, Hassan, you saw we reinitiated in the second quarter, as you said, with the $200 million. I would say that for modeling purposes, that's a good quarterly run rate for the back half of the year. And then as we get to the end of the year, at Investor Day, we will talk more about 2022. Operator : We'll take our next question from John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets. John McNulty : Yes, thanks for taking my question. Just a quick one. With regard to the impact in PSP and I&I around the Uri volumes, can you give us a little clarity on how much that nicked you in 2Q? Because I assume that\u2019s all in the rearview mirror and we should be kind of [technical difficulty] look to 3Q? And is that right? Jim Fitterling : Good morning, John. I think your assumption is right. They were impacted pretty hard in 2Q, and we should see that come back. And the assets are running very hard right now. The only caveat to that, I would say, is that there are still a couple of lines where some raw material supply limitations, small raw materials are important in making those products, sometimes cause us a little bit of a backlog. I think most of that capacity was out during the month of April. And so as you think about it and go forward in Q3, I would say you'll have three solid months of production, where last quarter we had two, and we pulled hard out of inventory. And so I don't think that we are going to have a chance to rebuild inventories until maybe the end of the year. And that would all depend on if the economy slows down. As Howard mentioned, we\u2019ve customers, and most of them in those chains that have 45 to 60-day backlog. So our view is we're going to be running hard through the end of the year and right into 2022. Operator : Our next question comes from John Roberts with UBS. John Roberts : A little bit related there, Jim and Howard, but Dow and the industry had a much harder time recovering from Winter Storm Uri. If we had a similar situation again, would the impact likely be the same? Or has there been some learnings or changes that would mitigate the effect if we had a repeat of this? Jim Fitterling : Yes. That's a good question, John. We do like we do after a hurricane, we -- after every hurricane or weather event, we get the team together and we take a look at what worked well and what didn't work so well. Uri was a little bit different in that it was so widespread. And it was not just us, but it was everything upstream and downstream of us, gas production, electricity, water. The biggest damage, obviously, was freeze-ups. And so you can't winterize everything to prepare for that, but you can winterize some things. And if you have some advanced notice, you can actually take some things down and protect them. And so the team has gone through that. And we've got an updated game plan on what we would do in the face of a situation like that again. I think the whole industry is going through it. I know ERCOT is going through that on the power side. Winterization is a big part of what they're doing and what they're requesting us to do as well because we are a supplier into ERCOT. So I do think there's some positive developments since Winter Storm Uri. And the widespread nature of it is what caught everybody and has taken so long to work through. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Sison with Wells Fargo. Michael Sison : Hey, guys. Nice quarter. I think PE prices are at all-time highs and obviously, demand is strong and supply is super low. Just curious, though, do you think there's a fundamental change in demand for polyethylene on a structural basis, maybe post the pandemic? Is it possible that we're really going to be above that one three to one five GDP going forward? And then just curious what you think would need to happen for prices to fall. Jim Fitterling : Yes, Michael. Thanks for the question. We\u2019ve seen a change in buying behavior from customers. And so there are some areas that really drive a lot of packaging-like e-commerce activity, which I don't think it is going to go backward. I also think that the fact that plastic packaging is so lightweight and so strong and it is the lowest carbon footprint package out there, you are going to continue to see a drive toward that. For most companies, the shipping costs and the CO2 footprint, and the shipping cost will drive that. And so I just use a paper versus plastic scenario in a grocery store. One truckload of plastic shopping bags would take four to five truckloads of paper bags to replace it. So I think you're going to see as carbon comes into the equation that it advantages plastics greatly. I don't think there's something that's going to see it long-term move above 1.5. For many, many decades, it's been in that 1.5 type of GDP growth rate. I think that will stay. There are some functional polymers that are made out of ethylene and polyethylene derivatives that are continuing to grow, materials for construction that are positive. You're going to see growth in some other applications like products that go into alternative energy, both solar panels for encapsulation, wind blades, and other types of applications. So I think we can sustain that over a long period of time, which is positive. Operator : We'll take our next question from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Bob Koort : Thanks very much. Jim, I wanted to ask you, maybe it dovetails on Mike's question, but in terms of PE demand growth in that multiplier, the Dow and the industry is also embracing the circular economy. Just curious what effect you think the recycling initiatives and circular initiatives out there? What that might do to virgin demand growth rates relative to that sort of 1.5 times GDP multiplier? Jim Fitterling : Yes. Good question, Bob. We are seeing a real demand pull from consumers and brand owners that want more post-consumer recycled material in there or they want more material that\u2019s made from either a biosource to ethylene or something that is made from advanced recycling to get back to feedstock and back to a product. I think the drivers that are going to help on the virgin side of things are obviously redesign of packaging types on flexible packaging, many packages are complicated and hard to recycle. I think one of the positives of our portfolio right now is the greater than 80% of our portfolio is fully recyclable or reusable today, and the research team and the tech service team are working hard to get the rest of that to 100%. All the brand owners are working on redesigns right now of different packages to move away from complex structures into simpler structures. We use that bare naked granola [ph] example with Kellogg's, where that package has been redesigned. This is going on across the value chain. We are seeing the investments in mechanical recycling and advanced recycling pick-up. We are seeing the number of states that are approving advanced recycling projects pick up. And I think our next big impact is going to be on infrastructure at the state and local level to allow more collection of curbside recycling of more products. And that will be the next drive north. We still have a long way to go even to catch up with Europe. In the United States, we\u2019ve a long way to go to get to that 35% of recycling. We set a target by 2030 to collect or reuse or recycle 1 million metric tons of plastic through our own actions and partnerships. And I can tell you, I\u2019m pushing the team to always pull that number forward and get that done faster. And I think we're seeing real demand in taking recycled packaging products into some things that are more durable and longer lived, building materials, using recycled plastics in aggregate for roadways, architectural decking, all kinds of things that are upgrading the use of end-of-life plastics. So I think over time, it's going to be a real positive. Operator : The next question comes from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Laurence Alexander : Good morning. What price of carbon do you currently use for evaluating growth projects? And is it high enough that you are actually seeing it skew the types of projects that you're considering from what you would have considered otherwise? Jim Fitterling : Yes, that\u2019s a good question. I would say today the price is around \u20ac50 to \u20ac55 a ton. I mean, that's what we see today in the EU on the market and translate that back into dollars as well. I would say that is not a high enough price of carbon to drive the change that needs to be made because the lower carbon technologies are much more expensive than that. But it is enough to put pressure on us to make sure that all of our projects have lower carbon approaches to them. And one of the things we will talk about at Investor Day is the work we did to kind of outline the next 20, 30 years of how we would get there. I think carbon capture, as we talk about, as we get beyond this infrastructure build that's in front of Congress right now and we get to the next step, you\u2019ve got to look at advanced technologies. And carbon capture and blue hydrogen are two that we have to keep an eye on. Those are the lowest cost next step for us to get our industry to low CO2. But they're a lot more than \u20ac55 a ton to deliver that. And so without the right tax incentive or support from government in terms of investment in those technologies, you would need a market price on carbon that is much higher than that. We are right on top of that and we are very attuned with that. And that\u2019s one of the things that we're piloting in Terneuzen. That's the 40% reduction that I talked about by 2030, is we are looking at blue hydrogen and carbon capture to try to make an improvement at that site. Operator : We'll take our next question from Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Arun Viswanathan : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the strong results here. You had mentioned some comments on supply additions being at the high-end of the cost curve. Could you just maybe remind us what your assumptions are on how much polyethylene capacity is being added in the rest of '21 and where that is coming, whether it be in, again, China or other regions? And also for '22, what do you expect on that side? And have you seen any changes as far as projects being accelerated that were potentially pushed out during COVID or returning back to the table? And then longer term, do you expect new projects to be announced? It sounds like the market -- it sounds like you're indicating the market is going to be very tight for a little while and you don't see any letup in demand. So looks like we would potentially need some more capacity and North America looks like an interesting place for that addition. So is that kind of within your thinking as well? Thanks. Jim Fitterling : Thanks, Arun. Good question. I will try to remember all of that so that I can get it all out. About 50% of the global polyethylene adds through 2025 are higher-cost naphtha or coal to olefins or methanol to olefins. About 35% are naphtha, about 15% are coal to olefins, methanol to olefins. 60% of the capacity adds through 2025 are in Northeast Asia. And when you think about the Chinese projects that are in construction or in start up phase, about 50% of those will come to market around the announced dates. And so that\u2019s -- in 2021 to 2023, that\u2019s about 12 million metric tons out of 24 total. Capacity increases are going to obviously reduce some imports into China. And so that will be domestic. And we don't see China as being an exporter at those levels. I would also say that you\u2019ve got some existing crackers that are considered unreliable due to some trade risk, but it's only in the neighborhood of 2 million to 3 million metric tons. Long-term, right now, there are supply demand -- there are supply additions that are about 31 million metric tons on the books. In our view, on delays or cancellations, are in the 6 million to 15 million metric tons on delays or cancellations. Demand growth is going to be 25 million metric tons. So we're going to be balanced to short by about 9 million metric tons during that time frame. And in the near term, with these GDP growth rates, things are going to be tight. So we're looking at growth. I mentioned to Jeff's question earlier a 600 kt expansion on polyethylene, that's in the cards. Incremental expansions on ethylene, those are in the cards. We are doing work on our own FCDh technology and our EDH technology in the Gulf to try to have low carbon moves forward. I think one of the things that has to be resolved before you see a next wave of announcements is what are the policies going to be in the United States around carbon, carbon border adjustment mechanisms, carbon tax, perhaps a voluntary emissions trading scheme. And we have to know what those are. We have to know how China is going to play on the global footprint. And we have to see how Europe is moving forward. All of those have to be resolved before we can see what the right place is to make that next step. But we are working on projects, and we're looking for the right opportunity. Operator : Our next question comes from Alex Yefremov with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Alex Yefremov : Thank you. Jim, just to continue on the subject, you mentioned that the price of carbon in Europe is currently not high enough to really provide incentive to implement these technologies. As this price rises and Europe implements the tax to help domestic industry sort of absorb these higher carbon prices, do you think that ultimately amount to something neutral for Dow Chemical? Because having capacity in Europe you will directly or indirectly benefit from these import taxes? Jim Fitterling : I think it -- thanks, Aleksey. I think it can be done. And I\u2019ve said before and I will continue to say it, we need to have a real constructive and open dialogue about how much it costs to do this. I think, idealistically, everybody is in agreement that we want to make improvements and we want to reduce carbon emissions and we want to get to net zero. But nobody's yet, at a government level or any level, having the educated discussion that we need to have about the cost of doing this. What will happen in Europe is Europe has -- the way the emissions trading game works in Europe is they have price for carbon, but they also have allowances for energy -- for emissions emitters. And if you are under your allowances, you can trade those carbon credits. What they will do over time is they will ratchet back the allowances and they will start to put everybody over their allowances and that will start to drive the prices up and that will drive the incentives to make the conversion. So Europe is less concerned right now with what the cost is to everybody and more concerned with trying to drive that number up and drive the conversion. And we are in the middle there trying to talk to them realistically about what the price is to do this, what the technologies are today, and scale up the ones that we think are the most cost effective going forward, blue hydrogen, carbon capture to be able to do that. So I think as we work through that over the next 2 or 3 years, we will start to make some progress to that. And I would say all heavy industry and the power and utility sector are taking a look at this, but with eyes wide open that it's not free. And the other thing to remember on hydrogen, is as you move to a hydrogen economy, the most effective way to make most of that hydrogen is through steam methane reforming which uses natural gas, which means you are going to need a lot more natural gas production to make that hydrogen. And that\u2019s one of the other discussions that is difficult to get on the table right now. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Steve Byrne : Yes. Thank you. So, Jim, you are really leading this initiative on net zero. I mean, you are the -- you are clearly one of the few that have a net zero greenhouse gas emission target for 2050. I'm curious to hear your view as to what\u2019s driving that? I mean, clearly, there's not U.S. government policy driving that. You are describing a carbon tax in Europe that\u2019s insufficient to incentivize that. Is there any opportunity that you see that downstream revenue could be enhanced from it? I'm not sure how, but there's clearly ways for you to premium price for a recycled product or renewable product. But a low carbon footprint product, is there a revenue potential that could help drive a return on that CapEx, or is this all really self motivated? Jim Fitterling : Good question, Steve. We are starting to see consumer preference drive the brand owners for lower carbon and more recyclable products. And clearly, both the brand owners and ourselves are in the space, that we want to make investments in that area, but we want those investments to be value accretive. So as you say, the policies are not there right now. And what we are trying to work through are the right set of policies that we need to make value creating investments going forward. I would say the consumer drive and the consumer preference on this is going to be the thing that makes it happen. The other reality is, I believe that the market premiums are starting to show up in some of the plastics today. When it comes to post-consumer recycled materials into packaging, we are seeing a strong pull from the brand owners and we are starting to see premiums. If you go back a decade, we had not seen that. And so you've got brand owners who are announcing that they're allocating premiums for recycled materials to address circularity, I think that\u2019s a sign that their customers want it. And when you get it down to a per package basis, it's very small. The problem comes through the value chain and the cost to manufacture the materials. But if you take it down to a per package basis on the shelf at a supermarket, it might add $0.01 to the cost of a product that you buy. It isn't significant at the consumer level. It's significant through the value chain. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Kevin McCarthy : Yes. Good morning. Jim, I wanted to ask you about industrial intermediates where your operating income more or less doubled sequentially. Two parts. Can you talk about the upside relative to your expectations 3 months ago? How much might have been polyurethanes versus other industrial chemicals? And then given that momentum and your sales forecast of flat to up 3%, do you have a strong view today as to whether third quarter could be flat, up or down profit wise sequentially? Jim Fitterling : Good -- that\u2019s a good question. In Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure on the polyurethane side, we saw strong demand for both polyols and isocyanates in the polyurethane side and in construction chemicals for chemicals that are made from those raw materials going into not only single-family homes, but also larger construction like commercial construction. I think those demands are going to continue to stay strong and the supply demand will continue to be tight. You saw strong pricing in both PO as well as isocyanates. There's not a lot of new capacity coming on in that space. And then additionally, in ethylene oxide and ethylene oxide derivatives in the industrial solutions business, those end markets are continuing to grow. And on top of that, we\u2019ve several new capacity adds that are coming for things like pharmaceutical incipient, a product called polyethylene glycol that we just made an expansion on, we\u2019ve got some other materials coming through there. And we have a host of low VOC solvents in that portfolio that go into the coatings sector. So around the world, as coatings move away from traditional organic solvents into waterborne or lower VOC solvents, that benefits our portfolio. That same trend, by the way, helps us in cleaning chemicals or cleaning products that you might use in your home, and we see that both from a brand owner and an industrial side as well. So I think those will continue our expectation on third quarter in those businesses are very similar to second quarter. Pankaj Gupta : Very good. Thank you. That concludes our call today. We appreciate your interest in Dow. For your reference, a copy of our transcript will be posted on Dow's website within 24 hours. Thank you. Operator : And that does conclude today\u2019s conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] Also, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Pankaj Gupta. Please go ahead, sir. Pankaj Gupta : Good morning. Thank you for joining Dow's third quarter earnings call. This call is available via webcast and we have prepared slides to supplement our comments today. They are posted on the Investor Relations section of Dow's website and through the link to our webcast. I am Pankaj Gupta, Dow Investor Relations Vice President. And joining me on the call today are Jim Fitterling, Dow's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Howard Ungerleider, President and Chief Financial Officer. Please read the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the earnings news release and slides. During our call, we will make Forward-looking statements regarding our expectations or predictions about the future. Because these statements are based on current assumptions and factors that involve risks and uncertainties, our actual performance and results may differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Dow forms 10-Q, and 10-K include detailed discussions of principal risks and uncertainties which may cause such differences. Unless otherwise specified all financials where applicable, excluding significant items. We will also refer to non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures is contained in the Dow earnings release, in the slides that supplement our comments today, and on the Dow website. On Slide 2, you will see our agenda for the call. Jim will begin by reviewing our third quarter highlights and operating segment performance, Howard will share our modeling guidance and outlook, and then Jim will recap our strategy for disciplined value growth that we outlined at our Investor Day earlier this month and why Dow continues to be a compelling investment opportunity. Following that, we will take your questions. Now, let me turn the call to Jim. Jim Fitterling : Thank you, Pankaj, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. Starting on Slide 3. In the third quarter, Dow achieved top and bottom line growth, both year-over-year and sequentially. I'm incredibly proud of the Dow team for delivering these results and doing so safely, despite industry supply disruptions from hurricanes on the U.S. Gulf Coast. Our proactive storm preparations enabled us to maintain the safety of our team and community and recover quickly. We delivered a 53% sales increase year-over-year with double digit gains in every segment, business and region. We also recorded a 7% increase in sales over the prior quarter. We captured strong price momentum, driven by tight supply demand balances across our key value chain. And we achieved volume growth of 2%, both year-over-year and sequentially, supported by continued strong end-market demand despite supply and logistics constraints. We increased operating EBITDA by more than $2.1 billion year-over-year, with improvements in all segments and businesses and $58 million higher sequentially. Key contributors included year-over-year margin expansion of 1,170 basis points, driven by price momentum and demand growth, and increased equity earnings up $189 million from margin expansion at our Sadara and Kuwait joint ventures. Our continued focus on cash generation and our balanced disciplined capital allocation enabled us to deliver cash flow from operations of $2.7 billion, up $958 million year-over-year, driven by margin expansion from price momentum in key value chain. We returned a total of $918 million to shareholders through our industry-leading dividend of $518 million, plus $400 million in share repurchases, and we also reduced gross debt by more than $1.1 billion in the quarter. Our proactive liability management actions to tender existing notes have resulted in no long-term debt maturities due until 2026, and we've reduced annual interest expense by more than $60 million. Overall, Dow continues to deliver on its priorities and we see further strength ahead as we benefit from a favorable macro backdrop and execute our disciplined strategy to decarbonize our footprint and grow earnings, driving significant value for all stakeholders. Moving to our segment performance on Slide 4. In The Packaging and Specialty Plastics segment, operating EBIT was $2 billion compared to $647 million in the year-ago period. Sequentially, operating EBIT was down $60 million. Price gains in both businesses and in all regions led to margin improvement in the core business and increased equity earnings. On a sequential basis, operating EBIT margins declined by 300 basis points on higher feedstock and energy costs. The Packaging & Specialty Plastics business reported a net sales increase year-over-year, led by local price gains in industrial and consumer packaging, and flexible food and beverage packaging applications. Volumes declined year-over-year due to lower polyethylene supply, as a result of planned maintenance turnarounds and weather-related outages in the quarter. Compared to the prior quarter, the business delivered price and volume gains on strong demand in industrial and consumer packaging applications, which were partly offset by a hurricane-related outages. Moving to the Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure segment, operating EBIT was $713 million, up $609 million year-over-year, primarily due to continued tight supply and demand in both businesses. Sequentially, operating EBIT was up $65 million and operating EBIT margins expanded by 50 basis points on volume and price gains in both businesses. The Polyurethanes & Construction Chemicals business increased net sales compared to the year-ago period with price gains in all regions on tight supply demand balances. Volume declines year-over-year, primarily reflected the planned transition of a low-margin co-producer contract, as well as weather-related outages and third-party supply constraints. Sequentially, the business delivered sales growth due to increased local price and volume from additional supply availability to meet resilient demand. The Industrial Solutions business delivered a net sales improvement compared to the year-ago period with local price gains in all regions. Volume increased year-over-year on strong demand for materials in industrial manufacturing and energy applications. Net sales also increased sequentially, driven by volume growth, primarily in coatings and industrial applications from increased supply and local price gains in all regions. And finally, the performance materials in Coatings segment reported operating EBIT of $284 million, up $209 million versus the same quarter last year, as margins increased 750 basis points due to strong price momentum and robust demand recovery for silicone and industrial coatings offerings. Sequentially, operating EBIT was up $59 million on price gains, leading to margin expansion of 210 basis points. The Consumer Solutions business achieved higher net sales year-over-year with price gains in all regions. Volume increased over the prior year on stronger consumer demand for personal care, mobility, and electronics offerings. Sequentially, sales were down as price increases in all regions were more than offset by volume declines as a result of planned maintenance and third-party supply and logistics constraints. The Coatings & Performance Monomers business delivered increased net sales year-over-year, as higher raw material costs and tight supply demand balances led to price gains in all regions. Volumes were down year-over-year as demand recovery for industrial coatings was more than offset by weather-related outages and third-party supply and logistics constraints. Sequentially, the business delivered local price gains in all regions supported by increased volume due to continued strong demand for acrylic monomers and architectural coatings and increased supply availability. Now, let me turn it over to Howard to review the modeling guidance. Howard Ungerleider : Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 5. In the fourth quarter, we see a continuation of robust demand growth across our packaging, infrastructure, consumer, and mobility end markets. Brand owner inventory levels remain low, and as a result, we anticipate higher seasonal demand continuing into the holiday season this year. In Packaging & Specialty Plastics, we continue to see resilient demand for packaging applications and for our differentiated functional polymers. Global polyethylene supply remains constrained as the industry completes higher turnaround activity and supply chains recover from weather events on the U.S. Gulf Coast. We exited the third quarter experiencing higher raw material and energy costs, which we anticipate will likely persist through the fourth quarter. We expect these costs to be at approximately $350 million headwind sequentially. Dow will continue to utilize our broad geographic footprint and best-in-class feedstock flexibility to help mitigate these impacts. We also anticipate $175 million tailwind from turnarounds in the quarter as we completed our planned maintenance at our cracker in Canada. In Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure, continued consumer demand for furniture and bedding, appliances, pharma, and home care, are expected to keep supply tight in our key value chains. Due to the weather related outages in the third quarter, some of our planned turnaround activity was moved to the fourth quarter. Sadara will also start a turnaround at it's isocyanates facility in the fourth quarter as well. Altogether, we anticipate a $100 million in this segment from turnaround impacts. Short-term increased energy costs in the U.S. Gulf Coast and Europe are expected to be an additional $100 million headwind in the quarter. We continue to see sequential recovery in industrial activity, particularly for HOG applications. We anticipate this recovery will continue at least through the fourth quarter as industrial production continues to ramp up from very low inventory levels to meet demand and performance materials and coatings demand for electronics, mobility, building construction continues to outpace supply. Demand for architectural coatings is also expected to remain elevated due to persistently low inventory levels across the value chain. Global production for silicone has been impacted by the recent dual control policy enforcement actions in China, with silicon metal prices almost three times their previous highs. We intend to put forward a scheduled turnaround at our facility in Zhangjiagang, China to coincide with government actions to curtail power usage. Our current estimate for the quarter includes a $125 million from increased raw material costs and turnaround impacts. We'll continue to work on mitigating the impacts of rising raw material costs through our integrated position in both businesses. Despite higher raw material and energy costs in the fourth quarter, Dow will continue to leverage its advantage global footprint, structural cost, and feedstock advantages, as well as our broad suite of differentiated products to meet growing demand. On Slide 6, as we look ahead, we expect robust economic growth to continue. With the Delta variant slowing the reopening of economies around the world, there remains significant pent-up demand globally, particularly across our industrial and consumer end markets. Many industries continue to see elevated order backlogs coupled with low inventory levels as supply chain s struggle to keep up with robust demand. These supply chain disruptions are expected to persist, which will certainly prolong the ability to restock inventories across most value chains. As a result, we expect tighter than forecasted market conditions to continue of strengthened by China's recent dual control policy that has impacted both coal-to - olefins and methanol-to - olefins base capacity, which represent more than 30% of China's total polyethylene production. 2022 GDP growth forecast are well above historical averages in most areas of the world, as industries ramp up to match the robust consumer demand with further upside as global chip shortages continue to extend the recovery in manufacturing. Collectively, G7 countries have not yet fully recovered to pre -pandemic GDP. This points to additional upside as economies return to more normalized consumption levels with degree of vaccination increasing, particularly in Asia, where levels remain low, relative to the rest of the world. Moving to Slide 7, at our Investor Day earlier this month, we outlined how our differentiated portfolio and our focus on sustainability driven innovation will enable more than $3 billion in underlying EBITDA improvement across the cycle. Our restructuring program and digital investments will yield 600 million in increased EBITDA. Both are in progress, and our restructuring program is on track to achieve its 300 million run rate by year-end. We also have a suite of high-return, low-risk, and faster payback capital and operating investments that will enable an additional $2 billion in EBITDA in the near-term. And our investments to decarbonize and grow at our Fort Saskatchewan site in Alberta, Canada are also expected to deliver approximately $1 billion in increased EBITDA. And, as we've already shared, we're executing against a favorable macro backdrop that we expect will continue to support constructive market fundamentals for our key value chains. Turning to Slide 8, you'll see the detailed list of these low-risk growth investments. Our capital investments are expected to generate a billion dollars in EBITDA through incremental capacity expansions, de - bottlenecking, and enhance feedstock flexibility across our operating segments. We're already making good progress. For example, in Packaging and Specialty Plastics, our Fort Saskatchewan expansion to add ethylene capacity of 65,000 metric tons per year, to support growing polyethylene demand, is now complete and will ramp by the end of the fourth quarter. Our FCDH pilot plant in Louisiana will start up in 2022, featuring 20% to 40% lower CapEx and 5% to 7% lower OpEx, while reducing CO2 emissions by up to 20% compared to other PDH technologies. Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure, our de - bottlenecking project to add 60,000 metric tons per year of analine will be fully online by year end. And earlier this year, we signed an MOU for a new South China hub to advance local supply and formulating capabilities to serve the fast-growing Asia-Pacific market. In Performance Materials and Coatings, we recently completed a capacity expansion at one of our silicone polymer plants, and by year-end, we will complete a new silicone sealant compounding unit to enable sustainable solutions for high performance building and infrastructure applications. And we are progressing our 50 kt methyl acrylate investment on the U.S. Gulf Coast to support global end markets such as residues and packaging materials, which is scheduled to come online in the first half of next year. In addition, our operating investments are also expected to generate another billion dollars in EBITDA as we improve our production capabilities and shift our product mix to higher growth and higher value markets. For example, in Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure, we're increasing capabilities and shifting our mix toward higher-margin Polyurethane systems for mobility and consumer applications Our Industrial Solutions businesses are increasing capabilities to supply differentiated materials into the textile market. Our ECOFAST collaboration with Ralph Lauren lowers energy usage by 40% and water usage by 50% in the fabric dying process. And by 2025, the brand aims to incorporate this technology in more than 80% of its solid cotton products. In Performance Materials and Coatings we're expanding our ability to formulate differentiated silicones for a number of attractive markets, including silicone adhesives for foldable displays in consumer electronics, thermal conducted silicone solutions for electric vehicles, and silicone solutions for 5G where the market is expected to more than double over the next ten years. And we've recently partnered with customers on high value innovations, like paper barrier coating applications that use our award winning roll bar polyolefin dispersion technology and call way super soft golf balls which feature a new hybrid cover, made with Dow's parallel Lloyd impact modifier. In Packaging & Specialty Plastics. We're enhancing our extensive conversion and testing capabilities to commercialize residence through packaging design, speeding the innovation process, and expanding the addressable market for higher-margin and more sustainable products. For example, we're already benefiting from the 9-layer blown film extrusion line project completed this year. We're also making investments to improve asset reliability, which will increase output and expand margins. And we're using digital technology for customer trials and process automation to accelerate catalyst development for new resins and processes like FCDh, where we can typically be 100 times more efficient than conventional experimentation. Collectively, our slate of near-term investments will generate an increase of approximately $2 billion in underlying EBITDA. And we intend to deliver this growth with a disciplined and balanced approach, maintaining our top quartile performance in cash flow, cost structure, debt reduction and shareholder remuneration. With that, I will turn it back to Jim. Jim Fitterling : Thank you, Howard. Turning to Slide 9. The strategy we outlined at our Investor Day builds on our long history of industry leadership. Our plan enables us to capture demand from sustainability drivers, achieve 0 scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions, and deliver meaningful, underlying earnings, and cash flow growth for years to come. Our path to decarbonize our footprint and grow earnings is a phased, side-by-side approach that both retrofits and replaces end-of-life assets with low carbon emission facility, while also expanding our capacity. This plan will deliver a 30% reduction in our CO2 emissions between 2005 and 2030 through a disciplined approach that manages timing based on affordability, macro and regulatory drivers around the world. Our Texas 9 cracker proves that we can do this, and do it well, Texas 9 is 60% lower carbon intensity than any asset in our fleet. And that's without any specific design for carbon capture or hydrogen. The project was delivered with 20% better capital efficiency and 12 months faster than any other crackers built in that wave. Overall, the project has a 65% lower conversion cost, is running consistently at more than a 110% of nameplate capacity and has delivered greater than 15% return on invested capital since startup. We will leverage key learning from Texas 9 as we plan to build the world's first ever net 0 carbon emissions ethylene cracker and derivatives complex in Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta, delivering approximately $1 billion in EBITDA, as Howard outlined earlier. This project will more than triple our ethylene and downstream derivative capacity at the site while decarbonizing emissions for 20% of our global ethylene capacity. We selected this site due to the availability of carbon capture infrastructure, advantaged feedstocks, and supportive government policies and incentives. On Slide 10, as we capture leads attractive growth opportunities, we'll maintain our balanced and disciplined financial approach since spent. We are committed to keeping CapEx at or below DNA, well below pre -spin levels while targeting return on invested capital above 13% across the economic cycle. We will continue to align our capital spend to the macroeconomic environment, our affordability, and return targets. Our investments align to three categories. First, we'll maintain our foundation and maximize the return of our existing assets while ensuring safe and reliable operations. Second, we'll execute our pipeline of faster payback, lower-risk incremental growth projects for downstream and sustainability driven applications, growing faster than GDP. And will invest approximately $1 billion per year to decarbonize our footprint and grow earnings. These investments enable us to capture increasing demand for low carbon footprint products, while de -risking the enterprise with lower emissions assets. In closing on Slide 11, Dow is well-positioned to deliver significant long-term value for shareholders. We have actions in place to both decarbonize our footprint and grow the enterprise. As we achieve an additional $3 billion in underlying EBITDA, maintain industry-leading cash flow generation, and drive towards 0 scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions. Our balanced capital allocation approach targets more than 13% return on invested capital. Keeps CapEx within DNA and returned 65% of net income to shareholders across the economic cycle. All of this is underpinned by our industry-leading portfolio, cost position, and strong track record of innovation that enables us to deliver differentiated products and solutions for our customers and a more sustainable world. With that, I'll turn it back to Pankaj to open the Q&A. Pankaj Gupta : Thank you, Jim. Now, let's move on to your questions. I would like to remind you that our forward-looking statements apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. Operator, please provide the Q&A instructions. Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global. Hassan Ahmed : Good morning, Jim. Jim, as I take a look at your guidance, sequentially, you seem to be guiding to a $500 million downtick in EBITDA. So $3.6 billion comes down to $3.1 billion. But just reading through the guidance, you don't break out the impact of IDA. So is it fair to assume that you guys are guiding to sort of north of $3.1 billion in EBITDA for Q4? Jim Fitterling : Thanks, Hassan. That's a great question. The impact -- the total impact of IDA was about $100 million and split third quarter, fourth quarter. So that's how you should look at that. Most of the rest of the guide was just impact on feedstock costs or raw material costs that we expect to see going into the fourth quarter. Having said that, I think demand is going to continue to be strong, and I expect our operating rates will be stronger than they were in the third quarter because of the impact of IDA. And I don't expect that we're going to have a chance to build much inventory, but our intent is to run hard through the end of the year because our customers need the demand and we need to get out in front of this a little bit. Operator : Next, we'll go to Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Vincent Andrews : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Maybe just a little more color within the Packaging & Specialty Plastics sales guidance and in particular, what you're expecting for volume sequentially? And then is there any sort of impact on the top line from feedstocks or hydrocarbons? You can obviously tell I'm trying to back out your polyethylene price assumptions. Jim Fitterling : Good morning Vince. I expect the volumes will be better. We had St. Charles, obviously, out in the month of September, and it came back here earlier in October. So I expect fourth quarter will have the strong run. And remember, we had the turnaround in the fourth that was happening in the third quarter as well, and we're out of that. So the fourth will be back. We'll see some additional ethylene out of the fourth because the back half of that expansion started up. And I think you'll see higher volumes for the year. We're looking at volume increases for plastics like 8%, 9% for the industry. I think for fourth quarter, we manage 2% in the quarter. In third quarter, I think for fourth quarter, it will be higher than that. I do expect prices will moderate at some point. I don't know exactly when that's going to be because right now, inventories are low, but I don't think it's going to fall as precipitously as some of the forecast estimate. Operator : The next question will come from P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Pj Juvekar : Yes. Good morning, Jim and Howard. Can you talk about siloxane and downstream silicone demand? What's happening in siloxane merchant market? And how is this change impacted by raw materials? I think, Jim, you said silicone costs came up in China, so you shut down some -- shutdown a plant. Can you expand on that? And finally, what happens to the new siloxane capacity that was announced in China with these recent dual control policies? Thank you. Jim Fitterling : PJ, good question. I'm going to walk through several things. I would say in the near-term, the impact on silicon metal has been in China due to the restrictions from dual control. And as you know, that was driven by the higher coal prices, really pushing up the costs for the electricity producers. And the electricity producers are capped on their electricity prices, so some of them didn't run and that forced the industry curtailment. Typically, as you're going into cold weather months, industry takes the hit versus homeowners and consumers. You try to keep your people warm and so that hit silicon metals. For that reason, things became tight. We've moved some silicon metals from Brazil over to China to offset that. And we'll run through the fourth quarter book. We decided to pull a turnaround in Zhangjiagang into the fourth quarter. We had originally planned it for first quarter. We decided to do it now, that takes a little pressure off the dual control situation. That turnaround will cost us, I think on Slide 5, it's in there, $75 million in the fourth quarter. I expect we're going to see about $50 million higher cost. That's both downstream G3 silicones demand and siloxane demand are very strong. And so siloxane\u2019s prices have gone up significantly. And so I think we're going to be in that situation for all of fourth quarter, and I would expect into first quarter as well. Operator : All right. Next question will come from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Jeffrey Zekauskas : Hi. Good morning. I have a two-part question. The first part has to do with your expansion in Alberta in the late decade. That seems to be your sole large ethylene polyethylene expansion. And by my calculation, what that means is that over the next 10 years or so, your capacity will expand 1% to 2% per year. And presumably the industry grows faster than that. And so, is this approach an example of your disciplined capital approach where you really only want to have high return projects? And what you'll do is you'll sacrifice volume growth in service of that higher return. Second part is for Howard. The net debt to EBITDA, you say, will go to 2 to 2.5 times. That makes a difference because if your EBITDA is $10 billion, that's a $5 billion difference. So was it 2 or 2.5times? And are you going to get there quickly? Or are you going to dawdle? Because if what you're going to do is lever up by another, I don't know, $9 billion or $10 billion to buy back stock or increase dividends, how quickly are you going to get there? Is it 2022 or '25 or somewhere in between? Thanks. Jim Fitterling : Good morning, Jeff. The first part of the Alberta expansion comes on in 2007. That brings on most of the new cracker capacity. The cracker will be expandable. And it also brings on the derivatives. And then we retrofit the existing cracker, so we can tie in the back-end into the auto thermal reformer and that will come on in 2009. So that will be the largest mega project that we do. We do have investments in the near-term on the bottleneck and existing assets that will help us between now and 2007. And we have the ethylene capacity to add some downstream capacity as well. So there will be a little bit more than 1% to 2% in growth. But our focus on Alberta is obviously to take advantage of the situation there, to decarbonize and have a good carbon capture location and take that whole site to net 0. Howard, do you want to get the net debt to EBITDA? Howard Ungerleider : Yes. Sure. Good morning Jeff. Your point about disciplined balance on the capital allocation side, it goes to the debt as well. I mean, when you think about what we get in the third quarter, it was very balanced. It was more than $500 million in dividends. It was doing another $400 million of stock buyback, and then we took out $1.1 billion of debt. To your point on the 2 to 2.5 ratio, I would say, some of our peers have a 1% swing between their low and high. So we're already giving you a better than peer view with saying our range is only a half a turn. But if you'd like me to narrow that further, I would say use the midpoint. So our long-term average is 2 to 2.5. I would say through the economic cycle, if what you want to use 2.25, that's a reasonable proxy for where we want to be, but we have the corridor there to recognize that it's a long-term target. Punctually today, using the rating agency methodology through the end of the third quarter, we're probably around 2.4, 2.5. So we have about a quarter of a turn left to go to hit that midpoint of the 2 to 2.5. Operator : Next question will come from the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Michael Sison : Good morning. This is Mike actually, sitting in for Bob. Just wanted to give me a couple of comments about inventories still being tight. And I guess from a polyethylene perspective, could you perhaps maybe quantify what you're seeing in terms of days of inventory and how, perhaps, that may compare to what you would consider more normal? Jim Fitterling : Industry -- Mike, good morning. Industry inventory and DDI fell. Industry inventories September fell about 120 million pounds. And so days and inventory had dropped, demand is obviously strong. And export demand exceeded -- domestic and export exceeded the production. Obviously, storms had an impact on that as well. We saw inventory declines in high density and linear low. And a little bit of inventory build in low density, but it isn't a significant number. So when you look at the 5 year trends and I think what we put in the slide deck to show your earlier is that the order backlog is up about 30% above normal and the inventory to sales ratio is down about 10%. I think that's going to stay in that band for the most of the fourth quarter. And as the capacity comes back from the hurricanes, we have still supply and logistics issues, so they're bottlenecks everywhere, especially when it relates to marine pack cargo or export and as it relates to product being shipped by truck. It's a little hand-to-hand combat right now on the truck driver doesn't show up, shipment gets delayed. So I think we're going to be in that situation for the rest of the year and into the first quarter. Howard Ungerleider : I'm just giving you some Dow numbers. Our DSI was down 7 days in the third quarter versus a year ago, and our overall cash conversion cycle was better by a day sequentially. So we're tightly managing our working capital. Operator : Next, we'll go to David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. David Begleiter : Thank you. Good morning. Jim, the consultants have a pretty sharp decline in ethylene chain margins through February. Do you agree with that or are they being a little too bearish given the tightness right now in the marketplace? Jim Fitterling : Good morning, David. I think, a little bit bearish, the way I would categorize it, I think they are underestimating the demand that's going to be there because there still is a significant inventory restock and continued strong demand that we see coming. And I think they are overestimating how much supply. I is coming in. And if I go back to the China situation, remember that about half of those CTO/MTO capacity is out of the money right now. 60% of all the new capacity coming on in the world is in Northeast Asia, which will still be a net importer for a long time, and it's all napma or higher cost base. And so I think those things are going to soften this. I do expect prices to moderate a bit, but I think we could see a pretty strong 2022 with higher volumes, yet slightly lower prices. Operating rates were always going to be in the high 80s to low 90s for the full year. So I don't see a change there. And remember that the U.S. structural advantage, the Canadian structural advantage, our position in Argentina, our position in the Middle East are still going to remain strong. David Begleiter : Thank you. Operator : And next, we'll go to Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research. Frank Mitsch : Hey, good morning and nice results. You r data sequentially tick up your buybacks here to that 400 million level in the third quarter. How should investors think about the pace of buybacks in 4Q and 2022? Jim Fitterling : Howard, do you want to take them? Howard Ungerleider : Yes. Thanks. Frank, good morning. So the guidance we gave for the fourth quarter is 745 million shares outstanding. So if you look at where we ended the third quarter or the average for the third quarter, that's about a 5 million share reduction, which would equate to another 400 million plus or minus on stock buybacks, so essentially keeping pace with the third quarter. With that said, look, we continue to be disciplined and balanced on the capital allocation and we will continue to be opportunistic. We're staying true to our 65% of our net income going back to shareholders. Long-term 45% of the earnings growth will and the net income will go in the form of dividends. And then we'll use stock buyback to top that up to 65% Operator : All right. Next question, we'll go to John Roberts with UBS. John Roberts : Thank you. We see all the container ships out in the harbors and all the containers stacked up on the docks and the warehouses are full with drivers waiting to take product to the final customers. Your earlier comment was about polyethylene producer inventories. Do you worry about contained product down stream where it would seem like there's a lot of inventory in the channel downstream of the converters. Jim Fitterling : Hey. Good morning John. Yeah it's -- the visibility is hard to track right now. I do think that some of the moves that the government made recently to get the big ports 24/7 operation is going to help the backlog. What happens is typically when those ports get backlog, it spills over into other ports. We don't use Long Beach as much, but when traffic spills over into other ports it hits us. I would say that almost every value chain has some impact from that, and where we see the biggest impact is being able -- it's kind of blocking material getting out.  And so we're starting to see some congestion and some competing demand, product coming in. Sometimes it's faster to reload and empty containers to get it back to China, and so that competes with other materials going out. We don't see that in every quarter. But certainly on the west coast, we're seeing that right now. I would say almost every value chain we have, every application we have is short product. And I don't think there's enough material tied up in all of that floating inventory or in the warehouses that that is going to alleviate the demand, or fill the demand that's out there right now. I still think the consumer is strong and we've still got other economies that are coming back from COVID that are going to add to that demand. Operator : Next, we'll go to Michael Sison with Wells Fargo. Michael Sison : Hey, guys, good morning. Nice quarter. Just curious, when you think about '22 and you tend to have that nice little market fundamentals for your three base segments. And just curious, any -- I know you think demand's strong, what -- any thoughts on natural gas pricing, feedstock costs, oil's going up. Just curious how you 're baking in those type of inflation numbers in that outlook? Jim Fitterling : So we're starting to see some improvement in production, drilling, and completion of wells. We're going to bring more NGOs as we move out of the winter season. I believe what we're seeing short-term here is a knock-on effect as coal really ratcheted much higher in China. The first fuel that you go to that could replace coal in the fuel grid is natural gas. And then LNG obviously went right up after coal. And then the next fuel is oil. And oil came right up. And so that could cost up to $80 a barrel. I think we're going to see things will stabilize a little bit as we go into winter. Inventories are a little light of the five-year average going into winter. But you've seen prices unwind a little bit in the forward market by about $1, a million BTU, because weather plays a significant factor. So if we have a warmer fall, that's going to take a little bit of sting out of natural gas prices. Even with them the oil to gas ratio, but more importantly, the oil to gas spreads are good. And so I think that's going to continue. And if we get through winter without a really, really cold snap then I think you're going to see prices to moderate. Long term or medium term, I would say 250 to 450, for U.S. production. And long term, about 275 a million BTU for natural gas. Operator : And your next question will come from Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Mike Delay : Great. Thanks. Good morning. This is Mike Delay on for Duffy. Maybe two-part question for Howard. I guess one -- just a clarification in Jeff 's earlier question. Is that 2 to 2 and 1/2 debt target of gross debt to EBITDA metric net debt? Because if I heard your response correctly, it sounds like you still want to pay down slightly more debt from here. And second, if we say in this call 6 billion or so annualized operating cash flow range from the past, say 24 months or so, we roughly know what CapEx would be next year. And it seems like there should still be a decent amount of excess cash. I know you stress ed the balanced approach, but just how should we think about the priority of that excess cash, gets us the gold bar and your chart. But are buybacks supply real here? Thanks. Howard Ungerleider : Yeah. On a 2 to 2.5 debt to EBITDA ratio, that's a rating agency adjusted net debt to EBITDA target. So that's over a long term. Typically the rating agencies will look at a few years back, current year, and then come up with a forward two-year forecast. So when we think about that 2 to 2.5 range or as I targeted the midpoint, in answering to Jeff's questions of 2.25, that's over a 5 to a 10 year period. So as I mentioned to Jeff, we're slightly -- we're at the higher end of that range today, so you will -- you should expect over the next several years, we'll continue to titrate that number down to the midpoint of 2.25. And depending on how things go, we might go to the lower end of that range, we'll see. In terms of the capital allocation priorities, we intend to continue what you've seen from us, which is disciplined and balanced approach. The number one priority for us is to safely reliably operate our plants. And then, the next is organic investments. So where we have low risk, high return, fast pay-back projects that helps us continue to get the through the cycle, average return on capital of the enterprise to 13% or more. We will do that. Dividends would be next. So as the net income increases, that dividend should increase in line with the 45% of net income over the cycle. And then share repurchases and we'll -- like I said earlier, we'll use share purchases to at least cover dilution, but then we will also be opportunistic and compare opportunistic share buyback to any other use of cash. And over the long run, our goal is to do the value maximizing thing. Operator : Next, we'll go to John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets. John McNulty : Hi, good morning, Jim. This is John. Question on your equity earnings from the GDs? It looks like each of your II&I and TNXP segments is on track to deliver around $0.5 billion of earnings. Now, quite a few unique regional dynamics and feedstock arrangements that play here but broadly, could you discuss where these businesses are in the cycle and perhaps any color on where you see the earnings of these businesses for the next year? Thanks Jim Fitterling : Yeah. Good question on II&I and Polyurethane, I do believe that the demand and the operating rates for isocyanates will continue to stay strong into next year. Maybe a little bit lower operating rates on polyols, but the key demand drivers and value drivers are going to be those systems and solutions that are going into things like mobility, like construction, like appliances, and some extent furniture and bedding and things that are driven by consumer growth. And that'll continue to remain strong. The only thing that we've got coming that would be a detractor from those earnings would be, we've got a turnaround in this quarter on isocyanates and Sadara. But that's been planned and they'll manage that. They've been running very well. I expect to see them in good shape next year. And as you know, their fixed costs are quite low. And so I think they will be a very good source for us to fulfill that demand. Howard Ungerleider : Just one point on maybe on the cash flow side, on the equity earnings. If you recall that our dividends usually come from the prior year earnings. So with this year's equity earnings up, as you pointed out, then that will drive a cash flow tailwind for us next year, probably in the range of at least $200 to $300 million as we sit here today, possibly more. Operator : And next we'll go to Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Laurence Alexander : Good morning. Two questions. In the period with the tighter supply constraints, have you seen a mix, be it net positive or negative across the portfolio? Or in other words, how do you see things playing out when the supply constraints ease? And secondly, with respect to the decarbonization, so long as you could see a path to hitting your return on capital hurdles, how broadly would you consider vertically integrating in decarbonization platforms? Jim Fitterling : On the mix, I think any time you get a tight situation like this, there's a natural gravitation for the mix to move up. I would also say though that we've been trying, customers are in close communication and we're trying to obviously to keep everybody running. There's a lot of juggling going on.. There are some specialty grades where it's hard to shift the mix up because things are so tight right now, especially in some of our elastomeric products. On decarbonization, I think it's just going to depend on the situation in the geographies that we're looking at, the investments. In Canada we don't need to do the bank investment into CO2 capture and sequestration. And I think there are a lot of players that are out there that have capabilities to do that. So if we can keep our investments focused on assets that generate revenue for us and generate growth for us and our zero carbon emitting, I think there's plenty of room for third parties and others to play to help us to handle the CO2. Laurence Alexander : Thank you. Operator : Next, we move to Alex Yefremov with KeyBanc. Alex Yefremov : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I have a question about Slide 8 where you detail in-flight investments for 1.7 and 2.1 billion EBITDA contribution. In my math, this implies fairly high single-digit growth versus your base EBITDA. So can you give it a high level explaining why investors can have confidence in this target? What are you doing differently from traditional Dow's growth rate here? So anything that can at a high level explain why this growth is achievable. Jim Fitterling : Yeah. I'll start and I'll ask Howard to fill out a little bit. But I'm going to start with silicones because that's an area that's grows at 2 GDP. And if you look in mobility and if you look at electronics and if you look at consumer application, they are going to continue to grow as well as, we've had expansions coming for silicons products into construction and sealants, or glass glazing for big skyscraper buildings. So that is a high GDP growth, and that's going to continue in Industrial Solutions, not only highest value return to ethylene, but also high-value downstream growth driven primarily by consumer applications. To some extent, oil and gas, which we see recovering. I know we have many, many cases where our oil and gas products help people reduce CO2 emissions in the midstream production. And then things like ECOFAST Pure, which is the partnership with Ralph Lauren where we just open sourced that technology to use that product, which would get textile mills that use cotton to switch over to a product that is -- uses 90% less chemicals, 50% less water, 50% less energy, I think that's a huge driving force towards more sustainability in an area that's a tough environmental aspect. And then if you go to PM and see, we've got continued growth in our downstream systems, which have been growing at greater than 11% per year for a long time. We'll continue those investments. We've got high-gross targets for our downstream coating business, as I continue to keep up with demand specifically traffic demand. Howard mentioned paper demand for paper cups, replacing others with our raw barges versions, and also architectural demand, which is our growth leader in that space. And then you get back to Packaging and Specialty Plastics, which is continuing to grow above GDP, about 1.4 times GDP in our forward forecast. It's very dispersed, so when we talk about $3 billion of EBITDA growth over that time period, Jim Fitterling : is pretty evenly split between all three segments. And you're going to see about 200 to 300 million of it come on next year. And that is the projects that are already completed and will be finished by the end of the year. Operator : All right. Your next question comes from Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Arun Viswanathan : Great. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on a strong quarter. So I just wanted to get back to the polyethylene discussion. I guess we're hearing some conflicting things because we saw an ACC member on inventories of mid 40s on days of supply, maybe 47, and then it appears that the September, October increase on polyethelene has stalled as well. So is that -- are those correct characterizations or would you say that the market's really tight and you do expect further increases as we go through the year. Thanks. Jim Fitterling : Having a mid-40s number on days of inventory is kind of an average number. But remember sometimes the inventory numbers on things that are locked up and can't get shipped out. And so I think that's the main delta and some of the data that I shared with you. I would say demand and production, I think are both going to be strong in the fourth quarter. I also think some of the shipment delays are going to moderate as we get through the quarter and I think that will help. But a 40 to 45 days of inventory is not much inventory for the polyethylene business. Operator : The next question will be from Christopher Parkinson with Mizuho. Christopher Parkinson : Hi, this is for Chris. I was just wondering if you can touch a little bit between II&I and you mentioned third-party supply constraints. Can you just talk about what you're seeing in terms of those third-party supply constraints and whether you see them easing into the fourth quarter and into the first half of next year, if it's something that you continue to expect to persist throughout 2022? Thank you. Jim Fitterling : They are primarily -- the third party supply constraints are primarily industrial gas suppliers. They were racked pretty hard earlier in the year from the Texas freeze. And then they got hit again from the hurricanes in Louisiana. it is improving. I expect it will continue to improve through the quarter. And I think they're working hard. I know they're working hard to work on reliability and get the assets back up. And we're working hard as well to make sure that we've got redundancy in those supplies. So we'll take actions, like we do after events like those and make sure that we've got redundancy in supply as well. But that was the primary impact. Operator : All right. Next, we'll move on to Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Matt Dion : Thanks, everyone. It's Matt Dion for Steve. Just a question on polyolefin I think you touched a little bit on this, but where do you think we are in the cycle? Because even earlier this year we had some of your peers talking about over earning. I know we've had a lot of outages, but demand is still really strong. Inventories are like, how does the shake out into 2022? And then, as you pushed downstream into systems, what do you expect the margin uplift to be, and how has the business, maybe, different from SG&A intensity perspective? Jim Fitterling : I think the supply demand balances are pretty favorable through 2026 because durables demand has been outpacing the supply growth and durables pull a lot on [Indiscernible] and [Indiscernible] operating rates. And so I think you're going to see an earnings ridge in the business that we haven't seen. There have also been a fair number of delays or rationalizations of capacity. And we've also seen obviously margin up within that segment for polyurethane systems. Operator : All right. And we'll take our final question from the line of Matthew Blair with Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Matthew Blair : Hey, good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in here. Howard, I think you highlighted the feedstock flexibility in your crackers. Given the volatile energy markets, do you have any specific examples of the kind of changes you've been making. For example, are you switching away from propane either in the U.S. or in Europe, and then also if you have any thoughts on the recent widening of the ethane to natural gas spread? I think it's out to about $0.08 a gallon. Do you see that, as kind of a short-term blip or perhaps something, maybe a little bit more medium term. Thanks. Jim Fitterling : No, go ahead, Howard Howard Ungerleider : Jim, look at me. So I will take that. Look, I would just say this, our feedstock selection ability is really a key enabler of our consistent outperformance versus our peers as you've seen in the last several years of our annual benchmarking. It includes what I would say is unmatched feedstock flexibility for most of our feet. We've got the ability to max ethane on the U.S. Gulf Coast. We also have propane. We can do minimum naphtha if we need to. In Europe, we also have the ability to do max LPG to your point made propane is not necessarily in the slate right now. So you're not doing that in Europe. But then you also look at the point that Jim made earlier, which is we've got our Canadian advantage. We've got the feedstock flexibility in U.S. Gulf Coast. We've got the Argentinean advantage and we also have the Middle East. And I also think a lot of people talked about feedstock flexibility. But most of the time what that means is that they have three furnaces that can crack this feed, two furnaces that can crack this feed. When we talk feedstock flexibility it's in-furnace flexibility. So we have the ability to switch within the furnace and we can do it -- frankly, we can do it day by day. Typically, we do it every week. Do you have anything to add? Jim Fitterling : I'm only going to add two things. It isn't always the linear equation when you switch from cracking ethane to propane at these propane prices. Some might expect that propane was out of the crack slate. And actually, we've been cracking a fair amount of propane because we're generating a lot more byproducts out of that and we need them all. And so it has been in the slate more than you might expect. And I think as the natural gas prices moderate going into the year, we're going to see that ethane and propane advantage in the U.S. Gulf Coast is going to be there. Pankaj Gupta : Very good. I think that's all the time we have for Q&A. Thank you, everyone, for joining our call. We appreciate your interest in Dow. For your reference, a copy of our transcript will be posted in Dow's website within the next 24 hours. This concludes our call. Thank you. Operator : And again, that does conclude today's conference. We thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

I would now like to hand the call over to Pankaj Gupta. Please go ahead, sir. Pankaj Gupta : Good morning. Thank you for joining Dow's fourth quarter earnings call. This call is available via webcast, and we have prepared slides to supplement our comments today. They are posted on the Investor Relations section of Dow's website and through the link to our webcast. I'm Pankaj Gupta, Dow Investor Relations Vice President, and joining me today on the call are Jim Fitterling, Dow's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Howard Ungerleider, President and Chief Financial Officer. Please read the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the earnings news release and slides. During our call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding our expectations or predictions about the future. Because these statements are based on current assumptions and factors that involve risks and uncertainties, our actual performance and results may differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Dow's Forms 10-Q and 10-K include detailed discussions of principal risks and uncertainties which may cause such differences. Unless otherwise specified, all financials, where applicable, exclude significant items. We will also refer to non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures is contained in the Dow earnings release, in the slides that supplement our comments today as well as on the Dow website. On slide 2, you will see our agenda for the call. Jim will begin by reviewing our fourth quarter and full year highlights and operating segment performance; Howard will then share our outlook and modeling guidance; and then Jim will discuss how we will continue to execute on our priorities to deliver value growth. Following that, we will take your questions. Now, let me turn the call over to Jim. Jim Fitterling : Thank you, Pankaj. Beginning with slide 3, in the fourth quarter, Dow once again delivered top and bottom line growth year-over-year with sales growth and margin expansion in every operating segment. Our results reflect the strength and resilience of our advantaged portfolio and the incredible efforts of the Dow team as we continue to ensure well-being and safety of our team and our communities. We delivered year-over-year sales growth of 34%, with gains in every operating segment, business and region. While volume declined 4% year-over-year due to supply constraints from several factors, including our own maintenance, lingering effects of weather-related outages and global logistics challenges, we continue to see robust underlying demand across our end markets, particularly for higher-margin downstream and sustainability-led applications. Prices were up 39% year-over-year, reflecting gains in all operating segments, businesses and regions. Our discipline and agility enabled us to navigate the supply constraints and logistics challenges I just mentioned, dual control actions in China and rising energy costs. We delivered operating EBIT growth of $1.2 billion year-over-year, with margin expansion in every operating segment. Equity earnings were also up year-over-year with margin expansion at our joint ventures in Saudi Arabia, Thailand and Kuwait. These results translated into significant cash generation for the quarter, with cash flow from operations of $2.6 billion, up $901 million year-over-year and cash flow conversion of 88%. And we returned $912 million to shareholders in the quarter, including $512 million through our industry-leading dividend and $400 million in share repurchases. Our performance in the fourth quarter capped a record year for Dow, which you will see highlighted on slide 4. In 2021, Team Dow capitalized on the economic recovery, achieving record sales and earnings performance despite pandemic-driven uncertainty and industry-wide weather-related challenges. Our focus on cash flow and disciplined capital allocation enabled us to continue to deliver on our financial priorities. We achieved $7.1 billion of cash flow from operations, bringing our total cash flow from operations since spin to $18 billion. We enhanced our balance sheet by reducing gross debt by another $2.4 billion in the year, bringing down gross debt by more than $5 billion since spin. We have also no substantive debt maturities until 2026. We proactively funded our U.S. pension plan, and successfully executed Sadara's debt reprofiling, lowering Dow's guarantees by more than $2 billion. Dow has returned a total of $7.3 billion to shareholders since spin through our dividend and share repurchases, including $3.1 billion in 2021. And we kept CapEx well within DNA as we continued to invest in our higher return and faster payback growth investments. In 2021, we achieved a return on invested capital of greater than 22% on strong earnings growth. As we turn the corner on the pandemic, we do so with a strong balance sheet and a deliberate and disciplined strategy to decarbonize and grow. We achieved this record financial performance in 2021 while advancing our ESG leadership. Importantly, we announced our disciplined strategy to decarbonize our assets, while improving underlying EBITDA by more than $3 billion as we capitalize on our participation in attractive, high-growth end markets and sustainability-driven solutions. Our ESG efforts continue to be recognized externally as we were recently recognized by JUST Capital for the third year. Dow earns a top spot in the chemicals sector overall as well as the number one position in the workers and stakeholders in governance categories in the industry. I'm extremely proud of Team Down's dedication to deliver for our customers and drive value for all of our stakeholders. We will build on these achievements in 2022 as we advance our ambition. Moving to our operating segment performance for the fourth quarter on slide 5. In the Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment, Operating EBIT was $1.4 billion, up $662 million year-over-year, primarily due to margin improvement and partly offset by lower supply volumes. Sequentially, operating EBIT was down $512 million and operating EBIT margins declined by 520 basis points on lower olefin and co-product pricing combined with higher raw material costs and energy costs. The Packaging & Specialty Plastics business reported higher net sales year-over-year, driven by price gains in all regions as well as in key applications such as flexible food, industrial and consumer packaging. Volume declined year-over-year, primarily in Asia Pacific due to supply constraints. Moving to the Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure segment, operating EBIT was $595 million, up $299 million year-over-year, primarily due to continued price strength. Sequentially, operating EBIT was down $118 million and operating EBIT margins declined 280 basis points, primarily driven by higher energy costs in Europe and our planned maintenance turnaround activity. The Polyurethanes & Construction Chemicals business increased net sales compared to the year ago period on broad-based price gains in all regions. Volume declines were primarily due to a planned transition away from a low-margin coproducer contract and our planned maintenance turnaround activity. The Industrial Solutions business delivered a net sales improvement compared to the year ago period with local price gains in all regions. Volume was flat year-over-year as higher volume from a renewable energy contract was offset by fewer licensing and catalyst sales. And finally, the Performance Materials & Coatings segment reported operating EBIT of $295 million compared to $50 million in the year ago period, as margins increased 900 basis points due to strong price momentum for silicones and coatings offerings. Sequentially, operating EBIT improved $11 million as price gains were partly offset by our planned maintenance turnaround activity. The Consumer Solutions business achieved higher net sales year-over-year with local price gains in all regions and across end market applications. Volume declined as strong demand, particularly for industrial, electronics and personal care applications, was offset by lower supply availability due to our own decision to pull forward maintenance activity to coincide with dual-control actions in China. The Coatings & Performance Monomers business achieved increased net sales year-over-year as higher raw material costs and strong industry demand led to price gains in all regions. Volume declined as stronger demand for architectural coatings and industrial coatings, primarily in the U.S. and Canada was more than offset by lower merchant sales of acrylic monomers partly due to Dow's own higher captive use. I'll now turn it over to Howard to review our outlook and modeling guidance. Howard Ungerleider : Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Turning to slide 6. Our diversified portfolio continues to enable us to capitalize on attractive end market trends with higher-margin downstream products. Our four primary market verticals are each growing at rates of 1.3 to 1.5 times GDP and benefiting from sustainability macro trends. We are meeting this demand with higher-margin solutions such as functional polymers, alkoxylates, surfactants, polyurethane systems, sustainable coatings and performance silicones. In the packaging vertical, demand for lower carbon emissions recyclable and circular materials are driving demand for Dow's industry-leading plastics portfolio and in-house application design capabilities. Dow's broad suite of products and hybrid innovations targeting infrastructure will continue to benefit from government investments and incentives, with particular demand resiliency in the Americas, Europe as well as in the Middle East, Africa and India. We see global demand across the diverse consumer market vertical remaining at elevated levels, particularly for applications like electronics, 5G, appliances, pharma and home care, where several of Dow's growth investments are targeted. And in mobility, Dow's portfolio of specialty silicones, polyurethanes and elastomers is uniquely positioned to benefit from growing electric and autonomous vehicle trends. Importantly, these attractive market verticals are supported by favorable balances across our key value chains with continued strength across consumer and industrial end markets, which we'll see on slide 7. We expect the economic recovery to continue as forecasts call for above historical average global GDP growth in 2022. While the Omicron variant has resulted in some near-term disruption, we do not expect it to materially change the current recovery path, particularly as global immunization levels and treatment options continue to increase. Several factors support continued strength across our end markets. Consumer balance sheets remain healthy, with significant pent-up demand driven by more than $5 trillion in additional savings accumulated through the pandemic. Manufacturing growth is expected to remain robust, supported by increasing investments in infrastructure and accelerated adoption for 5G, EV and sustainability trends. And with retail inventories remaining low and backlogs elevated, easing supply chain issues should unleash additional volume growth in 2022 as manufacturing activity increases to meet strong consumer demand. This will certainly be a focus for Dow as we work closely with our customers to fill order backlogs and replenish inventories to meet the robust demand and increase service levels. Turning to slide 8, in the first quarter, we expect these demand trends to drive growth, particularly following the Chinese Lunar New Year. Demand remains resilient in Packaging & Specialty Plastics. Although domestic polyethylene supply improved through the fourth quarter, comonomer supply remains constrained and trade sources are predicting another year of higher-than-average turnaround activity. These factors, coupled with improvements in shipping logistics that will help meet demand in the export market, are leading to more constructive supply and demand balances domestically. Equity earnings are expected to be lower sequentially due to rising feedstock costs impacting Asian olefin margins, and we anticipate higher raw material and energy costs, particularly in Europe and Asia. Altogether, we anticipate an approximately $200 million impact versus the prior quarter for this segment. Utilizing our best-in-class feedstock flexibility and our differentiated portfolio, Dow will continue to be agile to mitigate potential volatility and meet demand. In Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure, strong demand for our high-value materials in appliances, construction, pharma, home care and energy applications, combined with tight supply and increased global infrastructure investment are supporting a constructive demand outlook. We anticipate approximately a $100 million benefit in this segment from completed turnarounds in the fourth quarter, including Sadara's isocyanate facility and several in our core polyurethane business. And we expect the elevated energy costs in Europe will be a $75 million impact versus the prior quarter for this segment. In Performance Materials & Coatings, increasing industrial activity and consumer demand for electronics and construction continues to outpace supply for our differentiated silicone products. The industry also anticipates resilient demand for architectural coatings as rebuilding from low inventory levels in preparation for the Northern Hemisphere spring and summer months. The completion of our turnaround in the fourth quarter at our siloxane facility in China will allow us to take advantage of tight global market conditions as silicon metal supplies improve and energy curtailments in China continue to ease. We will also be executing a turnaround at our methacrylates facility in Deer Park. All in, we expect a $25 million net tailwind versus the prior quarter from turnarounds for this segment. Turning to the full year. We're continuing to provide our best estimates of several income statement and cash flow drivers. Notably, we expect lower equity earnings sequentially due to margin compression versus the tighter conditions in 2021, particularly in Asia as oil remains constructive, putting upward pressure on the naphtha-based feedstock costs in the region. Total turnaround spending for the year will be up approximately $100 million versus 2021 as we have another heavy turnaround year with three crackers slated for maintenance activity and increased inflationary pressure on materials and labor. Net interest expense is expected to be approximately $600 million, benefiting from our proactive deleveraging actions since spin. For cash flow, we anticipate higher joint venture dividends from increased earnings in 2021 and a $1 billion tailwind toward pension-related items following our actions last year. Continued investment in our digital initiatives will drive efficiency and enable us to achieve our $300 million EBITDA run rate on the program by 2025. We will also complete the spending portion of our restructuring program which is now delivering the full $300 million EBITDA run rate as we enter 2022. And finally, as we highlighted at our Investor Day, we anticipate increasing our capital expenditures to $2.2 billion, well within our DNA target as we continue to advance our higher return, faster payback projects and execute on our decarbonize and grow strategy. Overall, the macroeconomic backdrop remains favorable in 2022, and Dow is well positioned due to our global footprint, feedstock flexibility, productivity programs and sustainable solutions for our customers. We will continue to leverage these advantages as we navigate higher oil prices and continue to deal with inflation and logistics challenges. And as the year progresses, we intend to drive operating rates and service levels higher and do expect widening oil to gas spreads. With that, I'll turn it back to Jim. Jim Fitterling : Thank you, Howard. Turning to slide 10. At our Investor Day in October, we laid out our disciplined strategy to decarbonize and grow the Company, supported by a series of in-flight earnings growth programs that will drive over $3 billion in underlying EBITDA growth. In 2022, our capital and operating investments are on track to deliver $200 million to $300 million in run rate EBITDA and will serve higher-margin, differentiated applications where demand is accelerating as customers work to reduce their own carbon footprint. In Packaging & Specialty Plastics, our Fort Saskatchewan expansion completed last year will deliver a full year of earnings growth to support increasing polyethylene demand. And our FCDh pilot plant in Louisiana will start up this year to produce propylene for coatings, electronics and durables end markets. Notably, the technology enables lower CapEx, OpEx and CO2 emissions compared to conventional PDH technologies. These projects serve faster growing, more sustainable market segments such as renewables to drive lower carbon emissions for our customers. For example, our endurance compounds for cable systems support next-generation, longer life, and lower carbon emissions infrastructure, including on and offshore wind farms by reducing the cable manufacturing carbon emissions footprint by 80%. And our ENGAGE elastomers deliver 35% improved performance and efficiency for solar photovoltaic applications. In Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure, our alkoxylates and PU systems expansion projects are closely linked with brand owner demand for higher value, differentiated downstream applications across home and consumer care, agricultural and infrastructure end markets. For example, our surfactants offer an improved environmental profile for leading brand owner laundry and home care products. And our polyurethane system PASCAL technology enables up to 10% greater energy efficiency and appliances without raising manufacturing costs. In Performance Materials & Coatings, we're expanding capacity in formulated solutions for coatings and silicones through incremental debottlenecking projects. Our products enable higher performing, more sustainable solutions, targeting mobility, consumer and infrastructure end markets. For example, FASTRACK coatings enable autonomous mobility infrastructure and have approximately 45% lower greenhouse gas emissions. And our DOWSIL technology enables higher density, lower-cost battery packs for the fast-growing electric vehicle market. Finally, as Howard mentioned, our restructuring program and digital investment will continue to support our low-cost operating model and top quartile cost structure. Turning to slide 11, the increasing demand for sustainable products represents a significant growth opportunity for Dow with attractive pricing that will support longer term higher quality earnings. Our customers are looking for opportunities to enhance their sustainability, and we are meeting those needs with lower carbon emissions solutions beginning with our own operations. Our Alberta project will decarbonize approximately 20% of Dow's global ethylene capacity while growing our global polyethylene supply by about 15%. We are also working with our suppliers to reduce our scope 3 carbon emissions. To date, we have more than 150 supplier agreements in place and have adopted third-party frameworks like CDP, together for sustainability and EcoVadis to drive tangible improvements in environmental performance along the value chain. We continue to advance a circular economy for plastics and see a consistent trend across our brand owner customer base toward redesigning packages to be recyclable and incorporating 30% post-consumer recycled content in their packaging by 2030. Six of our largest sites have now received International Sustainability and Carbon Certification Plus recognition for tracking the use of sustainable feedstocks. We're advancing our partnership with Mura technology to scale advanced recycling solutions and secure circular product supply. Mura broke ground on the new plant with an expected startup around the end of the year. Earlier this month, we announced an investment in Mr. Green Africa, the first recycling company in Africa to be a certified B Corporation, which includes socially responsible waste collection and plans to codevelop new flexible plastic packaging that will enable more sustainable packaging solutions. A first of its kind investment for Dow in Africa, this business model will be scaled to other developing regions around the world. We continue to grow our recyclable offerings, recently doubling sales with Chinese laundry brand, Liby, and increasing our addressable market opportunities. And like the partnerships, Dow recently announced to source pyrolysis oil from Gunvor and New Hope Energy. These investments in circularity are examples of our progress and solid foundation as we grow and scale circular solutions. To close on slide 12, 2021 was an outstanding year for Team Dow. We delivered record financial performance and continued our disciplined execution of our strategic priorities. Building on this foundation, we're focused on advancing our plan to decarbonize our assets and grow earnings. Our competitive advantage enables us to meet the increasing needs of our customers and consumers who are demanding more circular and sustainable products while we work to achieve zero carbon emissions in our own operations. And as we look ahead, our priorities remain consistent. Our focus on profitable growth, while maintaining a low-cost position and best owner mindset, will enable us to deliver on our earnings growth levers. We'll continue to maintain our balanced and disciplined approach to capital allocation, driving higher returns for the Company and our shareholders while retaining the financial flexibility that has served us well. And we'll continue to advance our leadership in ESG with a clear path to achieve our zero carbon circularity and sustainability targets. The world and our customers are demanding a more sustainable future. As we execute our ambition, I am confident that we will create significant long-term value for all of our stakeholders. With that, I'll turn it over to Pankaj to open up the Q&A. Pankaj Gupta : Thank you, Jim. Now, let's move on to your questions. I would like to remind you that our forward-looking statements apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. Operator, please provide the Q&A instructions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank. David Begleiter : Jim and Howard, it looks like there's some recent stability or even strength in polyethylene. What are your assumptions for polyethylene prices over the next couple of months? Could we actually see a price increase maybe in February, given some higher oil prices and better demand and balances here? Jim Fitterling : Our view, as we go into the quarter, we had two increases out in the market, plus 4, plus 4. And I think those will look like they're going to line up for February and for March. As we ended the year, we were a little bit constrained on volume really due to some unplanned events of our own, both the hurricane as well as the situation we had in Terneuzen. Otherwise, December was the best marine pack cargo month for exports that we've had since last March, still not back to where we'd like it to be but I think we see signs of gradual improvement, and the team is working hard to stay on top of that. And I think that's why you see the Asia volume number down in the fourth quarter was we just backed off of those exports in the fourth quarter. Operator : We will move on to our next question from Hassan Ahmed of Alembic Global. Hassan Ahmed : Just wanted to sort of get your views on the Q1 guidance that you guys have given. If I'm running my numbers correctly, it seems you guys, with some of the tailwinds and headwinds that you talk about, you're guiding to around $2.8 billion in EBITDA for Q1 '22. And correct me if I'm wrong, it seems to me that that does not factor in the sort of polyethylene price hikes that you talked about, the 4 plus 4. Is that a fair assumption? Jim Fitterling : Let me have Howard walk through the guidance and then we can comment a little bit more on the market outlook for Q1. Howard Ungerleider : Sure. Good morning, Hassan. Look, I think your number or your estimate is reasonable when you look at all the moving parts. And the way I would think about it is, look, we're going to see about $275 million likely of margin moderation sequentially from Q4 to Q1. And then the net turnaround is actually a tailwind from Q4 to Q1 of about $125 million. So, those are the big moving parts. Jim Fitterling : And I'd say, Hassan, it's possible that margins could open up. Obviously, our view on oil is very constructive because as you look at the market, demand has been better than anybody anticipated for oil. And because of the investments being so low in oil and gas production in the last three years, it takes supply time to catch up. So, when you look at the spare available capacity for oil, that number is relatively low. And as this demand grows, that shrinking spare available capacity number means the market moves up pretty dramatically, and that opens up the spreads. Meanwhile, LNG is obviously driving natural gas production. I think in the United States, as we get through winter, we're going to see prices come down to like the 2.75 a million Btu range. That will mean a pretty good oil to gas spread here and plenty of available ethane for the market. Operator : We will now move on to our next question from Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley. Vincent Andrews : Wondering if you could talk about the Asian polyethylene market, just where we continue to see negative margins. And I assume some of that is just that the raw material costs have moved faster than pricing. But is your anticipation that we'll see those margins neutralize at least through higher prices, or should we anticipate that we'll see some reduction in production there? And I guess I asked that in particular because you're referencing increased export capability coming out of the U.S. I'm just trying to put all of that together. Thanks. Jim Fitterling : Asia has been underwater because of the rise, obviously, in naphtha prices and the narrow margins there. I'd also say a slow start to the year. We've got Chinese New Year ahead of us here the 1st of February. And I think we're watching closely as we come out. We've seen some rate reductions at some Asian producers that are higher cost. That's what we would expect to see. And obviously, when coal ramped up and LNG ramped up, CTO and MTO down. So, as we come out of Chinese New Year watching closely on both polyethylene as well as ethylene glycol and what happens to the market. EG has come off a little bit from the fourth quarter, not terribly dramatic, but it's down more than $100 a ton. And the demand coming out of Chinese New Year will be something we keep an eye on. Now that's good for us. Obviously, with our footprint and our advantaged cost positions here, we just have to continue to improve on these marine pack cargo shipments and get those numbers moving up to take advantage of that arbitrage with Asia. Operator : We will now move on to our next question from Jeff Zekauskas of JP Morgan. Jeff Zekauskas : In your modeling guidance for '22, you say that your share count is 745 million. Isn't your share count today, I don't know, 743 million, and aren't you buying back shares at 6 ,, or 7 million a quarter? Shouldn't your share count be, I don't know, 735 million or 730 million for modeling purposes for 2022? And secondly, how are your VAM operations in the United States? Are they back to normal running at full capacity or are there still issues? Jim Fitterling : Good morning, Jeff. Let me ask Howard to walk through the share count and the modeling guidance data. Howard Ungerleider : Yes, sure. Good morning, Jeff. I would say, look, our guidance is for flat because we're focused on making sure we cover dilution. With that said, we're going to continue to be opportunistic. We bought $400 million worth in the fourth quarter. Our expectation is that we will do that same rough amount in the first quarter. Don't forget the way as you're doing your math, you've got to think about where the stock price is because that will obviously impact the number of shares that we can buy, increased exercise of options as the share price hopefully continues to move up. And then also, the averaging effect, right, because that will impact the number as well. So, that's why we say, look, 745 million is a good number. Could it be slightly lower than that by the end of the quarter? It could be. Jim Fitterling : And back to your question, Jeff, on asset utilization, we've seen -- obviously, we saw some impact in the fourth quarter from weather-related outages and constraints. But as we start the first quarter, I think everything's come back to normal on operating rates. So, we've been running pretty strong in the Gulf Coast, strong as we have for a long time, and that's a nice sign going into the first quarter. Operator : We will now move on to our next question from Frank Mitsch of Fermium Research. Frank Mitsch : Nice end to the year. You referenced the Terneuzen outage. I was wondering if you could talk about your operating rates overall in the P&SP segment in the quarter and then also versus the year. And I believe, Howard, during your comments, you also mentioned that you anticipate higher operating rates in 2022. If you could expand upon that that would be great. Thank you. Jim Fitterling : Yes. Good morning, Frank. P&SP in the segment, obviously, was down a bit in the fourth quarter from what we had been running throughout the year. It was down about 5%. And so, that really hit us. And if you think about fourth quarter, fourth quarter could have probably been about $150 million better have we not had those outages. So, we're running at much better rates right now. The Gulf -- our outlook for rates for the year on ethylene and all the ethylene derivatives is north of 87%. We kind of see that as the low watermark, and that's the way things are running right now, really strong. And then Terneuzen's back, one of the crackers has been back since the beginning of the year. The other one is in the startup phase right now. And so, we'll be back out of that situation. Any other comments on operating rate, Howard? Howard Ungerleider : The only other thing maybe to add, Frank, is remember when you think about year-on-year for full year '22 versus '21. Last year, we had the winter storm. That knocked out the -- that knocked out all of Texas basically for the industry for about 30 days, and then we also had the two hurricanes. So, we obviously can't predict what weather events or what unplanned events are going to happen. But certainly, it feels like last year was above normal. Jim Fitterling : Normal amount of capacity offline for the year. So, typically planned downtime year-to-year will be about the same. We have three cracker turnarounds, the three crackers that are there means about the same amount of outage time. Our expectations on growth, global GDP, 4% to 4.5%; U.S. 4; China, 5 to 6, translates really for us at 1.5 times GDP and about 6% year-over-year volume growth. That's what we're targeting for and that's what we're running for. We want to try to obviously also get some inventories back up and service levels back for our customers, trying to get back to kind of a normal cadence that they can expect and better availability and reliability for them. Operator : We will now move on to our next question from John Roberts of UBS. John Roberts : The downstream coating customers are obviously struggling with raw materials, and it looks like you made some changes to your acrylic mix as well. When do you think the supply chains and coatings sort of get back to a steady state where things aren't shuffling around? Jim Fitterling : They are gradually improving. I would say the one thing in coatings that's a little bit different than some of our other chains, there are quite a few small ingredients that go into that coatings chain. So, third-party suppliers, even that supply through us from day to day, we still see some disruptions on third-party supply and materials. We've got a turnaround right now in the first quarter for Deer Park, but that's planned and then we'll be running hard. We ran really hard in fourth quarter. I think we picked up some ground in fourth quarter, and we're able to help some things out. We've been using more of our own acrylate monomers in our captive business. So that's kind of constrained monomers a bit. But my expectation is with the strong contractor demand for housing architecture, do-it-yourself is still holding up really well and housing starts. I mean you saw the December housing starts number was up 11.9% in North America, which was well above what people expected with rents increasing and the ability to buy or build, being there and some of the materials cost coming off. I think we're going to see a good housing season in North America, and that's going to drive some good business for us. Operator : We'll move on to our next question from Mike Sison of Wells Fargo. Mike Sison : Nice end of the year. Just curious, industry consultants still look for a lot of capacity coming on in -- globally this year, 8 million plus. And you guys tend to have a better view on what realistically could come on. So just any thoughts on sort of the outlook for new capacity, and how much of that could be absorbed this year, given -- it seems like the outlook demand for polyethylene remains really strong. Jim Fitterling : Yes. The demand is very strong. And welcome, Mike, Thank for being here. For every 1% of GDP growth in the marketplace, you need 2 to 3 world-scale polyethylene plants to come on line and our expectation is that is not going to change. We see strong demand across all the sectors for plastics products. And so, that's what's driving it. I would say, we have very good line of sight to the projects and the timing of the projects. And most of them are going to start coming on second quarter midyear impact. And so, I think the market growth is going to help moderate some of that. I think our expectations on operating rates are 2 to 3 percentage points higher than what the industry is expecting on polyethylene, and plastics is typically running a bit heavier than that. So, my outlook is you've got 4 million tons that are coming in North America. About half of that is destined for the export market. So, that's why we're trying to keep an eye on marine pack cargo and the export shipments. About 50% of the global PE capacity adds between now and 2025 are coming on in high-cost regions. Naphtha, which is the most of that and a little bit of CTO and MTO capacity. About 60% of all global polyethylene capacity adds through 2025 are in Northeast Asia. So, I think with the advantage being in Canada, U.S., Argentina, Middle East to places that have really good structural low-cost ethane positions, we're going to be in a good space and operating rates are going to be very high. Operator : We'll now move on to our next question from Bob Koort of Goldman Sachs. Bob Koort : Maybe along the same lines, Jim, I was curious it looked like maybe polyethylene exports were down 15% or 20% in total in '21 from the U.S. as a result of those production issues. And I guess by our reckoning, production might be up as much as 15% in '22. You mentioned the Asian crackers are maybe curtailing a bit. Where is all the extra polyethylene going to get sent relative to what you saw in the export arena in '21, do you think? Jim Fitterling : I do think we're going to see a rebound from all that offline capacity. As Howard said, it's unpredictable, right? I mean, a weather event can take some offline. But the amount offline due to unplanned events, weather-related events last year was probably double what we would normally see. And that Texas freeze had a lot of knock-on impacts that are hurting. I think, yes, we're seeing movement into all the markets. We've seen India come back relatively strong, which has been a good positive. And I think after the Chinese New Year, we'll watch China coming back. We're seeing good steady improvements in marine pack cargo. We need to keep ramping those rates up. And I think as we navigate through Omicron and we'd start to see less of an impact on the labor force, we'll see those numbers loosen up. And so, that's why we're looking for the higher operating rates and the 6% volume growth coming out of the machine this year. I think global -- I'm not pessimistic about inflation killing demand. Honestly, inflation has always been a positive for our business, and over the last 30 years, when the Fed raises interest rates, that typically tends to drive outperformance in our sector versus the other sectors. And so, I think commodities pull is very strong right now, whether it's in petrochemicals or whether it's in minerals and mining for all of the things that we need for EVs and alternative energy. Operator : We will now move on to our next question from Steve Byrne of Bank of America. Steve Byrne : Jim, you have some pretty ambitious sustainability goals on your slide 11. And when you look across all your businesses across the three segments, what would you estimate the fraction of those customers that are asking you for a more sustainable product? And then if you drill into that, do they want your product to have been derived from some recycled material, or do they just simply want their product to be recyclable or does it go even further in that, they want your product to be derived from a renewable feedstock or a low-carbon feedstock? Jim Fitterling : Yes. No, it's a great question, Steve. And this is an area that's rapidly changing. I would say on the brand owner segment, the brand owners pull a lot through the packaging. So, brand owners can be brands that you buy for food or for personal care items, could be medical care, and other types of applications as well. All the brand owners are asking us for more post-consumer recycled content. And obviously, the quality needs to be good. And that's why the discussion around advanced recycling is so strong, and we're making progress getting more and more acceptance of advanced recycling. I think our view is as we go into high-value applications, that is going to be the way that we tackle this. Mechanical recycling will still be there but in those cases, I think you're going to see more mechanical recycling into more durable type applications, different end markets. We see the same trend in silicones, silicones especially in Personal Care, we see the trend in automotive, all the automotive OEMs and manufacturers are looking for to be able to make claims on sustainability on their products. That even goes into polyurethanes for seating and cushioning. And so, the project we announced last year in France were full recycle of polyurethane foams strong demand for those in the automotive sector. Now, the supply is not there yet. And they all want more supply faster and supply challenges making sure that that's all cost competitive. And they just don't have a blank check to write for these materials. It is going to be more expensive than virgin materials. And I think they're all getting their heads wrapped around that. Just like the whole discussion we're having now about focus too much towards renewable energy really drives up the energy cost for the whole complex. And so, that's a big debate right now, and that's why we're very-disciplined about our approach and making bets that we think will be low cost in that future and also will be the quality that customers need for their end product. Operator : We will now move on to our next question from Kevin McCarthy of Vertical Research Partners. Kevin McCarthy : Jim, I was wondering if you could expand on your outlook for volume growth. I think you indicated a target or projection of 6% growth, just quite a bit above the minus 4% that we saw in the fourth quarter. You touched on supply constraints, maintenance turnarounds and dual control actions in China. Is it the case that fourth quarter was unduly depressed by these sort of fleeting or temporary effects, such that will come back quickly to 6%? And if so, might that happen as soon as the first quarter, or do you think that takes longer or more patience as the year progresses? Jim Fitterling : Yes. Good morning, Kevin. It's a very good question, and we will ramp into this as we go through the year. Think about it this way. It was this time last year, I think it was February last year that we had the freeze in Texas. It took pretty much the whole state of Texas down. A lot of capacity came out. And we -- by March, we were back and we ran hard through the month of March. What happened during that time was inventories got depleted pretty much through the chain. And then, we had a very strong second and third quarter. So there wasn't a chance to really rebuild any inventories. We had an October hurricane, again, pressure on inventories, and then we had logistics constraints all through the year. In fact, March was our best marine pack cargo exports after the freeze. And December was the best month we've had since March. So, it took that long to really kind of scale back out of it. So gradually, we're seeing improvement month by month on marine pack cargo exports. We were constrained by the fact that there if you had inventory, it might not have been in the right grade for a customer. We are constrained a little bit by comonomers. Comonomer is very tight for the higher alpha olefins sector, and we're constrained by logistics. And so that's -- and the Terneuzen situation than in Europe, obviously put a curtailment on taking orders in the fourth quarter. So, I think that's a bit of an anomaly and that was specific to those issues. But I think the underlying demand growth is still there, and the order book is still strong. Operator : We will now move on to our next question from John McNulty of BMO Capital Markets. John McNulty : So, I guess maybe two related things. On the supply chain impact that you guys had in terms of the hit to volumes in the quarter, can you help us to understand what that was? And then, maybe a little bit more broadly, when you think about the really tight freight and logistics markets right now and the impact that they're having on some of these very wide arbs, I guess, how are you thinking about how that plays out as we look through the rest of 2022? Jim Fitterling : I think, a good proxy for the supply chain impact would be to look at the Asia volumes year-over-year, and that will give you a good -- because we had a strong fourth quarter last year. And so, that would give you a good indication on the age of volumes. So, if you look at our fourth quarter sales volumes, they decreased in Asia, and that's mostly obviously China. And so I think you can look at that and see that opening back up, and that will drive some of that 6% growth. And then obviously, we have other markets that we serve out of the Gulf that will come back. And some of that outage time was in Europe. And Europe is really sized for the domestic market there. And the business in Europe Q1 has been strong. There hasn't been an issue with demand in Europe. So, I think we'll work through that. Team is working hard on the reliability and availability of schedule. That's been the biggest challenge, is you've got something scheduled and then worker shortages because somebody has tested positive for Omicron means they're not able to pick it up. That's the hand-to-hand that the team is dealing with right now. Operator : We'll move on to our next question from Duffy Fischer of Barclays. Duffy Fischer : Two questions. The first one, on your JVs, EBITDA is down a couple of hundred million dollars, but cash equity dividends to you are up. Can you walk through the puts and takes on that? And then, how should we think about those two moving together going forward? And then, maybe more broadly, just on dual control, now that you and the government there have had the opportunity to kind of go back and forth on some stuff, what do you think the impact in '22 is going to be on your business from dual-control? And what do you think it's going to do to your end markets? Jim Fitterling : Howard, you've got a good line of sight on the JV. So, you want to take a shot at that? Howard Ungerleider : Yes, sure. Duffy, yes, equity earnings were up year-on-year. They were up 224 -- well, they were $224 million, up $118 million. Really gains in Kuwait, Thailand and JV primarily in P&SP in our Industrial Solutions business. And you're right about cash. So, our dividends are -- they come a year in arrears. So if you think about it, the reason why the cash was down this year is because earnings last year were lower in 2020 versus 2019. Obviously, the equity earnings were up in 2021. And so, that's why this year in 2022, we're guiding that the dividends will be up about $250 million. So, you should model in about $500 million to $600 million. We targeted the midpoint of $550 million of higher cash from our JV dividends in 2022. Jim Fitterling : In China on dual control, Duffy, the biggest thing that we had our eye on was, obviously, silica metal for silicones is an energy-intensive process. And early on, there was some concern that China was going to curtail some of that manufacturing. We were able to move some silicon metal from Brazil because we have production there as well to kind of offset. But that's why in the fourth quarter, we pulled some turnaround time into the fourth quarter for Zhangjiagang, for silicones, and that's done now. And over the course of the fourth quarter, both our industry and the solar industry made sure it was obvious to the Chinese government that the impact that that would have on solar PV market and on our market as well. So right now, those assets are not under the dual-control curtailments. We keep a close eye on that. We are not in some of the other locations that have been more impacted by dual-control. And I think it could be positive for imports for polyethylene, although I haven't seen that yet. So, we just keep a close eye on it. But I think for silicones, we're in a good track. We're going to -- we're up and going to have a strong first quarter there. And the market demand and the volumes are good. Operator : We will now move on to our next question from Alex Yefremov of KeyBanc. Alex Yefremov : Howard, I wanted to follow up on your comment about $275 million of sequential margin pressure in the first quarter. If you get any of the $0.08 of polyethylene price increases that you nominate, does this number become better or does it include the $0.08? Howard Ungerleider : Yes. I think you've got -- Alex, good morning. I think you've got two moving parts, so really three. You've got how much volume we can get, which will be the total margin dollars, you've got the price and then you've got the cost structure. I mean clearly, what we're seeing is elevated natural gas prices in the U.S. and also significantly higher Brent pricing, which will impact naphtha. So certainly, in Europe, our cost structure is going to be higher. But I think the points that Jim mentioned earlier, demand is very strong. And so, you are likely going to see higher prices around the world. It is too soon to tell about Asia to the point that Jim made about Chinese New Year. We'll see what happens. But you've got good global GDP, you've got good manufacturing output. You've got good consumer spending. That will drive demand growth. And with the higher feedstock cost, whether it's on a natural gas basis in the Americas or oil, Brent, naphtha in the rest of the world, that will put pressure on price. So, the best that we can do is our view is that minus $275 million a margin offset by $125 million of favorable net positive sequential turnaround. And that's how you get to that 2.08 [ph] plus or minus number. Operator : We'll now move on to our next question from Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets. Arun Viswanathan : Congratulations on a strong year there. I guess, we've talked a lot about the polyethylene market. So, maybe I could also just get you to guys to elaborate on your outlook for polyurethanes, as well as silicones. Could you just comment on those two markets as well? Thanks. Jim Fitterling : Yes. Arun, thank you. Polyurethane market strength in furniture and bedding, appliances, construction, everything related to housing is very good. In that segment, II&I segment also Industrial Solutions, market strength, pharma, home cleaning, food, we have some feed additives in there, crop defense, intermediates for crop defense and electronics are all very strong. And what you see is that the supply-demand is very constructive to the middle of this decade, whether you're looking at MDI, polyethylene -- propylene glycol or ethylene oxide and ethylene oxide derivatives. So, all very strong through mid-decade. We think that even though automotive is a little bit constrained right now because of semiconductor chip shortages, we expect that's going to ease throughout the year and especially in the second half is going to be better. Light vehicle production estimates for this year, about 85 million units around the world. That will be up from last year, so that's positive. Electric vehicle trends are good for us. There's more content on an EV for us than there is on internal combustion engine vehicle, but both of them continue to look good. So, I think that's good. A little bit slower, our operating rates on propylene oxide because the new capacity has come on. But net-net, so the systems business, which is a strong driver of the profitability is going to be good. Just to give you an example on building and construction, we're looking at kind of 4% market growth rate similar to last year, electronics, 6%. And so, I think we've got a good trend in front of us. Pankaj Gupta : I think that's all the time we have today. So thanks, everyone, for joining our call. We appreciate your interest in Dow. For your reference, a copy of our transcript will be posted on Dow's website within about 24 hours or so. This concludes our call. Thank you very much.

I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Pankaj Gupta. Please go ahead, sir. Pankaj Gupta : Good morning. Thank you for joining Dow's first quarter earnings call. This call is available via webcast, and we have prepared slides to supplement our comments today. They are posted on the Investor Relations section of Dow's website and through the link to our webcast. I am Pankaj Gupta, Vice President of Dow Investor Relations, and joining me today on the call are Jim Fitterling, Dow's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Howard Ungerleider, President and Chief Financial Officer. Please read the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the earnings news release and slides.  During our call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding our expectations or predictions about the future. Because these statements are based on current assumptions and factors that involve risks and uncertainties, our actual performance and results may differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Dow's Forms 10-Q and 10-K include detailed discussions of principal risks and uncertainties which may cause such differences. Unless otherwise specified, all financials, where applicable, exclude significant items.  We will also refer to non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures is contained in the Dow earnings release and in the slides that supplement our comments today as well as on the Dow website.  On Slide 2, you will see our agenda for the call. Jim will begin by reviewing our first quarter and operating segment performance. Howard will share our outlook and modeling guidance as well as how Dow's competitive advantages are driving resilient earnings and cash flow while positioning the company for value growth. Jim will then provide an update on how our in-flight actions raise our underlying mid-cycle EBITDA above pre-pandemic levels while also advancing on our path to zero carbon emissions. Following that, we will take your questions.  Now let me turn the call over to Jim. James Fitterling : Thank you, Pankaj. Beginning on Slide 3, we entered our 125th year with global scale, a differentiated portfolio, unmatched feedstock and derivative flexibility and a track record of operational excellence, all of which enables us to continue to deliver more resilient earnings and cash flow in a variety of economic and geopolitical environments and positions us to deliver mid-cycle earnings above pre-pandemic levels.  This is reflected in our first quarter results. Team Dow delivered top and bottom line growth, both year-over-year and sequentially. We capitalized on end market demand strength across the breadth of our diverse portfolio and mitigated the impacts of rising raw material and energy costs.  Year-over-year sales growth was 28% with gains in every operating segment, business and region. Sequentially, sales increased 6%, driven by gains in Performance Materials & Coatings and Packaging & Specialty Plastics. Local price was up 28% year-over-year, reflecting gains in all operating segments, businesses and regions. Price was up 2% sequentially, led by silicones and polyurethanes.  Volume increased 3% year-over-year with gains in all operating segments and in the United States and Canada. Sequentially, volume was up 5%, reflecting strong demand for silicones and packaging applications. And we continued our digitalization drive, marking an important milestone for digital sales in the first quarter as we reached a $1 billion monthly run rate. Operating EBIT increased $865 million compared to the year-ago period with gains in all operating segments.  Despite rising raw material and energy costs, we effectively leveraged our industry-leading feedstock and derivative flexibility in a very dynamic environment. And higher operating rates compared to the impact of Winter Storm Uri in the year-ago period enabled us to capture better end market demand.  We continue to generate significant cash flow of $1.6 billion in the first quarter, up $1.8 billion year-over-year due to increased earnings and no voluntary pension contributions in the current period. Shareholder remuneration totaled $1.1 billion in the quarter, including $513 million through our industry-leading dividend as well as $600 million in share repurchases. Additionally, we recently announced a new $3 billion share repurchase program. This was a direct result of our performance and our balanced and disciplined approach to capital allocation with attractive shareholder remuneration.  Before I address our operating segment performance, on behalf of the Dow team, our thoughts are with the people of Ukraine and their family and friends around the world. Dow continues to prioritize the safety and security of our colleagues in Ukraine and Russia by providing evacuation support, financial assistance and shelter as well as humanitarian aid to refugees in the region. From a business perspective, our presence in Ukraine and Russia represents approximately 1% of annual sales and a much smaller percentage on the bottom line. We fully support and are complying with sanctions implemented against Russia, and have significantly reduced our operations and stopped all investments in the country and are only supplying limited essential goods.  To help diversify Europe's energy supply, we also recently announced that Dow is taking a minority stake in the Hanseatic Energy Hub, which is developing a new zero carbon emissions LNG import terminal. The terminal will be colocated on Dow's site in Stade, Germany and will satisfy up to 15% of Germany's current natural gas demand, helping enable a stable, cost-effective and sustainable supply of energy to Europe in support of the region's economy, Dow's business interests and our communities and our employees.  Moving now to our operating segment performance on Slide 4. In the Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment, operating EBIT was $1.2 billion, up $6 million year-over-year with operating EBIT margins down 400 basis points as price increases in the United States and Canada and Latin America were partly offset by rising raw material and energy costs in all regions. Strong end market demand drove volume up 4% year-over-year. Sequentially, operating EBIT was down $208 million and operating EBIT margins declined by 390 basis points primarily due to higher raw material and energy costs in Europe.  Moving to the Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure segment. Operating EBIT was $661 million, up $335 million year-over-year as operating EBIT margins increased 560 basis points, primarily due to strong price momentum in both businesses and volume gains of 1%. Sequentially, operating EBIT was up $66 million, and operating EBIT margins increased 150 basis points as strong prices and lower planned maintenance activity in the core business offset higher raw material and energy costs.  And finally, the Performance Materials & Coatings segment reported operating EBIT of $595 million compared to $62 million in the year-ago period. Operating EBIT margins increased more than 1,600 basis points due to strong price gains and an 8% volume increase on improved supply availability and robust stand for silicones in personal care and high-performance buildings and demand for architectural coatings. Sequentially, operating EBIT improved by $300 million on price gains and lower planned maintenance activity.  I'll now turn it over to Howard to review our modeling guidance for the second quarter. Howard Ungerleider : Thanks, Jim. Turning to Slide 5. In the second quarter, we expect ongoing underlying demand strength across both consumer and industrial end markets. Despite elevated inflation, consumer spending continues to grow and balance sheets remain healthy with household debt service levels at some of the lowest levels in the last 30 years. Industrial activity also remains robust with global manufacturing PMI continuing to point toward expansion. We continue to monitor dynamics impacting the operating environment, including geopolitical activity, inflation, COVID and the pace in which global supply chain constraints are easing. Our talented team and advantaged operating model continued to position us well to navigate these impacts by leveraging our global footprint, scale and differentiated portfolio, combined with our cost-advantaged and suture feedstock and derivative flexibility.  In Packaging & Specialty Plastics, our order book remains strong, and we expect continued demand strength for packaging applications. Elevated feedstock costs, particularly for naphtha as well as tighter supply as we enter another turnaround season for the industry in the U.S. Gulf Coast and Europe should continue to support prices globally. That will begin a turnaround at our cracker and aromatics facilities in Louisiana, which are anticipated to be $125 million headwind in the quarter. We will continue to leverage our advantaged shale positions in the Americas and our leading feedstock flexibility in Europe to help mitigate these costs.  In Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure, we expect strong demand in industrial and energy end markets, coupled with the seasonal increase in construction and infrastructure activity in the quarter. Higher raw material and energy costs and tight supply and demand balances are expected to provide additional price momentum across our key value chains. We're also beginning turnarounds at our Stade and Terneuzen facilities, which are anticipated to be a $100 million headwind sequentially. In Performance Materials & Coatings, we're seeing robust consumer demand strength across our major end markets, including home and personal care, infrastructure and electronic applications. We continue to monitor the recent pandemic-related lockdowns in China and will remain agile to proactively manage the near-term impacts, particularly on local supply chains. In the coatings sector, value chain inventories remain tight, and we anticipate strong seasonal uplift in architectural demand as the Northern Hemisphere enters paint season. All in, we expect the second quarter to be in line with the prior quarter, excluding the total $225 million impact from turnarounds.  We have also provided updated full year modeling input in the appendix of this presentation. Most notably and supported by our recent buyback announcement, we have lowered our year-end share count assumption to approximately 715 million shares as we remain committed to delivering attractive shareholder remuneration.  Moving to Slide 6. Our first quarter results once again demonstrate our competitive advantages, which have enabled Team Dow to navigate the dynamic macro environment, capture end market growth and continue to elevate our earnings potential. Our broad global reach with local presence, which includes the diversified manufacturing footprint is structurally advantaged and enables low-cost positions in each region.  About 65% of our production capacity is based in the Americas where we have a cost advantage from abundant shale-based feedstocks. We also have industry-leading propane flexibility in Europe, ethane and natural gasoline advantages from our joint venture partners in the Middle East and global sourcing capability to support Asia with ethane advantage supply. Additionally, we are continuously leveraging our industry-leading feedstock and derivative flexibility to optimize margins.  Region by region and furnace by furnace, we are able to mitigate higher raw material and energy costs. This is particularly relevant in today's environment where Dow has more than 2 to 3x more propane flexibility than our European peers. And our derivative flexibility allows us to optimize our product mix to capture differentiated prices and margins compared to our peers. At the same time, our consumer-led portfolio and track record of innovation enables us to grow in attractive market verticals of packaging, infrastructure, consumer and mobility, expanding our share and growing with our customers, particularly for sustainability-led applications.  Growth across our end markets is expected to remain strong over the next several years with distinct demand drivers of sustainability, efficiency and connectivity, all of which are enabling growth rates above GDP. We're capturing these opportunities with innovative new products across our portfolio that not only feature advantage polyolefins, but also silicones, acrylics, cellulosics, polyurethane systems, alkoxylates and elastomers.  For example, our DOWSIL carbon-neutral sealants increase design flexibility of smart buildings to reduce the environmental impact of new construction as infrastructure investments continue to ramp. The RENUVA Mattress Recycling Program converts used mattresses into raw materials for new building and home care applications. Our ENGAGE photovoltaic polyolefin elastomers offer improved performance and extended life for solar applications. And Dow's patented ACCUTRACE Fuel Marker technology was recently selected by the European Commission to help facilitate fraud prevention, especially critical for monitoring fuel flows from sanctioned supply sources.  Altogether, these advantages enable resiliency, growth and support higher mid-cycle earnings compared to pre-pandemic levels. These advantages have been key to our 125-year history and will remain relevant for decades to come.  With that, I'll turn it back to Jim. James Fitterling : Thank you, Howard. Now turning to Slide 7. We have a clear road map to advance our decarbonize and grow strategy, which we expect will deliver greater than $3 billion in additional run rate EBITDA, while reducing carbon emissions by 30% by 2030. This begins with our continued investment in renewable energy, asset efficiency improvements and innovative carbon-efficient technologies like electric cracking and carbon capture.  Licensing our technologies will further expand our value pools, decarbonizing our assets and the industry. For example, our FCDh unit will reduce CO2 emissions by as much as 20% compared to other leading PDH technologies. And as we advance our electric cracking project in collaboration with Shell, we will incorporate even more renewable energy into our network.  In Alberta, we're progressing engineering and development activities for the world's first net zero carbon emissions, ethylene and derivatives cracker complex. This year, we plan to complete our partner agreements, which will put us on track for regulatory approval and a final investment decision in 2023.  We're also advancing plans to reduce CO2 emissions at sites in both Europe and in the Americas. A key part of our decision to advance profitable projects will be ensuring competitive subsidies and commercial contracts before final investment decision. These projects will provide the low to zero emission products that our customers increasingly demand to reduce their own carbon footprint. This is another demonstration of Dow's leadership in the transition to a sustainable world while driving earnings growth.  Turning to Slide 8. To that end, our near-term actions to decarbonize, grow the company and continue to improve our return on capital are well underway. In 2022, our in-flight growth programs remain on track to deliver a run rate of more than $300 million in underlying EBITDA with a focus on targeting downstream and sustainability-led applications across all operating segments that will generate strong returns. In Packaging & Specialty Plastics, our FCDh unit in Louisiana is on track to start up in the fourth quarter of this year and will contribute more than $75 million in run rate EBITDA with a return on invested capital greater than 15%, giving us the key proof point to accelerate the licensing of our technology.  In Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure, our alkoxylates capacity and other efficiency investments are also on track to start up this year and in total, are expected to generate more than $50 million in run rate EBITDA with returns greater than 20%. In order to support the accelerating demand growth across pharma, cleaning and energy sectors, today, we're proud to announce another series of alkoxylate investments in the United States and Europe.  These expansions maintain our current carbon emissions levels and are backed by supply agreements with leading consumer brands across fast-growing end markets. All combined, these investments represent a 70% increase in our industry-leading downstream alkoxylates capacity over the next several years, targeting high-value applications where we're delivering 10% to 15% annual growth rates.  Lastly, in Performance Materials & Coatings, we're also executing a series of incremental downstream debottlenecking projects with more than 20 projects expected to be completed this year, collectively contributing approximately $100 million in run rate EBITDA with return on invested capital of more than 20%.  All in all, by 2025, we're projecting a cumulative underlying EBITDA improvement of approximately $2 billion, driven by projects like incremental high-margin polyethylene and functional polymers capacity to serve growing demand for flexible packaging, debottlenecking projects to enhance our mix toward polyurethane systems serving mobility and consumer applications, and new capabilities to formulate differentiated silicones, including silicone adhesives for next-gen electronics, mobility and infrastructure applications.  At the same time, we continue to decarbonize and deliver on our sustainability commitments by increasing our use of renewable energy, optimizing our assets to be more carbon efficient and driving continuous emissions reductions throughout our global asset base. Just one example, we will reduce our CO2 emissions by more than 350,000 tons, which is more than 15% of our 2025 emissions reduction target when we replace end-of-life steam and gas turbines at our Plaquemine, Louisiana site, with less capital intensive, higher efficiency and lower operating cost systems. Overall, we expect these near-term actions to deliver $2 billion in additional underlying earnings while reducing carbon emissions by approximately 2 million metric tons by the year 2025. And importantly, we'll do this while maintaining CapEx within D&A and continuing to target a return on capital of greater than 13% across the economic cycle as we invest in higher-return, lower-risk projects across the enterprise.  Turning to Slide 9. Dow has unique and resilient competitive advantages, a clear strategy to decarbonize and grow earnings, cash flow and return on capital combined with top quartile operational and financial performance. Our annual benchmarking update is published in the appendix of this presentation and demonstrates once again that we continue to deliver better results relative to our peers across many key financial performance metrics, including top quartile EBITDA margins, return on capital, free cash flow yield, shareholder remuneration and debt reduction. Our commitment to industry-leading cash generation and shareholder remuneration have resulted in an attractive free cash flow and dividend yield above both our benchmarking peers as well as the broader S&P 500. Furthermore, strong execution against our higher return growth projects over the past several years has resulted in 3-year EBITDA growth and return on invested capital that is well above the peer median. And as we've outlined, our in-flight growth investments will deliver additional incremental earnings and cash flow upside with high-quality return on invested capital across the economic cycle.  To close on Slide 10, Dow continues to be well positioned to deliver higher mid-cycle earnings and cash flow above pre-pandemic levels in both the near term and over the economic cycle. With our flexible and advantaged operating model, we're also able to effectively manage in a wide range of macro environments. We continue to deploy our industry-leading cash flow in a disciplined and balanced way to maximize long-term value creation. Case in point, our new share repurchase program reflects the strength of our performance and confidence in our ability to continue delivering industry-leading cash flow.  We're making good progress on our decarbonized growth strategy, delivering incremental earnings by capitalizing on fast-growing demand for more sustainable solutions. Our in-flight actions are elevating our underlying mid-cycle EBITDA above pre-pandemic levels, all as we advance our return on capital. Over the past 125 years, Dow has transformed from a small science start-up to the company that we are today, an industry leader with global scale, a differentiated portfolio and sustainable solutions that enable us to tackle some of the world's greatest challenges. Our ambition, purpose and capabilities continue to make Dow a great place to work for PhDs, engineers, chemists and leading talent from many different disciplines.  For the second year in a row, Dow has been recognized as the only material science company on the Great Place to Work and Fortune 100 Best Companies to Work For list. These advantages enable us to capture value growth while continuing to focus on delivering for our customers advancing our ambition and creating value for all stakeholders.  With that, I'll turn it over to Pankaj to open the Q&A. Pankaj Gupta : Thank you, Jim. Now let's move on to your questions. I would like to remind you that our forward-looking statements apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. Operator, please provide the Q&A instructions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. We will now take our first question from Hassan Ahmed from Alembic Global. Hassan Ahmed : A quick question around the Q2 guidance. As I look at the different moving parts, it seems you're guiding to an EBITDA north of $2.9 billion. So first part of the question is, is that correct? And second part is that it seems that the $0.04 a pound April polyethylene price hike stock, you guys seem to have a May price hike on the table as well. So does the guidance factor in these polyethylene price hikes sticking? James Fitterling : I'll have Howard walk through the guidance. On polyethylene, our expectation is we'll see about $0.04 to $0.05 coming through here in the near term. For the Americas, we've got $0.07 out there in April and $0.07 out there in May. A little bit less in Europe and Asia Pacific. So we are expecting to see prices continue to move up in Packaging & Specialty Plastics through the quarter. With that, Howard, maybe walk through the guidance for second quarter? Howard Ungerleider : Yes. Sure, Jim. Thanks for the question. But you've got it right. Basically, what we're guiding to is to take the first quarter EBITDA actuals, subtract the $225 million of turnaround headwinds in P&SP and Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure and that's our best estimate today of what we see with all the puts and takes of where second quarter EBITDA is likely to land. Operator : We will now take our next question from P.J. Juvekar from Citi. Prashant Juvekar : And congratulations on your 125 years of history. Jim, I have a broad question on sort of the future of the European chemical industry, given what seems like a long-term step up in energy prices there. And then specifically on Dow in Europe, how are your crackers performing there? I know you use more LPGs there. And what about II&I and PM&C? How are the margins holding up in Europe in those segments? James Fitterling : Thanks, P.J. Great question. I think, obviously, there were questions about Europe's competitiveness at different times in history and what's happened with Russia entering Ukraine and what that's caused has created more concerns on Europe's ability to, one, decouple from Russia and to compete longer term. That's one of the reasons we made the announcement about the project in Stade, to basically host that LNG import terminal to help that happen.  I would say the crackers right now are operating well. We're able to still have margin in Europe under these circumstances. Obviously, have to pass a lot of that along. But the thing we have to work on is longer term, getting them to a more competitive feedstock and energy cost position. Europe has been higher energy cost than the United States for quite some time, and we've been able to be profitable there.  We did announce some expansions there in alkoxylates for some of our brand owners. We've made expansions there in Spain previously. This will be in Terneuzen. And as you know, we're going to convert Terneuzen to be a net zero ethylene facility over time. So I do think there will be a chemical industry in Europe, but I think we have to continue to look at how it evolves and how we're going to continue to make Europe more energy competitive to support that industry longer term. Operator : We will now take our next question from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. David Begleiter : Jim, Howard, can you talk about PMC, a little bit about the doubling of earnings sequentially? And how sustainable is this pricing realizing right now in the silicones business? James Fitterling : PM&C had a great quarter. Obviously, PM&C had some issues throughout last year with different outages and some of the challenges from Winter Storm Uri. So Winter Storm Uri impact year-over-year is a big part here.  Volume is also very strong. Coatings -- or silicones has had a super strong first quarter in terms of demand, both on the construction side but also on the personal care side, which is coming back very strongly. Coatings had one of the best first quarters ever, which is the lead up to what's really its typical strongest quarter, which would be second quarter. And not only did volume increase, but pricing increased as well. And we've been able to navigate COVID in China. Even though we had some issues around the Zhangjiagang area, we were able to keep the plant running. And subsequently, that has been lifted and Zhangjiagang is ramping back up to full rates. So I think we executed and navigated that whole situation pretty well.  Silicon metals spiked a bit in the quarter. I would expect, over time, as things kind of normalize, that will come down a little bit, but that also helped drive some of the pricing that we saw in the first quarter.  So all in all, very strong performance. I do think it will continue to be a strong year for PM&C. We've got demand up in building electronics, industrial, mobility and personal care. The only area that's a little bit softer in 2022 versus '21 would be in home cleaning and that's as we're coming out of the pandemic. Operator : We will now take our next question from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan. Jeffrey Zekauskas : It's a two-part question. Your consolidated volumes were up 1%, which is a slower rate than global GDP growth. In general, what do you make of that?  And secondly, Jim, you've been running Dow Chemical now for 3 years. Has your concept of how you create shareholder value changed over that period? And if you had to summarize it, what would it be? James Fitterling : Jeff, good questions. I would say volume, year-over-year, up 1% consolidated basis is one way to look at it. I would say also sequentially, remember, we were up about 5%. We had a very strong operating rate in hydrocarbons and energy in the first quarter. And so we took advantage of the spreads between oil and natural gas, and that was a big underlying support for all the businesses. Some of the businesses that are the big volume generators had a pretty strong first quarter last year, and more of their impact from the freeze happened in the second quarter. We were able to manage first quarter last year by selling out of inventory, but second quarter really saw the stronger volume impact from Winter Storm Uri.  In terms of shareholder return. First 3 years post spin, we were faced with quite a few issues. Right after spin, we were moving into really a declining market, which led into COVID and all the issues we had to deal with. And so our focus during that time frame was to make sure that we navigated that, protected that dividend and made sure that we came out with the best balance sheet in the industry when we came out of the pandemic. I believe we did all those things.  A great company is not always a great stock. The actions we took on share buyback were meant to reflect that we think we are undervalued and there's better total shareholder return ahead. And I think we're starting to see that show through in the marketplace. Operator : We will now take our next question from Chris Parkinson from Mizuho Bank. Chris Parkinson : Just very quickly on the free cash flow side, buyback activity is obviously robust to say the least, including the recent addition. Can you just give us a real quick update on your thoughts for uses for cash, '22 perhaps through 2024, just anything on CapEx, some of the growth investments you've been looking at, just anything else investors should really be considering? James Fitterling : Sure. Howard, you want to take a walk through cash priorities? Howard Ungerleider : Yes. Look, in terms of our capital allocation framework, safely and reliably operate our plants is number one. So to do that, we have about $1.3 billion of turnaround expenses this year. Our CapEx is going to be around $2.2 billion to $2.3 billion this year from an organic investment. That's up from $1.5 billion, $1.6 billion last year. We're continuing to work on the 65% shareholder remuneration as a percentage of our operating net income. That's across the economic cycle.  But as you rightly point out, Chris, our share buyback continues to ramp. We did $400 million in the fourth quarter. We did $600 million in Q1, and of course, the new stock buyback announcement of $3 billion. We have about $700 million left on the current program, that will be done by midyear. And so then we'll have a significant amount of firepower left with that full $3 billion program on a go-forward basis.  And then we'll continue to look at incremental net debt. We still want to 2 to 2.5 rating agency adjusted net debt to EBITDA. So we still are looking at between maybe a $500 million and $1 billion net debt reduction before the end of the year. We'll see how the cash flow goes.  And I would say on the -- don't forget about the cash tailwinds. As Jim talked about in the prepared remarks, our cash flow yield is significantly above our peer group 50%, 5-0 percent above our peer group. It is 20% better than our next closest peer. And one of the reasons is everybody in Team Dow now has not just a P&L statement, but a balance sheet and a cash flow statement.  We're actively working on working capital improvements. Our working capital was improved by 3 to 4 days, depending on whether you're looking at same quarter last year or prior quarter. And then the unique-to-Dow tailwinds that we continue to work on. We've got more than $1 billion of unique-to-Dow cash tailwinds that we're working on still this year that haven't come through that should come through over the next 3 quarters. Operator : We will now take our next question from Vincent Andrews, Morgan Stanley. Vincent Andrews : Just first, can we just clarify the comments you made on the polyethylene prices? I think you said you're expecting a $0.04 to $0.05 increase for 2Q. I just couldn't tell whether that was a global comment or how that compared versus the $0.14 that you have out for the next 2 months in the U.S?  And then my actual question is for Howard, just to talk about the pension. Just given if -- rates have already gone up a lot year-to-date and what with most expectations for what the Feds are going to do for the rest of the year, what does that do in terms of your pension? And what opportunities could that present for you to materially reduce that liability? James Fitterling : Yes. So if you look, Vince, good question. If you look at our polyethylene numbers quarter-over-quarter, the IHS markers that are out there right now call for Americas to be up $0.05; Europe and Asia Pacific to be up $0.04; and the global weighted average to be up about $0.05.  Our current nominations that are out there in the marketplace today are $0.07 in the month of April and $0.07 in the month of May for North America; there's $0.07 on the table from Latin America, which is a carryover from late March; we've got EUR 400 in Europe; and we've got $0.05 in Asia Pacific. So those are the current nominations. So I would say, I think we're going to land somewhere between our nominations and where that IHS data is coming in. Days demand and inventory on PE inventory has decreased about 9%. U.S. and Canada, demand was strong in the first quarter. So that was part of the decrease. But the other part was a product that was sitting, waiting to be exported from the United States. And the export channel is moving better. It's not back to where it needs to be. But we're seeing weekly and monthly improvements in the export channel and that's helping us out. And we're starting to see that roll through in the inventory data.  And did I miss the second half of that question? Howard Ungerleider : The second question was around pension. I can take that, if you want? So when you look at our underfunded pension, we ended the year last year -- that number has come down dramatically. It's come down $6 billion total since year-end 2020. At the end of last year was at $6 billion, that's pension plus OPEB all in. And just with the rate moves we've seen year-to-date, that $6 billion number is now lower by $2 billion.  So our total pension OPEB underfunding is $4 billion. It really only takes another maybe 75 basis points of rate increases and 1 more year of EROA for us to fully fund that gap. What we're doing is we have a methodical plan that as rates continue to move and as each pension plan gets to fully funded status, we are working to immunize each plan individually with the goal of not putting additional cash in to immunize. So that will depend on each country's rules and regulations. And obviously, the EROA and -- of each individual pension plan.  But over the next, I would say, 3 years, plus or minus, depending on how rates move from here and obviously, how the EROA does, we should be able to fully fund and fully immunize that plan. That's the path that we're working toward today. Operator : We will now take our next question from Stephen Richardson, Evercore ISI. Stephen Richardson : Jim, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about your outlook for U.S. natural gas. I appreciate all the discussion on feedstock and all the flexibility that Dow enjoys. We have seen a big move in the back of the forward curve, talk about accelerating LNG exports, some more global linkages at least seasonally. So curious, does that make you want to expand some of your joint ventures and some of your access further upstream? Or how is your outlook kind of changing as a big downstream consumer of domestic natural gas? James Fitterling : Yes. Good question. Natural gas has been stubbornly high. It was higher than last year before the Russian-Ukraine incident and then obviously, then that drove it quite a bit higher. I would say the biggest issue behind natural gas pricing in the near term has been freeze-offs in the U.S. and the fact that we've not been back to the 98 Bcf a day that we need to produce at to get inventories back to the 5-year level. We've only been running about 95 Bcf per day, so we're about 3 Bcf a day short to get those inventories back to that level. Some of that has been due to freeze-offs through the winter and just not a big rebound.  But we're starting to see the production and the rigs shift into natural gas production. And what's going to happen, I think, is that natural gas production is going to come on faster than any LNG export capability. We're pretty well maxed out on LNG export capability today. So we'll -- if we can get these inventories back to the 5-year average levels by the fall, then I think you're going to see natural gas prices really come back into a more normal trading range.  In the medium term, I'd say they get back to $4 to $6, 1 million Btu longer term as those inventories get to that 5-year level, around $3, 1 million Btu. And then I think you'll see how many new export facilities get put up and also how much new import capability in Europe gets added to be able to decouple them from the Russian situation. I think natural gas is going to see more investment and has a more positive outlook in the near term than oil. Oil has not had the investment for new capacity for the last several years. And if we were back to the level that oil needed to invest at today, we'd have to sustain that for a few years before we would see the oil supply come. I think the natural gas supply will come quicker. You'll see a response on natural gas in the 6 months to 12 months' time frame, not 2 to 3 years. Operator : We will now take our next question from Kevin McCarthy from Vertical Research Partners. Kevin McCarthy : Jim, if I look at Slide 8, where you provide some helpful detail on your various capital projects, a few of them relate to silicones. And so I was wondering if you could expand on your near-term and also longer-term outlook there in terms of supply demand and also educate us a bit on where you're adding capacity, how much, and the returns look awfully good at north of 20%. So curious to understand what kind of pricing you're embedding in that as well. James Fitterling : Sure. We've got quite a bit of downstream silicone capacity coming on. A fair amount of it is in China. It's in a wide range of markets. It's in construction markets, in electronics and mobility, it's in personal care markets. Silicones is used in such a wide variety of applications. And those markets are all growing substantially. EVs use 2 to 3x more silicones than a traditional internal combustion engine vehicles and EVs' growth rates right now are relative. Year-over-year growth rates are super strong. So I think both return of internal combustion vehicle sales as the semiconductor chip issue is alleviated and the EV growth is going to really drive a lot of demand there.  Autonomous vehicles, 5G capabilities, all require more silicones. We have to eliminate the crosstalk in all those areas. And you've got to put up a lot more infrastructure in cities for 5G to support absolute continuous coverage in those areas. And that's really, really strong.  There are about 20 debottlenecking projects that are in those total projects. They're anything from new vulcanized products, lower viscosity fluids for personal care applications, all kinds of gels for EVs, electronics, mobile optics for automotive lighting. So think about the headlamps in a vehicle, not being polycarbonate anymore but being moldable optical silicone. Those are some of the biggest growth areas in that sector. Operator : We will now take our next question from Mike Sison from Wells Fargo. Michael Sison : Nice start to the year. Just curious, if you do happen to get sort of this $0.09 increase in the second quarter, yes, I think polyethylene prices will be back to October's peak. Where would integrated margins be if that was achieved? I understand energy costs clearly are higher now versus they were in October. So would you be close to the past peak margins? Or would you need to get more price increases to get there? And could you bifurcate that between North America and Europe? James Fitterling : Yes. If we were to get $0.09, as you suggested, we'd probably be close to that peak in the Americas, maybe a little bit shy of that peak in Europe and a fair bit off of the peak in Asia Pacific. Asia Pacific has been under a lot of pressure because of the much higher cost. Their cash margins in Asia have been really, really slow. And you've seen a lot of turndown in rates in Asia.  But I would say, yes, on North America, you'd be back close to that peak, maybe a few cents below it and same with Europe. So I think you're looking at it the right way. If we were to get $0.09 -- the other way to look at it is if we were to get the whole $0.09, we would probably cover the turnaround costs in P&SP and that wouldn't be a drag on the quarter. That's not what we've got in the forecast, but it is possible that, that could happen. Operator : We will now take our next question from Frank Mitsch from Fermium Research. Frank Mitsch : And let me also offer my congrats on the 125. Jim, you just talked about some of the difficulties in Asia in terms of margins. And I was wondering if you could expand a little bit more on what you're seeing on the ground right now in terms of demand relative to the shutdowns that are going on with COVID zero in China? And how do you think that, that plays out? James Fitterling : Demand has been relatively stable. I would say, we don't have as much of a footprint in plastics in China as we do in Performance Materials & Coatings, and we do in silicones, and we do in Industrial Solutions. And so for plastics, a lot of what we would move in would be from the U.S. Gulf Coast or obviously from our partners in the Middle East.  Having said that, our demand was still pretty strong year-over-year going into China. We're seeing a lot of accelerated turnaround activity right now in China. So you're seeing crackers not just in China, but in Southeast Asia and North Asia, lowering operating rates, you're seeing them take turnaround time now instead of just slowing rates and continuing to operate. We've seen a lot of pressure on coal to olefins and methanol to olefins. And so I think that will continue.  And obviously, I do believe that China is seeing some advantage of being able to buy feedstocks probably from Russian sources at discounted rates. So that may be helping a little bit, but it certainly isn't making them positive cash margins. And I think we're going to be in that kind of environment for the next couple of quarters. Operator : We will now take our next question from Steve Byrne from Bank of America. Stephen Byrne : I have a couple of energy-related questions for you. In Europe, do you have gas hedged? And any hedges that roll off to note here? And with respect to what Germany is mulling over, whether they cut off Russian gas and/or need to pay in rubles, how do you manage that risk? Is it a concern for you?  And then maybe one other energy-related question for you, Jim. You talked through the ambitious decarbonization targets and one of the projects is to try to develop these e-crackers. My question for you on that is, are you seeing some demand pull for greener sources of polyethylene that might enable you to sell those products at a higher price, i.e., do you think you can get a return on such projects like that? James Fitterling : Yes. Good question, Steve. I would say, in general, on hedging and both in the United States as well as in Europe, we've increased our hedging positions on natural gas, just based on what we've seen over the last couple of quarters. And we moved those positions over time, whether it be oil or natural gas. And we've had higher positions on both over the last couple of years.  Our biggest move is just based on our usage and our usage of natural gas and other feedstocks is so ratable that, that physical demand that we create is where we play most with the hedging. So what we can do with physical positions, what we can do with feedstock flexibility around cracking probably is our biggest bang for the buck bottom line. And then the paper strip and the physical are the financial hedge is next after that.  When it comes to e-cracking, the biggest challenge on e-cracking right now is finding the right materials of construction to make an electric coil for a cracker furnace that can withstand the heat that you need to be able to crack hydrocarbons and have any kind of life. And so I would say before we start thinking about what the return on that will be, we've got to just see if we can get the materials of construction right and be able to have a furnace coil that will have any kind of life to it at all and that can operate at a high operating rate and have good reliability over a long period of time.  And that's the biggest proof point on this pilot project. And then we can work ourselves into do we have the renewable energy at the right cost to be able to make that happen. We're doing that work in the Netherlands. I think it's important to note that the Netherlands has 6 new nuclear plants on their long-term plan. And I think that's a great sign in terms of what they see in terms of the need to basically decouple. They're going to have to rely a lot more on nuclear power to have high reliability, low-cost power. And that's going to be especially important for our industry as we move forward. And we need to look at that same thing. We're looking at that here in the U.S. in terms of small modular nuclear reactors. Operator : We will now take our next question from Josh Spector from UBS. Joshua Spector : Just want to follow up. From your release, you guys talked about functional polymer pricing was up, while commodity polyethylene pricing was down. So I'd be just curious, is that normal that you would see that kind of divergence? And if you can give us some perspective of what that spread is today on that functional polymer over commodity. Is that higher or lower than where you would say it's been on average? And where do you see that going? James Fitterling : Yes, that's a good question. About 25% of our product mix is in the functional polymers when you look at P&SP downstream. Typically, the way you would think about functional polymers is they would typically hold their price through the cycle. They typically have less price dynamic movement compared to the commodity side of the business. But they're up quite a bit this quarter, and I would say that's because demand has been strong on the downstream for them and there hasn't been a lot of new capacity added there.  So just a tighter supply/demand balance on some of those functional polymers than we've seen. And I think some of that will continue because some of the markets that they go into are infrastructure-related. They can go into wiring cable markets, they can go into things like geomembranes and roofing for commercial buildings.  And so as you see more infrastructure-related projects, I think you're going to see that strong demand last longer here for functional polymers and that will probably keep the prices of those materials up. Also some higher input costs for some of the monomers to make functional polymers is going to have to pass through as well. Operator : We will now take our next question from Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets. Arun Viswanathan : So I guess, two questions real quickly. So could you just give us a quick outlook on MDI? And then also maybe if you could discuss the certain situation that you see as far as inventories in polyethylene. We know that there's some tied up in supply chain, but do you see that alleviating over the next couple of months? James Fitterling : Yes. Look, good question, Arun. On MDI, the balances through 2026 are pretty good. Demand looks like it's going to continue to outpace supply through 2026. So I think that continues to be positive for MDI.  On polyethylene, as I mentioned, in the Gulf Coast -- in the U.S. Gulf Coast, we've seen inventories come down. Inventories were down in March by about 200 million pounds and days of demand decreased by about 9%. So it's about 46 days of demand, and that's pretty -- if I looked at all of last year, they probably ran around 45 days all of last year. So I'd say pretty normal. And that is with still some congestion in the ports for the export channel.  So I would say supply challenges will still put upward pressure about 3 to 4 days on DDI. And half of that's due to third-party congestion and the other half is inventories that were built to cover turnaround season in second quarter, which is typically the heaviest turnaround season.  Based on the way things are moving, every month, we're seeing a little bit better export flows out of the Gulf Coast. So I think if we can keep steady improvement through the year, hopefully, we can get back to a more normal kind of predictable rate by the end of this year. Operator : We will now take our next question from Aleksey Yefremov from KeyBanc. Aleksey Yefremov : I had a question on the LNG import terminal in Europe. I think, in general, you've been selling midstream energy assets. Is this one an exception because it's so strategic? Or could you, in the long run, also maybe monetize this one? James Fitterling : Well, that's a good question. I think it's unlikely that we get into it just to monetize it. Our contribution -- and remember, our equity interest here is relatively low. We stepped in and made a contribution of land and access to our infrastructure services for the site in Stade. And those of you who are not familiar, Stade is about 40 minutes upstream from Hamburg on the Elbe River.  And we've got the capability. We've got our own port there, and we've got the capability to have a birth for an LNG ship to land in there. And so by contributing that land, we take an equity position in that Hanseatic Energy Hub. They've got plans to build the new terminal by 2026. They're going through the approvals right now. If they can get that done, that will satisfy 15% of Germany's natural gas demand. And so that will really help Germany have a second source of supply to the Russians. And that's very strategic, and I think that's important for the country.  So that's the reason we got into it to make it happen. We're not far enough along yet to get into what the offtake agreements are, but we will provide utilities. We'll provide cooling and other things to be able to help them make that a zero carbon emissions hub. And I'm glad we were in a position to be able to do it. There's been some talk about building an LNG import facility in Germany for some time, but we were at the point where we were not sure whether Stade would still be on the table. And this came together relatively quickly after the Russia-Ukraine situation. And I'm really happy that the team was able to move in fast and put a stake in the ground on this. Operator : Thank you.

On Slide 2, you will see our agenda for the call. Jim will begin by reviewing our second quarter results and operating segment performance. Howard will then share our outlook and modeling guidance. And then to close, Jim will discuss how we continue to advance our Decarbonize & Grow strategy to deliver value growth. Following that, we will your questions. Now let me turn the call over to Jim. James Fitterling : Thank you, Pankaj. Beginning with Slide 3. In the second quarter team Dow delivered top line growth both year-over-year and sequentially. These results reflect the strength of our diverse global portfolio, our focus on execution and our proactive pricing actions. As such, our team was able to navigate dynamic market conditions, the impacts of pandemic lockdowns in China, continued logistics constraints, and higher energy and raw material costs. Sales increased 13% year-over-year with gains in all operating segments and regions. Sequentially, sales were up 3% with gains in all regions except Asia Pacific. Local price increased in all operating segments, businesses and regions, up 16% compared to the prior year period, and up 6% sequentially, with gains in all operating segments and regions. Volume was consistent with the prior year as growth in packaging and specialty plastics was primarily offset by declines in industrial intermediates and infrastructure. Sequentially, volume declined 2% primarily due to lower demand in Europe and China in the quarter. With a low cost position and industry-leading feedstock and derivative flexibility, we generated cash flow from operations of $1.9 billion and free cash flow of $1.4 billion. Our disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation enabled us to further strengthen our balance sheet. We redeemed $750 million of outstanding notes in the quarter, lowering our annual interest expense by $27 million. As a result, we have no substantial long-term debt maturities due until 2027. We also returned more than $1.3 billion to shareholders in the quarter, including $800 million in share repurchases and $505 million through our industry leading dividend. Furthering our commitment to transparency and accountability, this quarter we also published our annual integrated ESG report intersections. The report highlights our ESG leadership advancements and aligns our data and disclosures with key ESG frameworks. Notably, this year's report features convenient access to data, as well as enhanced disclosures and carbon emission reporting for Scope 1 and 2, intensity metrics and full TCFD implementation. Key highlights from the report include executing our plan to decarbonize and grow, accelerating sustainability investments to enable design for recyclability and more circular plastics, taking deliberate actions to drive inclusion, diversity and equity, and improving governance, transparency and accountability. Dow's report is one of few in our industry to receive limited assurance against formal standards by its external audit firm. And with our latest report, we added our Scope 1 and 2 emissions reporting in accordance with greenhouse gas protocol reporting to the assurance review. We're proud of our progress. And if you haven't already accessed the report, we welcome you to do so through the link included in this presentation or on our website. Now, turning to our operating segment performance on Slide 4. In the Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment, operating EBIT was $1.4 billion, compared to $2 billion in the year-ago period, which was elevated due to weather driven events. Price increases year-over-year were more than offset by rapidly rising raw material and energy costs. Sequentially, operating EBIT was up $202 million and operating EBIT margins increased by 120 basis points due to improved product mix and increased integrated margins despite higher raw material and energy costs, primarily in the United States and Canada. Moving to the Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure segment, operating EBIT was $426 million compared to $648 million in the year-ago period, as increased raw material and energy costs and planned maintenance activity were partly offset by higher pricing. Sequentially, operating EBIT was down $235 million and operating EBIT margins declined by 490 basis points also primarily due to higher costs and planned maintenance. And finally, the Performance Materials & Coatings segment, reported operating EBIT of $561 million, up $336 million year-over-year, as margins expanded by 960 basis points, primarily due to price gains for both silicones and coatings applications as well as improved monomers supply compared to the prior year. Sequentially, operating EBIT declined $34 million as lower siloxane prices in Europe and China were partly offset by margin expansion in the coatings and performance monomers business. I'll now turn it over to Howard to review our outlook on Slide 5. Howard Ungerleider : Thank you, Jim. We continue to closely monitor the evolving economic landscape, including inflation, interest rates, ongoing supply chain challenges and geopolitical risks. And as we have continued to prove we are well-positioned to adapt to market dynamics, while continuing to advance our long-term Decarbonize & Grow strategy. Recent economic indicators show continued growth in global economic and industrial activity, albeit at a slower pace. U.S. PMI remained positive in the second quarter, as higher U.S. industrial production and capacity utilization levels were supported by continuing demand for consumables and services. In Europe, the geopolitical and inflationary environment is driving moderation in consumer confidence and spending. However, PMI was still at expansionary levels at the end of the quarter. In China, economic activity began to recover at the end of the quarter, with manufacturing PMI expanding in June and Chinese output and new orders lifting to expansionary levels for the first time since February. And as the regional economy continues to reopen, we expect industrial output and consumer spending to benefit from easing supply chain constraints as well. While the macroeconomic environment remains dynamic, we continue to see areas of underlying strength across our market verticals where demand and consumer spending have been resilient. Our unique competitive advantages including our global footprint, our industry-leading feedstock and derivative flexibility, combined with our chemistry toolkit and our innovation engine enabled Dow to remain agile to changing geographic energy and market conditions. Importantly, oil-gas spreads, as you can see on the slide, continue to support our structurally advantaged feedstock positions along the U.S. Gulf Coast, Canada, Argentina, and the Middle East. These advantages enable us to mitigate the impacts of higher raw material and energy costs as we navigate the market dynamics around the world. Turning to Slide 6, you'll see our current expectations for the third quarter. In the Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment, we continue to see healthy demand in food packaging and consumable end markets, largely connected to economic expansion in the services and travel sectors. Higher energy costs and near-term regional supply imbalances are expected to be a headwind of approximately $125 million in the quarter. We also have three planned maintenance turnarounds at crackers in Texas, Argentina and Canada that will be a $75 million headwind versus the prior quarter as well. In the Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure segment, while industrial activity and infrastructure spending in the U.S. remain resilient, we expect inflation to continue impacting global consumer durables demand, including furniture and bedding and appliance end markets. Industry supply recovery of propylene oxide in China will likely drive higher global polyol and other PO derivative supply and combined with higher energy costs in Europe will likely result in an approximately $125 million headwind. We completed our significant planned maintenance in Stade in the prior quarter, and will execute additional turnarounds at our alkoxylate facility and Seadrift and at our EDC/VCM facility in Germany, in total contributing an approximately $25 million tailwind in the quarter. In the Performance Materials & Coatings segment, we expect sustained U.S. consumer spending for home and personal care applications, as well as a continuation of seasonal construction activity. Industry siloxane capacity additions and supply recovery in China, along with higher energy costs are expected to generate a $200 million headwind in the quarter. All in for the third quarter, we expect a $500 million net impact compared to the second quarter, which is aligned with current first call consensus for the quarter. We remain confident that our focused and disciplined approach combined with our competitive advantages will enable us to maintain our industry leadership and continue to drive value in a dynamic market environment. Finally on Slide 7, we have also updated our full year modeling inputs. Notably, we executed a $750 million make whole call on our 2026 debt in the second quarter in line with our previous full year target. We also raised our expectation of dividends from our joint ventures to $900 million and a year-end estimated share count of 700 million shares due to a strong cash generation profile. With that, I'll turn it back to Jim. James Fitterling : Thank you, Howard. Turning to Slide 8. We continue to advance our Decarbonize and Grow strategy, which we expect will deliver greater than $3 billion in additional run rate EBITDA, while reducing our carbon emissions by 30% by 2030. As a reminder, our path to decarbonize our footprint and grow earnings is a phased side-by-side approach that both retrofits and replaces end of life assets with low carbon emission facilities, while also expanding our capacity. This plan will deliver a 30% reduction in our CO2 emissions between 2005 and 2030, through a disciplined approach based on affordability, macro and regulatory drivers around the world. As a progress update, we continue to invest in renewable energy with access to more than 900 megawatts now. We're also making asset efficiency improvements and investing in innovative carbon efficient technologies like electric cracking and carbon capture. Recently, we announced the startup of an e-cracking research scale unit in the Netherlands that represents a key milestone in our joint technology program. Engineering and development efforts are ongoing for our plan to build the world's first ever net zero carbon emissions ethylene cracker and derivatives complex in Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta, with formal resource loading, vendor selection and project investment decisions by year-end all on track. And work is underway to develop detailed plans to reduce CO2 emissions at our sites in both Europe and in the Americas. These projects collectively demonstrate Dows leadership in the transition to a sustainable world, while driving underlying earnings growth. To that end on Slide 9, while we decarbonize, we also continue to invest in higher return, faster payback projects, capture our efficiency levers, and capitalize on long-term growth opportunities including circularity. In the near-term, our in-flight investments remain on track to deliver an incremental underlying EBITDA run rate of approximately $2 billion by year-end 2025, which includes approximately $300 million of run rate EBITDA in 2022 with growth levers across each of our operating segments. For example, in Packaging & Specialty Plastics, our 150 kiloton FCDh pilot plant in Louisiana is expected to start up in the fourth quarter of this year. In Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure, our alkoxylate capacity investments are on track to start up in the second half of this year. And in Performance Materials & Coatings, we completed two debottlenecking projects and two growth projects in the second quarter, with nine additional projects expected to be complete by year-end. Importantly, circularity is also a key enabler of our growth strategy as brand owners and our customers increasingly demand more circular solutions. We're leveraging on more than 20 strategic partnerships globally, as we accelerate our circular product capabilities and technologies to meet this demand. Today, we announced a series of circularity projects including a plan with our existing partner Mura Technology to construct multiple world scale advanced recycling facilities in the United States and Europe. These projects will add up to 600,000 tons per year of plastic waste recycling capacity by 2030, representing Dow's largest commitment to date, to scale advanced recycling. As a major off taker, Dow's capacity of circular polymer products will expand significantly as we utilize recycled plastic feedstock to produce new virgin grade and 100% circular derivatives serving fast growing brand owner needs across our market verticals. In parallel, we continue to accelerate our mechanical recycling capabilities through partnerships like the one we announced today with French recycling company Valoregen to build the largest single hybrid recycling site in France. That will be the main recipient of its post-consumer recycled resin for our revolute PCR product range, which recently received certification for plastics recycling traceability and content in Europe. These collaborations will support approximately two-thirds of Dow's 2030 target to enable 1 million metric tons of plastic to be collected, reused and recycled. In addition, our efficiency levers are on track to deliver roughly $600 million of run rate EBITDA from our restructuring program and digital investments by year-end 2025. In 2022, we expect these investments to deliver a run rate EBITDA of $50 million to $100 million. We already achieved the full run rate benefits from our 2020 restructuring program at the end of 2021, and we will see run rate benefits from our digital investments ramping up over the next few years. For example, we've accelerated modernizing and automating our warehouse management systems and we improved our supply chain planning processes using new digital capabilities, enabling us to consolidate multiple customer shipments, lower costs, and reduce our carbon emissions. We also improved the customer experience through enhanced real time delivery tracking capabilities across all modes of product shipping. These digitalization improvements are particularly valuable when global supply chains are as dynamic as they are today. Moving to Slide 10, Dow is well-positioned to generate resilient cash flows and deliver value across a variety of economic environment. This reflects our approach to manage the business with more agility and efficiency, operate with the best owner mindset and continue to ensure accountability, transparency, and a discipline and balanced approach to capital allocation. Our 3-year average EBITDA is now at more than $9 billion, driven by our early industry cycle growth investments, and efficiency programs that have collectively raised our underlying earnings above pre-pandemic levels, as well as improved our cost position versus the previous cycle. We nearly tripled our 3-year trailing cumulative free cash flow since spin. With respect to the balance sheet, we have reduced gross debt by more than $6 billion in spin with a target ratings agency leverage ratio of 2x to 2.5x compared to 2.5x to 3x its spin. All of our debt is fixed rate with less than $1 billion of maturities do over the next 5 years, which represents a reduction of approximately $7 billion in near-term debt maturities since spin. Our underfunded pension status now stands at approximately $3 billion, less than half of where it was at spin. The significant progress we've made has been reflected in our credit ratings, including a recent upgrade from Moody's and positive outlook revisions from Fitch and S&P. With ample cash generation, we remain focused on executing our value creating Decarbonize and Grow strategy, while continuing to deliver attractive shareholder remuneration. To that point, we completed our previous share repurchase program in the second quarter, and initiated our new $3 billion program aligned with our target of returning 65% of operating net income to shareholders over the economic cycle. As Dow looks ahead, our strong cash flow, balance sheet and attractive growth prospects collectively enabled increased optionality to remain agile through a variety of economic environments and continue to deliver value for all of our stakeholders. With that, I'll turn it back to Pankaj to open up the Q&A. Pankaj Gupta : Thank you, Jim. Now let's move on to your questions. I would like to remind you that our forward-looking statements apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. Operator, please provide the Q&A instructions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will take the first question from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Vincent Andrews : Thank you and good morning, everyone. Jim, wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the Mura announcement from today and in particular, kind of lay out the path for us what's going to happen between now and 2030 from a timeline perspective in terms of getting that 600kt built? What are the key sort of thresholds that you have to reach, presumably the first plant coming online and so forth is important. And how do the economics of this work in terms of how much capital will you be putting in and in terms of the off take are you getting it at cost or some type of cost plus? And how is raw material sourcing and so forth going to work? James Fitterling : Yes. Good morning, Vince. Thank you for the question. I think importantly, the partnership with Mura today is two-thirds of our 1 million ton goal by 2030 to stop the waste and will drive a lot of volume growth in our post-consumer recycle markets. As we know, those are higher-value premiums in the marketplace today. Most of our brand owners have 30% PCR targets by 2030, and we're seeing rapid growth in our Dow REVOLOOP's brand of PCR containing materials year-over-year. We will be an off-taker from Mura for those capacities. It's multiple plants that will be built in the United States and Europe. I don't have all the detailed timelines on which each -- which time each will RTO, but essentially, we will have the off-take a lot of that material, as you know, to reach the packaging quality that we need for our brand owners. We will also have to be worked in with virgin grade materials. So you can think of the 600kt as additive volumes to virgin materials that we produce today. And then as we get closer to the startup of those, we can give you more details on the margins. Howard? Howard Ungerleider : Yes, I would just add a couple of things, and good morning, Vince. When you add these announcements out that we made this morning, it will make Dow the largest consumer of recycled plastic globally for polyethylene. And to your first question, the first asset with Mura is in Teesside, U.K., and that will be starting up next year, and that's in the 100, 150kt kind of range. Operator : We will now take the next question from P.J. Juvekar from Citi. Please go ahead. P.J. Juvekar: Yes. Good morning, Jim and Howard. Question on plastics. The polyethylene price increases are not coming through as expected. So maybe you can comment on that. But really, my main question is on Europe, where you have higher energy prices likely this winter. What are you doing to prepare for that? You have assets in Germany, which may be most vulnerable. Can you just talk about that and what do you anticipate -- and how would you anticipate any write-downs in Europe? Thank you. James Fitterling : Good morning, P.J. Thanks for the question. We have good integrated margin outlook for the United States Gulf Coast in the third quarter, similar maybe $0.01 lower than what we had in the second quarter. So I think that's very positive. And Howard mentioned the cost positions that we have in our assets that are using ethane and light cracking. In Europe, I expect it will come off a few cents from the integrated margins in the second quarter. As you mentioned, we have high energy cost today in Europe. So that's reflected in second quarter's numbers already. I think our preparation for the fourth quarter, as we get closer to winter time, you have to be thinking that the government could move into some curtailments. We feel very good about our positions in Spain and in the Netherlands because we have some flexibility there. As you know, the Netherlands has our highest percentage LPG cracking. And so that -- we expect that to be an advantage for us as we go into fourth quarter. Spain has LPG cracking as well, but I think that pocket looks pretty good right now. Germany is the place that we have to keep an eye on. We've already reduced our natural gas use in [indiscernible], which is really the biggest exposure. And so we've made a natural gas reduction there that is very significant. And I think we will continue to look at other sourcing capabilities. So we have sourcing capability around the world in low cost positions that if it was necessary, we could look at sourcing differently to supply the European demand. Germany, in and of itself, is not -- and especially [indiscernible] is not the largest footprint for us. I mentioned on the last call also that Stade, we'd worked on a project there to build long-term with a consortium a standing LNG facility, a permanent facility to be able to bring in LNG shipments to help with as much as 15% of the German government's needs. We did get the indication just recently that Stade is a site that was selected to receive one of the floating storage and regas units for LNG. So that's a big help. That will be a facility that will dock near the Stade site and bring that in. That's about 25% of the United States commitment for LNG to help out the European Union. So we feel very good about that, and I think that improves the resiliency -- energy resiliency at the Dow site in Stade. So our focus will be to get ready and look at what we need to do in [indiscernible] beyond the natural gas reductions we've already made. Operator : Next question comes from Hassan Ahmed from Alembic Global. Please go ahead. Hassan Ahmed : Good morning, Jim and Howard. Just wanted to go back to polyethylene again as it pertains to the Q3 guidance you guys have given. Seems you're guiding to an EBITDA slightly north of $2.5 billion. And Jim, if I heard your commentary correctly in response to the previous question, it seems you guys are baking in maybe like $0.01 a pound decline in the U.S. in terms of that Q3 guidance and maybe a couple of $0.01 a pound worth of sequential decline in polyethylene margins in Europe. So is that correct? And if you could also comment on what you guys are seeing in -- on the polyethylene inventory side of things in the U.S.? Thanks so much. James Fitterling : I think you have the read right, Hassan, in the numbers that you read back there. I would say, in inventories in the U.S. were impacted by two things. Half of the increase in inventories in the United States was due to supply chain congestion that was really holding up product exiting the ports down there. Most of that was already packaged and set up for export. So it isn't a product that is likely to come back into the U.S.  The other half, we\u2019ve to remember that there was some turnaround season. It was pretty heavy in the second quarter, and we've got hurricane season upon us in the third quarter here. So we usually try to build some inventories ahead of hurricane season just to be ready. And I think that would account for most of the increase that you see there. There's still supply chain congestion at the port and we're still working through that. I would say, for us, Marine Pack [ph] cargo is the area that we are focusing on. Rail has been relatively good for us. And truck, we don't move as much by truck, but truck has been relatively good as well. Operator : The next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Jeffrey Zekauskas : Thanks very much. Since the end of the first quarter, oil prices have been relatively stable at about $105 a barrel, but naphtha prices have moved down globally. What do you make of that? And do you think that's changing? In your MDI business, are spreads getting worse? And then for Howard, in your Slide 10, you estimate your underfunded pension at $3 billion as of the second quarter. Was that $6 billion in -- as of the end of 2021? And you have gas field investments. Are those ever going to be big? Or it's all small numbers? Thank you. James Fitterling : Thanks, Jeff. I will tackle the first two and let Howard handle the last two. On oil price, we are still bullish oil, and we expect that these oil-to-gas spreads are going to stay in that $70 to $80 a barrel of oil equivalent in the back half. The reason I say that is there's less than 2 million barrels per day of available capacity and oil derivative demand has been very strong. And so we don't see that abating, and we don't see that the supply is picking up fast enough to close that gap. A little bit of effort and you've seen a little bit of movement in China towards coal. You've seen it in the energy industry. You've also seen it in coal to chemicals, that's probably taken a little bit off of the naphtha demand. China, Northeast Asia would be some of the largest naphtha demand that's out there. So my guess is that's why you've seen the oil naphtha correlation change a bit. MDI fundamentals, to your point, are still strong. Our operating rate outlook for MDI through 2025 and 2026 is continuing to increase year-over-year, every year. So I don't think we are going to see any issues with MDI spreads. If byproducts come off a little bit, a lot of byproduct goes into production of MDI. If oil byproducts come off a little bit from the refineries, then that could be actually positive. Howard? Howard Ungerleider : Yes. Thanks, Jeff. Good morning. So yes, the answer on your pension question is correct. So it's $3 billion. By the way, that's total. That's the DB as well as the OPEB. So that's an all-in number. And all it takes is a little bit more rate increase and/or another year of earning the ROA, and that $3 billion probably goes to almost zero. So we've almost got that issue completely behind us. Thanks for pointing out Slide 10 in the earnings deck. I have to say that's one of my personal favorite slides this time. I mean I think when you look at everything that we said we would do at spin and what we've done on every single financial metric, whether it's earnings, whether it's cash flow, whether it's capital structure, we are in much better position today than where we were. And I think that's reflective in the credit rating agency upgrades on Moody's and then the positive outlook, both from Fitch and S&P. Relative to your gas well question, I think you're referring to our Devon investments, and that really -- that deal allows us to hedge I would say both on quantity and duration against rising energy and feedstock costs, and that's just not exactly available in the same way in the paper trading market. So we participate in both. The hydrocarbons are sold directly into the market, and that obviously offsets the price increases for other sources of feedstock in our U.S. Gulf Coast assets. We are really pleased with our partnership with Devon that continues to grow. And it's just another tool in our toolbox of hedging, and that's how we think about it. Operator : The next question comes from Laurence Alexander from Jefferies. Laurence Alexander : Good morning. Could you give a little bit more detail on how you think about the impact of electricity prices in Europe next year? I mean, or if we mark-to-market current spot rates across Dow's positions. And secondly, on the circularity side, are you going to seeing enough price traction and customer commitments that you can expect to have a higher average selling price across your polymer portfolio as recycled polymers become larger in the mix? James Fitterling : Yes. So the first question on electricity. Obviously, we\u2019ve an existing purchase power agreement at Stade, and that also helps supports coal [ph] power. And so we are in a good position in terms of a forward look at what our energy cost needs are going to be, and Stade is our largest electricity user. So I think that is well in hand. I think, obviously, you have to work on what's going to happen with the weather markets in Europe, but that's hard to predict next year at this point. On sales of products containing recycled content, they are wrapping up dramatically. So our REVOLOOP product brand, for example, is up about 140% versus the first half of 2021. They're commanding about $1,500 per metric ton and $2,200 per metric ton price premiums, so $1,500 for advanced recycled materials and $2,200 for bio-based products. And that's compared to the fossil fuel and the virgin alternative. So as we see that, we're going to see that blend into our existing business. Howard mentioned 150,000 tons starting up next year in Teesside in the U.K. and then ramping up to that 600,000 tons. So I do think over time, as we get these numbers larger, we will see it have an impact. And most of that premium is there because the demand is much stronger than the supply. Operator : We will now take the next question from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. David Begleiter : Thank you. Good morning. Two things. First, Howard, on the modeling guidance, how should we think about the roughly $1 billion of lower sales sequentially in terms of applying some sort of decremental margin to that? Or it sounds like it's already embedded in that $500 million headwind. But how should you think about that? And two, Jim, overall, in Europe, in terms of the natural gas curtailments, higher costs, can you frame how much Dow will benefit or could benefit from the situation in the near and medium term? Thank you. Howard Ungerleider : Yes, David. Look, when you think about that $500 million guidance down, which again is in line with the current third quarter consensus. We are not giving incremental margins, but the way I would talk and have you think through it, it's about $125 million in P&SP. On the EBITDA line, it's about $125 million in Industrial Intermediates, again, on the EBITDA line, and $200 million on PM&C. And then you got to add the net $50 million turnarounds on top of that, and that's really split primarily P&SP $75 million headwind; PM&C flat, and then there's a tailwind sequentially and Industrial Intermediates is at $25 million because the turnaround -- the big turnaround was behind us. James Fitterling : David, in the European market, for several years, the European market has been fairly well self-contained. It isn't -- with a few exceptions, it isn't an export market. And so the higher costs in Europe are really what's pushing the integrated margins over there. So I think we are looking at it from a standpoint of maintaining the business in Europe and trying to keep everything running in the event of a curtailment that would mean that we would have to slow something down, we would obviously look to bring in import materials from one of our other lower-cost facilities. But there's a cost to doing that as well. And I think we don't look at it as being advantaged because of a curtailment in Europe. What we really want to try to do is help Europe get some additional sources of gas supply in there, which is why we're doing what we're doing at Stade because we think that's necessary for them for the long-term. They need to have more sources of supply for a better balanced energy policy in the EU. Operator : The next question comes from Frank Mitsch from Fermium Research. Frank Mitsch : Hey, good morning, gentlemen. I was just curious, on Slide 5, you did a nice job of pulling together some of the macro indicators looking out over the past several months, and the direction is modestly concerning. So, I\u2019m just curious in terms of the demand outlook that you have, how would you judge the second half order book for Dow today versus what your expectations might have been 3 months ago? James Fitterling : Good morning, Frank. Good question. I would say the businesses that are still strong on order book. Packaging continues to be strong. Our volumes in second quarter were up 5% year-over-year, without some logistics constraints could even have been higher than that. Industrial electronics for big telco 5G data centers has been strong. Pharma incipients and Dow DIS continues to be strong. Obviously, United States, Canada, we expect to still be strong. India has shown good strength. So, I think that's going to continue. And I think China will come back in a big way in third and fourth quarter. We are seeing between 4% and 5% GDP outlooks in China. If you look at things that are steady to where we were in the first, second quarter, infrastructure continues to be very steady. Autos, even though autos have had issues with chip supply, we still are looking at year-over-year unit build and improvements in the 2023 forecast on auto. So, I think as we get through chip supplies, we will see that move right now today. Our tier OEMs, as they get delays in orders, we see that roll through, but we are managing that. Industrial markets, China has picked up in construction and residential housing and EVs pretty strongly because of programs supporting that. So we see that. And I'd say the industrial markets are coming, but they're lagging that a little bit. Oil and gas is up. So we saw a lot of ethylene oxide derivatives into oil and gas, drilling and cleaning up natural gas. So that's up -- gas production in the U.S. is up to 97 Bcf a day from 95, and I think it's headed to 98 or higher. Residential housing, I would say, the urbanization, I don't think is as big or as we continue to see commercial construction and multiunit construction tends to be strong. Single-family homes and home resales are slowing a bit with the higher mortgage rates. But I think that commercial construction site still looks good. And then we keep an eye on single-family home unit builds here in the U.S.  The ones that are showing a little bit of weakness right now year-over-year, appliances are slowing a bit and consumer electronics. So, I would just think big ticket items for the consumer and people that are paying higher food prices and higher transportation costs and higher utility bills, they're pulling back on some of those things. On the other hand, they're traveling. So, we see those services and tourism numbers up. And so that feeds back into the packaging business and some of the other things I started with. Operator : The next question comes from Kevin McCarthy from Vertical Research Partners. Kevin McCarthy : Yes, good morning. Jim, at your Investor Day last October, you provided a helpful trough to peak EBITDA range of $9 billion on the low-end to $15 billion on the high-end. And today, the run rate is right in the middle at $12 billion. So, it seems as though you've got a fair amount of cushion down to your self-defined trough range. But obviously, a lot's changed in terms of geopolitics and the energy volatility we are talking about here. Is that still the right range? And if so, can you flesh out what sort of assumptions you are baking into the trough level? And whether it might be better in a mild recession scenario or a little bit worse if we stress test further? Thank you. James Fitterling : Yes. Thank you, Kevin. Look, the new range that we laid out is still intact, and we still feel good about that. 9 to 15, and that's including the expansion at Alberta, the net zero emissions facility in Alberta. If you look where we are to 2025, probably that $8 billion to $14 billion range for that 2025 window, because the Alberta expansion doesn't come in until '27 and '29 in a couple of phases there. And I would think about it this way. P&SP always -- Package & Specialty Plastics always performs well in these type of environments. We are well above mid-cycle EBITDA margins right now. And our look is for next year that we will still be above those mid-cycle numbers. So that underpins that lower part of the quarter pretty strongly. II&I, if you take a look at 2022, where we've been with historical peak type of numbers, and I think we are seeing a little bit of softness in a couple of areas there, but we've got growth in Industrial Solutions. They're still well above that within a percentage of their high EBITDA margins. And then PM&C is right at the peak on their EBITDA margins. So I feel good about the quarter. I think we proved through 2020 and what happened with COVID that we have a very good model to understand the peak and the trough. As Howard mentioned, and I mentioned on the script, we have made a lot of improvements to the balance sheet of the company and lowered our cost position with the investments we've made over the last few years. So we go into this with a much better position. And that oil-to-gas spread really underpinned it because we've got very good low-cost assets around the world. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Sison from Wells Fargo. Michael Sison : Hey, guys. Nice quarter. In terms of the export market of China, do you think it's opened up? And if it does, does that potentially improve the outlook for integrated margins in the Gulf Coast? And then as a quick follow-up, in 2020, demand for polyethylene was up 2%, pretty tough time. If we head into a recession, which seems to be impacting everybody these days, at least sentiment wise, what do you think demand from polyethylene would do given that there is not a lot of durable goods is such in a mild recession? James Fitterling : Yes. Good question. I think China is opening up, I would say, export demand -- in our business, China is still a net importer of our materials. And so I think our focus in supplying into China, whether it's through our investments on the ground in China or through our imports, is really to support the local Chinese market. We will, I think, start to see pickup in movement of things, like parts that will help instrumentation electrical business and controls and think mobility parts for the automotive industry. I think we will start to see that improve, which will really debottleneck things back here. But Asia Pacific cost positions, when you think about ethylene and other basic chemicals, are still negative. And the switch over to MTO and CTO, I don't think is really fundamentally going to change that. So I doubt in petrochemicals, we'll see them be an exporter. I think they'll be focused more on getting the domestic economy ramped up and moving. Global growth for PE is still strong. Still in the 1.4x to 1.5x GDP rate. Operating rates are in the high 80s, low 90s, and I think they're going to be that way over the next few years. So if we are able to navigate through this in a soft landing scenario, you could actually see things move and continue to stay above these mid peak numbers over the next several years. Any comments, Howard? Howard Ungerleider : Yes, Michael, the only other comment that I would make to your question about what happens in an economic slowdown in terms of P&SP volumes. If you go back and look in history, we can get you some of this data, if you need, offline. But essentially, I mean, you're right, in the 2020 pandemic economic trough, you saw P&SP volumes actually increase. I would say, historically, when you go into an economic recessionary type of environment or an economic slowdown, you don't lose a lot of volume growth in P&SP. I would say it's typically maybe 2%, 3% reduction in volume. But because people move back to smaller package types, which then basically has more square inches or square meters of packaging, and that actually drives consumption of polymers up a little bit in an economic slowdown environment. James Fitterling : And by focusing our investments in lower cost positions and we\u2019ve over time taken out higher cost assets as well, we've increased our unit margins by greater than 20% each cycle. So higher peaks and higher troughs has been the mantra for the business. You get higher trough versus the last one when you invest in flexibility and lower cost positions like we\u2019ve been, and you get higher peaks when things tighten up. Operator : We will now take the next question from Christopher Parkinson from Mizuho. Christopher Parkinson : Great. Thank you so much. Can you just give us a quick update on your JVs? I mean, the additional disclosure has been very helpful. But just a quick outlook specifically on Sadara for the back half and any preliminary thoughts on '23 would be greatly appreciated. Thank you so much. James Fitterling : Yes. Thanks, Chris. Sadara should improve in the back half as they had some maintenance activity in the second quarter. So they have our first quarter, second quarter was a little bit better, and then the back half of the year, they should be running at full rates. They've also paid down some debt position. So on a relative basis, their balance sheet is in better shape than it was last year. So I feel good about what they're doing there. Kuwait JV is still generating good returns, obviously, watching for China to open up and see if that has an impact that rolls through to MEG pricing, and that's probably the biggest drag on equate right now, although the results are still good. And then the Thai JVs obviously is the most exposed with naphtha costs. And as we mentioned earlier, naphtha is actually coming down. And we will see how pricing evolves in Asia on plastic polyethylene. Functional polymers on plastics continues to be good, and the Thai JVs have a fair amount of capacity in the functional polymer space as well. So that should be positive for them. Howard Ungerleider : The other positive, just to reinforce on the equity earnings, is the dividends. That's the cash that we received. So in the modeling inputs for the full year that we updated, the dividends expected from our JV, it's now expected to be about $900 million of cash. That was a $300 million increase versus the earlier estimate from earlier in the year, and that's now up $600 million versus last year. So that's a nice cash tailwind for us. Operator : We will now take the next question from Alex Yefremov from KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Aleksey Yefremov : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. On Slide 10, you show a bucket of additional value creation for uses of cash. So in that context, how are you thinking about buy versus build decisions? Do you see potential scenario where there's inorganic investment comes around if we do face a downturn and there is a significant acquisition opportunity? Is this something you would roll out or something that remains an option? James Fitterling : We obviously have to weigh that vis-\u00e0-vis our organic growth investments. So the Decarbonize and Grow strategy is very attractive for us. And with the market moving towards zero carbon and also more circular products, we\u2019ve a lot in front of us that is really high value and high return. I think Howard and the team, we still continue to look at non-revenue generating infrastructure assets from a standpoint of the market is there to take on that infrastructure and us be able to liberate some cash from deals like that and then deploy it into organic growth strategy. We look for strategic bolt-on M&A, bolt-on, meaning millions, not billions, for gaps that are in our technology as we move forward. And as you look at things, like growth in sectors like mobility, adhesives, things that have really good drivers to them. If there were opportunities there, I think we'd take a look at it. Any other comments, Howard? Howard Ungerleider : Yes. Alex, I appreciate the question. I mean, look, I think what you've seen, hopefully from us now since before spin, is focused, disciplined and balanced. And our capital allocation priorities have remained the same. Our mindset on that additional value creation will be to do the most value creating thing for long-term shareholder value creation. Our return on invested capital target over the economic cycle is still at least a 3% spread above our weighted average cost of capital. And so that will be the primary focus with which we view any of those bars in that value creation potential bucket. Operator : We will now take our next question from John Roberts from Credit Suisse. John Roberts : Thanks. Nice quarter. Hydrocarbon & Energy contributed 2% of total overall company year-over-year volume growth. Does that imply it was the majority of volume growth in the Plastics & Specialty segment -- the Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment? And how did benzene steam and other energy-related products impact the net earnings in that segment? James Fitterling : Yes. Good morning, John. Thanks for the question. No, I don't think that's what is implied in the volume numbers. Obviously, we\u2019ve a lot of moving parts in olefins, and so byproduct sales can ebb and flow with things. I would say that functional polymers, if you take a look at margin results and price momentum, delivered a really strong margin result on that price momentum, and that drove a lot of the upside in revenues and in the beat because infrastructure really drives the demand for those functional polymers and we\u2019ve a pretty significant sized functional polymers business there. But I think on olefins, we really try to run olefins to keep our integrated margins healthy and then try to move the byproducts into the market, and we see some byproducts that were moving off a little bit as well. So I think packaging, especially plastics packaging volume was up 5% year-over-year. And so I think those trends are still well intact, and I don't expect that those are going to change. Operator : We will now take our next question from Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets. Arun Viswanathan : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Good morning. I guess I have just two quick follow ups on polyethylene and polyurethane. So in polyethylene, do you expect ethane to kind of stay in the $0.40 to $0.60 per gallon range and that kind of provides some support to pricing? Or do you expect pricing to kind of maybe decline $0.03 to $0.06 per pound over the next couple of quarters? And then similarly on PU, now that we are running slower, or running a little bit at BASF Geismar and some of the other facilities that were down, do you expect MDI prices to kind of moderate over the next couple of quarters, especially given what you said on durables demand slowing? Thanks. James Fitterling : Yes, I do expect that ethane will bounce around. There's plenty of ethane in rejection, so it's not a supply driven issue. I think events have caused the prices to move around. Frac spreads right now are about $1.25. And they've ranged in from $1 to $1.50, so that's kind of that $0.40 to $0.60 range at today's natural gas prices. So I think that's a reasonable expectation. As gas production improves, we might see it come off. You've got to remember, you had the ONEOK plant fire in July, which put some upward pressure on prices. You've got a couple of startups of crackers in the second half here, which are going to put a pull on demand. But I think it's a reasonable range and we will watch natural gas and what happens with natural gas because that could pull the prices down a little bit. Pankaj Gupta : And thanks everyone for joining our -- yes, thanks [indiscernible]. I know we are up at time here. I know we couldn't get to all the questions. So for folks who are in queue, we will talk to you this afternoon as well. And I want to thank everyone for joining our call. We appreciate your interest in Dow. For your reference, a copy of our transcript will be posted on Dow's website within approximately 24 hours or so. This concludes our call. Thank you.",

[Operator Instructions] I will now hand over to Pankaj Gupta, Investor Relations, Vice President. Pankaj Gupta : Good morning. Thank you for joining Dow\u2019s third quarter earnings call. This call is available via webcast, and we have prepared slides to supplement our comments today. They are posted on the Investor Relations section of Dow\u2019s website and through the link to our webcast. I am Pankaj Gupta, Dow Investor Relations Vice President. And joining me today on the call are Jim Fitterling, Dow\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Howard Ungerleider, President and Chief Financial Officer. Please read the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the earnings news release and slides. During our call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding our expectations or predictions about the future. Because these statements are based on current assumptions and factors that involve risks and uncertainties, our actual performance and results may differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Dow\u2019s Forms 10-Q and 10-K include detailed discussions of principal risks and uncertainties which may cause such differences. Unless otherwise specified, all financials, where applicable, exclude significant items. We will also refer to non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures is contained in the Dow earnings release, in the slides that supplement our comments today, as well as on the Dow website. On Slide 2, you will see our agenda for the call. Jim will begin by reviewing our third quarter results and operating segment performance. Howard will then share our outlook and modeling guidance. And then to close, Jim will discuss how our actions and long term strategic priorities enable us to deliver value growth in a dynamic environment. Following that we will take you questions. Now let me turn the call over to Jim. Jim Fitterling : Thank you, Pankaj. Beginning on Slide 3, in the third quarter, team Dow continued to proactively navigate higher energy costs and geopolitical uncertainties that are impacting consumer demand, particularly in Europe. As macroeconomic conditions began to erode in the quarter, we responded quickly by implementing a set of actions to prioritize resources toward higher return products, align production rates to supply chain and logistics constraints as well as demand and reduce operational costs across the enterprise. In addition, our advantage portfolio enabled us to capitalize on demand strength in higher value functional polymers in Packaging & Specialty Plastics, and performance silicones in Performance Materials & Coatings. Third quarter net sales were $14.1 billion, with sales declines of 5% year-over-year and 10% quarter-over-quarter. Local price increased 3% year-over-year with gains in Performance Materials & Coatings and Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure. Sequentially, price declined 6% and was down across all operating segments and regions. Volume was down 4% versus a year ago period as declines in Europe, the Middle East, Africa and India or EMEA more than offset volume growth in the U.S. and Canada and Asia Pacific. Sequentially, volume was down 3% led by EMEA. Continued strength of the U.S. dollar also impacted net sales by 4% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. Operating EBIT for the quarter was $1.2 billion. Our consistent focus on cash flow generation and working capital management in the quarter supported cash flow from operations of $1.9 billion or a conversion of 104% of EBITDA and free cash flow of $1.5 billion. We returned $1.3 billion to shareholders in the quarter, including $800 million in share repurchases and $493 million in dividends. And our balance sheet continues to have no substantive long-term debt maturities due until 2027. Turning to our operating segment performance on Slide 4. In the Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment, net sales were $7.3 billion, down 5% year-over-year as price gains and resilient demand in functional polymers were more than offset by lower polyethylene pricing. Sequentially, net sales were down 11%, also driven by lower polyethylene prices with reduced volumes as we decreased operating rates in response to continued global marine pack cargo logistics constraints and lower demand in EMEA. Operating EBIT for the segment was $785 million, compared to $2 billion in the year ago period and $1.4 billion in the prior quarter. These results were impacted primarily by higher raw material and energy costs and lower local prices. Moving to the Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure segment, net sales were $4.1 billion, down 9% from the year ago period with price gains in both businesses. Volume was down as strong demand for pharmaceutical, agricultural, and energy applications in Industrial Solutions were more than offset by declines in polyurethanes and construction chemicals due to inflationary pressures in EMEA, decreased consumer durable demand and the slowing housing market. Sequentially, net sales were down 7% and stable volumes primarily in mobility end-markets were more than offset by lower local price and currency. Operating EBIT for the segment was $167 million compared to $713 million in the year ago period and $426 million in the prior year. As lower EMEA demand and increased energy and raw material costs were partly offset by higher prices. Sequentially, operating EBIT margins declined by 560 basis points on lower price and higher energy costs. And in the Performance Materials & Coatings segment, we reported net sales of $2.7 billion, up 5% year-over-year, with price gains in both businesses and all regions. Volume was down as resilient demand in mobility and home care end-markets were more than offset by declines in building and construction. Sequentially, net sales were down 12%, driven primarily by lower demand and decreased local price for siloxanes due to supply additions in China as well as with planned maintenance turnaround activity. Operating EBIT for the segment was $302 million compared to $284 million in the year ago period as margins expanded by 20 basis points due to price gains for both silicones and coatings applications. Sequentially, operating EBIT declined $259 million driven by lower prices for siloxanes and increased raw material and energy costs. I will now turn it over to Howard to review our outlook and actions on Slide 5. Howard Ungerleider : Thank you, Jim. Turning to Slide 5, in the fourth quarter, we expect to continue navigating high inflation, supply chain constraints and the impact of geopolitical tensions. In Europe, high energy and feed stock costs are driving record Eurozone inflation, reaching a new high of 10% in September. As a result, we see reduced industrial production and consumer spending. In China, COVID-19-related lockdowns continue to hinder economic activity with weaker than expected regional consumer spending and infrastructure investments. That said, we\u2019re seeing continued strength in the mobility sector, with automotive sales up more than 25% in September year-over-year. In the U.S. healthy consumer spending and low unemployment rates have supported resilient underlying demand despite high inflation, with U.S. consumer confidence rising in September for the third consecutive month. Looking forward, we\u2019re closely monitoring the impact of rising interest rates on demand. And in Latin America, we continue to see robust demand for flexible food packaging and consumer durables, as well as transportation and infrastructure end markets. To manage these evolving dynamics, we continue taking actions region by region and business by business. Throughout the third quarter, Dow implemented plans to reduce natural gas consumption at our sites in Europe by more than 15% due to high energy costs. In August, we also temporarily lowered our polyethylene nameplate capacity by 15% and have now implemented a cold furnace idling program at our crackers for fixed and energy cost savings. In parallel, we continue to prioritize higher margin functional polymers to capitalize on continued demand strength while working to ease logistics constraints along the U.S. Gulf Coast. We\u2019re also reducing operating rates and shifting production across polyurethane, siloxane and acrylic monomer assets in Europe to manage our costs and our inventory levels. And as we plan for next year, we have additional actions focused on production optimization, turnaround spending, and reductions in purchase services with the potential to deliver more than $1 billion in cost savings on a run rate basis. Turning to Slide 6, you\u2019ll see our current expectations for the fourth quarter. In the Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment, we see stable demand for consumables and food packaging applications. We anticipate global energy markets to remain volatile in response to geopolitical dynamics as well as weather in the northern hemisphere and continue to expect lower consumer spending primarily in Europe. While lower turnaround costs will be a sequential tailwind, in total, we expect $150 million seasonal headwind for the segment versus the prior quarter. In the Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure segment, demand for energy applications, particularly in the U.S. and a seasonal increase in deicing fluid demand are expected to positively impact the quarter. Inflationary pressures however continue to impact consumer durables and building a construction demand particularly in Europe. We also expect continued pressure on propylene oxide and MEG margins due to increased supply from producers in Asia. After completing major plan maintenance activity in the prior quarter on a net basis, we expect similar dynamics with a typical seasonality on a sequential basis. In the Performance Materials & Coatings segment, demand for personal care and mobility applications remain stable as consumers move toward holiday season buying patterns. However, we also anticipate a seasonal decline in demand for coating applications. Lower spending on planned maintenance activity will partially offset margin pressure from supply of both siloxane and acrylic monomers from Asia particularly to Europe. All in, we anticipate a $250 million headwind for the segment. So in total, for the fourth quarter, we expect a $400 million net EBITDA headwind compared to the third quarter. We have also provided updates to the full year modeling inputs in the appendix of the presentation. Equity earnings have been revised to align with the current market conditions and the weaker margins in Asia. We\u2019ve lowered full year CapEx from $2.1 billion to $1.9 billion, and the full year tax rate is now expected to be slightly higher than our prior guidance due to the geographic mix and lower equity earnings. This upward pressure and the full year rate is also expected to increase the fourth quarter tax rate to account for the typical year-to-date true up. With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Jim. Jim Fitterling : Thank you, Howard. Turning to Slide 7. As a result of our actions over the last several years, we\u2019ve created a streamlined portfolio with unique levers to manage through the current macro backdrop. We have global scale and leading positions across the diverse set of attractive market verticals, geographies, and value chains. This gives us significant flexibility to quickly respond to evolving demand trends and capture demand better than our peers. 65% of our production capacity is in the cost advantage in Americas, and we have 2 to 3 times more LPG flexibility in Europe versus our peers. Our advantaged cost position and unmatched feedstock and derivative flexibility enables us to optimize our margins and our commitment to operational and financial discipline underpinned by a culture of benchmarking and a best owner mindset have resulted in a low cost operating model and strong cash conversion. These advantages have served us well since spin, providing a solid financial foundation that supports long-term value creation despite the current unprecedented events impacting the market. Importantly, our early cycle growth investments and our efficiency programs are enabling us to raise our underlying mid-cycle earnings above pre-pandemic levels. We\u2019ve nearly tripled our three-year trailing cumulative free cash flow since spin across a variety of macro environments, and we\u2019ll continue to execute on levers to drive even higher cash flow, including working capital improvements, joint venture dividends and cash interest savings. And our balance sheet is now the strongest it\u2019s been in my more than 35 years with the company creating a solid financial position that offers significant flexibility. The combination of robust cash flow generation and a strong credit profile enables us to deploy capital in a disciplined and balanced manner as we advance our decarbonize and grow strategy, while also consistently returning cash to our shareholders through the economic cycle. Moving to Slide 8. In 2022, we expect to deliver an incremental underlying EBITDA run rate of approximately $300 million to $400 million, comprised of $300 million from growth initiative across our operating segments, as well as $50 million to $100 million from efficiency levers. We have two Alkoxylation investments coming online this year to serve high value home care and pharma end markets. Our 60 kiloton project in the United States started up in the third quarter, and our 34 kiloton project in Spain is on track to start up in the fourth quarter. Our 150 kiloton FCDh pilot plant in Louisiana is also on track to start up in the fourth quarter. And year-to-date, we have completed 13 downstream silicones debottlenecking projects. Longer-term, we remain on track to grow underlying EBITDA by greater than $3 billion by 2030 while reducing our carbon emissions by 30% versus our 2005 baseline. Our suite of higher return, lower risk, and faster payback investments will deliver $2 billion in additional run rate EBITDA, while we also reduce our carbon emissions by approximately 2 million metric tons by the middle of this decade. These investments target higher value applications that enable us to capitalize on increasing demand for more sustainable and circular solutions. Let me highlight a couple of examples. Our ENGAGE Elastomers increase the lifetime of solar panels and enable over 50 gigawatts of solar power generation around the world. And we recently launched SiLASTIC, the world\u2019s first silicone-based self-sealing tire solution that can be easily recycled, which is being commercialized in upcoming Bridgestone tires under the technology name B-SEALS. We also remain on track to reach preliminary investment decision by year end for our Path2Zero project in Alberta to build the world\u2019s first zero carbon emissions, ethylene and derivatives cracker complex, which will grow our global polyethylene supply by 15%, while the carbonizing 20% of our global ethylene capacity. This project will generate an additional $1 billion of underlying EBITDA by 2030. As we deliver on our growth strategy, we remain committed to the discipline and balanced approach to capital allocation that has served us well since spin. Our first priority is to maintain safe and reliable operations. We continue to advance our growth investments with CapEx at or below D&A and drive return on invested capital greater than 13% across the economic cycle. With adjusted debt-to-EBITDA inside our long-term target range of 2 to 2.5 times, we have the financial flexibility to deploy cash to maximize long-term shareholder value creation, and we\u2019re targeting to return 65% of our operating net income to shareholders. Since spin, we\u2019ve exceeded this target returning an average of 78%. Turning to Slide 9, despite near-term macroeconomic challenges, innovating circular and sustainable solutions remains a key aspect of our long-term decarbonize and grow strategy. We see increasing demand for these products, which represent a significant growth opportunity for Dow with attractive pricing that will support longer-term higher quality earnings. We have continued to accelerate our actions to capitalize on this opportunity and create a circular economy. And we recently announced a new commitment to commercialize 3 million metric tons of circular and renewable plastic solutions annually by 2030. This new goal expands our sustainability targets and our focus on advancing a circular plastics business platform to meet our customers increasing demands for more sustainable and circular products as evidenced in the recent letter published by the Consumer Goods Forum, citing demand for advanced recycled plastic material. To achieve this goal, we will exceed our original target to enable 1 million metric tons of plastic waste to be collected, used, reused or recycled, and we\u2019re well on our way as we scale a robust pipeline of more than 20 strategic collaborations to enable recycling infrastructure to partner across the value chain to bring hard to recycle waste into the circular economy and to help communities address waste management and recycling gaps. This includes our most recent and significant commitment to-date to scale advanced recycling with Mura Technology, which positions Dow to be the largest consumer of recycled plastic feed stock for polyethylene globally. These collaborations are a unique advantage as demand for circular solutions continues to grow. When you consider together this circular and renewable sales target along with the additional capacity from our Alberta Project, in 2030, our combined circular, renewable and zero carbon emissions capacity will comprise greater than 50% of our global polyethylene capacity. I\u2019ll close on Slide 10. Our strategic priorities remain unchanged. We will continue to operate with agility as we navigate the current market dynamics as evidenced by our recent actions to balance production while ensuring we remain well positioned to capture demand as market conditions improve. At the same time, we remain focused on executing our long-term growth strategy, expanding our competitive advantages and delivering on our financial priorities to position the company for long-term success. With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Pankaj to open up the Q&A. Pankaj Gupta : Thank you, Jim. Now let\u2019s move on to your questions. I would like to remind you that our forward-looking statements apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. Operator, please provide the Q&A instructions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take the first question from P.J. Juvekar from Citi. Please go ahead. P.J. Juvekar: Yes, good morning, Jim and Howard. With the IRA and CCS credit going to $85 per ton, are there any projects in CCS that you could deploy at your existing plants that come into the money now that weren\u2019t there before? And then secondly, on Europe, would you accelerate - incrementally would you accelerate CapEx in the U.S. given the situation Europe is in? And then if Europe is not producing much chemicals, how does that impact in your mind sort of the downstream automotive building and construction businesses in Europe? Thank you. Jim Fitterling : Good morning, P.J. Two really good questions. I think when we look at the IRA, which has a lot of good elements in it for our sustainability agenda both hydrogen and CCS as well as advanced nuclear. The challenge right now is where do you have the availability of the existing pipeline infrastructure to get carbon off of an existing asset into a CCS category. That\u2019s why we put the project in Terneuzen and the project in Alberta first, because we have existing capacity there. And I should say in Terneuzen not yet, but Terneuzen has got a plan in place to get it in place. This is going to help us get some infrastructure in place in the U.S. Gulf Coast, so will make that possible. And as that becomes available, we\u2019ll look at accelerating deployment here in the U.S. Gulf Coast. And I would say $85 a ton, we think long-term, those numbers are probably going more towards a $100 a ton or higher. And that should really help accelerate hydrogen and CCS. On CapEx in the U.S. and the future of chemicals in Europe, third quarter, the two big challenges we had were \u2013 the biggest was primarily electricity-related, and third quarter you saw European electricity cost go as high as \u20ac400 of megawatt hour, they\u2019ve come off a little bit now because natural gas has come off. About half of our footprint in Europe has advantaged electricity. So we did in the quarter was bring down rates to the advantaged positions or kind of run and break even in Europe and obviously load other assets with that demand. I think in the short-term, you\u2019re seeing more product flow into Europe from the Middle East and some right now from China. I think longer term we\u2019re working with the governments through energy policy changes that are going to help. One of the reasons we announced the project in STADA one of the five floating regas units that\u2019ll be put in Germany to really help Germany diversify away from just solely Russian gas. I think the European question, long-term will be in front of us through next year, but in the short-term, we\u2019ve got a good game plan to navigate the winter and to navigate next year, and that\u2019s why we announce the billion dollars worth of cost reductions for 2023. Operator : We will now take the next question from Hassan Ahmed from Alembic Global Advisors. Please go ahead. Hassan Ahmed : Good morning, Jim and Howard. Just trying to reconcile the Q4 guidance you guys have given, it seems to me you\u2019re guiding to an EBITDA of roughly $1.45 billion. If that is the case, I\u2019m just trying to sort of understand what sort of polyethylene pricing you\u2019re baking into that guidance. Because it just seems that there\u2019s some price hikes on the table, some consultants are out there sort of doubting some of those price hikes going through, so if you could provide any color around that? Jim Fitterling : Thank you, Hassan. Good question. Obviously, we saw pricing in polyethylene through the third quarter decline. It started to stabilize the beginning of the fourth quarter. Most of what\u2019s in that, fourth quarter outlook is more stable pricing in polyethylene, but you get the dollar averaging that happens through the quarter, so we start the lower pricing and it carries through the quarter. Inventories came down on the Gulf Coast, stepped down from the high levels that they were in the third quarter, and so that\u2019s helping and we\u2019ve seen some better Marine Packed Cargo logistics. We had good volumes out in the third quarter. We could have done more. And so we\u2019re continuing to try to work on the logistics constraints. And so most of what\u2019s in there is dollar averaging, more stabilized pricing, and then a little bit of tailwind because we have lower turnaround costs into the fourth quarter for polyethylene. The other thing I would mention is that input costs are starting to look more favorable. We\u2019ve started to see a little bit of improvement in the ethylene chain. Oil is obviously \u2013 oil inventories continue to be low and natural gas production continues to be higher. And so that\u2019s positive skewed, I\u2019d say the estimate skew to the upside if oil and gas continue on these trends. Operator : We will now take the next question from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan. Jeff Zekauskas : Thanks very much. Two questions. Can you talk about MDI prices and volumes sequentially and your general expectations? And secondly, in Performance Materials, there seems to be a fair amount of pressure in siloxane prices. Are we entering some kind of cyclical downturn in that business? And so what we should expect is a relatively level of earnings from the fourth quarter going forward. Jim Fitterling : Yes. Good morning, Jeff. Thank you for the question. On MDI in Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure, the supply demand balances through the middle part of the decade look good on MDI, where we\u2019ve seen market weaknesses in consumer durables, mobility is held up pretty well. Electric vehicles are really probably the shining star on growth in that space. But it\u2019s housing and construction where we\u2019ve seen the biggest weakness. And then of course, appliances closely related to that. I would also say, what you see in the numbers and what you see in the guide, remember that we have quite a bit of footprint in Europe, and so with the energy situation there that just really compresses the margins there. I think it\u2019s less pricing and less that issue than it is the input cost issue. So that\u2019s why we brought rates down to low levels in Europe. China also seeing housing and construction slow. And so I think we\u2019ll see what happens after we come out of this party Congress and whether we see a change in COVID restrictions that might signal that 2023 would be better. In siloxanes capacity has come on in China and that\u2019s really what\u2019s brought the prices down. And we\u2019re really back to the kind of the long-term mid-cycle average prices for siloxanes in the marketplace, and yes, we expect that will continue into 2023. And so I think it\u2019s more, the timing of the supply coming on that\u2019s put that pressure on. Operator : We will now take the next question from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. David Begleiter : Thank you. Good morning, Jim and Howard. Howard, just on modeling guidance. Does the $400 million of sequential EBIT headwinds fully capture the seasonality in Q4 and is any benefit in the guidance from the $1 billion of cost savings you highlight today as well? Thank you. Howard Ungerleider : Yes, good morning, David. So yes, look at an enterprise level, the short answer to your question is it does. So the $400 million net of really EBITDA decline, I would call, half of that is enterprise level seasonality or typical Q3 to Q4 seasonality, and the other half is the averaging effect of the margin decline that we saw through the third quarter. And then you\u2019ve got two pieces that are kind of offsetting each other. The higher \u2013 the more favorable turnarounds or the lower turnarounds that Jim mentioned that are getting offset by some currency headwinds that we\u2019re seeing sequentially. Embedded in that are some of those interventions that, we listed in the slide that\u2019s in the earnings deck. So, we are already and have been intervening since the beginning of the third quarter. So, we\u2019re going to see that continue through the fourth quarter and then obviously in a bigger way next year. Operator : We will now take the next question from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Vincent Andrews : Thank you, and good morning everyone. Just wondering if you can talk a little bit more about sort of the delta between what you think underlying demand is versus maybe some destocking that\u2019s going on just given all the macro uncertainty out there. And part of what I\u2019m getting at is, you\u2019ve obviously made some seasonality assumptions sequentially from 3Q to 4Q and just trying to understand, how much of what we\u2019ve seen already in terms of weak demand might have been a pull forward of what we might have previously thought could have happened more traditionally in November and December. So just sort of any comments you have helping us bridge, sort of the weak volume with destocking versus underlying demand would be helpful. Jim Fitterling : That\u2019s a good question, Vince. Obviously the retail sector saw a lot of higher inventories and pulled back. I would say in automotive things are still restricted primarily by those supply chains of all the different various parts coming together so the auto companies can make their deliveries. That probably shows up more on internal combustion engine vehicles, somewhat on EVs, but EV growth in the U.S. and EV growth in China have been really, really strong. So, I think that\u2019s going to continue to be good. Our outlook for automotive next year is 86 million light vehicles up from 80 million projection this year I think that\u2019s good. Packaging, I don\u2019t think we saw a lot of destocking in packaging in the market. I would say, we saw adjustment to lower operating rates because of the slowdown of demand in EMEA. EMEA being off 12% was a significant slowdown. Consumer pressures in EMEA are much stronger than even the consumer pressures here, and they\u2019re significant. The durable goods and the consumer electronics is a tough one to call. They\u2019re pretty tightly connected to housing. China housing is down 38%. Their housing starts are down 38% year-over-year. So that\u2019s a pretty low level. I\u2019d say there\u2019s opportunity for upside going into next year. The U.S. has slowed down, but we\u2019re still working off of finishes of houses that are under construction. And so I think the general consensus is demand is a little bit slower for 2023 on housing here. The other bright spot is infrastructure, and so for those businesses that are tied to infrastructure we still see very good infrastructure spending. Operator : We will now take the next question from Michael Sison from Wells Fargo. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is Richard on for Mike. Just wanted some color on the $1 billion in cost savings for 2023. Is any part of this embedded in the $3 billion to $3.9 billion that you\u2019re targeting to increase sort of the \u2013 your earnings range through the cycle? And also is that \u2013 does that also include the temporary 15% reductions in polyethylene and maybe additional reductions in capacity, potentially in maybe II&I. Jim Fitterling : Yes, that\u2019s a good question, Richard. So, our target is to come up with more than a $billion in cost saves. I would break it down into a few different buckets for you. One is, what we can do with optimizing our mix, so flexing the assets across geographies and product and application mix tax when improve margins. The second would be what you talked about in terms of plant idlings were shutdowns. Right now we don\u2019t have anything lined up for shutdowns, but we obviously reduce rates for higher cost plants, and we\u2019ll continue to do that, especially in Europe while energy costs remain as high as they are. And then we\u2019re working on always things to drive operational excellence. And the other big moving part next year is, we\u2019re going to reduce turnaround spending. We\u2019re starting to see commodities come down and input costs come down and some relief on freight and logistics costs. So, we\u2019ve got a big effort on purchased materials and freight and logistics to get costs down and also on purchased services including contract labor. And then we\u2019ve been implementing digital and acceleration of finishing those projects delivers bottom line margins and productivity to us. So those are really the five big buckets that we\u2019re working on. The target here, if you looked at the earnings corridor that we published back in Investor Day, our 2023 lower end of that corridor is about $7.2 billion. So our efforts here are really driven to protect that earnings corridor that we put out there. A lot of the path to zero project growth in that earnings corridor the Alberta project, which is a $1billion of underlying EBITDA growth, starts in 2027. That project will come on in two phases between 2027 and 2030, but the other $2 billion comes on through the years as we bring on these smaller, higher return, lower risk projects. Operator : We will now take the next question from Kevin McCarthy from Vertical Research Partners. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, good morning, this is Cory in for Kevin. Turning back to a question on the outlook. You had mentioned, benefits in the ethylene chain. What are you baking to your 4Q outlook as it relates to ethane costs? And what is your view in light of today\u2019s natural gas market backdrop? And then for the cold furnace idling program, can you talk through or quantify what impact you expect it to have on fixed cost absorption at your reduced plants? Thank you. Jim Fitterling : Right. That\u2019s a good question on ethane. I mentioned natural gas earlier. So gas production continues to be high, more than half a million barrels a day of ethane in rejection that has really brought the frac spreads down. And so we\u2019ve seen frac spreads come back down to about $0.33 a million Btu, so off of some of the highs that we saw in first, second quarter. And I think our projection is it\u2019s going to continue to be that way. Natural gas productions and 100 Bcf a day right now. And the outlook for next year is 110 Bcf a day. There will be plenty of ethane available. So, I think our feeling is, we expect through winter, $0.40 to $0.60 a gallon on depending on what happens with winter gas demand. That\u2019s really where it was, $0.35 to $0.65 in third quarter, and I think next year we\u2019re going to see continued availability and lower pricing on ethane. And in terms of the cold furnace idling, I don\u2019t have a good number for you to estimate what that is. Essentially, the practice historically would\u2019ve been to keep those assets on hot standby and ready to go, but with the slower demand, there\u2019s no need to do that. And with these higher gas costs, taking them cold and then warming them back up is not going to penalize this in the marketplace. Operator : We will now take the next question from Steve Byrne from BOA. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks. It\u2019s Matthew on for Steve. Can we talk about the trending functional polymers a bit? I think price was up year-over-year, but sounds like maybe down sequentially. Did margins in that business improve quarter-over-quarter with base commodities deflating? And when we look at 4Q, does that performance catch up on the downside or do you still think things should hold in pretty well? Jim Fitterling : Yes. Thank you. Good question. Prices typically are pretty resilient through the cycle in, in that space. We saw prices flat really from quarter-to-quarter, and so that margin declined a little bit because of the higher energy in raw material costs. But the demand continues to be good. Demand in, in areas like commercial construction, which is, is holding up relatively well mixed use both residential and commercial buildings are holding up pretty strong around the world and that takes a fair amount of material. Obviously products into automotive are holding up pretty well, and then energy, energy infrastructure takes a lot from the wire and cable business and that continues to hold up well. So I think what you\u2019ll see is, they can \u2013 the margins can ebb and flow a little bit but the volumes and the price trends are very strong. Operator : We will take the next question from John Roberts from Credit Suisse. Matt Skowronski : Good morning, Jim and Howard. This is Matt Skowronski on for John. Some of the consultants have reported that polyethylene storage levels are very high in North America. Would you consider taking operating rates lower than the 15% reduction you\u2019ve already taken if demand weakens further and then sitting here today, do you think it\u2019s possible that further reductions in production will need to happen either through the end of this year or early 2023? Jim Fitterling : Thanks for the question. I think the storage levels primarily at the ports are waiting for ships to arrive to get the product out. A lot of that product is packaged for the export market, so it isn\u2019t that that product is going to magically turn around into the North American market. And with what we see with demand growth in the North American market, I don\u2019t see a reason to reduce operating rates any further. I\u2019d also say Latin American businesses holding up relatively well. So that gives us some opportunity as well. I think it\u2019s going to be worked out as we get better ship arrival times and better loading. I think you\u2019re going to see those numbers deplete pretty quickly. Howard Ungerleider : I would just also add the latest ACC data says that inventory levels actually decreased by 7% or about four days month-on-month. So I mean, I think you still see fundamental demand in the United States and Canada hanging in there. Operator : We will now take the next question from Christopher Parkinson from Mizuho. Christopher Parkinson : Hi, good morning. I was just wondering if you can parse out a little bit, what end markets and regions, you saw the biggest shift in demand versus kind of your original expectations in the second quarter and how those areas are trending into the fourth quarter. Now, is there any area where you\u2019re more optimistic or more concerned as we head into the end of the year in 2023? Thank you. Jim Fitterling : Yes. Good question, Chris. So areas of strength are industrial electronics and think about telecom, 5G infrastructure, data centers and that continues to be pretty good. There can be some supply chain constraints there, but they\u2019re pretty strong. In industrial solutions we make intermediates and incipients for the pharma industry. That demand has been strong; we\u2019re looking at greater than 7% compound average growth rates through 2026. And so that\u2019s \u2013 I think that\u2019s going to continue industrial solutions in general, as I would say has good growth trends and silicones, downstream silicones in general have good growth trends. Automotives we\u2019re seeing some supply constraints easing and even those sales this year; deliveries this year are flat year-over-year really robust EV growth especially in China. If you look at China, EVs are up 90% year-over-year and automotive in China is up 25% year-over-year; I think that\u2019s a bright spot. We expect to continue EVs in the United States also strong, and I expect that to continue. That\u2019s good for us because two to three times more silicone materials in the EVs and similar amount of materials that we would have in an internal combustion engine for things like controlling noise, vibration and harshness. Infrastructure\u2019s going to continue to be strong. There\u2019s stimulus packages out there, many governments around the world and that tends to pull a lot in functional polymers, which we just talked about. It will pull some polyurethanes and construction materials that will pull some in coatings in that infrastructure space and some into our industrial solutions. In plastics it tends to pull in things like water pipelines, natural gas pipelines, I think we\u2019ll continue to see that grow. Steady markets, I would say would be oil and gas. We\u2019re starting to see an uptick in oil and gas production that pools a means from our industrial solutions business. Personal care has been very resilient. Cosmetics have come back after a soft second quarter in China and packaging for food. And so the issues in packaging are really more, not demand, but really more the higher energy cost and slowing economic activity in Europe. And then places where I mentioned before a week are related to housing and big ticket items, so appliances, food and beverage activities like furniture and bedding, I mean, not food and beverage, appliances and furniture and bedding slowed down third quarter and into fourth quarter. And then consumer electronics slowed down as well, large TVs, large home PCs and electronic devices. Residential softening here in the U.S., Europe, also in China but commercial construction has been relatively good; mixed residential and commercial buildings especially in big cities. I think next year, India, U.S., Canada, Latin America will be bright spots. We\u2019ll still have to manage through Europe and the situation with Russia/Ukraine having the biggest impact there. And then China we had our \u2013 we had our best quarter in China. We were up 13% quarter-over-quarter and 7% year-over-year in volume and could have been better with the ability to get more plastics out of the Gulf Coast. So I think there\u2019s been a lot of concern about what they\u2019ve reported or not reported, but our view is that demand has been good. Operator : We will now take the next question from Josh Spector from UBS. Josh Spector : Yes. Hi, good morning. So I was curious if there is a way to think about the costs you guys are absorbing in Europe from higher energy. So we think about 3Q and 4Q expectations versus the level of 2Q. Is there any way to quantify how much you feel like you\u2019ve had to absorb and not be able to kind of shift away from flexing your production or through pricing or other means? So if pricing or energy prices were to move down would demand environment remains similar? How would you think that would play out? Thanks. Jim Fitterling : Simple answer two-thirds of the total EBITDA decline in third quarter whether it was versus previous quarter or last year was in EMEAI, and that\u2019s the impact of high inflation, elevated energy costs on our raw materials and then what that high inflation has done to consumer demand in EMEAI. Volume was down 12% in the quarter in EMEAI. Operator : We will now take the next question from Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets. Arun Viswanathan : Great, thanks for taking my question. Good morning. So my question is around North America and potential, your outlook there. I know Europe was responsible for two-thirds of the weakness in Q3 and its likely been the case for a little while now. Are you at all concerned of a weakness that could emerge in North America? Is North America just a little bit behind Europe and China and the weakness that you\u2019re seeing there? I mean, I guess you\u2019re not seeing China weakness, but, but on Europe? And what are some of the factors that would differentiate and keep North America a little bit more resilient? Maybe you can touch on inventories or supply demand or anything else. Thanks. Jim Fitterling : Well, the cost position that we have in the Americas is very advantaged and so I think that\u2019s the most important thing to keep in mind. The consumer demand has been strong especially consumer non-durables, consumer discretionary has been good. I would say big ticket items, like I mentioned have already slowed this year. So if anything, there\u2019s a chance for upside next year. I think that same is true on automotive, automotives really been supply constrained. And so we get through some of that. We\u2019ll start to see that move up. We\u2019re starting to see and here, I\u2019m not talking just about Dow\u2019s business, but we\u2019re starting to see prices come down in bulk commodities. It takes those prices a while to work through the fabrication shops and get themselves into the price of a product that a consumer would buy in the store. So those prices have come down through the year, and I think you\u2019ll start to see those show up in the consumer markets next year and that may actually help things improve. European energy situation is totally different than the United States. And right now we\u2019re trying to work through how we can help the governments get to a better energy policy that will help them out. I think that\u2019ll be the biggest improvement globally that\u2019ll help the economy move. Operator : We will now take the next question from Aleksey Yefremov from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is Paul on for Aleksey. As we approach winter, how are you guys managing the cost front in both the U.S. and Europe, and do you see the potential for any idling of assets in Europe maybe not your assets but just probably in the industry? Thanks. Jim Fitterling : Yes, I think we have seen in energy intensive industries in Europe like steel and aluminum already idling of assets a lot. Maybe not complete closure, some energy intensive industries, complete closure may jeopardize the long-term, probability of starting them back up. But lot of pressure on smaller producers in Europe, especially having some scale matters and having good advantage cost positions matters. About half of our energy footprint in Europe is advantaged. And so we\u2019ve dialed back to those rates to take advantage of that cost layer, and then we\u2019ve loaded that demand onto other locations that are more cost advantage. We\u2019ll continue to do that. I think the other answer to shutdowns is going to be whether we see a way through the energy policy situation. The longer we stay in this situation, the longer the Russia/Ukraine situation lasts; it\u2019ll put more pressure on the industry to take a look at rationalizing. And they\u2019ve already got a lot of pressure\u2019s there. They need government help more than anything. Operator : We will take the next question from Laurence Alexander from Jefferies. Laurence Alexander : Good morning. So can you describe how you\u2019re thinking about CapEx flexibility over the next couple of years given the, we\u2019re given the credit cycle in prior cycles, Dow\u2019s tended more to look at retrenching, but as you look at the investments required for the circular economy initiatives, could you pull forward or be opportunistic in expanding sort of what you do in that value chain as other people retrench? Jim Fitterling : Good question, Laurence and obviously we\u2019re trying to have the financial flexibility to keep moving on those projects because I don\u2019t think long-term any of those trends are going to change. We see the consumer demand throughout the year in spite of what\u2019s going on in the global macro economy. Consumer has come back to us consistently wanting more and more, more of both mechanical recycled, advanced recycle products and products made with bio-based ingredients, more renewable products and that\u2019s what we\u2019re investing in. Some of it\u2019s our capital, some of it is joint capital together with partners, like I mentioned with Mura Technologies. We have about 20 projects in plastics today. We had a 1 million metric ton target and we have good line of sight to be able to deliver the 1 million and we just increased it to 3 million metric tons of circular and renewable solutions by 2030, mainly because of those brand owners who are telling us the demand is there for those products. And so we will keep those projects moving forward. We will keep our decarbonization and Path2Zero projects moving forward. Obviously we\u2019re going to be disciplined about it. Most of the monies that we spend on Path2Zero right now are engineering dollars, and we will not pull the trigger and start those projects until we see the bulk contracts for steel and fabricated products and long lead time items in the right range. And when we see that we\u2019ll be ready to go. And I think in this next wave, we\u2019ll have first mover advantage with the Canadian project, just like we did with the U.S. Gulf Project that started up in 2017. Operator : We will now take the next question from Jaideep Pandya from On Field Research. Jaideep Pandya : The first is on the siloxane value chain, could you just tell us what is the current cost differential between Europe versus the U.S. and China on a lended cost basis, if you include the energy cost? And given that significant supplies coming in China in the next 12 to 18 months, especially in Xinjiang and Yunnan what do you expect for siloxane utilization outside of China? That\u2019s my first question. And the second question really is around the ethylene oxide MEG chain. This chain has done extremely well for not just yourselves, but a lot of your peers as well. And again, we are starting to see as freight rates normalize product come out of China. So what do you expect the EO chain in 2023 and 2024? Do you expect a normalization or do you think that demand is going to continue to be good? Thanks a lot. Jim Fitterling : The siloxane prices that are available there in China become available in all the regions around the world already. So I think it\u2019s already at that spot. Silicone metals market prices are down a bit mainly just because demand and some higher volume applications are down, higher volume applications related to building construction. But that I think is going to steadily improve. I would expect it to be in these levels in 2023. And then as we see, inflation coming down, which I do believe it will, I think you\u2019ll see the demands start to pick back up again and things will tighten back up. Let\u2019s put more pressure on Europe, I would say than North America. And that\u2019s why we took some slower rates in our UK facility. On EO demand was that the second half of the question? Jaideep Pandya : EO and MEG? Jim Fitterling : EO and MEG. MEG is the weak spot in EO. If you look at our industrial solutions strategy, it is to keep investing in high value EO applications. And so all the alkoxylate investments that you see, investments in our oil and gas franchise for means those are continuing to do very, very well. And we\u2019re going to continue investing there to try to increase the amount of business that goes to those higher value applications for purified EO and away from MEG. MEG prices were actually at a low spot in the third quarter and had improved a little bit since because of falling inventories. I think a big part is going to be dependent on higher China activity after they stopped the zero COVID lockdowns. Pankaj Gupta : Yes. Thanks everyone for joining our call. I think that\u2019s all the time we have for today. We appreciate your interest in Dow. For your reference a copy of our transcript will be posted on Dow\u2019s website within approximately 24-hours. This concludes our call. Thanks once again. Operator : Thank you. That will conclude today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation. Ladies and gentlemen, you may now disconnect.",

I will now turn it over to Dow Investor Relations Vice President, Pankaj Gupta. Mr. Gupta, you may begin. Pankaj Gupta : Good morning. Thank you for joining Dow's fourth quarter earnings call. This call is available via webcast, and we have prepared slides to supplement our comments today. They are posted on the Investor Relations section of Dow's website and through the link to our webcast. I'm Pankaj Gupta, Dow Investor Relations Vice President. And joining me today on the call are Jim Fitterling, Dow's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Howard Ungerleider, President and Chief Financial Officer. Please read the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the earnings news release and slides. During our call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding our expectations or predictions about the future. Because these statements are based on current assumptions and factors that involve risks and uncertainties, our actual performance and results may differ materially from our forward-looking statements.  Dow's Forms 10-Q and 10-K include detailed discussions of principal risks and uncertainties, which may cause such differences. Unless otherwise specified, all financials where applicable exclude significant items. We will also refer to non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures is contained in the Dow earnings release, in the slides that supplement our comments today as well as on the Dow website. On Slide 2, you will see the agenda for our call. Jim will begin by reviewing our fourth quarter results and operating segment performance. Howard will then share our outlook and modeling guidance. And to close, Jim will then outline our competitive position for long-term value creation. Following that, we will take your questions. Now let me turn the call over to Jim. Jim Fitterling : Thank you, Pankaj. Beginning on Slide 3. In the fourth quarter, Team Dow continued to take proactive actions to navigate slower GDP growth, challenging energy markets and customer destocking. We proactively lowered our operating rates to effectively manage working capital, implemented operational mitigation plans and cost saving measures and prioritized higher-value products where demand remained resilient, including in functional polymers and performance silicones as well as in mobility, renewable energy and pharma end markets. These actions, combined with our continued focus on cash enabled us to deliver cash flow from operations of $2.1 billion in the quarter. Cash flow conversion was 166%, and we returned $620 million to shareholders. Dow's cash generation reflects our continued focus on operational and financial discipline, which was important as we navigated an extremely dynamic year in 2022, as you see on Slide 4.  In the first half of the year, we capitalized on strong demand across our diverse global portfolio while leveraging our derivative and feedstock flexibility and low-cost positions to mitigate higher raw material and energy costs. In the second half of the year, economic conditions deteriorated driven by record inflation, rising interest rates, ongoing pandemic lockdowns in China and continued geopolitical tensions.  In the face of these evolving market dynamics, Dow was resilient, generating cash flow from operations of $7.5 billion for the full year. While executing our disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation. We delivered returns on invested capital of 15%, above our 13% across the economic cycle target, as we prioritized higher return, lower risk and faster payback investments.  We achieved credit rating and outlook upgrades as a result of our strengthened balance sheet, and we have no substantive debt maturities due until 2027. And we returned a total of $4.3 billion to shareholders, including $2.3 billion in share repurchases and $2 billion in dividends. At the same time, we continue to advance our Decarbonize and Grow strategy and accelerate circularity to create long-term shareholder value as we meet growing customer demand for more sustainable solutions. I'm proud of how Team Dow continues to deliver for our customers, drive shareholder value and support our communities as we progress toward our 2050 carbon neutrality target, and you can see a number of those highlights depicted on this slide. Now turning to our operating segment performance on Slide 5. In the Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment, net sales were $6.1 billion, down 16% year-over-year as price gains across all regions and functional polymers were more than offset by lower polyethylene and olefin prices.  Volume declines were driven primarily by lower olefins and packaging demand in Europe, which was partly offset by a resilient global demand for functional polymers. Sequentially, net sales were down 17% driven by lower hydrocarbon sales and polyethylene prices. Operating EBIT for the segment was $655 million compared to $1.4 billion in the year ago period, primarily due to lower integrated polyethylene margins. Sequentially, operating EBIT was down $130 million as lower raw material and energy costs were more than offset by lower polyethylene prices and operating rates. Moving to the Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure segment. Net sales were $3.7 billion, down 20% from the year ago period. Volumes declined primarily due to lower demand in Europe for industrial, consumer durables and building and construction applications. Sequentially, net sales were down 10% as seasonal demand increases for deicing fluid were more than offset by declines in building and construction, consumer durables and industrial applications. Operating EBIT for the segment was $164 million compared to $595 million in the year-ago period, driven by lower demand and increasing energy costs, particularly in Europe. Sequentially, operating EBIT margins expanded by 40 basis points as lower energy costs versus the prior quarter were partly offset by lower volumes. And in the Performance Materials & Coatings segment, we reported net sales of $2.1 billion, down 20% year-over-year as local price gains for performance silicones and architectural coatings were more than offset by lower prices for siloxanes and acrylic monomers. Volume was down as resilient demand in mobility was more than offset by declines primarily in building and construction end markets. Sequentially, net sales were down 22% due to seasonally lower demand for coatings, industrial and building and construction applications as well as local price declines for siloxanes and acrylic monomers. Operating EBIT for the segment was a loss of $130 million compared to earnings of $295 million in the year-ago period due to local price declines primarily in siloxane and lower operating rates in the quarter. Sequentially, operating EBIT declined $432 million, driven by lower prices, demand and operating rates. I'll now turn it over to Howard to review our outlook and actions on Slide 6. Howard Ungerleider : Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. We expect the market dynamics we experienced in late 2022 to continue into early '23. While the pace of inflation has moderated, overall cost levels remain elevated, which has continued to trigger tighter monetary policy in most parts of the world and is weighing on both business investment and consumer sentiment.  The majority of economic forecasts are calling for slower GDP growth globally relative to 2022, although dynamics differ by region, with most regions except Europe still forecasting positive year-on-year growth. In the U.S., we see signs of moderating demand and the continuation of year-end destocking trends early in the quarter.  Building and construction end markets have been particularly impacted by inflation and rising interest rates with housing starts declining by more than 20% year-over-year in December. Manufacturing PMI contracted for the third consecutive month of 48, while light vehicle sales in the U.S. were down for the full year by 8 percentage points. Easing inflation is leading to improving consumer confidence, albeit from depressed levels in late 2022, while consumer spending remains resilient. In Europe, we expect demand to remain constrained despite recent improvements in regional energy prices.  While the move to five-year highs in gas storage is a positive sign, changing weather forecasts are leading to volatility in the futures markets. High inflation and geopolitical tensions continue to weigh on consumer spending and industrial production. December manufacturing PMI has been contracting since July, and construction PMI reached its lowest level since May. In China, while we're very encouraged by recent ships in COVID policy to ease restrictions and open up orders, we expect these actions to take some time to improve economic activity. This is an area we're closely monitoring as it has the potential to provide a source of significant demand recovery following the Lunar New Year.  And in Latin America, overall economic growth is expected to slow, driven by political tensions, high inflation and restrictive monetary policy. Given this dynamic backdrop, we will continue to take a region by region, business-by-business approach to managing our operations and adapting our businesses to the evolving market realities. Turning to Slide 7. As we highlighted at our last earnings call, we are proactively responding to the current economic environment with a playbook of targeted actions to deliver $1 billion in cost savings. This begins with maintaining a low cost to serve operating model by implementing actions to optimize our labor and service costs, including a global workforce reduction of approximately 2,000 roles.  We will continue to increase productivity with end-to-end process improvements now that our digital foundation is in place, and we will also shut down select assets while further evaluating additional actions across our global asset base, particularly in Europe to ensure long-term competitiveness while also enhancing our cost efficiency. These structural actions are expected to deliver a total of $500 million in EBITDA savings this year. Additionally, we will deliver another $500 million of savings through actions to maximize cash flow while reducing our operational expenses. This includes decreasing turnaround spend, purchased raw materials, logistics and utilities costs. Importantly, we will do this while maintaining safe and reliable operations, which, as always, remains our top priority. These proactive actions will optimize our cost structure in response to the near-term macroeconomic uncertainty while maintaining our long-term value-creation focus. Turning to our outlook for the first quarter on Slide 8. In the Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment, improving logistics and lower operating rates led to the fifth consecutive month of inventory declines for U.S. polyethylene in December. Reduced global operating rates are continuing to drive feedstock and input costs down with ongoing destocking through the value chain impacting functional polymer strength and demand in Europe.  While lower turnaround costs will be a sequential tailwind, we expect lower demand levels in Asia to impact equity earnings and lower nonrecurring licensing activity from the prior quarter will impact earnings. In total, we expect a $75 million headwind for the segment sequentially. And the Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure segment, demand remains stable for energy markets, and we're monitoring demand for deicing fluids with a warmer than average winter. However, inflationary pressures in contracting PMIs continue to impact industrial demand, and we expect lower seasonal volumes in building construction end markets. We also anticipate an approximately $25 million headwind due to a third-party outage, which is causing a supply disruption on the U.S. Gulf Coast from winter storm Elliott. And in the Performance Materials & Coatings segment, we expect demand recovery for performance silicones following year-end customer destocking as well as improved supply availability and lower costs. However, we also anticipate lower siloxane pricing in the quarter as we continue to see pressure from increased industry supply.  We expect higher planned maintenance turnaround costs in this segment at our Deer Park acrylic monomer site in performance monitors. All in, we anticipate a $25 million tailwind for the segment. In total, we expect the first quarter to be in line with the fourth quarter performance with the $75 million in discrete headwinds I mentioned. Turning to the full year. We're continuing to provide our best estimates of several income statement and cash flow drivers. I will highlight a few notable year-over-year inputs. We expect lower equity earnings in the year down approximately $300 million to $400 million. Total turnaround spending is anticipated to be down by $300 million as we implement our playbook of cost savings actions while maintaining safe and reliable operations.  We expect share count to remain relatively flat as we plan to continue covering dilution. And finally, we anticipate increasing our capital expenditures to $2.2 billion, well within our D&A of $2.8 billion as we continue to advance our higher return, faster payback projects and continue to execute on our decarbonized and growth strategy. Overall, the macroeconomic backdrop remains dynamic in 2023, we see the potential for additional upside from higher oil to gas spreads, reopening in China following the Lunar New Year and easing inflation and supply chain constraints. We also continue to pay close attention to a range of indicators, including pressure from higher interest rates on building and construction, PMI levels, global energy markets and geopolitical dynamics.  Dow remains well positioned based on our global footprint, feedstock flexibility and the sustainable solutions we provide for our customers. We will continue to leverage these competitive advantages to deliver long-term value for our shareholders. With that, I'll turn it back to Jim. Jim Fitterling : Thank you, Howard. Moving to Slide 10. While the near-term environment remains challenging, we continue to see attractive secular trends across our market verticals of packaging, infrastructure, consumer and mobility. With resilient cash flow generation and a strong credit profile, we are well positioned to continue advancing our Decarbonize and Grow strategy to capitalize on these opportunities. We Delivered on our growth investment commitments outlined in early 2022. These investments are expected to collectively generate $2 billion in run rate EBITDA by the middle of this decade. In Packaging & Specialty Plastics, we mechanically completed and began final commissioning of our FCDh unit in Louisiana in the fourth quarter. This breakthrough propylene technology features up to 25% lower capital outlay while reducing energy usage and greenhouse gas emissions by up to 20% versus conventional FCDh units. In Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure, our latest alkoxylates capacity investment in the United States was completed in the third quarter of 2022, and our next in Europe will be completed in the first quarter of this year. These projects will further serve high-value markets in home care and pharma and are just a start.  Our next wave of alkoxylates capacity investments remain on track. In fact, Dow has already successfully begun locking in supply contracts with several consumer and pharmaceutical customers to support the next wave of growth. And in Performance Materials & Coatings, we completed 16 downstream silicone debottleneck projects in 2022 to meet demand for high performance, building and construction, personal care and mobility applications. Additionally, we accelerated the delivery of our digitalization initiatives and now expect the full $300 million run rate EBITDA to fully materialize by the end of 2023, well ahead of our prior target of 2025. As a result, we anticipate our digital sales to comprise 50% of total revenue by 2025. Looking forward, we expect to continue growth investments in our global operations, including key capital investments in higher-margin polyurethane systems and additional alkoxylate capacity, incremental projects to expand downstream, high-value ethylene derivative capacity and continued coatings and silicon debottlenecking projects. We will also continue progressing our operating investments to improve production capabilities and reliability as we shift our product mix toward higher growth and higher-value markets. Turning to Slide 11. Decarbonizing our assets and driving circularity remains a significant growth opportunity for Dow. We have a clear road map to reduce carbon emissions by another 5 million metric tons by 2030. We continue to invest in innovative, renewable energy and efficiency technologies, such as our collaborative program with Shell to electrically heat steam cracker furnaces, which is on track to start up in 2025. In Alberta, we reached a preliminary investment decision for our past to Zero project, and we are working with the Canadian government to confirm necessary incentives so that we can make a final investment decision by the end of this year. And our Terneuzen 2030 project, where we have a clear road map to reduce carbon emissions at the site by more than 40% by 2030 is making progress as we secure partner and government agreements and subsidies.  We are also advancing our transform the waste target to commercialize 3 million metric tons of circular and renewable solutions annually by 2030. By leveraging our pipeline of strategic partnerships to invest in innovative solutions and scale up production, we are well positioned to meet this growing customer demand in a disciplined and capital-efficient manner. Most recently, Dow and WM announced a bold new collaboration to address hard-to-recycle plastic films by enabling them to be placed directly into residential curbside recycling. By 2025, the program is expected to divert more than 120,000 metric tons of plastic film from landfills. We continue to see sustainability as essential for our long-term earnings growth. Altogether, by 2030, we remain on track to deliver $3 billion in underlying EBITDA improvements while reducing Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 30% compared to our 2005 baseline. Turning to Slide 12. The actions we've taken since spin to strengthen our balance sheet while improving our financial flexibility and operating cash flow generation are enabling us to be more resilient as we deliver on our capital allocation priorities across the economic cycle.  Our free cash flow performance is now more than tripled on a trailing 12-month basis. We substantially improved our liquidity position, ending the year with nearly $14 billion. And through our disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation, we've significantly reduced our liability profile with a combined reduction of more than $11 billion in our net debt and underfunded pension position since spin. Closing on Slide 13, we have a clear playbook of actions to drive resilient performance in the near and long term. We have plans to achieve $1 billion in savings through targeted actions to increase efficiency and maintain a low-cost structure that is best in class. We're maintaining a strong financial position with a continued focus on disciplined and balanced capital allocation, and we're advancing our Decarbonize and Grow and circularity strategies, delivering incremental run rate EBITDA improvements through the end of the decade, positioning us for an economic recovery while lowering our carbon dioxide emissions. As we leverage our competitive advantages, operational agility and focus on cash flow generation that has served us well since spin, we will continue to deliver long-term value for our shareholders. With that, I'll turn it back to Pankaj to open up the Q&A. Pankaj Gupta : Thank you, Jim. Now let's move on to your questions. I would like to remind you that our forward-looking statements apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. Operator, please provide the Q&A instructions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Vincent Andrews : Good morning everyone. Wondering if you could just unpack the outlook for Performance Materials & Coatings a little bit. And it sounds like there's just a lot of moving parts right now with weak China in the fourth quarter but now reopening, some issues with new supply coming into the market. So obviously, uncertainty about how far and how fast China will reopen. But could you give us sort of the range of outcomes for how this segment might recover as we move through the year, representing that it could be a wide range? Jim Fitterling : Sure. Good morning, Vince. Thanks for the question. First, I think it's important to look back at the fourth quarter on PM&C and understand the fourth quarter. Coatings and Performance Monomers kind of got back to the normal fourth quarter seasonality that we would see, which a year ago was very different because we were still recovering from all the supply disruptions from winter storm URI and everything else that was associated with that. So I think you'll see that they'll come back to a more normal season in 2023. And you also saw the impact of destocking. Destocking in the fourth quarter represented, and this is across the businesses, about 50% to 60% of the slowdown that we saw in the fourth quarter. So I think the destocking is going to work itself through in the first quarter. And then I think you'll see us get back to normal seasonality there.  I do think positively on China for coatings and performance monomers. I do think we're seeing China opening up. We're not seeing issues with people coming to work. So I think we're optimistic that the government will probably try to stimulate the construction economy there, and we'll start to see that take off through the year. On silicones and siloxanes, you had two impacts. One was the market impact of things slowing, which was the lower siloxane prices that hit hardest in China, obviously, at the end of the year. The other one was self-inflicted. We happen to have all three of the silicones pillar plants, the siloxanes pillar plant down at some point in the fourth quarter. And that lower operating rate really hurt us. They're, all 3 back up and running. So I think that issue is behind us.  So I would expect you'll start to see siloxanes demand pick back up. We saw destocking in all the downstream areas in silicones, personal care, home consumer goods, and we also saw it, obviously, in building and construction. I think that will start to rebound as the year progresses. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. David Begleiter : Thank you. Good morning. Jim and Howard, given the recent decline in European natural gas prices, how are you thinking about the competitiveness of the European operations going forward? Jim Fitterling : Good morning David. Very good question. Obviously, the European situation has been tough on all the European producers over this past year. In fact, if you think about the year-over-year performance for Dow for the full year, 60% of the decline in EBIT was related to Europe and that energy situation.  So this is very targeted. Incrementally, we saw a step change in the fourth quarter, obviously driven by the warmer winter and the inventory levels being back up. And they've done an admirable job, especially in Germany, of switching away from Russian natural gas over to other sources.  So that has helped. But we still have to take a look at long-term energy policies and work with the governments, both EU and the member states on energy policies because we're a long way away from long-term competitiveness in Europe. I would say the decisions we announced today around restructuring, right now, we've looked at locations that are going to be challenged in any scenario long term, and we'll take actions on those. But on large sites, like our large cracker sites, we're still able to run cash flow positive, and we're working hard on that energy situation. We'll continue to analyze that through this year and see what kind of work we can do with the governments there to make them more competitive long term. Operator : The next question comes from Hassan Ahmed of Alembic Global. Please go ahead. Hassan Ahmed : Good morning Jim and Howard. A nearer-term question around your guidance. First part of the question is, it seems you guys, as I look at segment level guidance, you're guiding to Q1 EBITDA of $1.2 billion. So, first part of that question is, is that correct? And then part and parcel with that question, it seems that there are 2 $0.05 a pound price hike announcement for polyethylene in the U.S. for January and February.  And then, obviously, we've seen these preceptors declines in natural gas prices in Europe. So, in this $1.2 billion EBITDA guidance that you guys have given for Q1, how much of those U.S. polyethylene price hikes have you factored in? And how should we think about factoring in for Q1, those declines in natural gas are good. Jim Fitterling : Good morning Hassan. Good question. Obviously, the outlook -- I would go back to integrated margins and take a look at our outlook and our expectations for integrated margins in the quarter. We think both in the U.S. and in Europe, they'll be up about $0.04 on integrated polyethylene margins. I would say, yes, natural gas costs have come off. We see a fair amount of benefit in that, obviously, from PMC, which is a large energy user. And so that helps in a location like Stade. But we only really are cracking natural gas to any big degree in Terneuzen and some in Tarragona. So it has a little bit more limited effect there. Most of the rest of the economics are naphtha. I do think prices -- obviously, fourth quarter to first quarter, you've got to remember, we start the quarter with a lower base and then we build up from there. So you're going to have some of that lag effect that bakes into it. That's part of the guidance. And then we also are expecting a little bit of destocking to still continue into the quarter from a volume and operating rate perspective. So those are the big things that went into the guidance. Anything else you want to add, Howard? Howard Ungerleider : Yes. Thanks, Jim. And Hassan, thanks for the question. I would say you got the number right. I mean, it's around $1.2 million. At a high level, there's really 3 moving parts we expect Q1 on balance to look pretty much like Q4 with three discrete items. So as you know, our licensing business is lumpy. We had a large sale in the fourth quarter of $75 million that will not repeat in Q1. We're dealing with a third-party gas supplier in the Gulf Coast that's still having issues post winter storm Elliott that's impacting our DIS business, which is in our Industrial Intermediates segment. That's a $25 million sequential headwind. And then there's a $25 million sequential positive tailwind on lower turnaround expenses at the enterprise level. That's a $50 million tailwind in P&SP, but offset by a $25 million headwind in PM&C, which is the Deer Park asset. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from P.J. Juverkar of Citigroup. Please go ahead. P. J Juvekar : Yes. Good morning. Jim, it seems like the European chemical capacity is now the high-cost marginal capacity instead of China and European capacity will be flexed with demand ups and downs. Would you agree with that statement? And then in polyethylene, as you mentioned, China reopening is positive. Assuming that do you expect somewhat of a snapback in polyethylene as a result? Or is it more of a gradual recovery in first half? Thank you. Jim Fitterling : Yes. Good morning P.J. Both good questions. I would say in Europe, I would think about it in two ways. First, I would think about the crackers. And I would say from a cracker economic standpoint, yes, on a naphtha basis, they have become incrementally the highest cost on the assets that are able to crack LPGs like Terneuzen and Tarragona and where utility costs are lower like in Spain. They probably are fairly competitive with that Asian situation.  So we haven't flexed as much up and down in Europe on the cracker operations. They've run at pretty steady rates throughout. We did flex up and down a bit when it got into our II&I business like polyols, polyurethanes, isocyanates in Europe, where the energy cost at STADA and Germany are much, much higher. And so what you would see there is we have some amount of that energy cost, that is very competitive and at a low rate, but then the increment is much higher. So we would run to that competitive rate. And I think that is what still continues to be in the front window and the thing that we have to address with the government. I would say on second part of the question, remind me. Howard Ungerleider : China, China recovery. Jim Fitterling : China. Yes. Look, I think it's going to be positive. We had growth in the fourth quarter in packaging, especially plastics and Industrial solutions. The places that were weakest for us were anything related to building and construction, so polyurethanes, construction chemicals, coatings and monomers, although that was fairly even quarter-over-quarter. And then Consumer Solutions because of the, as I mentioned, siloxane prices and also our asset being down there. For the year, we had growth in Packaging & Specialty Plastics, Consumer Solutions and Industrial Solutions, pretty good growth. And it was really construction businesses that were the most impacted. Construction is 25% of China's economy. It was off 40% last year. I'm certain that the government is going to try to stimulate that and get that going again. I don't know how fast it will happen.  As I mentioned, we're not seeing any big COVID spreads that are unmanageable right now. People are reporting into work, and I'm hearing this from other CEOs as well, people reporting into work, things are moving as expected. So I do expect we're going to see a little bit of positive move from China. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Jeff Zekauskas : Thanks very much. Two-part question. Your local price in Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure was down 1%. Was that a combination of puts and takes, that is some chemicals were up and some chemicals were down? And can you talk about MDI pricing? And then secondly, for Howard, what kind of working capital benefits do you expect for 2023? Can you have a working capital inflow of $500 million or $1 billion? Can you size that? Jim Fitterling : Good morning Jeff. Good questions. On II&I, we actually had higher prices in polyurethanes and construction chemicals and it was volume that was the offset there. And remember, that business has a fairly large footprint in Europe and the input costs are much higher there and so that was part of it. We also saw that Industrial Solutions pricing held up relatively well. And again, it was volume that slowed. So both of them had very resilient prices but saw some volume slowdown and a little bit of currency impact. I'll let you answer the second part of that, Howard. Howard Ungerleider : Yes. Thanks, Jeff. Look, let's start with the fourth quarter on working capital. That was actually a tailwind versus the prior quarter, so sequentially of $1 billion and more than $400 million versus the same quarter last year. I would say it really depends on what's going to happen with feedstock costs and revenue growth. We're certainly expecting some volume growth as we move through the year, especially with Jim's comments on China reopening. And overall, global GDP growth is still expected to be positive of around 1.5%, which should drive some industrial production and should drive some growth. You know that since spin, we've been very focused on working capital. We're continuing to target a couple of days of structural working capital improvement. So I would say, at a bare minimum, we're looking at $200 million to $300 million of working capital improvement 2023 versus 2022. I'm very proud of the Dow team on their focus on cash flow. When you look at what we've been able to do since spin, we have actually improved our cash from ops every single year, 2019 through 2022. And last year was $7.5 billion of cash from ops and $400 million better overall than 2021.  And so one of the ways we do that is work on working capital. We're also working on other unique to Dow cash flow levers. I estimate that is around inclusive of that $200 million to $300 million working capital, we're focused on $1 billion of pulling on $1 billion of unique to Dow levers. Working capital is certainly one of them. The other one, as you saw in the fourth quarter, we successfully concluded 1 of the 2 big novo litigations that we have. We're hopeful that we can solve the second one or resolve the second one in calendar year 2023. That could be another up to as much as $0.5 billion of unique Dow cash that we expect. And then we've got a few other projects that are in the works to round out that $1 billion. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from John McNulty of BMO. Please go ahead. John McNulty : Thanks for taking my question. So it seemed like the destocking was kind of at really accelerated levels in the fourth quarter. Can you give us a little bit of color as to which of the segments do you feel like you're largely through that? And if anything, you may be -- maybe we're even at a balance side or even a restock phase? And I guess tied to that, -- can you speak to the operating rates you saw in the fourth quarter and how you expect that to change as we look to 1Q? Jim Fitterling : Sure. Good morning John. Good Question. I would say it accelerated in December. We made announcement in October that we were going to reduce some operating rates in ethylene, polyethylene because of some logistics constraints and other things that happen. We saw better logistics in December. December was our best export month of the year for marine pack cargo, so that's positive. But at the same time, manufacturing activity in the last half of December really slowed. And so you could see that in the order pattern. And that stayed relatively slow the first half of January.  I do think we're seeing manufacturing activity come back right now. We're seeing that in the order book. I would not say that we're at a restocking state yet. But I do think as the quarter progresses, we will get there because second and third quarter are typically our highest volume quarters. And there is not a lot of excess inventory anywhere in the change right now. So I do think it's coming, but it isn't here as we sit here right now today. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Mike Sison of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Michael Sison : Hey, good morning guys. What was the impact from the lower operating rates in the fourth quarter on EBITDA, meaning if you were at normal operating rates, what would that be? And then is that impact similar for the first quarter? And when do you think you can see your operating rates sort of improve back to normal rates in '23? Jim Fitterling : Yes. Just to give you an idea, I would say, probably you saw because of destocking, you probably saw a 10% lower operating rate due to destocking. Rough numbers, Howard, where do you think, [indiscernible] million. Howard Ungerleider : Yes, I would say 10 percentage points. And that's -- I mean, when you think about every percentage point. Yes, look, I would say it this way, Mike. When you look at the sequential decline in probably two-thirds of that EBITDA drop was because of the destocking. And then the other balance was really the seasonal -- just a seasonal sequential decline because we're in more of a Northern Hemisphere business. And obviously, our coatings business typically is a seasonal low point in the fourth quarter. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Steve Byren of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Steve Byren : Yes, thank you. That 2,000-headcount reduction, how much of that is these assets in Europe that you're planning to shutter? Or can you highlight what operations, is this commercial or back-office headcount? And then just one other quick one. Your partnership with Mura, when that's at scale, you're using the pyrolysis oil as cracker feedstock, how would you expect the profitability of that versus naphtha or ethane-based feedstock? Jim Fitterling : Sure. Good morning Steve, good questions. 2,000 headcount reduction is not all specific to Europe, although Europe is a big part of the earnings decline that's driving us to take these actions.  The site and asset decisions we've made so far are really smaller locations, smaller scale locations where we know they will be challenged through the year. We haven't released a list of those we're working through that with the European Works Councils, et cetera, but we will be doing that as we get toward the end of this quarter.  But -- the $1 billion is really made up of two buckets : $500 million is structural cost reductions. That's the headcount reductions, that's productivity and end-to-end process improvement. So we're really building off that digital work we've done, and that would work on improving processes and customer service and then the asset decisions. And then $500 million will just be reduced spending, turnaround spend, which Howard had mentioned, $300 million, leveraging our volume on lower purchased raw materials, logistics and utilities because we do see some supply/demand imbalances and the ability to do that and just tightening the belt to this environment.  So I would say I don't -- it's not a haircut 5% of the workforce. It will be targeted, and we target around asset decisions. It will be targeted around businesses that need to tighten. It will be targeted around -- it's not just Dow headcount. We will have contractor reductions as well at the sites. And so we'll look at it that way.  On Mura, on our transforming the waste target. Right now, when we talk to you at Investor Day in 2021, the premiums vary by technology. But they continue to be greater than about $1,000 a metric ton. And the supply demand -- the demand is out there right now, and it's in excess of the supply.  I think as the supply increases, there will be pressure on that, obviously. But there's a big imbalance right now between what the consumer brand owners want and what's available out there. So I do think you'll see margin expansion in that part of the segment. There will be some higher costs we\u2019re doing that, but there will -- I think the premiums will more than cover that. Operator : The next question comes from Kevin McCarthy of Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead. Kevin McCarthy : Yes, good morning. Jim, I'd welcome your thoughts on the supply side of polyethylene. We've seen spot prices start to percolate higher over the last 3 or 4 weeks. So I was wondering if you could comment on where you see downstream inventory levels among converters at this point? And also if I rewind to maybe September, we had a lot of purposeful throttling back of operating rates from Dow and others that dovetailed into winter storm Elliot in late December. I think at least one of your competitors has declared force majeure on a tornado of all things.  So if we look at that holistically, do you think there's enough supply disruption to kind of rebalance the polyethylene market and move higher from here? Jim Fitterling : Good morning, Kevin. I think there has been enough, obviously, to give good momentum to these price increases in the first quarter. And so I think we will see the margins expand, as I mentioned earlier on one of the other questions.  From a supply side standpoint, it's also worth mentioning that I'm really proud of the team. After winter storm Uri, we took our playbook and we said, how do we -- if this happens again, how do we make sure that we don't have any production losses due to freeze? And we were able to navigate this freeze with winter storm Elliott, and we had no problems with polyethylene plants or crackers.  And right now, as we sit here, about 37% of the ethylene capacity in the Gulf Coast is still off-line. And so that's an advantage to us. And as Howard mentioned, the only issue we've had is with an industrial gas supplier at one of our sites in Louisiana for our Industrial Solutions business. That's been our only blip, and I don't think they did the same kind of work. I do think China, to P.J.'s question earlier, China is making an impact. We saw that in December. I think we're going to continue to see that in the first quarter. Inventories there are managed well. Inventories here, five consecutive months of reduction in the ACC inventory data inventory is 45 days. That's pretty standard inventory levels.  And I think everybody, not just converters, but consumers, brand owners, everybody in the value chain at the end of the year was watching inventories and managing cash into a slow end of the year. We had a pretty strong end of the year in 2021, and in 2022, we kind of reverted more to the normal slower end of the year dynamics. We do have to keep an eye on capacity coming on. But I would say our outlook for the year is probably about the same amount of capacity off-line as last year. And so if demand kicks back up here and there's some restocking that happens, that will set us up well for second and third quarter. Howard Ungerleider : I would also just add that another bright spot that we see as we head into 2023 is the improving situation marine pack cargo and the ability to export out of North America. I mean, I can't speak for our peers, but certainly, we certainly have ramped our capability. And so that really should not be a bottleneck at least for the first half of the year, and don't have the visibility in the second half, but certainly as we ramp through the balance of Q1 into Q2, we should see increased marine pack cargo exports out of the U.S. Operator : The next question comes from John Roberts of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Matthew Skowronski : Good morning. This is Matt Skowronski on for John. Two commodities that Dow participates in, siloxanes and MDI, have had competitor capacity come online recently. You called out weaker pricing in siloxanes in your guide for the first quarter. But can you just talk about how long you expect it to take for pricing these commodities to recover? Jim Fitterling : Yes, good morning. And thank you for the question. I think we'll see a little bit of demand improvement. But siloxanes prices have fallen to their lowest levels in some time at the end of the year, and so we start the year at those levels. I don't think we're expecting any immediate improvement. The downstream demand still continues to be good. Building and construction will be the thing that I think will start to tip it to the positive. So if we see a good rebound in building and construction in China, that should start to pull things to the positive and lift things up. North America has been fairly resilient. And North America and Europe are typically slightly higher than the Chinese prices, and that continues to be the same case today. So I -- that's my outlook on siloxanes on. On MDI, I would say the biggest difference between what's reported in the markets on MDI in our view, is just what you believe about the RTO timing of some of the Chinese competitions, new plants that are coming online. I think our view is that, that's going to be stretched out over a longer period of time. Most of what's reported would have all that 4 world-scale MDI facilities coming on in 2023. I don't think that's our view of how that's going to happen. That would be more spread over the 2023 to 2025-time period. And so I think that will take some of that pressure off of MDI.  Downstream demand for MDI and for systems and the application that it goes into is really good so I don't feel worried about that. That's purely what your assumptions are about -- that our new demand coming -- or new supply coming online and the time frame Operator : The next question comes from Christopher Parkinson of Mizuho. Please go ahead. Christopher Parkinson : Great. Thank you so much. You have a very helpful slide given all your growth expansions on Slide 10. And obviously, there's been a lot going on regarding the and the polyethylene side over the last few years. But when we all take a step back, just given all the volatility and the macro headwinds, how should investors now be thinking about normalized earnings that we're thinking about '24 when we're looking out to '25 or even perhaps especially in the context of potentially lower NGL prices. Just do you have any updated thoughts on that? Thank you. Jim Fitterling : Good question, Chris. I would go back that this is the basis of obviously, the earnings corridor slide that we put together and we shared last year and at earnings day back in 2021. And so if you look at it, I think we look at the midrange of the kind of the through-the-cycle range as being what we target for the growth. And that's kind of how we report the growth. And then peak potential would be when you would see those scenarios like you mentioned with lower NGL prices and higher oil prices. Now like we got into with 2021 and the first half of 2022, that was kind of peak levels for plastics.  I do think the possibility exists that oil price is going to continue to be driving higher because we've had underinvestment in oil production, inventory is at the bottom of their five-year average. And if you started investing in oil production today, it would be three to five years before you would see any movement in that number. And I do think that any demand pull on that is going to start to move oil prices up, anything speculative that happens will move it up quickly because those inventory levels are so low.  Meanwhile, NGL production is continuing to grow at a pretty good clip. I think it's going to be up pretty substantially here in the United States this year. And so that keeps costs down on NGLs. And so that's positive. So Canada, U.S., Argentina, I feel good about the positions we have there. Obviously, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, we feel good about that. Our cracking into news and Spain. I think that's positive. So you've seen the high watermark for plastics, delivered $8 billion of EBITDA which is right in line with what we've got here with peak potential, EBITDA range. And I think we're trying to get in other segments up to that peak potential as well. So I feel good about where we're going long term, and that's also one of the reasons we wanted to make the investment in Canada, if all the conditions are right, we want to make that investment to continue to leverage that position.  Hard to say what's going to happen with all that energy policy, plays a big part in it. I think the one thing that governments aren't correctly addressing is that all the things that we've passed for IRA, for new alternative technologies, that's all great. We're very supportive. It's a fantastic package. We also need some support for conventional oil and gas production because we are going to need a reliable power and natural gas is going to provide the low carbon reliable power for the foreseeable near future. Howard Ungerleider : I would also just say that, I mean, when you think about that earnings corridor of 6% to 12% and then moving to the middle of the decade into the $7 billion to $13 billion range with all the CapEx and OpEx investments we're making, if you just want to look at the mathematical average, right now, that's about a $9 billion normalized through the cycle. And then by the middle of the decade, that should be in the $10 billion range by the middle of -- in terms of the mathematical average in a normalized view by the middle of the decade. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Frank Mitch of Fermium Research. Please go ahead. Frank Mitch : Thank you. And good morning. And Howard, thank you so much for giving us the mathematical average for 6% to 12% and 7% to 13%. I was having difficulty crunching that number.  I want to come back to the cost savings, the $1 billion. You mentioned that in the first quarter, you can take a charge of $550 million plus. And I was wondering how much of that is cash versus non-cash? And then also on that slide, you mentioned that you're going to be reducing turnaround spending in '23 versus '22. And I'm curious if you could order -- give us an order of magnitude there? And does that suggest perhaps that 2024 will see an above average spend on turnarounds? Jim Fitterling : Howard, do you want to take it? Howard Ungerleider : Yes, Frank, you're welcome. I just -- that really -- my answer on the previous question was really targeted, all The Nets and The Jets fans out there. I just want to let you know that, make sure that you can do that math. Just a joke. Look, the $1 billion as we look at the end of the year run rate exiting into 2024, that $1 billion should become about $1.4 billion. We haven't set the turnaround budget for 2024 yet, obviously. But I could imagine if we just revert to a normalized turnaround and that could be -- the turnarounds could be potentially $150 million or maybe $200 million higher in 2024 than 2023 if we do one more cracker turnaround. So that would be the order of magnitude that I would expect. But still improving -- overall, the cost improving versus 2023. Frank Mitch : And how much was the cash charge on that? Howard Ungerleider : Oh, the cash -- we expect the cash outlay over the course of 2023 and 2024 to be roughly $800 million to $1 billion, in that range, about half this year probably and then the balance the other half in 2024. Pankaj Gupta : I think that's all the time we have for today. For your reference, a copy of our transcript will be posted on Dow's website within approximately 48 hours. This concludes our call. Thanks, everyone, for your time this morning. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines.",

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn it over to Dow Investor Relations Vice President, Pankaj Gupta. Mr. Gupta, you may begin. Pankaj Gupta : Good morning. Thank you for joining Dow's first quarter earnings call. This call is available via webcast and we have prepared slides to supplement our comments today. They are posted on the Investor Relations section of Dow's website and through the link to our webcast. I'm Pankaj Gupta, Dow Investor Relations Vice President, and joining me today on the call are Jim Fitterling, Dow's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Howard Ungerleider, President and Chief Financial Officer. Please read the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the earnings news release and slides. During our call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding our expectations or predictions about the future. Because these statements are based on current assumptions and factors that involve risks and uncertainties, our actual performance and results may differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Dow's Forms 10-Q and 10-K include detailed discussions of principal risks and uncertainties, which may cause such differences. Unless otherwise specified, all financials where applicable, exclude significant items. We will also refer to non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures is contained in the Dow earnings release, in the slides that supplement our comments today, as well as on the Dow website. On Slide 2, you will see the agenda for our call. Jim will begin by reviewing our first quarter results and operating segment performance. Howard will then share our outlook and margin guidance. To close, Jim will outline how our Decarbonize and Grow and Transform the Waste strategies enable continued value creation. Following that, we will take your questions. Now let me turn the call over to Jim. Jim Fitterling : Thank you, Pankaj. Beginning on Slide 3. In the first quarter, Team Dow demonstrated its agility, delivering sequential earnings improvement in what continues to be a challenging environment. These results reflect our competitive advantages and operating discipline as we leveraged our structurally advantaged feedstock positions, proactively aligned our operating rates with market demand and focused on higher-value products where pockets of demand remain resilient, such as pharmaceutical applications, energy, commercial building and construction and mobility end markets. Additionally, our actions to deliver $1 billion in cost savings in 2023 are progressing with $100 million achieved in the first quarter. These actions will ensure we continue to focus on cash flow generation through our low-cost to serve operating model. Turning to the details of the quarter. Net sales were $11.9 billion, down 22% year-over-year. Declines in all operating segments were driven by continued soft global macroeconomic activity. Sales were flat sequentially, as gains in performance materials and coatings and packaging and specialty plastics offset declines in industrial intermediates and infrastructure. Volume decreased 11% year-over-year, led by declines in Europe, the Middle East, Africa and India or EMEA. However, volumes increased 2% sequentially on gains in performance materials and coatings and packaging and specialty plastics. Local price declined 10% year-over-year and 4% quarter-over-quarter, due to industry supply additions in some businesses amidst soft global economic conditions. Operating EBIT for the quarter was $708 million, down year-over-year due to lower local prices and volumes. Sequentially, operating EBIT improved by $107 million, with gains primarily driven by performance materials and coatings. Cash flow from operations was $531 million in the quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, cash flow conversion was 85%. With ample financial flexibility and a strong balance sheet, we are continuing to execute on our strategy as we advance our disciplined and balanced capital allocation priorities for long-term value creation. We returned $621 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases during the quarter and our balance sheet continues to have no substantive long-term debt maturities until 2027. Now turning to operating segment performance on Slide 4. In the Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment, operating EBIT was $642 million compared to $1.2 billion in the year ago period, primarily due to lower integrated polyethylene margins. Continued margin resilience in functional polymers was more than offset by lower polyethylene and olefins margins. Volume declines were primarily driven by lower consumer demand in EMEA. Sadara also had lower export volumes due to planned maintenance activity. Sequentially, operating EBIT was down by $13 million. Improved input costs and higher operating rates in our most cost advantage assets were more than offset by lower sales from non-recurring licensing activity and lower equity earnings. Moving to the Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure segment. Operating EBIT for the segment was $123 million compared to $661 million in the year ago period. Results were driven by lower pricing and demand, as well as higher energy costs, particularly in EMEA. Sequentially, operating EBIT was down $41 million. Lower energy costs were more than offset by decreased demand and pricing for propylene oxide, its derivatives, and in isocyanates, in polyurethanes and construction chemicals. Industrial Solutions experienced lower volumes due to weather-related impacts and a third-party supply outage combined with lower demand in industrial end markets. And in the Performance Materials and Coatings segment, operating EBIT for the segment was $35 million compared to $595 million in the year ago period. Local price declines for siloxanes were driven by competitive pricing pressure from supply additions in China. Volume was down as resilient demand for commercial building and construction, mobility and industrial coatings was more than offset by volume declines in siloxanes and architectural coatings. Sequentially, operating EBIT increased $165 million, driven by improved supply availability, seasonally higher volumes, and reduced value chain destocking. Next, I'll turn it over to Howard to review our outlooks and actions on Slide 5. Howard Ungerleider : Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, we expect to continue navigating challenging macro conditions around the world. While the pace of inflation has slowed, elevated levels continue to pressure both input costs and demand, particularly in industrials, durable goods, and housing. On the bright side, demand in agriculture and energy markets remains resilient, as does consumer demand for personal care and household items. In the U.S., consumer spending continues to moderate while retail sales were up 2.9% year-over-year in March. After contracting for five straight months, normalizing value chain inventories are driving improvements in manufacturing PMI, which reached 50.4 in April. Residential building and construction markets remain under pressure, with housing starts and building permit down around 20% year-over-year in March. However, builder confidence increased for the fourth straight month in April on growing demand in the new home market due to limited resale inventory. In Europe, while energy prices have remained lower than previously anticipated, higher inflation levels continue to weigh on both consumer and business sentiment with manufacturing PMI continuing to contract since July of last year. In China, March industrial production rose 3.9% year-over-year and is recovering gradually with manufacturing PMI now at 50. March retail sales also rose 10.6% year-over-year at their fastest pace since July 2021. Though recovery following the pandemic lockdowns has been slow, we continue expect growth over the medium term. Against this backdrop, we continue to take disciplined actions to manage our costs and deliver our target of $1 billion in cost savings in 2023. We're implementing our global workforce reduction program of approximately 2,000 roles. Notifications have begun and 75% of the impacted roles will exit by the end of the second quarter. We're also continuing to review our global asset footprint on a business by business and region by region approach, rationalizing select higher cost, lower return assets in line with market fundamentals. Additionally, we're executing opportunities to reduce operating costs. This includes decreasing maintenance turnaround spending by $300 million year-over-year and driving efficiencies through the value chain, including streamlining our logistics networks and reducing our spend of purchased raw materials and contract services. All in, we expect to deliver approximately 35% of our cost savings in the first half of the year and the remaining 65% in the second half of the year. Turning to our outlook for the second quarter on Slide 6. In the Packaging & Specialty Plastic segment, we see signs of improving domestic demand versus the start of the year, as well as continued easing in marine pack cargo allowing for increased export volumes. We expect healthy oil to gas spreads to continue to favor cost advantaged positions as rates increase to meet seasonally higher demand levels. All in, we expect these factors to have a $75 million tailwind versus the prior quarter, along with another approximately $70 million tailwind from cost savings actions. We anticipate these will be partly offset by a $25 million headwind from a seasonal increase in planned maintenance activity. In the Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure segment, demand remains resilient in energy and pharmaceutical end markets. However, we expect continued demand pressure in consumer durables, and building and construction, which is also driving a decline in cost pricing from its recent peak. We anticipate a $25 million tailwind from improved volumes in Industrial Solutions following third party outages and the winter weather related impacts, as well as a $20 million tailwind from cost savings actions. Additionally, Dow will begin to turn around at our Louisiana Glycols facility, which is projected to be a $50 million headwind for the segment. In the Performance Materials & Coatings segment, while demand for consumer electronics and industrial end markets is softening, we're seeing a seasonal increase in demand for coating applications as well as improvement in mobility. Our cost saving action will deliver a $50 million tailwind for the segment. The completion of our first quarter turnaround at our Deer Park acrylic monomers facility will be offset by impacts from the planned maintenance at our Carrollton and our Zhangjiagang siloxanes facilities. All in, with puts and takes mentioned and listed on our model and guidance slide, we expect a sequential earnings improvement of $150 million to $200 million versus the prior quarter. With that, I'll turn it back to Jim. Jim Fitterling : Thank you, Howard. Moving to Slide 7. While we expect near term conditions to remain challenging through the year, we continue to see positive underlying demand trends driving above GDP growth across our attractive market verticals over the next few years. Packaging is vital to delivering a lower carbon footprint. Through our $3 million metric ton Transform the Waste commitment, we will capture demand growth for recycled polyethylene, which is accelerating as brand owners and customers increasingly seek more circular products. In Infrastructure, more than $3 trillion in investments will be needed to meet global infrastructure plans. Green buildings are driving demand for Dow products, including low carbon footprint silicone sealants for high rise buildings, reflective roof coatings and lower carbon emissions cement additives. An expanding middle class will support growth in consumer spending where our products help deliver a lower carbon footprint and enable more sustainable materials through technology, such as biodegradable polymers or bio-based surfactants for home care and thermal conductive silicone gels and adhesives for electronics and batteries. And in mobility, stable global vehicle production growth is expected with increasing demand for electric vehicles which contained 3 times to 4 times more silicone content than internal combustion engine vehicles. Lighter weight vehicles are also aided by our high value polyurethane systems and EPDM technologies. Further, we continue to execute our targeted suite of higher return, lower risk projects, which are expected to add $2 billion in underlying EBITDA by the middle of the decade. These investments put us in an advantaged position to capture demand as economies recover and raise our underlying earnings profile. Turning to Slide 8. With growing consumer and brand owner demand for more sustainable and circular products, leading in the transition to a more sustainable future remains critical to our strategy to drive growth and shareholder value creation. In collaboration with X-energy, in the second quarter we expect to select an analysis site in the U.S. Gulf Coast to develop a small modular nuclear energy facility by 2030. Nuclear technology will be key in generating safe and reliable power and steam at our sites, while enabling zero CO2 emissions manufacturing. In Alberta, we recently awarded Fluor with a contract to provide front end engineering and design services for our Path2Zero project. Today, we achieved another key milestone by selecting Linde as our industrial gas supplier to supply nitrogen and clean hydrogen for the site. Securing partner agreements and subsidies is our next step. All of these actions are critical to reaching a final investment decision this year. As a reminder, this investment for the world's first net zero CO2 emissions ethylene and derivatives complex will decarbonize 20% of our global ethylene capacity. At the same time, it will grow our global polyethylene supply by 15% and triple our Alberta site polyethylene capacity. We're also taking a capital efficient approach to meet increasing demand for more circular solutions as we scale up production for both advanced and mechanical recycling with strategic partners like Valoregen, Mura Technology, and WM among others. Valoregen's 15 kiloton mechanical recycling facility in France will start up during the second half of this year. This hybrid recycling plant is expected to process up to 70 kilotons of plastic waste per year by 2025. And Mura remains on track to start up the first of its kind, 20 kiloton per year advanced recycling plant in Teesside in the United Kingdom in the second half of this year. This is the first step in our strategic partnership with Mura to launch as much as 600 kilotons per year of advanced recycling capacity by 2030. As the key off taker of post-consumer and advanced recycled feed from both of these partnerships, Dow well commercialize circular polymers in high demand from global brands. Altogether by 2030, we are on track to deliver an additional $1 billion in underlying EBITDA improvement through our Alberta project, commercialize 3 million metric tons per year of circular and renewable solutions and reduce Scope 1 and 2 CO2 emissions by 5 million metric tons compared to our 2020 levels. Turning to Slide 9. We remain focused on delivering on our commitments with transparency, accountability and a culture of benchmarking. Today, we published our annual benchmarking update as we have every year since spin, which can be found in the appendix of this presentation and is posted on our website. The results, once again, demonstrate our strong performance relative to peers. In particular, Dow delivered best-in-class free cash flow yield and net debt reduction since spin. We also achieved above peer median return on invested capital and returns to shareholders. Taking a closer look at the results on Slide 10, our free cash flow yield on a three year average is nearly 2 times the peer average and 3 times the sector and market averages. Our differentiated portfolio, cost advantaged assets and operating discipline have resulted in three year EBITDA margins and return on invested capital well above the peer median. This includes our 15% return on invested capital, which is above our 13% target across the economic cycle. Our focus on cash flow generation has supported strong shareholder returns and our strengthened balance sheet has resulted in improved credit ratings and outlooks. Additionally, all operating segments achieved best-in-class or top quartile free cash conversion and cost performance. Notably, Packaging & Specialty Plastics further expanded its outperformance over the next best peer on an EBITDA per pound of polyolefin basis by $0.05 per pound. It also delivered five year average EBITDA margins 500 basis points above the peer median. Looking forward, our growth investments throughout the decade will further enhance our competitive advantages and shareholder value creation. Closing, on Slide 11. Dow continues to execute with consistency and discipline to deliver resilient performance in the near term and sustainable growth in cash flow generation over the long-term. We're implementing targeted actions across the enterprise to reduce costs and maximize cash. Our strong balance sheet provides financial flexibility as we continue to deliver against our capital allocation priorities and our Decarbonize and Grow and Transform the Waste strategies will raise our underlying earnings profile, while reducing our carbon footprint and increasing recycled content. All combined, we are confident in our ability to continue delivering against our financial targets across the economic cycle. With that, I'll turn it back to Pankaj to open up the Q&A. Pankaj Gupta : Thank you, Jim. Now let's move on to your questions. I would like to remind you that our forward-looking statements apply to both prepared remarks and the following Q&A. Operator, please provide the Q&A instructions. Operator : [Operator Instruction] Our first question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Vincent Andrews : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Wondering if you could touch a little bit more on Performance Materials and Coatings, obviously, the segment showed very strong results on a sequential basis that were fairly better than what the Street was looking for. So, if you can just give us a little bit more insight into why things turned out better than planned and just sort of what you think the trajectory is for the balance of the year? Jim Fitterling : Yeah. Good morning, Vince. Good question. They -- obviously, we had some headwinds, obviously, in the fourth quarter in silicones with some outages that did not recur in the first quarter. So that was part of the impact. The other thing you would see in silicones was that, pricing and demand held up relatively well. Some pressure downward on siloxanes pricing in China from new capacity additions there. But I think we're starting to see that the demand is picking up and that should help smooth things out. So you also saw higher net sales in coatings and monomers and also higher volumes. Some of its supply availability, as I mentioned in silicones and siloxanes, the other is getting ready for seasonally higher volumes going into the second quarter. And then we think we'll see more of a traditional seasonal pickup in the coatings and monomers segment. Some pressure on architectural coatings, but industrial coatings are looking relatively strong. And I think we'll have to watch carefully what's going on with housing starts and housing sales and see how that impacts architectural coatings through the quarter. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global. Please go ahead. Hassan Ahmed : Good morning, Jim and Howard. Question around packaging and specialty plastics. Look, I was a bit surprised to see EBITDA being sequentially flat keeping in mind that, obviously, we got $0.06 a pound worth of polyethylene price hikes and ethane was down sequentially. So that's sort of part one of the question. And part two is that, I'd also love to sort of hear your views on what's happening with your operating rates within sort of ethylene and polyethylene, keeping in mind that you guys scaled back in Q4? Thanks so much. Howard Ungerleider : Good morning, Hassan. Good questions. P&SP did see pricing improve through the quarter in the first quarter, but, obviously, in the fourth quarter, we saw things slide down through the quarter. And so, a simple way to think about it is, we ended the quarter really still below where we started the fourth quarter of last year. So we did see pricing improvements. In fact, we saw $0.03 through in March and we've got a $0.05 nomination into April. But I would say that averaging effect took away some of the impact from oil to gas spreads, which are improving. The other thing is, the oil to gas spreads really improved in the month of March primarily. We didn't see so much impact in the month of February, but in the month of March we saw that. So we -- I would expect that to carry into the second quarter. Operating rates for the quarter were up 10 percentage points, with the biggest pressure still continuing to be in Europe because of the higher cost position there and also the lower demand in Europe, and I would say, that's the biggest. If you look at our volumes and not just in packaging and specialty plastics, but our overall volumes in Europe year-over-year, they're down the most in Europe and our operating rates are the lowest in Europe. As you would expect, whereas our operating rates in the U.S. Gulf Coast, Canada and Argentina with the exception of turnaround time are continuing to be in the 90-plus percent range. Jim Fitterling : Yes. On two other points on that comparison. So don't forget that in the fourth quarter, we had the innovation catalyst and actually a licensing sale. Those are lumpy. That was about $70 million in the fourth quarter that didn't recur. So that was a headwind sequentially. And then also the bulk of Q1, we had the cracker in Sadara out for a planned maintenance turnaround. So that's now back up and running, and that should be a tailwind improvement in the second quarter. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. David Begleiter : Thank you. Good morning. Jim, the sequential increase in Q2 is a little less than normal. Where are you seeing the greatest pressures from a volume perspective in Q2 versus maybe perhaps normal seasonality? Jim Fitterling : Yeah. I would say the biggest pressure still continues to be an II&I and more specifically in polyurethanes and construction chemicals. I'd say the one thing that may not be quite as obvious in the second quarter guidance is, there's a $70 million headwind in there from Chlor-Alkali and Vinyl. And we've seen some pressure, obviously, there on lower demand. And as you know, that complex operates on both caustic soda and also chlorine demand. And with housing down, PVC demand being down and the pressure that puts on operating rates brings things down. Then on the other side, obviously, we're seeing industrial uses putting some downward pressure on both demand and price in caustic soda. So I'd say, they're managing it well. They're making the adjustments that they need to make, and -- but that's probably the biggest difference in looking forward to Q2. I would say from a turnarounds perspective, we're in pretty good shape. Howard, do you have a comparison, like, on turnarounds Q2 versus Q1? Howard Ungerleider : Yep. I mean turnaround sequentially are going to be about a $75 million headwind. $25 millions of that in P&SP and the balance in Industrial Intermediates. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Steve Byren : Yes. Thank you. I just wanted to confirm that the margin benefit from propane to propylene that's not realized in the PM&C segment. Is that right? And perhaps a question about the headcount reduction, 2,000 target for the year. What is that off of the total number? And is your benchmarking analysis that it highlight that is an area to focus on, like, EBITDA per employee or something like that? Thanks. Jim Fitterling : Yeah. First, Steve, I'm going to take a shot, because I want to make sure I get this right. So Howard, I'll ask you to comment. But we transfer propylene and ethylene at market. Having said that, we roll some of the benefit of the propylene spread forward into II&I, for example, for polyurethanes and into coatings and monomers. So they see -- it's there for their integration benefit and so they see that in their numbers, it rolls forward. So it should show up in that side of the equation. On the 2,000 headcount reduction, that is off our published Dow Direct headcount list. So you would expect 75% of those exits to happen by the end of second quarter, as Howard said, probably close and 90% by the end of the year. The only reason for the time lag is, as some of the site announcements get made on-site closures. Well, I have to, obviously, work through the timing with works councils and others on that and the timing of the closures. The driving force for that is, obviously, just looking at our overall cost position and trying to keep our cost lean and in line with demand. If you can take a look at demand really hit in fourth quarter, really hit the lowest we've seen since the beginning of the COVID pandemic, which was back in March of 2020. And so, we really need to tighten up to that level and then see how we can go as we expand out of that. Are there thoughts or comments? Howard Ungerleider : No. That's correct. Agreed. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Jeff Zekauskas : Thanks very much. ExxonMobil announced a very large project in Baytown to produce ammonia and hydrogen in order to decarbonize their Gulf Coast facilities. Is that something that Dow might do, that is, do you want to get involved in the ammonia markets or the hydrogen markets in the United States? And then secondly, for Howard, what's the working capital benefit look like for this year? Is that, I don't know, $400 million? Is it a higher number or a lower number? Your cash flows probably will work their way up this year? Jim Fitterling : Good morning, Jeff. I'll take the Exxon question and the ammonia question. I'll have Howard tackle the working capital. I think one of the things that's happened is, obviously, ammonia as a fuel is becoming an interesting market. And so, in addition to decarbonizing, there's also a shift in what's expected to be a shift in fuel mix. We've seen that with some announcements in ammonia fuel for overseas shipping. And so, I think there's a play into that market. As we look at our own assets, we're going to look at hydrogen and carbon capture as ways to decarbonize. And obviously, we've got the plan to decarbonize one of our assets with advanced small modular nuclear reactors. It will be site specific as we go through it. I think hydrogen clearly is going to play a role because of the ability to take off gases through autothermal reforming and convert those into hydrogen. That will probably be the most efficient for us. But there will be a wide variety of uses, but I don't see us entering the ammonia markets. Howard Ungerleider : Yes. Jeff, on the working capital, really proud of the work that the Dow Team did. Sequentially, we kept our conversion or efficiency on a days basis flat, sequentially from Q4 to Q1. You think about as we enter turnaround season as we enter hopefully a period of heavier demand, that's very good. Actually, we put our inventory units down about 2% sequentially. To your question about the full year, I would say, we're working on between two and three days of structural efficiency, improvement in working capital. On a dollars basis, that's anywhere between $300 million and $500 million for the year in terms of improvement in cash. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Mike Sison with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Mike Sison : Hi, guys. Nice start to the year. Just curious, I think you mentioned your North American operating rates would improve 2Q to 90%. I think the EBIT driver is up $75 million. So just curious why the improvement in P&SP, wouldn't be stronger in 2Q? Are you thinking polyethylene margins are coming down? Or just maybe any other factors that the improvement would have been better? Jim Fitterling : Good morning, Michael, I would say two things. We've got nominations out for April in terms of pricing. I think there's also capacity coming on. So, we're being realistic about where we think things are moving in the marketplace. Exports are up, which is good. We hit the highest level of marine pack cargo exports since March of 2021. And so, that is a really good sign. And the schedule reliability on marine pack cargo exports has been the best since October of 2020. So we're seeing really positive trends there. The only inventory increase we saw in the region was really at the export hubs, which was sitting there waiting for exports. So I think overall industry inventories are under control. So those are all net positives. Oil to gas spreads promptly are a little bit less than where we ended the quarter. And I would expect as we get into second quarter and demand for that natural gas picks up a little bit, we should see some of that natural gas pricing move up a little bit. But still it's going to be good oil to gas spreads here in the U.S. So I think it's still guiding up on integrated margins, but there could be potential for some upside from there. Howard Ungerleider : Yes, Michael, the other thing is, don't forget, there's a $25 million headwind from a turnaround in Functional Polymers, which is in P&SP as well sequentially. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. John McNulty : Yeah. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So maybe just to dig a little bit further on the U.S. side of the market, obviously, there is some capacity coming on in the polyethylene area. Can you speak to the demand trends that you're actually seeing if there's any pockets of either strength or incremental weakness that you're seeing? And then also, can you give us kind of an update as to how you're seeing the mix of domestic versus export demand and how you expect that to trend through 2023? Jim Fitterling : Yeah. Good morning, John. The global demand has been improving. North America, we had some benefit, obviously, in the first quarter because the industry had about 14% of capacity online due to force majeures and unplanned events, and there were some delays in capacity startups in the first quarter. We still see North American fundamentals to be very robust as we go into the second quarter and through the year. I think logistics challenges appear to be behind us, both marine pack cargo, road shipments are all kind of getting back to normal space. The biggest drag right now probably on P&SP is in Europe. Europe has been pretty slow, still some destocking going on there. We're having some advantage from cracking propane in Terneuzen and Tarragona. So we've been cracking max propane there. So that helps a little bit. But I think the weight of the European market is really the biggest drag right now. I expect North American market to be pretty robust. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead. Kevin McCarthy : Yes. Good morning. Jim, I'm listening to your prepared remarks, it sounds like you're still evaluating potential for rationalization of some higher cost assets. And so, I'm wondering if you could speak to the possible size, scope and timing of that effort, and whether you're really looking at Europe as the center of gravity, given geopolitical and energy changes there or something larger and broader than that? Jim Fitterling : Good morning, Kevin. I would say Europe, obviously, adds the attention because in most cases, it's moved into the high cost position around the globe and there's a lot of pressure from higher energy costs as well. LNG costs into Europe right now are in the $14 to $ 17 a million Btu range, while we sit here in the U.S. between $2 and $3. And so, I think you can sense over the long-term that, that continues to be the same in the long-term, that will put a lot of pressure on the European market. A lot depends on how the European Union and also how the individual member states respond via energy policies and other changes that they're looking at and hard to anticipate when they'll make those decisions. But energy cost is going to be a big driving force, and that will be one that will be hard to overcome. So we'll continue to look at those assets. We don't want to jump the gun and get ahead of any policy changes that might make them still competitive long-term. But those are the biggest things on big assets, big sites that are in our head right now. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Duffy Fischer : Yes. Good morning. Jim, wanted to dig a little bit on the comment you made about a $70 million sequential headwind in chlor-alkali. So a couple of questions there. Is that mostly with the European assets? Or is that on the U.S. contract chlor-alkali you get? And is most of that pain coming from caustic? Or are you also seeing margin squeeze on the chlorine and chlorine derivatives? Jim Fitterling : Good morning, Duffy, our exposure on caustic is really Europe and Latin America. So, most of that $70 million is on that. None of what was in that guidance, that outlook guidance was related to our contracts with [indiscernible]. So nothing related to that. And I would say that's clearly driven by the market dynamics and the market demand that is driving lower prices and also lower operating rates in those regions. So we'll continue to keep an eye on that. Housing, I think -- if housing begins to turn a little bit, that will be one of the first things that will help out. And then industrial demand has also been relatively soft. Those two drivers will be the ones that will start to make that turn. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Josh Spector with UBS. Please go ahead. Josh Spector : Yeah. Hi, thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to follow up on volumes, I'm thinking maybe another quarter or two out. So, the past couple of quarters, your volumes have been down something in the range of 8% to 10% year-over-year. That seems to be kind of where you're guiding for the second quarter. And I mean, generally, we're seeing a slower uptick than what we expected sequentially and some market weakening. So I'm just curious, at this point, should we be assuming that volumes are down a similar level to that in 3Q? And obviously, the comps get easier in 4Q. But I'm wondering what in your view would change that trajectory or if that's the right way to think about it? Jim Fitterling : Yes. Good question on the volumes. I would say North American volumes are coming back, which I think is going to be a real positive. If you look at same quarter last year, I mentioned we were down 11% on volume. That was really led by EMEA. So EMEA was down 15% during that same time frame. So you can see that some of the other cost advantaged regions were still doing relatively well. The other thing to think about is Asia Pacific. We did start to see -- after February we started to see some positive expansion in the China market, which we had not seen earlier in the first quarter. And so, if you look at P&SP and II&I, both volumes were down a lot in the first quarter. We had some, as Howard mentioned, nonrecurring licensing activity, which is not really a volume but an EBITDA play. And then we had the Sadara cracker turnaround, which took volumes out as well for them. And so, I think you're going to see Asia Pacific volumes pick up in the second quarter, and I would think that, that would continue. We're starting to see even in areas like MEG, we're starting to see the spot market pick up a bit and the operating rates in China pick up a bit. So that will help. And then the question will be, when do we start to see some positive momentum out of Europe? So I would think through the year, we should start to see this gradually improve. That's what our plan for the year is, first half of the year, if you follow where we are, we'll make a little bit less than half of our target for the year, and we'll make the rest in the back half, largely on good price/volume management, good control over operations and our own self-help on delivering that $1 billion of cost saving. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Laurence Alexander : Hi. Good morning. Just to follow up on that sequential build. What are you thinking about in terms of the amount of summer inventory build or how to think about the seasonality in Q3, given the mix in the top end markets you\u2019ve described? Jim Fitterling : Well, as Howard mentioned, we're really focused on efficiency. And so, we're looking to get two, three days of efficiency. I'd love to get that efficiency through higher sales rather than through the opposite way. But we're keeping inventories well under control. For example, we ended the first quarter really similar, maybe even slightly lower than we ended the fourth quarter in terms of actual volume and inventory. I don't think we're in a scenario where there's any reason to really build big inventories going into the season, maybe on a specific business like coatings needs to build a little bit ahead of the seasonal demand. But for the rest, we have the ability to ramp up rates to match that demand, and that's what we're going to do. So I feel like inventory -- we're going to manage it pretty tight through the year. I don't see any outside drivers out there that would give us a signal that we should be doing anything more. We would need to see some really strong demand drivers and demand signals to move off of that tight inventory management. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Parkinson with Mizuho. Please go ahead. Christopher Parkinson : Okay. Thank you so much. It's obviously been a few years with China now finally emerging from COVID. But can you just kind of give us your latest and greatest thoughts on your three main segments regarding the potential for new Chinese supply across polyethylene, MDI, and then just the remainder siloxanes, which you've already been mentioning. Just given that they're finally emerging from this, just any update on your thought process there will be incredibly helpful. Thank you so much. Jim Fitterling : Sure. Let me try to do this MDI and siloxanes. Look, on siloxanes, there were about four additions in China last year on siloxanes capacity. You had each one of them range, they were between 100,000 and 200,000 tons each. And so -- there are some more planned additions coming throughout this year. But I think the net total -- the biggest year was last year that we saw about 650,000 tons added. So I think we're through that. MDI, I think, is a timing game, as we've said before, I feel good about where supply/demand is with MDI. In the short term, the operating rates have been between 75% and 80%. And it's all depending on your view of how fast the Chinese capacity is going to come on. We think it's going to be spread out a little bit more over time versus all coming on in 2023. And so, our view is that, the industry operating rates should hold up in that high 70s, almost 80% range, which historically is a constructive range for MDI. And in polyethylene, I haven't seen -- as you know, most of the capacity over the last 10 years has been added in China. The supply additions and also the delays and the cancellations mean that things are going to be pretty balanced to maybe even slightly net short over the next couple of years, maybe in the range of 2 million to 5 million tons net short. So I think supply additions in polyethylene is not the big concern right now. I think it's -- we're focused more on growing that recycling business and also making sure that we've got our footprint in the lowest cost to operate jurisdictions. North America, Middle East and U.S. ethane, Canadian ethane, Argentina, all substantially advantaged to European and Asian naphtha right now and even MTO and CTO. So, we want to continue to build out our footprint in more cost advantaged regions going forward. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Leithead with Barclays. Please go ahead. Mike Leithead : Great. Thanks. Good morning. I was hoping you could help me reconcile Slide 5 and Slide 7 a bit. If we look at Slide 5, your main product verticals look pretty challenged near term. And then on Slide 7, you talk about why they should see pretty attractive growth over the next one to two years. Obviously, I recognize there's a bit of a time disconnect or differential there. But I guess, internally, how do you get comfortable that what we're seeing near term only transitory or maybe the other way around, when do you start rethinking some of the timing of your expansion investments if demand remains weaker for longer? Jim Fitterling : Yes, good question, Michael. I mean, I think a lot right now, a lot of the weight on the market is the inflationary pressure and the things have remained stickier for longer. You are seeing in commodities that pricing is coming down. That hasn't rolled through yet to the consumer. And so, the weight on the consumer and the consumers' confidence has not been there. And the manufacturing confidence indexes have not been that grade either. A lot of them have been in contraction until just recently, and we're starting to see some positivity in the PMI numbers. China, just moving positive. It's a little bit mixed still here in North America, but a couple of zones in the Fed are starting to move into positive PMI territory. So I think as that market sentiment improves, we'll get ourselves back on to the normal trajectory. And what typically drives the growth for our products is GDP and an increasing middle class. And both of those, we believe, are going to continue to drive them for the long-term. It's true in Packaging & Specialty Plastics. The drive to urbanization drives a lot of volume in silicones and siloxane. So, think about architectural structures, high-rise buildings, even multifamily homes, which have been weak relatively. And then when you get back into II&I, polyurethane and construction chemicals, really driven by housing starts, housing sales, whether it's in insulation or it\u2019s in appliances or durable goods and in Dow Industrial Solutions, markets like ag, pharma and [cipients] (ph), every day consumer products, household goods, cleaning items that you buy all have positive trends. So I think it is a timing issue. There's been a lot of projects and incentives and policies deployed to drive this capital that's going to be invested in infrastructure, but it takes a while for that to actually ramp up. And so, I think that's why we took the near-term, long-term view of it, and that was what those two slides were meant to represent. Howard Ungerleider : And Mike, I mean the other positive on long-term trend of mobility with EVs, don't forget, there's a significant increase in multiple of the need for Dow chemistry in an EV vehicle than in an internal combustion engine. So that will be a real growth driver for our silicones business as well as our elastomers business and to a lesser extent, urethane acrylics. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Aleksey Yefremov with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Aleksey Yefremov : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. You work on your Alberta projects, do you have a sense of how much capital costs have come up roughly since you built the Texas 9 cracker on the Gulf Coast? Jim Fitterling : Good morning, Aleksey. Thanks for the question. On Alberta, I would think about it this way. Our target there is to try to get the total cost of the project in dollars per ton of capacity to be advantaged to the Texas 9 project. And we believe that we can do that based on what we've seen so far. Through the rest of this year, we'll be getting firm bids on some of the bulk materials that go in, and we'll have a feel for that. But we've been watching, obviously, steel, cement and the other markets that really drive a lot of those bulk costs. I think we'll be able to do that. Part of it is scale, part of it is learnings on construction and techniques that we picked up off of Texas 9. And so, there's some that we'll engineer into this as well. But my sense of this is, Texas 9 since start-up has been well above 15% return on invested capital, which is going to be one of the most successful cracker projects and derivatives projects ever. And I think when you look at Alberta, we're going to have a chance to replicate maybe even improve on that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Arun Viswanathan : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I just had a question about the $1.5 billion Q2 or so implied EBITDA guidance. When you think about that, it looks like there's $75 million of headwinds in there as well. So maybe it's a $1.6 billion number. So how would you characterize that within your framework of peak to trough? Would you still consider maybe $2 billion as a mid-cycle Q2 number? And so maybe you're 75% to 80% of the way there? Or -- and does the cost reductions kind of bridge that gap? Or how are we thinking about where we are kind of in your earnings trajectory? Thanks. Jim Fitterling : Howard, do you want to go through -- walk through on the outlook? Howard Ungerleider : Yes. No, I think -- I mean, Arun, you're thinking about it right in terms of the walk from Q1 to Q2. I would say my perspective, Jim, you may have your own view. But -- look, I think $2 billion is light from a normalized basis. We're still looking at that 6 to 12 current portfolio view from trough to peak, and that's heading in the middle of the decade, that should be more like 7.5 or 8 to as much as 13 or eventually 14 once we add in the Alberta project. So I think a more normalized EBITDA for us is in that $9 million to $10 million range in a normalized macro. So, when you're looking at $1.5 billion, plus or minus, you're still -- you're right around the floor of the earnings quarter on an annualized basis. And then, obviously, that $1 billion of cost saves that will ramp, 65% that will get us -- will come to the bottom line in the second half of the year, that just is there to protect and ensure that we can deliver in that $6 billion plus or minus range. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Cunningham with Citi. Please go ahead. Patrick Cunningham : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking question. In the release, you highlighted some year-over-year strength in functional polymers for renewable technology. Can you highlight some of those technologies? And then similarly, on the near-term growth investments, I think, Functional Polymers is a significant part of that. What technologies or end markets are targeted investments here? Jim Fitterling : Yes. Welcome, Patrick. And Functional Polymers is about 25% of the P&SP portfolio on the polymer side. And I'd say the two biggest areas of strength there are in the solar photovoltaic films and you think about the protective films that are used to put together the solar panels. We've got a good position there. And with some of the leading producers around the world and we're starting to see some real volumes pick up there. So I think you're going to see that industry be the beneficiary in the near term, probably one of the early beneficiaries of the infrastructure and the IRA monies that have been deployed. And the other area would be wire and cable, and we're starting to see a pickup there. So as we put more alternative energy in and we would also have to deal with the aging grid and we have to deal with also infrastructure work that utilities need to do on the grid to increase the reliability and expand the grid because populations are expanding in a lot of these urban areas. That drives demand for wire and cable products of which we have a leading market position, whether it's high voltage transmission or whether it's down into medium and lower voltage, things like in the telecom sector. So, as we're expanding reach for more wireless access to the people, we're going to see more telecommunitication towers go up, that's going to drive more demand for wire and cable products for those projects. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Blair with Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Please go ahead. Matthew Blair : Hi there. Good morning. Jim, could you provide some more color on your auto end market. The mobility category on Slide 5 actually looks a little bit better than all of your other major areas. Are you gaining share? And how are things tracking relative to your expectations? Jim Fitterling : Mobility is a growth platform for us, and the team there that's focused on building back some of that core capability that we had prior to the spin is doing a great job. Silicones are a big part of that. So improving the resilience of the system with more electronics on the vehicles is great. But we also play a leading part in noise, vibration and harshness in the vehicle. So we've got a long history of doing that. We're starting to see pickup for recycled materials. So our SPECFLEX C and also our RENUVA recycled materials, like recycled mattresses, SPECFLEX C CPU system is made out of polyols made out of recycled engine oil are now pickup in automotive seating applications. We also have a lot going on with acrylic, both hybrid acrylic and silicone technologies in this area. We've just won some recent innovation awards for some products that I think are going to be real platform winners. LUXSENSE silicon leather. We just got a big innovation award. This is a really high-quality synthetic silicone-based leather which can be used in automotive applications. It's durable. It holds color well, you can clean it easily. Also a lot of pickup with the Bridgestone self-sealing tires, which has a silicone inner layer to it, which allows that tire to seal. And that will completely eliminate the need for a spare on a vehicle. That also can be recycled. The silicon can be separated from the tire and be recycled. And then we play in the lighting area. In LED lighting, we're a big provider, both in what you would see in your home every day with LED lighting, but also in multiple optical silicones, we think the headlamps in automotive applications as they become more sophisticated, they move more to the multiple optical silicon in those applications. So we're excited about it. We think it has a potential to be a significant contributor to our future growth. Operator : I will now turn the conference back over to Pankaj for any closing remarks.

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Dow, Investor Relations, Vice President, Pankaj Gupta. Mr. Gupta, you may begin. Pankaj Gupta : Good morning. Thank you for joining our webcast today. The accompanying slides are provided through this webcast and posted on our website. I'm Pankaj Gupta, Dow Investor Relations Vice President. And joining me today on the call are Jim Fitterling, Dow's Chair and Chief Executive Officer; and Howard Ungerleider, President and Chief Financial Officer. Please note, our comments contain forward-looking statements and are subject to the related cautionary statement contained in the earnings news release and slides. Please refer to our public filings for further information about principal risks and uncertainties. Unless otherwise specified, all financials where applicable, excludes significant items. We will also refer to non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures are contained in the earnings news release and slides and are posted on our website. On Slide 2, you will see the agenda for our call. Jim will begin by reviewing our second quarter results and operating segment performance. Howard will then share our outlook and modeling guidance and then provide an update on our cost savings actions and financial position. To close, Jim will outline how we are continuing to advance our long term Decarbonize and Grow, as well as Transform the Waste strategies, while navigating challenging short term dynamics. Following that, we will take your questions. Now let me turn the call over to Jim. Jim Fitterling : Thank you, Pankaj. Beginning on Slide 3, we continued to navigate a challenging macroeconomic environment with slow global growth in the second quarter. Despite lower year-over-year sales and earnings, Team Dow delivered sequential earnings improvement by executing on our financial and operational playbook. We leveraged our diverse portfolio to capitalize on gains in packaging and modestly higher seasonal demand in building and construction. This resulted in a sequential improvement in volume. In addition, we continue to implement our $1 billion of proactive and targeted cost savings actions delivering $250 million of savings in the quarter and $350 year to date. Net sales were $11.4 billion, down 27% versus the year ago period, reflecting lower demand and prices due to slower macroeconomic activity. Sales were down 4% sequentially, as volume gains were more than offset by lower local prices. Volume decreased 8% year-over-year, led by a 14% decline in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and India, or EMEA. Volume was up 1% sequentially, driven by gains in Asia Pacific and Latin America, as well as in industrial intermediates and infrastructure and performance materials and coatings. Local price decreased 18% year-over-year and 5% sequentially due to lower demand on weak macroeconomic activity, as well as lower global raw material costs. Operating EBIT for the quarter was $885 million, down from $2.4 billion in the year ago period, primarily driven by lower local prices. Operating EBIT increased $177 million sequentially, driven by gains in packaging and specialty plastics. We generated cash flow from operations of more than $1.3 billion, up more than $800 million versus the prior quarter, driven by improved working capital. On a trailing 12 month basis, our cash flow conversion is 98%. Our strong financial position gives us the flexibility to continue to advance our long term strategic priorities, supported by our disciplined and balanced capital allocation strategy. In the quarter, we returned $743 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Year to date, we've returned nearly $1.4 billion. And our balance sheet remains healthy, supported by strong investment grade credit ratings. We also published our 2022 INtersections Report in June. The report once again received limited assurance by our external audit firm and showcases Dow's continued progress on our ambition to be the most innovative customer centric, inclusive and sustainable material science company in the world. Now turning to our operating segment performance on Slide 4. In the Packaging and Specialty Plastics segment, operating EBIT was $918 million compared to $1.4 billion in the year ago period. Local price declines were driven by lower global energy and feedstock costs, which in turn impacted polyethylene prices across all regions. Volume declines, primarily in EMEA, were driven by lower demand for olefins and aromatics. Sequentially operating EBIT improved by $276 million, driven by lower energy and feedstock costs. Moving to the Industrial Intermediates and Infrastructure segment, operating EBIT was a loss of $35 million, compared to earnings of 426 million in the year ago period. Results were driven by lower local prices and demand in both businesses. Volume declines were primarily driven by lower demand for consumer durables, building and construction, and industrial applications. Sequentially, operating EBIT was down $158 million due to lower local prices and increased planned maintenance turnaround activity. And in the Performance Materials and Coatings segment, operating EBIT was $66 million compared to $561 million in the year ago period. Local price decreases were driven primarily by declines for siloxanes and acrylic monomers. Volume was down on lower global demand for silicones and coatings applications. Sequentially, operating EBIT increased $31 million, driven primarily by seasonally higher volumes. Next, I'll turn it over to Howard to review our outlook and actions on Slide 5. Howard Ungerleider : Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. We continue to expect a challenging macroeconomic environment in the third quarter. While inflation is beginning to moderate, the lagging effects of higher monetary policy on consumer demand and a slower than expected demand recovery in China have resulted in a slowdown of industrial economic activity around the world. In the US, industrial activity remains weak with June manufacturing PMI in contraction at 46.3. However, consumer demand has remained resilient supported by low unemployment levels. With inflation starting to ease, consumer confidence in June is now at the highest levels since early 2022. In Europe, recessionary conditions persist and are expected to continue, despite lower energy prices and inflation declining to a 17 month low. Industrial activity in the region continues to contract with PMI reaching the lowest level since May 2020. In China, while we are experiencing growth, the anticipated economic rebound following the end of zero COVID restrictions has yet to fully materialize. June manufacturing PMI continues to hover around neutral level of 50, and China's exports were impacted by the global demand slowdown, contracting at the fastest pace since the beginning of the pandemic. Around the rest of the world, India's manufacturing PMI expanded to 57.8 in June as demand outpaced higher input costs and ASEAN manufacturing PMI remained in expansionary territory. Manufacturing activity in Japan, however, retreated back to contractionary levels following improvements in PMI for three consecutive months. Given these regional dynamics, we will continue to take a disciplined approach to managing our operations and adapt our business to the evolving market realities. Turning to our outlook for the third quarter on Slide 6. In the Packaging and Specialty Plastics segment, industry polyethylene demand increased 4% in June. Despite this tailwind, we exited the second quarter at lower price levels, which are expected to drive lower average prices sequentially. We're also experiencing increased feedstock costs, primarily driven by higher ethane prices on the US Gulf Coast. All in, we anticipate these market dynamics will be a $50 million headwind in the quarter. Additionally, increased planned maintenance turnaround activity at our cracker in St. Charles, Louisiana is expected to be a $100 million headwind, and we see another $100 million headwind from the lack of project based licensing sales from the prior order, which will not occur. However, we do expect to generate a $50 million tailwind in the quarter as we continue to implement our cost savings actions. In the Industrial Intermediates and Infrastructure segment, while demand in energy end markets remains resilient, we expect continued demand pressuring consumer durable end markets. We anticipate a $15 million tailwind from our cost savings actions, as well as a $25 million tailwind following the completion of a planned maintenance turnaround from the second quarter. Additionally, following an unplanned event at our Louisiana operations this month, our preliminary estimate reflects a $100 million headwind to earnings. I want to please reinforce that this estimate is only preliminary at this point. As we get a more refined estimate, we will update if needed. In the Performance Materials and Coatings segment, we expect continued price pressure in siloxanes, while seasonal demand remains below normal for building and construction end markets, together contributing a $50 million headwind. Our cost savings are on track to deliver a $35 million tailwind from the segment. Additionally, the completion of second quarter turnarounds at our Carrollton and our Zhangjiagang siloxanes facilities are anticipated to contribute a $25 million tailwind in the third. Operationally, our earnings are expected to be flat with the prior quarter as our self-help is expected to fully offset the estimated margin compression. All in, we expect third quarter earnings to be down approximately a $150 million sequentially before the impact of the Plaquemine outage as a result of the $50 million higher turnaround expense and the $100 million in project driven licensing sales, which will not recur. Turning to Slide 7, our commitment to financial and operational discipline enables Dow to navigate the near term market challenges, while continuing to invest for the future. We are on track to deliver our $1 billion of cost savings in 2023. We achieved 35% of the savings in the first half of the year and continue to expect we will deliver the remaining 65% in the second half. This includes our previously announced global workforce reduction program. 75% of the 2,000 impacted roles exited at the end of the second quarter and more than 90% are expected to exit by the end of the year. Our $300 million reduction in planned maintenance turnaround spending remains on track and we're continuing to execute improvements in our raw materials, logistics, and utility costs. We're also continuing to execute actions to rationalize select higher cost, lower return assets in our polyurethanes, coatings, and industrial solutions businesses, in line with market fundamentals. These actions support the strong financial position that Team Dow has purposely built since then. Our debt and our credit profile gives a significant flexibility and optionality to continue to advance our strategic priorities across the economic cycle. All in, our actions have allowed us to lower our cash commitments by approximately $1 billion since spin, driven by significantly lower cash interest and pension liabilities, reduce share count, and no joint venture cash contributions. For 2023, we expect our annual net interest expense contributions. For 2023, we expect our annual net interest expense to be down more than 40% versus 2019 and we have no substantive debt maturities due until 2027. And we see more than $1 billion of Unique-to-Dow additional cash levers going forward, including resolution of our pending Nova litigation, structural working capital improvements, and our intervention actions. Next, I'll turn it back to Jim for an update on our long term strategy. Jim Fitterling : Thank you, Howard. Moving to Slide 8. We remain confident in our long term growth as we drive the transition to a more sustainable future with a focus on profitability and maintaining our disciplined and balanced capital allocation priorities. Our decarbonizing growth strategy is expected to increase underlying earnings by $3 billion annually, while also reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 30% by 2030 versus 2005 levels. Notable updates this quarter include, our FCDH unit is now fully operational and is ramping up rates. Leveraging breakthrough technology, the unit expands our capacity at lower capital and cost intensity, while reducing energy usage and greenhouse gas emissions relative to conventional PDH units. In collaboration with X-energy, we are preparing to submit a construction permit application to the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission for our small modular nuclear energy facility in Seadrift, Texas. We plan to break ground in 2026, and the project is expected to provide the site with safe, reliable, low carbon power and steam. In parallel, we are utilizing a capital efficient approach to quickly scale production and grow our supply of recycled and bio based products. By 2030, we expect to advance our Transform the Waste strategy by commercializing 3 million metric tons per year of circular and renewable solutions. Our collaborations with Valoregen and Mura Technology both remain on track to start up their respective mechanical and advanced recycling facilities in the fourth quarter. Together, these investments will help us unlock long term growth opportunities as we meet increasing customer and brand owner demand for more sustainable and circular solutions. Taking a closer look at our Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta path to zero project on Slide 9. This flagship project will create the world's first net zero CO2 emissions ethylene and derivatives complex, another example of how we're delivering long term value growth through sustainability. By 2030, the project will decarbonize 20% of our global ethylene capacity, while expanding our global polyethylene supply by 15% and tripling polyethylene capacity at our Alberta site. We are on track to secure partner agreements and subsidies during the second half of this year and we are targeting board and regulatory approval along with a final investment decision by year end. Construction is projected to begin in 2024 and start-up of the project will occur in two phases. Phase 1 will add approximately 1,300 kilotons of ethylene and polyethylene capacity annually by 2027. Phase 2 will contribute another approximately 600 kilotons annually by 2029. We expect to spend, on average, roughly $1 billion of CapEx annually on the project beginning next year through project completion. By mid-decade, our total CapEx for the company is projected to ramp above D&A between 2025 and 2027 as we implement Phase 1 of the Alberta project. We remain fully committed to keep our target CapEx within D&A across the economic cycle and expect to return those -- to those levels after the completion of the first phase of this project. At full run rates, we expect the project to deliver $1 billion of EBITDA annually and targeted returns on invested capital above our enterprise goal of 13% over the economic cycle, driven by the Alberta feedstock cost advantage, which provides Dow with lower ethane costs compared to the rest of the world, even more advantaged than the US Gulf Coast. Industry leading capital efficiency, building on the success of our Texas 9 investments, which has delivered over 15% return on invested capital since startup with best-in-class capital intensity, conversion costs and CO2 emissions. A higher value sustainable product offering which drives value as we capitalize on technologies that deliver low and zero CO2 emission solutions with enhanced performance for our customers and by leveraging third party investments for decarbonization and CO2 infrastructure assets, which will reduce our capital spend consistent with our best owner mindset. Altogether, we are well positioned to lead the industry and meet the needs of customers and brand owners as they seek products with a lower carbon footprint. Our disciplined and phased approach will enable us to decarbonize our assets, grow earnings and keep CapEx within D&A across the cycle. Closing on Slide 10. Dow remains focused on advancing our long term strategy, while navigating challenging short term market dynamics. We're proactively reducing costs and maximizing cash flow, while maintaining a broad focus on financial flexibility and operating discipline. The actions we've taken since spin to strengthen our balance sheet and improve our cash generation profile are enabling us to be more resilient as we deliver on our capital allocation priorities across the economic cycle. As a result, we have raised our underlying earnings above pre pandemic levels, substantially improved our three year cumulative free cash flow, reduced our net debt and pension liabilities by more than $10 billion and delivered around 84% of net income back to our shareholders since spin, well above our target of 65% across the economic cycle. At the same time, our diverse, differentiated and global product portfolio is well positioned to capture the above GDP demand growth across our attractive market verticals. With increasing customer demand for more sustainable and circular solutions, we'll continue to advance our Decarbonize and Grow and Transform the Waste strategies, which will raise our earnings profile, reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and create a more circular economy. With that, I'll turn it back to Pankaj to open the Q&A. Pankaj Gupta : Thank you, Jim. Now let's move on to your questions. I would like to remind you that our forward-looking statements apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. Operator, please provide the Q&A instructions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Vincent Andrews : Thank you, and good morning everyone. Wondering if you could just give us a little bit more color perhaps by region in packaging, especially plastics for the third quarter? That $50 million headwind you see on a net basis between the higher feedstock costs and the lower average pricing. How do those dynamics play out in in each region? Jim Fitterling : Good morning, Vince. Great question. Packaging, especially plastics was strong in all four regions of the world. We saw volume increases in all four of them. And we saw overall the biggest volume increases across all the businesses in P&SP for the quarter. In terms of the $50 million headwind, obviously, June closed out a little bit softer on pricing. North American price has settled down $0.03 in June. And that's because you've had some new capacity that came online during that time. Inventories came down actually during the month of June. I think, which is a reflection of the strength in China, also India, also exports to Mexico. All three of those regions are relatively strong. Asia Pacific and Latin America led in terms of volume. And, obviously, Europe was the weakest of the three -- of the four regions. So my expectations is, while feedstocks have come up a bit in North America, a lot of that is really due to the hot weather that we've had and ethane staying in natural gas. The projection is that, that will continue through the third quarter, but if the weather breaks, then obviously we'll see some of that come out. But our expectation is, we'll start with that lower pricing in July, and then we've got actions out there in July of up $0.03 up $0.05 for August. And as we speak, Asia is increasing about $20 to $30 a metric ton in July. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. David Begleiter : Thank you. Good morning. Jim, staying on the $50 million decline in feedstocks and pricing. Looking at Integrated margins, that would suggest it would be worse than down $50 million. So what are you doing to offset the perhaps the greater headwinds in at least consultant margins versus your forecast down $50 million? Thank you. Jim Fitterling : Good morning, David. Look on integrated margins for the second quarter, I think they ended slightly higher than where we were in the first quarter. And that was good news in North America. Our expectation is that, they will improve in Europe in the third quarter. And obviously, the pressure that's been on here in North America has really been from the feedstock cost. And as I mentioned, I think there's -- it's hard to project how long the feedstock costs are going to stay where they are. We know new capacity coming in both natural gas liquids and in frac capacity. And so, that's going to mean there's plenty of ethane available. There's more than 750,000 barrels a day of ethane in rejection today. I think some of it stayed in rejection because natural gas demand has been so strong because of the warm weather, but it doesn't take much for that to turn, and there will be an incentive to break that out. Frac spreads are good right now. I also think that inventories on NGLs are above the five year average, about 15% above that five year average, even with this warmer weather. And that's a reflection of record natural gas productions, we've had record ethane production in the year so far. And so, while that seems like we've got cost pressures coming at us. The reality is, those things can be very dynamic, and they can change during the quarter. Exports continue to be strong. We continue to see month-over-month and quarter-over-quarter improvements in ability to move exports out our experience with China, even though China is relatively slower from a GDP growth standpoint than previous years. It's still in the 4.5% to 5% GDP range, which is relatively good. And we've been able to move good volume into China. Howard Ungerleider : And Dave, in terms of what additional tailwinds are there to help compensate or offset some of those headwinds that you talked about. A big chunk of it, we continue to ramp our marine pack cargo and our shipments, so you should expect sequential volume growth in P&SP from Q2 to Q3. And then also it's a self-help that the team delivered in the second quarter. I mean, if you look at all of the -- at a high level from an enterprise perspective, a big chunk, if not, almost all of the delta of sequential improvement came from the self-help and the interventions. And so, at the end of June, we had about 75% of those 2,000 roles and either enterprise level numbers exit. And so, I mean to think about half of that is impacted in P&SP. So the self-help and interventions will also be a tailwind sequentially for P&SP. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Hassan Ahmed of Alembic Global Advisors. Please go ahead. Hassan Ahmed : Good morning, Jim and Howard. Just wanted to sort of ask a quick question around the supply addition side of things : ethylene, polyethylene specifically. There have been some rumblings in the press about China potentially considering rationalizing inefficient facilities. So what are your thoughts around that and also around the pace of capacity additions given the macro the way it is? Jim Fitterling : Good morning, Hassan. Look, I think if you look over the near term, the pace of capacity additions versus demand increases is really going to be that short. I mean, most of the capacity is on now. And so, I think that's what leading to obviously some of the pricing pressure that we've seen. But the volume growth is there. And so, as that volume growth increases, we're going to see that eat up on that capacity relatively quickly. On China, obviously, China has had the benefit from a NAFTA standpoint, China has moved into a better cost position than Europe. Obviously, Europe snapped the crack. Cost position has become higher. But China has moved in to a better cost position, and so that means they've been able to supply more domestically. And still we've been able to export out of the US to supplement that because the US has an overall lower cost position. So I think there's obviously pressure on high cost producers. There's plenty of methanol available today, but MTO producers aren't really running, which I think speaks to the NAFTA advantage there. And then I think if you look at the industry capacity, about a quarter of the industry capacity is greater than 40 years old. And if you think about assets that are high carbon footprint, assets that are in high cost position, those are highly suspect, and they're going to be under pressure. I haven't seen any announcements to shut down, but I think usually those things lag a little bit. My expectation is that, polyethylene typically holds up the best through an economic slowdown, that continues to be true today. Our cost advantage and our feedstock cost advantage with our flexibility is showing through in the results. We're seeing that even in Europe where we're cracking more LPGs right now, maxing out on LPGs, and that improves our European position. And I think that's going to carry through the back half of the year. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Jeff Zekauskas : Thanks very much. Two part question. Can you comment on sequential MDI price trends in the United States? And, secondly, you bought back $250 million in shares So that's maybe about 5 million shares, but your shares went up 2 million sequentially, and you have them flat for the third quarter. So what's the magnitude of share issuance this year? Jim Fitterling : Yeah. I'll take a look at MDI and then I'll have Howard get the share buyback part of that. Look, on MDI, I think things are in relatively good position. We've seen MDI continue to be relatively strong in the market where MDI impact, obviously, automotive has continued to be strong. Where we've seen demand down is obviously in durable goods like appliances. And so, that has in some systems offering there that has put some pressure on prices. I think we are in the process of starting up MDI distillation down in Freeport, which is an expansion off of the La Porte capacity, but allows us to retire the La Porte asset. And so, I think relatively speaking, MDI is holding up relatively well. And I think from a supply demand balance standpoint, our expectation is that, some of the capacity that\u2019s been announced out there is going to come on later than expected. And I think that's going to offer a little bit tighter operating rates than what the industry analysts might be predicting. Howard Ungerleider : Yes, Jeff. Good morning. Look, this is Howard. On the share count issue, good eyes, what I\u2019d say is, look, in the first quarter because we had a GAAP loss in the period, we had to use the basic share count, not the diluted share count. All else equal, it would have been [711] (ph) if you were doing an apples to apples in Q1. In Q2, we opportunistically repurchased $250 million worth or 5 million shares. And what we continue to say is, we're going to buy back at least a dilution, and we will continue to be opportunistic. So I mean, I would say you should at least expect another $125 million of stock buyback in Q3. In terms of what\u2019s left on the program, we've got $1.7 billion left on the current open share repurchase program. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Mike Sison of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Mike Sison : Hey, guys. Good morning. Your volumes are down 8% in 2Q. I think it's the fourth quarter of [indiscernible] it sounds like third quarter will be down as well. Are you seeing any bottoming in any of your end markets? And do you think the volumes in the second half will maybe improve on a year-over-year basis at some point? Jim Fitterling : Good morning, Mike. Good question. Volumes were down 8%, obviously, Europe was off 14%, so that's a pretty significant part of that volume being down. Asia Pacific and Latin America volumes were stronger, and so they've held up relatively well. North America has been relatively flat about 1% on volume. So I think you can see, obviously, the pressure on Europe showing up in some of those markets. In terms of the look at the macro economy, my feeling is this, we know we're in a global economic slowdown. It really started mid last year. We saw GDP decline through the back half of last year. We saw a little spike up in Q1 of this year, but it's been down in Q2. And the expectation is, it'll be down in Q3 and Q4. I think it's setting up for a ramp back in 2024. People ask a lot of times, are we in a recession? I think we'll determine if we're in a recession or not when we look in the rearview mirror. But the leading indicators, the destocking that happened in the fourth quarter and into the first quarter appears to be over inventories are in relatively good control. MEG ethylene glycol typically leads into a slowdown. We saw that happen last year and, obviously, it led into this slowdown. And then a lagging indicator into a slowdown is caustic and chlorine, both sides of the electrochemical unit. Obviously, we saw a time where chlorine demand was relatively strong and caustic demand was relatively strong. Then we saw caustic fall off, but chlorine stay high. And now we see both caustic and chlorine fall off. And that's a lagging indicator that you're into a slowdown. So I would say all the indicators say we're in it right now. And it feels to me like third, fourth quarters are going to be that low point, and then we start to ramp back from there. And with the Fed seem to be nearing the ending of rate increases, a little bit of green shoots in housing, people moving back into the housing market. I think there is some areas to be optimistic for 2024. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy of Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead. Kevin McCarthy : Yes. Good morning. Jim, with regards to your industrial intermediates segment, can you speak to some of the actions that you're taking there in terms of propylene oxide and your kind of two way resupply arrangements with [Olin] (ph) on-site there. And then more broadly, maybe as a follow-up to Mike's question, you're guiding 3Q a little bit lower. Do you think you're at or near an earnings bottom in 3Q in Industrial Intermediates or how would you frame that in terms of the bigger picture cycle there? Jim Fitterling : Good morning, Kevin. Good questions. Let me just break it up into polyurethanes and construction chemicals or the industrial solutions and look at them differently. In polyurethanes and construction chemicals, we've been overweight propylene oxide and underweight isocyanates for some time. So you see what's happening with the asset moves have been trying to right size a bit on PO and exit the merchant market PO business. And that's what has been announced so far. And then also increase the MDI distillation capacity in Freeport, which is what we're doing and retiring the La Porte asset. I think that balances us out better with the growth in polyurethanes, which is in the downstream systems businesses where we make higher value. And so, I think you'll continue to see us do that. In terms of the Olin relationship, we've completed the negotiation of a series contracts in the US Gulf Coast that extends now through 2035, which means that the value and the sustainability and that integrated economics for both parties remain in place. And we're going to continue to supply ethylene, energy and site services to Olin, in the US Gulf Coast and Germany. So STADA is the site primarily affected there. We're going to Olin is going to continue to supply us chlorine and sell ethylene for the PO businesses in Plaquemann and also chlorine to the MDI assets in Freeport. I feel good about the working relationship with Olin. I think we've continued to manage this well, and I think we both understand that the best value for each company is to continue to work together and keep that integrated economics alive. In terms of industrial intermediates, I would say it has been growing well. Our focus there is to continue to invest in downstream alkoxylates means to support the growth in things like home and personal care, areas like low BOC solvents for the paints and coatings industries, the intermediates for the agricultural sector. And, obviously, all of the higher value derivatives that we make that go in pharma applications and energy, think oil and gas and gas treatment, gas scrubbing, all which have great growth drivers. And to deemphasize our exposure to ethylene glycol, which is commodity. And most people probably won't remember when we did the deal with ME Global. We still had a couple of assets here that made ethylene glycol. Longer term, it doesn't make sense for us to make ethylene glycol and small scale assets. So we'll move to purified EO only assets for industrial intermediates. And then all the higher value downstream and really emphasize the specialty side of that business versus the commodity. And I do think the additional drag in the quarter of the fact that ag intermediates were very slow in second quarter because of the hot weather, farmers did not spray in the second quarter, so they missed the whole spray of crops. That's a pretty significant volume on II&I intermediate capacity, and that's really why you saw the drag on them. I do feel like with housing and construction being at the bottom right now, I do think you can say we're at the bottom in that space. And I think things will look optimistic as we moved in -- more optimistic as we move into 2024. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Frank Mitch of Fermium Research. Please go ahead. Frank Mitch : Hey. Good morning. A clarification and a question, Jim. Just to clarify, your expectation is that we're going to see ethane pricing come back down more in balance with where natural gas is in the relatively near term. Is that correct? And then secondly, Sadara has been impacted by planned maintenance and the macros, the less couple of quarters. So can you give us some outlook on what your expectations are for Sadara in the back half? Jim Fitterling : Good morning, Frank. Yes. Look, I think ethane supply is going to continue to increase. There's about 15% of additional supply coming on the 2023, 2024 time frame, and there's 700,000 barrels a day in rejection today with -- this is after the start-up of new assets. So I think the supply is there. I think some of it is obviously been left in the gas because you've had really strong fuel demand for natural gas with the heat in the United States. That has put a big pull on base load power, which today in the US is very dependent on natural gas. I think some of that will come off. You're seeing storage, I think, it's going to hit its peak before the winter season comes. And so, I think as we see some moderation in the weather I think you're going to see potential for ethane pricing to come off. On Sadara, you're right, they had a couple of turnarounds that impacted the results. And, of course, they have a strong exposure to Asia Pacific. They have a very good cost position. So with them back online now and fully operating. And with the demand in Asia continued to be strong, remember, India has GDP rates above 7%. I think you'll see that Sadara will come back a bit in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter. Howard Ungerleider : Yes. Frank, I would also just add that Sadara, just like Dow with self-help, they have a number of structural and operational improvements underway, including some product mix enhancements to increase margins and then their own cost intervention. So you should start to see that build through the back half of the year as well. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Dan Rizzo : Good morning. This is Dan Rizzo on for Laurence. Just in terms of free cash flow conversion, it's obviously very high now, but I was wondering how we should think about it over the next few years given what you're expecting in terms of the new projects you've kind of went through during the call. Jim Fitterling : Howard, do you want to take that one? Howard Ungerleider : Yes. I mean, thanks for pointing that out. I mean, our second quarter trailing 12 month cash conversion was 98%. And really the team is doing a great job on working capital management. We also got some dividends from our JVs and just an overall continued focus on cash flow. I would not expect 98% going forward. Over the long run, an 80% cash conversion is a good number. Obviously, during periods of low macroeconomic activity, that number will be high because we tend to release working capital dollars. So a 90% number in the bottom of the cycle probably a 70% number at the top of the cycle and then using 80% kind of as a normalized conversion is probably in line. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Duffy Fischer : Yes. Good morning. If you could, on your Slide 6, just walk through each of the segments on the top line guide sequentially. Roughly, what are you looking volume versus price within those ranges? Jim Fitterling : Good morning, Duffy. Well, obviously, on the on the top line, I think sales, obviously, are going to be down about 5% on the high side. It could be down as much as 9%. I think you're going to see -- obviously, we talked a lot about feedstocks and packaging, especially plastics, that'll be one element. We have the one time related items from second quarter to third quarter that won't repeat on licensing, so that's about a $100 million. Cost savings is about $50 million to the positive. And then we just finished -- we just have the turnaround at the cracker St. Charles, which is a $100 million. So I'd say on price, volume -- my expectation is, volume is going to continue to move as we've seen in the second quarter. We have advantaged cost positions around the world and we're taking advantage of that. They're running at high rates and we're able to export. And so, we're going to take advantage of that in the third quarter, and then we're going to navigate the price and, obviously, the headwinds that we have on raw material. I would say the team's already shifting on flexibility. We've got butane in some cases and propane back in the slate in some areas to mitigate some of the higher ethane costs. If you look at II&I, obviously, the big impact will be the loss of capacity out of glycol in Plaquemann. So that'll be a $100 million headwind. That's partly lost margin on those sales and partly the cost of rebuilding the asset and getting it back operational. Cost savings and maintenance activities are actually about a $40 million tailwind. And then we'll continue to see how demand holds up. Automotive demand has been relatively good, but housing and construction has been relatively weak on the polyurethane side. Performance Materials and Coatings, I think volumes are going to hold up well. The price pressure in siloxanes has been the biggest headwind there. Although it's flattened and if it maintains flat, then we may not see as much of a headwind there. Cost savings and lower plan maintenance activity are about a $60 million tailwind for them. So on PM&C, I'd say the other seasonal impact will be a slower seasonal return to kind of a normal seasonal outlook for coatings, because architectural coatings have been relatively weaker. Industrial coatings have been strong, but architectural coatings compared to last year have been relatively weaker. That's kind of the outlook on all three. I'd expect at the high end, all three of them will be down, primarily due to price not so much on volume. And then as obviously demand returns, we'll start to see some pricing power come back in. Howard Ungerleider : Duffy. Look, I would just say at a very high level, if you think about it -- if you take a step back at the enterprise and think about what we're trying to guide to. It really is on an operating basis, essentially flat sequentially. You've got our self-help, which we're guiding $100 million increase in cost savings. We expect that that will be eaten up by the margin compression that Begleiter talked about that the third party indices are projecting. And then that leaves you with $150 million of stuff that either happened in the second quarter that won't recur. So the project driven licensing sales from the innovation, we're not -- we don't expect another $100 million in the third quarter although the team continues to work on additional licensing and then the $50 million turnaround headwind at an enterprise level, which is net. And so, that's operationally flat. And then, of course, we're still -- we've got to repair and restore the Plaquemines glycol plant, as Jim said. So we're guiding on that $100 million kind of a one-time impact on margin on lost sales and then the cost to rebuild and recommission and get that return to operations. That's a preliminary number and as we learn more through the root cause investigation and the implementation plan to get restart and we'll give a further update. Operator : Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Christopher Parkinson of Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead. Christopher Parkinson : Great. Thank you so much. I just wanted to hit back on Slide 9, if I may. Just given the outlook for the CapEx versus D&A and some of the comments on Alberta, can you just hit on any incremental thoughts you'd have on buyback activity in the second half of the year? Dividend growth throughout that period in terms of the current coverage ratio. Just what are the kind of the puts and takes and how your thought process entering the 2024 through 2027 period? Thank you so much. Jim Fitterling : Howard, do you want to hit view on buybacks? Howard Ungerleider : Yes. Look. We're going to continue to be opportunistic. As we think about the back half, I would say we're going to have my mindset, our mindset, which is, what I think I gave the answer on Jeff's question. $125 million, that's our estimate for dilution. So all things equal, we're going to cover dilution each quarter of Q3 and then Q4. We're going to continue to be opportunistic as we have the free cash flow and the Dow team has done an exceptional job on working capital and just managing cash in a much tighter way. Remember, that was one of the big changes we decided together as leadership team to make it spin is that, every P&L leader will also have their own balance sheet and also their own cash flow statement. So every single leader in our company that manages a P&L now manages the cash flow and that rolls up to the one that Jim and I and the leadership team are responsible for. They've been doing a phenomenal job. 98% cash conversion. So we did $250 million of stock buyback in Q2. And so, you could see that similar kind of number potentially in Q3, and we'll see in Q4. The other thing -- and I don't think we touched on it in this call, but we've talked about in the past is, look, we continue every year since spin, we've had about $1 billion or more of what I would call unique to Dow cash flow interventions or levers. Structural working capital is $200 million to $300 million. Our tax team continues to do a great job around the world. We're looking at any cash that we can potentially extract from our joint ventures, just as several examples. So we also have the Nova litigation, which is several $100 million that we fully expect to win in, I would say, the final round of that Canadian litigation. So there's another $1 billion out there over the next 12, 18 months. And as we get that money and we have the room, we will continue to be even more opportunistic on stock buyback. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Arun Viswanathan : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the Q2. As far as the Q3 outlook goes, it looks like you mentioned still sluggish markets in China [indiscernible] recovery there. Would you call out that as really the main driver of when we can expect things to get better. That is, should we looking mainly for an improvement in China that would help lower the days across many of your segments and signal better demand? Or what do you think are the main drivers of improving volume from here? Jim Fitterling : Good morning, Arun. Look, I think China, even though it's slower than what we are expecting is still relatively good in global GDP. I mean, 4.5% to 5% global GDP and the second largest economy in the world is pretty good. And India has been greater than 7% and Mexico has been strong, and we're well positioned to serve all those markets, and we're seeing that as we increase the exports. And obviously, both China and India still need higher-value functional polymers, which are a highly profitable part of what we export from the US Gulf Coast. So I feel good about that. I don't think it's totally just dependent on China improving. I also think it's dependent on things like housing starting to improve again in North America and the European economy coming back. So energy costs have come down in Europe. Natural gas, LNG prices in Europe have kind of flattened around [$10 a million] (ph) BTU, which is a lot of relief from where they've been, obviously, still much more expensive than United States, which is in the three handle on natural gas, but still much, much improved. And so, I think a lot will depend on the European economy coming back, which has been under a ton of pressure. And of course, we have a lot of exposure in Europe. About 30% of our footprint is in Europe, and it's most heavily in polyurethanes and construction chemicals. And then I think in North America, we look in for housing to take a step back, which has started to show some positive signs on new permits and mortgage applications. I think high rents and lack of supply on the housing market are leading to more people thinking about moving in. There's some other bright spots in the economy that I think are coming. We had all the passage of the infrastructure bill, the inflation Reduction Act, the CHIPS Act, which are meant to have a big impact, obviously, here in the United States. But there's a lag between the passage of those bills and the capital spend that goes along with it. We've already seen in areas like wire and cable for telecommunications and high-voltage transmission. We've already seen very strong demand with our downstream customers. And I don't think that's going to back off. So you see that demand already. The return to travel has meant that aerospace production, plane production is back up. You see that in the coatings sector, especially those that have exposure to coatings for the aerospace industry. Obviously, automotive continues to be relatively strong and stronger than last year. Heavy machinery continues to be strong because in a lot of parts of the world, we need to increase mining to keep up with the metals that we need to make this happen. And then automation, we don't talk about it much, but with inflation on wages, many companies are looking more to AI, machine learning and automation of existing manufacturing to get productivity out of manufacturing. So if you're thinking about components that are going into controls and automation and either new construction of new manufacturing lines or revamping existing ones, those companies have pretty big backlogs right now. So I think as housing picks up, it's going to pick up construction and it's going to pick up consumer durables, which had been weak all year really since mid-last year. And I think we look at that to be kind of the indicator of the turn. That will be an indicator in China. That will be an indicator here in North America as well. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Cunningham of Citigroup. Please go ahead. Patrick Cunningham : Hi. Good morning. Price declines in PM&C continue to be fairly substantial. How do you expect demand and trends for the balance of the year? And what are your sort of expectations for new siloxane capacity in 2023? Jim Fitterling : Good morning. Good questions on PM&C. Let's just take a look at 2023. In Consumer Solutions, which is primarily silicones and some of the higher end of Dow Industrial Solutions that goes into those applications. The two areas that are a little bit slower than last year in terms of growth, are electronics and mobility, they're up this year, but not to the same extent as last year. And then commercial buildings are relatively flat. Industrial is slightly up. Home and Personal Care is up. And so, that's driven the demand. But when you think about electronics and mobility and construction, those are the biggest volume uses, and I think that's what's put the pressure on as well as the siloxanes capacity in China. In coatings and monomers, the strongest parts of the sector right now are automotive and I think liquid applied sound dampening for undercarriage cars and road marking applications. So infrastructure builds are really driving the volume increases there. Architectural is off, but it's off by a couple of percent. And obviously, the contractor business has come back where during COVID, it was mostly do-it-yourself business. So we've got good dynamics, I think, starting to happen in the contractor side. The paper business has been off, paper coatings have been off year-over-year. I think on siloxanes capacity coming in, in 2022, we saw about 450,000 tons of new soloxanes capacity added. I'd say, in 2023, you've got probably in that range of about 300,000 tons and then beyond 2024 and beyond, you've probably got another 300,000 tons that comes out beyond that time frame. So I think you're looking at kind of the trough on siloxanes right now and maybe a little bit into 2024 and then the demand will start to eat that up. Operator : Thank you. And we have time for one more question from the line of Josh Spector of UBS. Please go ahead. Josh Spector : Yes. Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in. Just a quick one on the cost savings. So I guess, if I look at Slide 7, it looks like really 3Q was maybe the last large tranche of sequential step-up. I guess, is that right? So fourth quarter has much lower step up? And can you just remind us what we should be expecting there into 2024? Thanks. Jim Fitterling : Yes. I think when we looked at the guide for the third quarter, there's $100 million step-up from second quarter. So that will be on a year-over-year basis, about $350 million of cost saves. And I think fourth quarter is going to be in that $300 million to $350 million as well. So two-thirds of the $1 billion, $650 million to $700 million comes out in the back half of this year. Obviously, there's some sequential carryover into next year. So you got about $150 million in the first quarter of next year from the sequential carryover. So the kind of the year-over-year and first quarter will be a step up as well. And those are the spending impacts and then obviously, the businesses are all working on margin improvement within their portfolios. And then Howard mentioned, in addition to the $1 billion of cost saves, we're working on $1 billion of cash levers, unique to Dow cash levers. And I think he just outlined them on the previous question. So I'd say, net-net, we're focusing on cash, both on the cost side and on the cash levers where we can liberate some cash and also improving mix within the businesses and taking advantage of our low-cost positions and running those assets are and then trimming on the high-cost side where we can to set ourselves up for the ramp-up in 2024. Operator : There are no further questions at this time, I please turn the call over to Pankaj Gupta for closing remarks. Pankaj Gupta : Yes. Thanks, everyone, for joining our call, and we appreciate your interest in Dow. For your reference, a copy of our transcript will be posted on our website within about 48 hours or so. This concludes our call. Thank you once again. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

I will now turn the call over to Dow Investor Relations, Vice President, Pankaj Gupta. Mr. Gupta, you may begin. Pankaj Gupta : Good morning. Thank you for joining today. The accompanying slides are provided through this webcast and posted on our website. I'm Pankaj Gupta, Dow Investor Relations, Vice President; and joining me are Jim Fitterling, Dow's Chair and Chief Executive Officer; and Howard Ungerleider, President and Chief Financial Officer. Please note our comments contain forward-looking statements and are subject to the related cautionary statements contained in the earnings news release and slides. Please refer to our public filings for further information about principal risks and uncertainties. Unless otherwise specified, all financials, where applicable, exclude significant items. We will also refer to non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures are contained in the earnings news release and slides that are posted on our website. On Slide 2, you will see the agenda for our call. Jim will review our third quarter results and operating segment performance. Howard will provide an update on our cost savings actions and financial position and share our outlook and modeling guidance. To close, Jim will outline how our long-term growth and sustainability roadmap continues to enable value creation as we navigate challenging short-term dynamics. Following that, we will take your questions. Now let me turn the call over to Jim. Jim Fitterling : Thank you, Pankaj. Beginning on Slide 3. For the third quarter, we continued to advance our long-term strategy while also taking action to reduce costs and maximize cash generation in the face of slow global macroeconomic activity and higher sequential feedstock costs. In particular, we continue to implement targeted actions to deliver $1 billion in cost savings in 2023 and delivered a sequential improvement to operating cash flow of more than $300 million. Net sales were $10.7 billion, down 24% versus the year ago period reflecting declines in all operating segments due to slower global macroeconomic activity. Sales were down 6% sequentially as volume gains were more than offset by lower local prices. Volume decreased 6% year-over-year, mainly due to lower merchant Hydrocarbons and Energy sales. Volume was up 1% sequentially, led by gains in Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure and Performance Materials & Coatings. Volume was up 3% sequentially, excluding merchant sales and Hydrocarbons & Energy with gains across all operating segments. Local price decreased 18% year-over-year with declines in all operating segments and regions, primarily due to lower feedstock and energy costs. Sequentially, price was down 7%, primarily in Europe, the Middle East, Africa and India or EMEAI. Operating EBIT for the quarter was $626 million, down from $1.2 billion in the year ago period and $885 million in the prior quarter. Our consistent focus on cash flow generation and working capital management enabled team Dow to generate cash flow from operations of $1.7 billion, resulting in a cash flow conversion of 129% for the quarter and 103% on a trailing 12-month basis. We continue to invest in our long-term strategic priority while also returning $617 million to shareholders in the quarter through dividends and share repurchases. Year-to-date, we've returned nearly $2 billion to shareholders. Our cash flow generation continues to enable Dow to fully cover its capital allocation priorities. And our balance sheet remains the best it has been in four decades, supported by strong investment-grade credit ratings with no substantive long-term debt maturities due until 2027. Now turning to our operating segment performance on Slide 4. In the Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment, operating EBIT was $476 million compared to $785 million in the year ago period. Local price declines were driven by lower polyethylene and olefin prices in all regions, primarily as a result of lower global energy costs. Volume declined as increased polyethylene demand across all regions was more than offset by lower volumes in merchant hydrocarbons and energy sales. Sequentially, operating EBIT decreased by $442 million, driven by lower integrated polyethylene margins, increased planned maintenance activity and lower licensing revenue. Moving to the Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure segment, operating EBIT was $21 million compared to $167 million in the year ago period. Results were driven by lower prices and demand in both businesses as well as reduced supply availability due to an unplanned event in Industrial Solutions at our Louisiana operations. Sequentially, operating EBIT was up $56 million driven by volume gains and lower costs, which were partly offset by the Louisiana event. And in the Performance Materials & Coatings segment, operating EBIT was $179 million compared to $302 million in the year ago period, driven by local price declines in both businesses. Volume was down as gains in commercial building and construction end markets were more than offset by lower demand for personal care and coatings applications and residential construction. Sequentially, operating EBIT increased $113 million, driven by higher operating rates and cost savings. Next, I'll turn it over to Howard to review our outlook and actions on Slide 5. Howard Ungerleider : Thank you, Jim. We expect the challenging macroeconomic dynamics to continue through the fourth quarter, including sluggish industrial activity. Global Manufacturing PMI has declined for the 13 consecutive month in September. It also includes weak demand in Europe and a slower-than-expected recovery in China. While inflation continues to moderate, it remains at elevated levels, resulting in a continuation of a tighter monetary policy. In the U.S., we're seeing some mixed indicators as September manufacturing PMI improved to 49.8. Retail sales growth remains positive, while consumer confidence has declined for the last two months. In Europe, industrial and consumer demand remains weak despite sharply lower inflation. PMI has contracted for 15 consecutive months through September, and consumer confidence remains low. With that said, automotive demand is showing signs of resilience. In China, while manufacturing PMI remained in expansionary territory in September, China exports fell for the fifth straight month. Automotive sales and production are a bright spot, rising in August, both sequentially and over the prior year in September. Around the rest of the world, India's manufacturing PMI remains expansionary, while in Mexico, industrial production rose for more than 20 months in August. However, ASEAN manufacturing PMI contracted for the first time in two years in September. Against this macroeconomic backdrop, we will continue to take a disciplined approach to managing our operations while leveraging our diverse global portfolio and our cost-advantaged assets. Turning to Slide 6. Our commitment to financial and operational discipline continues to be reflected in the proactive actions we are implementing to lower our costs and maximize cash flow. We achieved $700 million in cost savings year-to-date and remain on track to deliver our $1 billion commitment in 2023. In addition, we are further enhancing our financial flexibility as we execute on our capital allocation priorities across the economic cycle. For example, we're implementing continued actions to improve our working capital to maximize cash flow. As a result, our cash conversion cycle has improved by approximately eight days from pre-COVID levels and we have unlocked approximately $600 million of cash from working capital in the third quarter. Since Spin, we have taken actions to strengthen our balance sheet, ensuring ample liquidity while reducing net debt and pension liabilities, and we are continuing to take actions to further derisk our pension plans. Now pension-funded status has greatly improved, driven primarily by changes in the discount rate and the $1 billion voluntary contribution we made in 2021. Our decision to freeze the U.S. deferred benefit plans at year-end '23 further reduced the pension liability. We expect to pursue additional derisking opportunities for our pension plans in the fourth quarter, including annuitization and risk transfer of some pension liabilities. If these transactions are executed, we expect to record a onetime noncash and nonoperating settlement charge in the range of $500 million to $1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2023. All in, our targeted actions have given us the ability to continue investing in growth while delivering more than 80% of operating income back to our shareholders, well above our 65% target. Turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter on Slide 7. In the Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment, industry data shows a continued decline in U.S. Gulf Coast inventory levels driven by resilient domestic demand and export market strength. Higher polyethylene prices and elevated oil to gas spreads continue to favor our cost advantaged footprint and are expected to generate $100 million tailwind in the quarter. Additionally, we expect a $25 million tailwind as we complete planned maintenance activity at our cracker in St. Charles, Louisiana. We also expect a $50 million headwind to equity earnings due to a planned turnaround at our joint venture in Thailand. In the Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure segment, we expect seasonal demand increases in deicing fluid to offset seasonal volume declines in building and construction end markets. Additionally, we expect a headwind of $25 million due to elevated energy and feedstock costs, particularly in Europe impacting our polyurethanes and our construction chemicals businesses. In the Performance Materials & Coatings segment, we expect the current macroeconomic conditions to limit consumer discretionary spending in nonservice areas. We also expect margin pressure to continue in upstream siloxanes from competitive supply additions, which will result in a $25 million headwind. Additionally, the seasonal decline in building and construction demand is expected to contribute an approximately $50 million headwind in the quarter. All in, we expect fourth quarter earnings to be in line with the third quarter. Next, I'll turn it back to Jim. Jim Fitterling : Thank you, Howard. Moving to Slide 8. We continue to make progress on both our Decarbonize and Grow, and Transform the Waste strategies which by 2030, position us to deliver more than $3 billion in underlying earnings while reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 5 million metric tons and commercializing 3 million metric tons of circular and renewable solutions annually. Starting with decarbonize and grow. In September, we achieved startup of a new MDI distillation and pre-polymer facility at our manufacturing site in Freeport, Texas. This new facility replaces Dow's existing capacity in La Porte, Texas, and expand supply by an additional 30% at the site to support high-value demand growth in polyurethane systems while also reducing our greenhouse gas emissions by more than 45% compared to the La Porte asset. Our Path2Zero project in Alberta remains on track. We expect the final investment decision by year-end, pending completion of our subsidies and incentives with the Canadian federal government. Additionally, we recently announced a solar power purchase agreement with MSU Green Energy in Bah\u00eda Blanca, Argentina, which will drive the site to source 75% of its electric power supply from renewable sources by 2025. In Terneuzen, the Dutch government informed us that they need more time for adjustments to certain rules and regulations critical to enabling carbon capture and clean hydrogen. The public private partnership is a crucial element of our Path2Zero effort at Terneuzen. Dow investment and timing will depend on the level of collaboration, subsidies available and a clear regulatory framework. We will continue to engage with the Dutch government to advance these efforts. And we continue to advance our Transform the Waste strategy, in the third quarter, we successfully leveraged our U.S. Gulf Coast assets for bio and circular feedstock processing, accomplishing a key milestone to utilize existing assets to quickly scale production of recycled and bio-based products. This was a direct enabler to the commercial launch of our sustainable Surlyn ionomers, which support high-end applications like perfume and cosmetics packaging. In addition, Valoregen in France and Mura technology in the U.K. remain on track to start up their respective mechanical and advanced recycling facilities by year-end. All in, we expect that our initiatives to develop a circular ecosystem will generate more than $500 million of incremental run rate EBITDA by 2030. Altogether, we remain confident in our long-term growth with continued focus on a more sustainable future while maintaining a disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation. Next, an update on our Path2Zero project in Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta, on Slide 9. The project will enable Dow to capture sustainable growth opportunities while also delivering on our 2030 greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets and advancing our long-term goal of carbon neutrality by 2050. Construction is planned to begin next year with Phase 1 start-up expected in 2027 and Phase 2 expected in 2029. We expect to spend an average of $1 billion of CapEx annually on this key growth project with total enterprise CapEx ramping above depreciation and amortization levels in the 2025 to 2027 time period as we implement the first pad. We remain fully committed to keeping our CapEx within DNA across the economic cycle and expect to return to those levels as we complete the project. We are expecting bottom line returns on our Alberta Path2Zero project equal to or better than our Texas 9 investment. Turning to Slide 10. We are partnering with brand owners and leaders across the value chain to strategically enable and scale waste management transformation through mechanical recycling, advanced recycling and bio-based solutions. This allows us to lead the way to a more circular economy and become a major off-taker of circular feedstock while also minimizing capital outlay for Dow. Robust industry demand for these solutions is expected to outpace supply through the end of this decade. We expect Dow's differentiated innovation portfolio to create opportunities that will result in more than $500 million in incremental earnings by 2030. Continuing on Slide 11. Our actions to commercialize 3 million metric tons of circular and renewable solutions annually are driven by a robust pipeline of strategic partnerships. These collaborations enable us to deliver innovative solutions to meet increasing brand owner demand. For example, our partnership with P&G China to enable recyclability of air capsule e-commerce packaging delivers an effective and efficient way to protect products while avoiding excessive packaging. Dow's SPECFLEX CIR foam system uses recycled waste from the automotive industry to produce circular polyurethane-based materials matching the performance of existing products as seen in the recent launch of the Mercedes-Benz E-Class and our collaboration with LVMH Beauty is pioneering circular feedstocks for sustainable packaging and the cosmetics industry. This has enabled Dow's first sales of bio-based and advanced recycling polymers in the third quarter. Closing on Slide 12. Since Spin, we have executed against our strategic priority and consistently demonstrated financial and operational discipline. As a result of our proactive actions, our underlying earnings and cash flow generations are well above pre-COVID levels, and our balance sheet is the strongest it's ever been, especially in this part of the cycle. Our global scale and leading positions across key value chains paired with our cost-advantaged assets and industry-leading feedstock flexibility positioned Dow well to respond quickly to evolving market trends and capture above GDP demand growth across our attractive market verticals. These distinct competitive advantages will continue to enable us to execute our capital allocation priorities while also driving long-term value growth for our shareholders. Finally, before we move to Q&A, I would like to speak to the announcement this morning that Howard is elected to retire from the company following 33 years of dedicated service. I want to personally thank Howard for his significant contributions to Dow over the last three decades. He's been an incredible business and strategic partner, created a financial and leadership team that guided our company through numerous challenges and accomplishments and most importantly, he's been a tremendous colleague and friend. In addition to recognizing and thanking Howard, we are pleased to share that the Board has elected Jeff Tate to the role of CFO effective November 1, 2023. As we thank Howard for his years of service and there will be time to honor and recognize him for that. We're excited to welcome Jeff back to Dow. Many of you will remember, Jeff, who also previously led Dow's Investor Relations team. He returns to us following a 4-year stint as the CFO of Leggett & Platt. Prior to that, Jeff had 27 years with Dow in various finance roles, including VP of Finance for Packaging and Specialty Plastics and was our lead auditor. Jeff is joining us here today, and we'll look forward to him joining our next earnings call in his formal role. In the meantime, more to follow as we all work together through this transition. As I noted, this change will become effective November 1, and Howard will stay on to support the handover through early January when he will formally retire from Dow. Howard, I'll now turn the mic over to you for a few comments. Howard Ungerleider : Thank you, Jim. I really appreciate those comments and thoughts. And I would like to share a few personal thoughts of my own. I've had the good fortune of being Dow's CFO for nearly a decade and President for the last five and they have truly been the best roles of my career. Jim it was an absolute honor to serve with you and the rest of the leadership team. We have accomplished a great deal together and I am extremely proud of not only what we have delivered for all of our stakeholders, but also how we have done it. Dow is a great company. Our decarbonizing growth strategy is absolutely the right path forward and our balance sheet, as you've said, is in the best shape it's been in four decades, and that's as a direct result of our disciplined and balanced capital allocation approach. The Dow culture and the incredibly smart hard-working people who embrace it each and every day all over the world are absolutely second to none. After more than 33 years at Dow, this is the right moment for me to move on to my next chapter, and I could not be more excited to hand the finance reins over to Jeff Tate. Jeff and I have known each other for more than 25 years. We have worked alongside each other, and I consider him to be a great professional as well as a friend, and he is absolutely the right leader to help take down to the next level of performance together with Jim and the leadership team. And while I'm retiring from Dow, I am not heading to the beach of the golf course, I'm excited about my next chapter and the opportunities that lie ahead. With that said, I believe Dow Red, PANTONE 185 for those of you checking the color wheel, and I will always be a supporter a fan and a friend of Team Dow. With that, I'll turn it to Pankaj to open the Q&A. Pankaj Gupta : Thank you, Howard. Now let's move on to your questions. I would like to remind you that our forward-looking statements apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. Operator, please provide the Q&A instructions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Hassan Ahmed of Alembic Global. Your line is open. Hassan Ahmed : Good morning Howard and Jim. Howard, sorry to see you leave. But obviously, wishing you the best wishes for your future sort of endeavors. In terms of my question, you guys obviously talked about $100 million worth of tailwind -- EBIT tailwind on the P&SP side of things. And you cited expanding oil to natural gas ratios. I just want to sort of delve a little deeper into that. What sort of pricing regime for polyethylene are you baking into that? What sort of pricing regime for ethane are you baking into that? Jim Fitterling : Good morning, Hassan. Yes. As we mentioned, we guided for the fourth quarter, in line with the third quarter. It will obviously be a different mix. I expect packaging especially plastics to be up. They had obviously, the weight of the St. Charles turnaround on them in the third quarter. And they also had the fact that we were out of the merchant ethylene market. When you look at the core underlying volumes, polyethylene volumes were up in all regions year-over-year, and they were up sequentially 3% in Asia, Latin America and EMEA. So those are good signs. Things that you should take into account is we obviously don't have the St. Charles turnaround in the fourth quarter. We do have a little bit of a headwind from the Thailand turnaround. We're expecting -- we saw prices up in September. I'm expecting Q4 integrated margins to be up about $0.02 in P&SP, and that's mostly on the back of pricing. The outlook right now is for ethane to be flat. It could be slightly better than that. But I think for right now, we've got it in as flat. We've got inventories down for three consecutive quarters in the United States and plastics, and U.S. Gulf Coast exports were up 7% versus the previous quarter and the previous quarter was up about 3.5% versus a quarter before. So I think all in all, I would expect volumes to be good, we'll be back in the merchant ethylene market for some extent. Pro-Nap spread in Europe is positive at about $120 a ton, and our assets are the lowest cost in Europe. And I think when you factor all that in, the guide for the fourth quarter is heavily on the back of P&SP fee delivery. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. David Begleiter : Thank you. Again, Howard has been an absolute pleasure and best of luck. Jim, Howard, second half EBITDA is running around $5 billion annualized, maybe a little bit more than that. How do you grow -- if the macro stays the same as it is today, how does EBITDA increase materially next year? Jim Fitterling : Good morning, David. Good question. Obviously, we're about 12 to 15 months into this economic slowdown, and typically, when we see a slowdown like we saw starting mid last year, about 12 to 18 months, we start to see things turn to a positive direction. Inflation is the thing that's weighing on people's minds right now. We're continuing to invest in our organic growth, while at the same time, manage our costs. We've got investments in all three segments, both incremental investments as well as new plant investments. They will start up through this year. This year, we expect those add an underlying $400 million to $500 million of EBITDA mid-cycle run rate to the bottom line. On top of that, we're continuing to see strength in areas like telecommunications and data centers, automotive, even in the face of the strikes is holding up relatively well. And our view is that it should bounce back once the agreements are made between the UAW and the auto workers. Our cost positions are good. And so I think that we're positioned that once the weight of inflation starts to moderate that things start to turn back in a positive direction. And our view is that we could be in a better shape for 2024. Additionally, we've taken $1 billion of cost out since Spin. So if you think about where we're operating today, we're able to meet all of our capital allocation requirements, be free cash flow before financing breakeven, you saw a $300 million improvement this quarter in operating cash flows, and we were still able to opportunistically buy back some shares in the third quarter. So we've done our best to really manage to be able to get through the bottom of the cycle, and it's the right time for us to continue to make organic investments to get the benefit in the next up cycle. Howard Ungerleider : And David, this is Howard. Look, thanks for your comments, Hassan, same to you as well. The only other thing I would add, David, to your question is don't forget about cash, right? So I mean Jim laid out our EBITDA or EBITDA improvements, but we have equally been doing cash flow improvements really every year since Spin, if you think about it. So the last five or six years, every year, we've been able to increase cash flow. We'll see if we can do that this year. But a couple of things. We are able to cover all of our capital allocation priorities inclusive of continuing to buy stock back even at these low EBITDA levels. And every year, we've had between $1 billion and $3 billion of what we like to call unique to Dow cash levers. And I would expect that to continue into next year. When you think about the $500 million plus judgment that we will likely get finally from Nova on the last tranche, continued structural working capital improvements, additional cash that we can pursue out of our joint ventures, and other projects that we currently have in the pipeline. So you should expect at least another $1 billion of unique to Dow cash flow levers coming out of next year on top of the organic investments that Jim talked about. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Vincent Andrews : Thank you. And let me also echo the prior remarks and congratulations to you, Howard. Very exciting for you. If I could ask just looking at Slide 9 on the CapEx. I just want to make sure I understand -- I mean, obviously, we know where '23 is, it looks like '24 is going to go to that D&A line. And then that '25 to '27, it looks like there's quite a -- there's sort of a zone there. Could you speak to a little bit of maybe a range that you could give us to make sure we have that right in our models and sort of what would define it at the lower end or the upper end of the range? Because I see you do have Alberta at about $1 billion a year, but is it maybe going to be a bit chunkier in some of those years? Or just how should we be thinking about the cadence and the range of CapEx during that period of time. Jim Fitterling : Hi, good morning. Vince, yes, as we get into the Alberta project, it will be '25 to '27 that is the peak construction of that project. Phase 1 starts up in '27. You would expect that we would get to somewhere in the 3 to 3.5 range for CapEx during that '25 to '27 time frame. That's very similar to where we were during the Gulfstream project, we peaked at kind of that same level. Obviously, we're in a little bit different spot than we were at Gulfstream. We're just doing Alberta Path2Zero, but we're also funding growth in Industrial Solutions, which is high-value growth and downstream incremental growth in our Consumer Solutions business. So, I think it will be very manageable. And as we get closer to those dates, we'll try to titrate more specifically, so that you have some year-over-year expectations on what CapEx is going to look like. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas of JPMorgan. Your line is open. Jeff Zekauskas : Thanks very much. In your $1 billion cost-cutting program, how much of that comes out of SG&A and R&D? And in your slides, you say that your share count in the fourth quarter is 7.10 and in the third quarter, it was7 or 7.5. Are you rounding or is the share count going up? Jim Fitterling : Yes, Jeff, good morning. On the cost, about half of the costs come out of our structural operating cost model, which would include obviously, making sure that we're controlling SG&A, during this time period. It also includes things like contract labor and what we've been doing, there to reduced headcount. On our operating cost side, it's things like purchase raw material and logistics costs, utilities costs being down, our turnaround spend, which is down about $300 million. And while SG&A is down both in cost and as a percent of sales, we're obviously still continuing to invest in research as we go forward. Howard, do you want to touch on the share count? Howard Ungerleider : Yes, Jeff, I was smiling. So yes, it is just purely rounding. The share count actually went down about 2 million shares quarter-on-quarter. Year-on-year, it went down 11 million shares. And I would say two things. We are going to continue as long as we have the free cash flow before financing to continue to buy at dilution. And we will also continue to be opportunistic when we have cash available and/or we believe it's a great investment. And so, we're continuing to buy shares on a regular basis, and you should expect that to continue in the fourth quarter. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Frank Mitch from Fermium. Your line is open. Frank Mitch : Thank you, Howard, hi congrats. Thanks for all the help and friendship over years and certainly looking forward to your next chapter. This - the third quarter was the third quarter in a row of sequentially higher volumes. I was wondering what your expectations are as we finish the year and into 2024? Is this a trend that we can continue to see? Jim Fitterling : Yes. Good morning, Frank, I think on volumes in P&SP, I would still be positive around what we see on polyethylene demand in all the regions, I also mentioned telecommunications and the fact that we've seen a lot of demand in infrastructure, data centers, et cetera. And so, the wire and cable business is one which is very positive. I would say Industrial Solutions will be limited a bit in fourth quarter, because of the outage in Plaquemine. But the demand - other than that, the demand is there once that plant is back up and running. In PM&C, for Consumer Solutions for coatings, you're going to see fourth quarter slowdown, which we typically see with architectural coatings. But other than that, the silicones downstream demand has been holding up pretty well. This is the first quarter that we've seen core, underlying volumes in all three segments better year-over-year. I mean, if you take away merchant ethylene sales in the third quarter, because we were - we had the cracker down in St. Charles, the underlying downstream demand for all three segments was better in the third quarter than it was last year. That's the first time we can say that in several years. So, I'm optimistic with that. We can see the automotive strike resolved, I think we'll see a tick up in that demand as well. China continues to be good. We saw a good quarter-over-quarter demand in China in P&SP, slightly up in polyurethanes quarter-over-quarter, up in Consumer Solutions. And flat to just slightly down in the other two. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Mike Sison of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. This is Richard on for Mike. I was just wondering to follow-up on that, if you could give us some color on where your operating rates are across your segments. Where do you see them for the industry, specifically for polyethylene? And how should we think about the potential improvement in EBITDA, if we do get a stronger demand environment next year, and you can ramp those operating rates up to optimal levels? Thank you. Jim Fitterling : Yes. Just taking a look at - I'll take a look at it both by segments, but I think you also have to take a look at it by regions. In P&SP, you're going to see operating rates substantially north of 80%. And obviously, when you think about Canada, the U.S. Gulf Coast, Argentina, our Middle East assets, all cost advantaged positions, even Terneuzen and Tarragona were Pro-Nap spreads of greater than $100 - $120 a tonight. That advantages them versus their competition within Europe. So, I think you'll see all those operating rates continue to be strong. And we're not building inventory. We're obviously able to meet that and move into the export market. Where you see things a little bit softer, obviously, construction-related segments, so in polyurethanes, which has a pretty heavy European footprint. We see lower operating rates there. We see that as well even on the Gulf Coast. Industrial Solutions, operating rates have been good. Our own issue in Plaquemine is the thing that has that capacity out. And then in Consumer Solutions, on silicones, we tend to see good operating rates in the quarter above 80%. And if you take a look at PM&C, those are slightly down, because of the typical year-end slowdown in demand in coatings. So all in all, I feel good that we're positioned to be able to ramp up, to meet demand as it comes up. Our cost advantaged regions are continuing to run strong, as you would expect. And we're watching closely for the demand signals that will pull us into 2024. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy of Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open. Kevin McCarthy : Yes, good morning. Jim, I'd appreciate your outlook for Dow's construction-facing businesses heading into 2024. Some of the companies that we cover are pointing to meaningful benefits from infrastructure and reshoring-related investments, basically fiscal stimulus. On the other hand, we've got rising rates, and that typically has a chilling effect. So, how do you see those countervailing trends netting out for Dow and affecting the way you're planning for the future? Jim Fitterling : Yes. Good morning, Kevin. The things we watch on construction, obviously, on commercial construction just the completion rates on existing builds and the permit work that's going on new builds. I would say this has been a relatively strong year on commercial because there have been a lot of projects that were in flight. We're starting to see, obviously, some tick up in applications for pyramids on residential for the noncommercial side of things, which is good. But I think as long as there's a question out there on rates and will rates continue to rise, that's going to put a lid on what we'll see on residential construction. In terms of infrastructure, we are seeing some movement in that space. I would say the biggest rate-limiting step on infrastructure is permitting. So, the speed at which people can get permits, whether that's for - it could be for pipelines. It could be for transmission cabling, you name it, but there could be some limitations there, and we keep an eye on that. Overall, I feel good about the fact that we're moving through the toughest phase of it right now. And if we could see some positive growth come back in the construction markets in China and the U.S., that will be a nice upside for us in '24. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Steve Byrne of Bank of America. Your line is open. Steve Byrne : Yes. Thank you. The inventory chart you have on Slide 6 is intriguing. What I'm curious about is, for each of your businesses, do you have a view as to how much your customers have destocked your products relative to their end market demand. And thus, how much of this sequential decline that you've seen 12, 15 months is destocking versus just end market underlying demand weakness. You showed some sequential improvement, in each of your businesses in the third quarter. Is that just destocking coming to an end? Or do you think that this is really some firming demand by your customers? Jim Fitterling : Good morning, Steve, it's a good question. Obviously, we get industry data that we published on the chart that you see there. When it comes to downstream when we get into the consumer brands and the retailer space, we have to go on reported data that we clean out of their public reports. But just a few things to keep in mind. We know in the auto sector, for example, that with the OEMs. It's been pretty much hand to mouth, because there have been other rate-limiting steps like the ability, to get computer chips. We haven't seen a big restocking with the OEMs. We've seen the OEMs continuing to run, because they want to be in a position to ramp up when the strikes get settled. So, I would say, I don't feel like there's a lot of restocking going on there. I would say on the consumer brands and the pharma companies lately seen them, obviously, watching inventory levels. I don't get any sense of any stocking or big destocking going on there. I think it's running more to meet demand. And then, the other thing we take a look at is obviously what's going on with the construction segments, as I just mentioned. But it's a little bit harder. It's a little bit fuzzier when we get into the downstream. We don't have as much published data to rely on. So, we look more at PMI. We look more at retail sales. We look more at, what they comment on in their public filings. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of John McNulty of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. John McNulty : Yes. Thanks for taking my question. And Howard, again, congratulations. You've been a huge help over the years. So, the question would just be on the II&I segment. It came in - it looks like solidly better than kind of what you were expecting when you gave the outlook on the 2Q call. So curious what the factors were that drove it? And I guess, if we back out the operations problem, you're kind of at a $250 million run rate in terms of EBITDA. Is that a reasonable way to think about how you start out looking at 2024? Jim Fitterling : Yes. Good morning, John. On II&I, we obviously saw a strong demand in the energy side, which is Industrial Solutions and the mobility side, which is more the polyurethane side. Durable goods are still lower than they were in the year ago period. We also had a little bit better, because Sadara had had some lower operating rates from some maintenance time and its coming back out of that. So, I think that will continue to be positive upside. There's price pressure, obviously on polyurethanes. We're going to see some positive impact from the new isocyanates capacity down in Freeport, which will be there. The business also did a lot of work on their costs. So their EBITDA was up, because they're also managing their costs. I don't think in fourth quarter, you'll see any higher impact on Plaquemine unplanned event. We saw about $100 million in the third quarter, you'll see that kind of flat to the fourth quarter. And then, the target is to try to get that asset up and running in the second quarter next year. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Josh Spector of UBS. Your line is open. Josh Spector : Yes, hi. Thanks for taking the questions. And want to echo my, congrats to Howard and definitely thank you both of you. So, I just wanted to ask on the siloxane side within PMC, made some comments on kind of some increased pressure there. I mean you've been under pressure in that business all year from added supply. Has anything changed in the last few months? Or is that just a reiteration of what you seen? And as you think about next year, how much did things have to improve for that business to get back to a normal healthy level? Jim Fitterling : Yes. Good morning, Josh. Obviously, in siloxanes, there was significant new capacity in 2022 and 2023, and we expect that to moderate in 2024 and beyond. That's put pressure on siloxanes prices, primarily in Europe or in Asia, which are at the lowest levels that they've been at in quite some time. They're starting to move up, a bit in the fourth quarter, some demand related. Some obviously related to higher silicones pricing, upstream silicon metals pricing, which is kind of moving things up. But I think what you're going to start to see, is that you're going to have less capacity coming on and the downstream market, continues to grow at good rates, and we'll start to absorb some of that and we'll start to see operating rates improve '24, '25. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Cunningham of Citigroup. Your line is open. Patrick Cunningham : Hi. Good morning. On the long-term decarbonization strategy, given the weaker macro and what seems to be some deceleration in appetite to tackle the green transition, how do you think about the risk to public private partnerships subsidies, incentives in North America and abroad? Jim Fitterling : Yes. Good question. Obviously, our view on the Alberta project, is we're working in an environment that's supportive of decarbonization. There's a price on carbon in Canada. There's existing carbon capture infrastructure. And there's obviously, some investment credits for the hydrogen portion of the project. And so, those are all positive. As we mentioned, though, we have to keep in mind that this is also going to be a very low-cost asset from an ethane supply capability standpoint. So that's why we say, our expectation is the returns will be at or above our Texas-9 cracker, which is the best project that we've ever had in our history. Having said that, we always have to keep our eyes wide open to what's going on, on the incentive space. We're not going to build just on the back of incentives. We've got to make sure that we make investments that are long-term, low-cost operating investments where we have advantaged feedstocks, and we have access to market. That's - the same thing is true when we get into circularity projects. And when we talk about our advanced and mechanical recycling projects, we've got to make sure that the partnerships that we have are looking long-term and where they're going to access the waste, will they be the low-cost position and will they have the right access to market. So, we're looking at them project-by-project. We're absolutely convinced that our timing is right on the Alberta project. We get this one final issue nailed down with the Canadian federal government, we should have FID before the end of the year. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Arun Viswanathan : Great. Thanks for taking my question. I'll add my, congrats to you, Howard, definitely a pleasure working with you over the years. I appreciate your insights. Yes, I guess I just had a question on China. Maybe you could just update us on, what you're seeing there. Obviously, very important for most of your markets. You noted that volumes were up across the three businesses year-on-year, if you remove your merchant ethylene sales. But I guess what are you seeing in China? Maybe if you could characterize kind of polyethylene demand, maybe some impacts from - on the consumer side as well as construction that would be great? Thanks - in your outlook. Jim Fitterling : Yes. Good question. I mean obviously, GDP growth this year is expected to be about 5%, that's been on the back of consumer demand, and that's really been the government's position as consumer-driven recovery from the slowdown. Our expectation is, because of what's going on in the housing construction markets, there will be some pressure on the government for some stimulus activity to get things moving there. Manufacturing PMI in September was up, so second consecutive month up, which is good. Automotive sales were up about 9.5% year-over-year in September. EV sales are up about 38% year-to-date. Retail sales were up 5.5% in September, and we saw a rise in the sale of closes and textiles as well as some refined oil products. I would say one of the things that we've always looked at in terms of coming out of a slowdown is the price of MEG. And one of the things that drives the price of MEG, is the operating rate on the polyester plants, which are above 70% right now. We haven't seen that in quite some time. I think it's a little bit early to call that as the turn, but it's something to keep an eye on. And the volume moved quarter-over-quarter are good. Packaging has held up really well. And it typically does in an economic slowdown, because of the nature of food packaging, medical packaging, day-to-day consumer nondurable items. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Duffy Fischer : Yes. Good morning, guys. In both PMC and iCube, if you could walk through, pricing you called out is down sequentially in each of the SBUs, but yet EBITDA was up in both segments sequentially. So could you walk through and just tell us like, where was the spread getting better, because raw materials were falling more than price was down? And how much of that was kind of the structural costs, that you guys are trying to take out that we would put in as kind of permanent? Jim Fitterling : Yes. So - if you look at II&I, the Louisiana outage was obviously a headwind. And then you had some turnaround tailwinds and cost savings, about $40 million. Variable costs on the benzene and propylene side really compress there - and then equity earnings from Sadara were a little bit better. So, those were the moving parts. In PM&C, you had tailwinds of about $60 million from the turnaround in cost savings. So that's to the positive. You had some seasonality and lower siloxane prices to the negative and we had also improved supply availability of siloxanes and some opportunistic monomer sales in the coating side of the business, acrylates were strong in the quarter. So that was - those were the things that net-net made the swing in those two segments. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Aleksey Yefremov of KeyBanc. Your line is open. Aleksey Yefremov : Thanks. Good morning. And Howard, congratulations. Just wanted to follow-up on PMC. I would say a pretty healthy number - is this a good level that we can use for thinking about next year? It sounded just in the previous answer, there was some opportunistic sales. So that's sort of where the question is coming from. Is this a real sustainable number to think about going forward earnings in the segment? Jim Fitterling : Yes. I think as a lot saying improve, you can see some positive uptick in Consumer Solutions and silicones. The downstream demand has continued to be strong. So that hasn't been the primary issue. And we're seeing still continued good positive signs in the downstream demand sector, things like EVs and battery production. We'll have to watch - the commercial construction markets. I think residential will start to improve somewhat, but household and personal care, consumer products, health and beauty, I would say, are going to continue to be positive in that space. Coatings has been slow due to construction. I think there are some signs starting that applications for permits are starting to pick up on construction. That's kind of a U.S.-centric view. And in China, we'll have to watch, if there's any stimulus to get the construction markets going there. Automotive, I would say, is a bright spot globally, even Europe in spite of a slow GDP has seen pretty strong automotive builds through the year. And I would say, once we get the strikes resolved here with the UAW and the big automakers. I think you'll see a step-up in demand, because they'll start to be competing again for that market share. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander of Jefferies. Your line is open. Laurence Alexander : So, good morning. I just want to revisit the inventory level. If you think about lessons learned from this cycle, where do you see inventory days and working capital days shaking out at the next mid-cycle? And separately, Howard, just thank you for your help getting ramped up on Dow? Jim Fitterling : Yes. Maybe Howard, do you want to touch inventories. You got the working capital team and there's been pretty focused on this all throughout. Howard Ungerleider : Yes. Sure, Jim. And Laurence, thanks and I appreciate everything you've done to cover Dow over time, and hopefully, we'll continue. Yes, we've been - look, I've been very proud of the whole organization and how we've really - if you think about one of the big changes that we've made, I think as a leadership team as an organization in the last five or six years is really a big step change on cash. And managing cash, just as well as we're managing margins and EBITDA and operating rate in EU. We have structurally taken out about eight days. When you think about it on a cash conversion cycle since spin, eight days has been structural and the other improvements have been more around the cycle. So obviously, that will continue, as we've headed into this down cycle period. Probably we've taken out about $1 billion of cash, just on the releasing revenue from working capital, as we head into a normalized macro and eventually a cyclical peak out into the future, you could expect $1 billion use of cash. But overall, eight days out, cycle-to-cycle, I think, is a good target so far. And I would expect that under Jeff's leadership, together with Jim and the leadership team. I would expect at least another day maybe another two days in the next year or two will come out structurally. So, I think a nice target is 10 days cycle-to-cycle from a structural standpoint. We've been really - we've implemented OMP, or in the process of implementing OMP in almost all of our businesses now and really thinking about it end-to-end from the customer back, and the team is still working on it, but that's - that gives you a good range. Jim Fitterling : Jeff is going to make me cut you off, before you set any more to targets for him. Howard Ungerleider : Just one more day. Maybe two. That's it. Operator : Thank you. Your last question comes from the line of Mike Leithead of Barclays. Your line is open. Mike Leithead : Great. Thanks. Appreciate you squeezing me in here. Just briefly on packaging. I think sequentially, EBIT was down about $440 million on $480 million lower sales, almost 100% drop through. Can you help us better understand the moving pieces in the quarter there? Jim Fitterling : Sure. The lower sales were primarily due to being out of the merchant ethylene market - and so that obviously had an impact. We had the cost of the turnaround in the third quarter for the St. Charles cracker. And that was a drag that drag, becomes a positive as we go into the fourth quarter. We had some stronger equity earnings, which were up from the previous quarter. But then pricing and the impact of really a surge in feedstock and energy costs that happened in the third quarter were the big delta. Prices ran up on us in the third quarter. And then the pricing came in September, which kind of lagged the increase in the feedstock and the energy cost. And so, you saw that margin squeeze. I think we're back to even with that, and we'll get a little bit ahead of that. And like I said, I expect about $0.02 integrated margin improvement, as we go into the fourth quarter. Operator : Thank you. There are no further question at this time. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Gupta for closing remarks. Pankaj Gupta : Yes. Thanks, Jay. Thank you, everyone, for joining our call today, and we appreciate your interest in Dow. For your reference, a copy of our transcript will be posted on Dow's website within approximately 48 hours. This concludes our call. Thank you very much. Operator : You may now disconnect.",

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn it over to Dow Investor Relations' Vice President, Pankaj Gupta. Mr. Gupta, you may begin. Pankaj Gupta : Good morning. Thank you for joining today. The accompanying slides are provided through this webcast and posted on our website. I'm Pankaj Gupta, Dow Investor Relations' Vice President. And joining me are Jim Fitterling, Dow's Chair and Chief Executive Officer, and Jeff Tate, Chief Financial Officer. Please note our comments contain forward-looking statements and are subject to the related cautionary statement contained in the earnings news release and slides. Please refer to our public filings for further information about principal risks and uncertainties. Unless otherwise specified, all financials, where applicable, exclude significant items. We also will refer to non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures are contained in the earnings news release and slides that are posted on our website. On Slide 2 is our agenda for today's call. Jim will review our fourth quarter results, full year highlights and operating segment performance. Jeff will provide an update on the macroeconomic environment, our strong financial position through the cycle as well as the modeling guidance. To close, Jim will provide an update on key milestones for our long-term growth and sustainability roadmap, which will continue to drive shareholder value. Following that, we will take your questions. Now, let me turn the call over to Jim. Jim Fitterling : Thank you, Pankaj. Beginning on Slide 3, in the fourth quarter, we continue to execute with discipline and advance our long-term strategy in face of a dynamic macroeconomic environment. Net sales were $10.6 billion, down 10% versus the year-ago period, reflecting declines in all operating segments. Sales were down 1% sequentially as volume gains in Packaging & Specialty Plastics were more than offset by seasonal demand declines in Performance Materials & Coatings. Volume increased 2% year-over-year, with gains across all regions except Asia Pacific, which was flat. Sequentially volume decreased by 1%, including the impact of an unplanned event from a storm that was equivalent to a Category 1 hurricane at our Bah\u00eda Blanca site in Argentina. Local price decreased 13% year-over-year, with declines in all operating segments due to lower feedstocks and energy costs. Sequentially, price was flat, reflecting modest gains in most regions. Operating EBIT for the quarter was $559 million, down $42 million year-over-year, primarily driven by lower prices. Sequentially, operating EBIT was down $67 million, as gains in Packaging & Specialty Plastics were more than offset by seasonally lower volumes in Performance Materials & Coatings. Our cash flow generation and working capital management enabled us to deliver cash flow from operations of $1.6 billion in the quarter. We continued to reduce costs and focused on cash generation, completing our $1 billion of cost savings for the year. And in the fourth quarter, we pursued additional de-risking opportunities for our pension plans, including annuitization and risk transfer of $1.7 billion in pension liability and a one-time non-cash and non-operating settlement charge of $642 million. We also advanced our long-term strategy while returning $616 million to shareholders. And we reached final investment decision with our Board of Directors for our Path2Zero project in Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta. Now, turning to our full year performance on Slide 4. Our 2023 results demonstrate strong execution and a commitment to financial discipline. Against the dynamic macroeconomic backdrop, Team Dow continued to take proactive actions. As a result, we generated $5.2 billion in cash flow from operations for the year, reflecting a cash flow conversion of 96%. We also returned $2.6 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Our efforts continue to be recognized externally through industry-leading awards, certifications and recognitions, and we continue to outpace our peers on leadership diversity. I'm proud of how Team Dow is delivering for our customers, driving shareholder value and supporting our communities as we progress our long-term strategy. Now, turning to operating segment performance on Slide 5. In the Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment, operating EBIT was $664 million, up $9 million compared to the year-ago period. Results were driven by lower input costs and higher operating rates, where we closed out the year strong and hit record ethylene production levels on a full-year basis. Local price declines were driven by lower global prices, while volume increases were led by higher packaging demand, primarily in the U.S., Canada and Latin America. Sequentially, operating EBIT increased by $188 million. This was driven by higher integrated polyethylene margins, the impact of planned maintenance activity in the third quarter and higher licensing revenue. Moving to the Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure segment, operating EBIT was $15 million compared to $164 million in the year-ago period. Results were driven by lower local prices in both businesses as well as reduced supply availability in Industrial Solution. Sequentially, operating EBIT was down $6 million, driven by seasonally lower volumes in building and construction end markets, which were partially offset by seasonally higher demand for deicing fluid and higher demand for mobility applications. And in the Performance Materials & Coatings segment, operating EBIT was a loss of $61 million compared to a loss of $130 million in the year-ago period, driven by lower costs and reduced planned maintenance turnaround activity. Volume was up year-over-year, driven by higher demand in project-driven building and construction end markets. Sequentially, operating EBIT decreased $240 million, primarily due to seasonally lower volumes. Next, I'll turn it over to Jeff to review our outlook and actions on Slide 6. Jeff Tate : Thank you, Jim. Before I begin, I'd like to mention how excited I am to have rejoined Dow last November. I've been connecting with key stakeholders, analysts and shareholders, including many of you on this call today. And I look forward to meeting with so many others in the future. After four years serving in a CFO role outside of Dow, I'm pleased to see that Dow's culture of execution, commitment to advancing our ambition and the focus everyone has demonstrated on delivering on our financial priorities since then remains. This is an exciting time for the company. As CFO, I'm proud to carry forward Dow's commitment to maintaining a disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation over the economic cycle as we advance our growth strategies and deliver long-term value for shareholders. Now, for our outlook on Slide 6. As we enter 2024, we expect near-term demand to remain pressured by elevated inflation, high interest rates and geopolitical tension, particularly in building and construction and durable goods end markets. That said, we are seeing some initial positive indicators. While inflation is still elevated compared to pre-COVID levels, the growth rate is moderating, supporting more stable economic conditions. In addition, the destocking that began in late 2022 has largely run its course, resulting in low inventory levels throughout most of our value chains. In the U.S., industrial activity continues to be moderate. In December, industrial production increased 1% year-over-year, and chemical railcar loadings are up 9.6% in January versus the prior year. U.S. consumer spending has remained resilient with retail trade sales up 4.8% in December. We're also encouraged by recent forecast from the American Coatings Association, which expects market demand to grow approximately 3% in 2024 following three consecutive years of declines. In Europe, while inflation has moderated, consumer demand remains weak with retail trade sales down 1.1% year-over-year in November. In December, manufacturing PMI remains in contractionary territory and new car registrations fell 3.3% year-over-year after 16 consecutive months of growth. We continue to monitor China where we see improving conditions, which could provide a source of demand recovery following the Lunar New Year. Industrial production was up 6.8% year-over-year last month, exceeding market estimates of 6.6%. December auto sales also continue to be strong in China, supported by year-end incentives. In other regions around the world, industrial activity remains constructive. While India Manufacturing PMI remains expansionary, ASEAN Manufacturing PMI entered contractionary territory last month. In Mexico, November marked the 25th consecutive month of industrial production growth. On Slide 7, our competitive advantages, early cycle growth investments and operational discipline position us well to capitalize on a recovery and deliver growth when economic conditions improve. Our differentiated portfolio with structurally advantaged assets, global scale and strong cost positions enable us to competitively support global demand growth over the cycle. Healthy oil to gas spreads supported by growing natural gas and NGL production in U.S. favor our cost advantage and ability to capture margin momentum. We've also taken actions to position the company for profitable growth, including ongoing execution of near-term investments that are expected to deliver approximately $2 billion in incremental underlying EBITDA by mid-decade. In addition, we've improved our cost profile, delivering $1 billion in targeted savings in 2023 that included lower plant maintenance spending and structural improvements to raw materials, logistics and utility costs. In addition, more than 90% of the 2,000 impacted roles exited by year-end. Our strong balance sheet allows us to navigate the bottom of the cycle and have the strength to capitalize on the next upside in the global economy. Turning to our outlook for the first quarter on Slide 8. In the Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment, lower feedstock and energy costs will be more than offset by lower earnings from non-recurring licensing activity from the prior quarter, resulting in a $25 million headwind. Additionally, we expect a $50 million headwind due to higher plant maintenance activity at select energy assets in the U.S. Gulf Coast. In the Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure segment, we expect margin expansion on higher MDI and MEG spreads as well as lower European energy costs, resulting in a $50 million tailwind. Increased season demand for deicing fluid is expected to provide a $25 million tailwind despite being partly offset by continued weakness in consumer durables demand. We also expect a headwind of $50 million due to planned maintenance activity in the quarter, primarily related to a PDH turnaround and catalyst change. In the Performance Materials & Coatings segment, downward pressure is expected to continue due to excess supply from competitive supply additions that will keep margins at depressed levels. However, we expect higher seasonal demand in building and construction end markets to contribute $150 million tailwind for the segment. We also expect higher planned maintenance turnaround activity at our Deer Park acrylic monomers site and PDH to result in a $50 million headwind in the quarter. With all the puts and takes, we expect first quarter earnings to be approximately $25 million to $50 million above fourth quarter performance. Next, I'll turn it back to Jim. Jim Fitterling : Thank you, Jeff. Moving to Slide 9, our Decarbonize & Grow and Transform the Waste strategies uniquely position us to capitalize on demand for more sustainable and circular solutions across our attractive market verticals. Altogether, by 2030, these investments enable us to deliver an increase of more than $3 billion to our underlying earnings through the cycle, while reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions by 5 million metric tons and commercializing 3 million metric tons of circular and renewable solutions annually. In November, we reached the key milestone as our Path2Zero project in Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta achieved final investment decision by our Board of Directors. We also continue to advance our Transform the Waste strategy via intentional actions, strategic partnerships and offtake agreements. In the fourth quarter, Valoregen's 15,000 ton per year mechanical recycling line in France achieved mechanical completion. And Mura Technology in the UK commenced commissioning, which is expected to contribute 20,000 tons per year of advanced recycling capacity. Both Valoregen and Mura expect to reach commercialization in the first half of this year. As a next step of our sustainability strategy, Dow has established a Green Finance Framework, which was published on our Investor website today. This allows us to further align our funding with our goals and targets, while also providing an opportunity for the investor community to take part in the execution of our sustainability strategy. Altogether, we remain confident in our long-term earnings growth with continued focus on a more sustainable future, while maintaining a disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation. Now, turning to Slide 10, polyethylene demand is expected to continue to grow at approximately 1.2 times to 1.4 times GDP through 2050. A growing population, regulations and consumer preferences support this. And our customers have expressed an increasing need for low and zero carbon emissions and circular products. As global demand grows, no new cost-advantaged ethylene capacity is expected to come online in North America until the late 2026 to 2027 timeframe, which is expected to tighten the supply-demand balance in the near term. We are well positioned to capture new and growing demand with our existing assets and partnership agreements. In addition, we are investing in low-carbon emissions infrastructure to capture growing demand for polyethylene as you will see on Slide 11. Our Fort Saskatchewan project will build upon the strong foundation of our Texas-9 cracker where we have proven our best-in-class execution, capital efficiency, reliability and emissions reduction. Canada's feedstock cost advantage provides Dow with lower cash cost compared to the rest of the world, even more advantaged than the U.S. Gulf Coast. We also anticipate potential upside from the commercialization of low and zero emissions products. Total CapEx spend is expected to be $6.5 billion on this to keep growth project, excluding any incentives, with Dow's total enterprise CapEx to ramp in 2024 to approximately $3 billion and exceed depreciation and amortization levels annually through 2027. We remain committed to keeping our CapEx within D&A across the economic cycle and expect to return to those levels as we complete this project. We expect to receive governmental support totaling more than $1.5 billion in cash and tax incentives that will bring the net capital outlay for this project to $5 billion. The majority of these incentives are expected to be received by Dow through 2030, which is closely aligned with our CapEx deployment for the project. We will begin construction in the first half of 2024 with Phase 1 startup of approximately 1.3 million tons per year of capacity expected in 2027. In Phase 2, we will add another 600,000 tons of capacity, which is expected to start up in 2029. Phase 2 also includes the retrofit of our existing cracker, reducing net 1 million metric tons per year of CO2 Scope 1 and 2 emissions. Closing on Slide 12, the actions we've taken since spin have strengthened our balance sheet, increased cash flow and enhanced the financial flexibility and resilience of our business. In 2023, we built on that foundation moving swiftly to deliver $1 billion in cost savings and focus on cash generation as economic conditions remain challenging. As a result, we delivered on all of our capital allocation priorities, including a fully funded dividend, $625 million of share repurchases and growth investments, all while maintaining the strongest balance sheet we've ever had at this part of the cycle. With all of our debt at fixed rate, we have no substantive debt maturities due until 2027 and $13 billion of available liquidity. Additionally, we have returned approximately 90% of our net income to shareholders since spin, well above our 65% target across the economic cycle. With global reach, presence in attractive end markets and advantaged cost position in early-stage growth investments in flight, we are well positioned to capture attractive growth opportunities as economic conditions recover. With that, I'll turn it back to Pankaj to open the Q&A. Pankaj Gupta : Thank you, Jim. Now, let's move on to your questions. I would like to remind you that our forward-looking statements apply to both our prepared remarks as well as the following Q&A. Operator, please provide the Q&A instructions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Hassan Ahmed from Alembic Global. Your line is open. Hassan Ahmed : Good morning, Jim. Jim, a couple of times through the prepared remarks you talked about inventory. It just seems that there are two camps out there in terms of the thought process with regards to what a potential restocking may look like, and I'd love to hear your views about that. On one side of the debate, people are sitting there and saying, hey, look, since the second half of 2022, the destocking was quite significant, and maybe as and when we should expect an equally impressive restock. But then on the other side of the camp, you have some of the folks sort of debating that buying cartons across the supply chain has changed quite dramatically coming out of the pandemic and maybe a restock could not look that impressive. So, I'd love to hear your views. And if you could also sort of elaborate on that within some of the main product chains, be it polyethylene, polyurethanes and the like? Jim Fitterling : Good morning, Hassan. I think that's a great question. I think one of the reasons that December and fourth quarter ended up stronger than expected, especially I'll use Packaging & Specialty Plastics as an example, was because you had a pretty mixed year in 2023. And in December, you can sometimes see the behavior of that. In the last half of December, things slowdown and people manage cash and they don't buy. That was not what we experienced in December. We actually experienced strong demand right through the month. I don't think that's an indication of restocking, but I do think it's an indication that inventories are low through the supply chain and the consumer demand was resilient, and so people had to buy to keep their supply chains moving. So, I would say through the value chains today and almost all the businesses, it looks like there's not an excess of inventory out there. And as demand is coming, people are having to buy to keep the chains full. Secondly, inventories are low in areas like P&SP, Industrial Solutions, because the arbitrage is open and our own footprint, 85% of our own global footprint is in light cracking jurisdiction, where we crack ethane and propane which have been highly advantaged. And so that's what allowed us to set an ethylene record for the year. I would say we're not -- I don't think we're in a restocking cycle yet. I think people are coming together around the soft landing here. I mean, we're seeing positive signs on housing permits. That doesn't turn into housing demand until we start to see, say, maybe interest rates come down. If interest rates come down in the second quarter, maybe you start to see some pickup in housing construction, and that starts to show up more toward the back half of the year. You've got to remember that energy costs are low, and so people are thinking that energy costs are low and I'm still able to buy at reasonable prices going forward. There may not be a reason for them to do a big restock right now. But this will turn. And as energy costs start to move up and the whole complex starts to move up with demand, I think at that point, I think we would be wise to keep our eye on what's happening with the potential for restock. It might just be a little soon right now. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Sison from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Mike Sison : Hey, guys. Nice end of the year. I'm just curious, you had good volume growth in PSP in the Q4. Do you expect that to continue into the first? And maybe any thoughts on how your operating rates for polyethylene will sort of improve sequentially and the cadence for the year? Jim Fitterling : Yeah. Thanks, Michael. Good question. Operating rates in the advantaged regions, especially Canada, U.S., Gulf Coast, Argentina, we're strong through the end of the year. I mentioned ethylene production record. We saw rates above 90% in those regions for the fourth quarter. And obviously we saw a little bit of an improvement in Europe. I'd say the Suez Canal situation means not as much material from the Middle East is flowing into Europe, and so that's given Europe a little bit of a lift on operating rates as we go into the first quarter, and of course with propane being where it is, we're cracking LPGs in Terneuzen and Tarragona, and that's helping out a bit there. I would say I think P&SP is going to continue to see good volume growth. That's what our outlook is going forward. The Industrial Solutions is holding up relatively well. We have our own self-inflicted issue with Plaquemine Glycol plant, but I'm expecting that back up in second quarter. And we're watching carefully on construction chemicals demand and durable goods to see if we see an uptick there. We saw some good movement in consumer electronics, and so that's got me a little bit optimistic. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Vincent Andrews : Hi, thanks. Maybe two quick ones for me. Just on Slide 7, you have some project starts that are going from '24 to '26. Talk about how material some of that might be for 2024? And then also if you could just give us an update on what you did with the pension ending the year? Jim Fitterling : Yes. On project starts, we've got the things that we've got coming up, obviously, is we've got some alkoxylation capacity that came up in '22 and '23, it's running really well. We started up the MDI distillation facility in Freeport in the third quarter. I think that will start to show some positive benefit to us as we move forward. That's about a 30% increase in MDI distillation, and also reduction of a footprint getting us out of the La Porte site. We've got CDF alkoxylation, second wave expansion in fourth quarter of this year, and then Terneuzen in fourth quarter of 2025, both of that supports growing demand and energy and also consumer solutions and pharma business, so that's good. Amines business for carbon capture is growing well, and so that's good. If you look at plastics industry, there's really no new capacity coming out in plastics say one train at the Shell plant in the United States. Otherwise, all the plastics capacity is in the market, inventories are low, export channels running strong, and we saw volume growth year-over-year in the fourth quarter. So, I feel good about the overall outlook for plastics as we're going into 2024. When you get into polyolefins, our polyurethanes and propylene oxide, a little bit different story. That capacity come on in China. We've seen the same in siloxanes last year. I think we're working through that. The silicones growth is going to eat up that siloxane capacity, but we've got to see the durable goods market and the housing markets come back to tighten up PO. Propylene Glycol side has been strong. But as you know housing and automotive drives PPE a lot. Those two things drive the propylene markets and we're going to keep a close eye on them. Operator : Your next question... Jim Fitterling : Jeff, do you want to cover pension and what we did? Jeff Tate : Sure, Jim. As we've been communicating to the Street here in recent quarters, one of the things that we're consistently looking to do as we're solidifying our financial position is look for ways to derisk our pension plans. And one of those could be around annuitization as well as risk transfer of our liabilities. So specifically in fourth quarter, we were actually able to reduce our pension liabilities by $1.7 billion. The execution of those transactions did not require any additional cash from the company. As Jim mentioned in some of his opening remarks, the impact of that was a one-time non-cash non-operating settlement charge of $640 million in the quarter. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Jeff Zekauskas : Thanks very much. Recently, there was a cold snap in Texas. And I didn't notice that there was any penalty in EBITDA for the first quarter. Are you still assessing what the amounts might be, or do you think that it's zero? And then, secondly, you pulled out $1 billion in costs. Can you allocate the $1 billion across your three segments? Jim Fitterling : Sure. I'll take the cold snap, and then, Jeff, I'll have you take a look at the costs. Look, on the freeze, Jeff, I just want to go back, two years ago, this is the third consecutive year of freeze on the Gulf Coast. And we've improved plans every year to be able to be ready for that. This year will be the lowest impact we've had of any of the three years. And so, the big impacts that hit us were at Deer Park and at Seadrift, but almost all of that is back up and running now. So, we were able to rebound pretty quickly. You never go completely unscathed, but I think we managed through it pretty well. We haven't had to disrupt any customers because of downtime. And I think we're going to recover pretty strong here and be running hard by the end of this month. So, I feel that we've navigated it pretty well. And we didn't see enough of an impact that we put that into first quarter estimates. I think our biggest delta in first quarter is we've got quite a few turnarounds in the first quarter, and so that's our biggest impact about $200 million of turnarounds in the quarter -- $150 million. And then, we expect some margin and some seasonality in first quarter, say, plus $200 million on margins and minus $150 million on turnarounds in the quarter. So that's the biggest net-net on the first quarter '24 guidance. Jeff, do you want to hit how the $1 billion costs fell across the business? Jeff Tate : Absolutely, Jim. In the simplest terms, about 50% of those cost savings are in P&FP, 20% to 25% are in the other two segments, respectively, and we also have a little bit in corporate as well. So, pretty well distributed based on our operations and our revenues as well. Jim Fitterling : We ended the year at a $1.4 billion run rate on that. So, if you look at full year 2024, Jeff, we still got another $400 million coming in in terms of the cost savings for '24, but we have $200 million of higher turnarounds in 2024, so net-net $200 million coming into 2024. I hope that covers what you're looking for. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Byrne from Bank of America. Your line is open. Steve Byrne : Yes. Thank you. I'd like to get some help from you on why were the earnings in PM&C so much lower than what you were expecting, say, in the third quarter slide deck. Would you attribute this to just lower pricing, higher raws? Help me on this one. And maybe in particular, coatings, you've got a key customer raising price and targeting mid-single digit lower raws. Your propylene costs are higher. Why not able to push more price in this segment, or cut back on operating rates or something along those lines? What's your outlook for that segment? Jim Fitterling : Yes. Good question, Steve. I'd say starting at the top, siloxanes and monomers in the silicones -- siloxanes and silicones and monomers and coatings and monomers are both oversupplied. So that put pressure obviously on both volume and pricing in the quarter. And you had volumes decrease sequentially across all regions and all markets, and that's not unusual, especially in coatings and monomers, that's pretty typical in fourth quarter that we would see that. But silicones was a little bit softer. And I think that was the biggest delta there. Year-over-year, they were down on price, which was because of that supply demand for both siloxane and acrylic monomers. The downstream in terms of the coat -- the binders business and coating held up relatively well and actually had decent volumes in the fourth quarter. So, what we supply to the downstream, coatings customers look good. And as we mentioned, our view going forward is about a 3% increase this year in downstream coatings. And I'd say downstream silicones demand continues to hold up pretty well. I'd say one thing we're keeping an eye on is what happens with EV volume production. EV drives a lot of silicones content, a lot into batteries. And so, we need to keep an eye on that. But the other segments in silicones are also on pretty substantial growth for 2024. It's those upstream monomers markets that we're going to keep an eye on. And I think things will start to tighten up a bit in China and that will help on siloxanes. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Josh Spector from UBS. Your line is open. Josh Spector : Yes, hi. Good morning. I was wondering if you could comment on your polyethylene price assumptions in the first quarter. I think within your bridge, you talk about lower costs and some other moving pieces, but there's not really anything there on price. So, are you assuming that you get positive pricing in February and March like some of the consultant data shows? Are you assuming something different? Thank you. Jim Fitterling : Good morning, Josh. We've got $0.05 price increases on the table for January and February. I would say, globally, we're looking pretty flat quarter-over-quarter on pricing. I'm expecting to see some price up in EMEA. I mentioned the Suez Canal and the impact that had on Middle East volumes going up into EMEA. So, I think we're going to see that up. I think we're going to see price up in Asia Pacific. I think we're going to see it relatively flat in the Americas. Integrated margins for the Americas ought to be about where they were in the fourth quarter. Integrated margins in Europe should be up a few cents, that's what the market markers will look at right now. And input costs are in line. I mean, even though we have that cold snap, natural gas costs are very competitive. Ethane costs are very competitive. Propane, they're a little bit high because of the heating demand. But I think that may start to come off a little bit as we move through this cold spell. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. David Begleiter : Thank you. Good morning. Jim, you highlight the U.S. chemical railcar loading is up 10%. What do you think is driving that? And given the strong start to the quarter, do you expect volumes to be up in all three segments in Q1? Thank you. Jim Fitterling : Yeah. Look, I think on chemical railcar loading, industrial production in the U.S. is starting to come back. The U.S. has a tremendous cost advantage. Operating rates in most of the sectors are up. And I think the destocking being -- it's always hard to have enough visibility to call the end of it, but I think what we saw in December were signs that destocking has worked through. So, any downstream demand is turning into orders and I think that's what you're seeing with the railcar loadings. Also remember, railcars service the Mexican market as well. Mexico has been very strong. They've benefited a lot from near-shoring. And so, having both China volumes up and Mexico volumes up, I think is a positive here. I would say, on volumes, my expectations, we have volume growth for all three segments for 2024. I think that's going to start the materialize. I think plastics is underway right now. I think construction, chemicals, housing-related demand on polyurethanes will probably be geared more towards the back half of the year. I think downstream silicones, Industrial Solutions will be throughout the year, and then we'll have a step up in Industrial Solution when we get the Glycol 2 plant back in Plaquemines. And I think I can speak for the business here. As soon as we get that plant back up, we'll have it sold out. So, we're working really hard to get that thing back online. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander from Jefferies. Your line is open. Dan Rizzo : Hi. This is Dan Rizzo on for Laurence. Thank you for taking my call. Can we just discuss your strategy on mechanical recycling? What do you expect by 2030? And longer term, do you expect that to outgrow the market? Jim Fitterling : Yeah. I think when we look at -- if you look at what we put in the deck on polyethylene demand, our view is that both mechanical recycling and advanced recycling are going to continue to grow. There's going to be demand drivers to grow all of those segments. We're in the middle of discussions on a global plastics treaty right now. We've got a big conference in Ottawa at the end of April, beginning of May. There's another one in Korea toward the end of the year. And I think what's coalescing around the industry and also the consumer brand owners and some of the NGOs that we work with, there's a focus on enhanced producer responsibility as part of it to drive circularity, focus on recycled content mandates, a focus on all forms of recycling and bio-based products that are made from waste or alternative feedstocks and in some cases like we have a project that's making bio-based materials from waste from corn production, corn stover that's used to convert into bio feedstocks. You're going to see demand all forms of that in place. We've got some capacity coming up in Europe. And we started there because the enhanced producer responsibility. The teams are there. Some of the mandates are there. And the demand from the downstream is very strong. That's coming when you look around the states in the United States. That's coming in Canada. I think we're going to see it come globally. So, I feel that over time you're going to see more focus on low-carbon fossil approaches like we're doing with Alberta. So, how can you make plastics from fossil fuels that have zero CO2 emissions. You're going to see focus on advanced recycling and mechanical recycling. And all of the above and we're just going to place bets in different regions based on what the market demand dictates. Good uptake from the customers. We see good volume growth there. We see pricing ahead of virgin materials. And of course virgin materials are relatively low right now. And we continue to work to get plants certified with ISCC PLUS so that we can certify that recycle content for our customers. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy from Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open. Kevin McCarthy : Yes, good morning. Jim, on a year-to-date basis, we've seen polyethylene export prices rise by, let's say, $0.04 to $0.05 a pound. I'm curious as to what you think is driving that. Would you attribute that pattern to better demand or some of the logistics challenges that have emerged in the Red Sea or perhaps other factors? And then maybe as a related question, if you don't have any unplanned outages, how hard do you think you might be able to run your U.S. Gulf Coast ethylene-linked assets in the first quarter? Just trying to get a sense of whether the export market might be strong enough to lift up the U.S. domestic market. Jim Fitterling : Yeah. Good question, Kevin. I would say if you look back at 2023, in the first half of the year, really the limit on PE export volumes and prices were just more on the volume side, on the supply chain side, it was the ability to get marine pack cargo moving. That improved considerably as we worked through the year. In fact, December was one of the highest months of the year for PE export sales and we've got the export channel full and lined up. And overall, we're running Canada, United States, Argentina as hard as we can. We ran at rates on crackers above 90% for the back part of the year, especially in fourth quarter. And so, to your point, unconstrained, if there's no freeze impact or anything else, we're going to be running them hard. The arbitrage is open. The volumes are there. We had up double-digit volumes for the year in plastics going to China. We actually were up year-over-year in China on P&SP as well as Industrial Solutions, and I think a little bit in Coatings -- Consumer Solutions, I'm sorry, in Consumer Solutions. So, we were off in Industrial Solutions because of Plaquemine outage, but we were up in -- slightly up in PE, slightly up in Consumer Solutions, and up double digits in P&SP. So, I think the market is there and that is -- everybody is talking about China being relatively light GDP last year and we can move those kind of volumes. My expectations are taking actions that are going to help 2024 be better. As we do the walk on 2024 for the full year EBITDA walk, we've got about $300 million of margin expansion. So, we start with $5.4 billion in 2023 of EBITDA. We have about $300 million from margin expansion. We've got about $800 million from volume growth that's in all three segments. We've got turnarounds which cost us $200 million. And then we've got about $100 million of improvement from equity earnings in the JVs. So, net-net, you're walking it up to the $6.4 billion, $6.5 billion, kind of a range for 2024. And I think with soft landing scenario in the United States, that will help domestic market. We saw good domestic volume in PE as well here. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch from Fermium Research. Your line is open. Frank Mitsch : Good morning. And Jeff, nice to hear your voice again. Hey, Jim, really appreciate that walk up into 2024. I want to take a step back to Slide 7, where you talked about the projects mid cycle that started up in 2022, should contribute $400 million. The projects that started up in '23 should contribute another $400 million. Can you just look at those $800 million worth of mid cycle earnings and suggest what you're anticipating they're going to contribute in 2024? Jim Fitterling : Yeah. I think, Frank, I think coming back to that and I probably didn't answer what Vince was asking very well at the beginning. I think you're probably looking back half of this year to 2025 before you start to see mid cycle types of returns. We're not to mid cycle yet. I mean, obviously, we're navigating the bottom here. But I think with interest rates potentially coming off in the first half of the year some amount that stimulates some demand and mid cycle probably get there. So, maybe $300 million to $400 million of that you'll see in 2024, the balance into 2025. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Duffy Fischer : Hey, good morning. If you could just on the $50 million to $100 million on the equity income improvement, can you walk through your major JVs and just kind of say what's additive, what's subtractive from that number? Jim Fitterling : Yeah. Sure. I think you're going to see on the Sadara JVs year-over-year should be up, I don't know, I'd say about $100 million. Remember they had some outages in the first part of the year. So they had some volume impact in the first part of the year. And obviously, they're seeing the same improvements in arbitrage that we're seeing out of U.S. Gulf Coast. You're going to see Kuwait JVs up about $60 million. Obviously, that's the strength on ethylene glycol. We saw a bit of that in the fourth quarter and their ability to run hard as well. I think the Thai JVs will be down. A lot of pressure obviously on naphtha cracking and they're based on naphtha cracking. So, I expect them to be down about $20 million, and then everything else down about $30 million. So, net-net, you're up about $100 million. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Roberts from Mizuho. Your line is open. John Roberts : Thanks. And it looks like a pretty smooth transition in finance, so congratulations on the stability there. I believe you were considering some additional infrastructure divestments. Could you give us an update on that? Jim Fitterling : Sure. And nice to hear your voice on the call, John. Welcome back. Yeah, we've got a number of non-product producing infrastructure assets that we continue to evaluate. We have in flight for this year greater than $1 billion. I think maybe even greater than $1.5 billion of additional cash proceeds from transactions related to that. We had a very successful divestiture in 2020 of our rail and marine infrastructure assets, and that is working well. And the idea was there was to liberate some cash, but keep a competitive cost structure. And that same mindset is in place here. And we think obviously the cash proceeds are going to help us with reinvesting in revenue-generating assets like the Alberta project as we move forward. And then, the other cash-related kind of unique levers to Dow for the year is we've got the last part of the settlement from the Nova litigation, we should wind all that up and that's about $500 million for the year. So, I'd say net-net, we're pursing north of $1.5 billion plus the Nova litigation to try to get those kind of unique cash levers into the company. Anything else you want to add, Jeff? Jeff Tate : Yes, Jim. The only other thing -- and good morning, John, and thank you. The only other thing I would add is the working capital -- structural working capital improvement opportunities that we'll continue to focus on. If you recall, we reduced eight days and made eight days of improvement around our cash conversion cycle since spin. So, tremendous work across Team Dow. We're going to look to continue to get at least another one to two days of improvements out of that, which should also give us another unique to Dow cash lever. John Roberts : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Cunningham from Citigroup. Your line is open. Patrick Cunningham : Hi, good morning. So you mentioned -- in II&I, you mentioned turnarounds maybe weighted towards the first quarter, Plaquemine coming back in 2Q, Freeport bringing on the increase in MDI distillation. Should we expect more significant sequential earnings improvement through the year, and maybe help size where we can exit the year for this segment? And then if you could also just briefly comment on what's driving the direction of MDI and MEG spreads into 1Q, that would be great. Thanks. Jim Fitterling : Yeah. I think generically that's true, Patrick, that I think you'll see that build through the year. First quarter, obviously, we mentioned the turnaround. But second quarter, we expect to get Glycol 2 back in Plaquemine, that will be positive. And then the third quarter will be more positive, so it will ramp into the back half of the year. On isocyanates, obviously, the biggest driver is on construction-related and durable goods related markets. Obviously, there's some impact in automotive as well, any of the rigids is where most of that volume gets consumed. So as that -- those volumes start to pick up, you'll start to see MDI take off. And that's usually a driver of value across the entire portfolio, both the polyols and the MDI side of things. So, I'm hoping that we start to stimulate some of that demand in the back half of the year. And I think it was what China is doing in the markets, in the financial markets to try to stimulate some things. Could be between U.S. interest rates and what's going on in China that we see some momentum build in the back half of this year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Leithead from Barclays. Your line is open. Mike Leithead : Great. Thank you. Good morning. Two questions on your Sadara joint venture. First, I believe there was a report earlier this month that Aramco is raising feedstock prices. Will that impact Sadara, or should we expect input cost there to remain relatively flat? And second, EBITDA remains quite depressed right now relative to net debt at the JV. Can we expect any further restructuring or cash infusion needed over the next year or so? Or is the runway there sufficient to get back to, say, more mid-cycle type EBITDA levels? Jim Fitterling : Yeah, it's a good question. We've had no cash contributions that needed to be made to Sadara '21, '22, '23. I'm not expecting any going forward. Sadara itself, like us, when you navigate the bottom of the cycle, it's focusing on self-help actions to try to pull levers to keep costs down. There is talk in the kingdom about a raise and feedstock prices, and so we'll obviously have a look at things that we can do within Sadara to offset those costs. But those haven't taken hold just yet. And then obviously, the market comes back. Sadara is very levered to oil price. And so, oil clears the market for plastics, especially because that drives the Asia Pacific operating prices and costs. And so, when oil price comes up, which the expectations are that, that's going to be constructive as we move into '25 and beyond, there hasn't been a lot of investment in oil production, demand is back above -- demand for oil is back above where we were pre-pandemic, and yet we have big parts of the market that are not back about where we were pre-pandemic. So, I think the outlook for demand is that the demand is going to come as the global markets improve, but the supply is going to lag. And so, we're sitting here at $80 oil, that could firm up. You could start to see the top end of oil be pitched more toward $90, $100 as you get into the '25, '26 timeframe. And that has a pretty substantial impact to the bottom-line in Sadara. So near term, we're going to navigate our cost at Sadara to keep the cost down and to be able to handle those feedstock costs longer term, obviously lean into the market as the economy improves. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Aleksey Yefremov from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Aleksey Yefremov : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Jim, you just made a couple of comments that siloxanes capacity could be absorbed by demand growth. And to me, you sound a little more positive here than in the past. Do you think this upstream silicones market could see margin uplift maybe within the next 12 months? Or is this a longer-term project? Jim Fitterling : Yeah. If you look at the amount of capacity that's coming on in 2024 versus what came on in '23, it's down quite a bit. You've got a couple of projects. There's four projects in China that are coming on, and I think a couple of them could delay beyond 2024. The downstream markets have been continuing to grow, and we've been continuing to invest in debottlenecking. It's just the amount of upstream that's come on has added to that. The other positive that's happened is, obviously, silicon metal prices have come down, too. And so that helps on the input side of things. So I think you're going to see that as the downstream demand continues to improve and as globally coming continues to improve, we're going to see that as the project pipeline for buildings continues to grow, and remember, this goes into everything. It can go into high-rise buildings, it can go into new airports, it can go into schools and all kinds of other construction. Those are big volume pools. I think as you start to see construction activity pick up, then you're going to see that ramp. We're seeing strong demand in areas, obviously, EVs were a big part of it, 5G and connectivity is a big part of it, data centers. So as you're looking at things like how to handle cooling on data centers, silicon fluids or dielectrics and some immersive cooling applications in data centers, which are big energy hogs and need energy efficiency, that's a growth area for us as well. And then, the normal downstream demand in consumer goods and beauty care products continues to be good. So, I'm optimistic. Maybe it may take more into late '24 and into '25 to see it, but I do feel like we're going to start to move toward mid-cycle in 2025. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Arun Viswanathan : Great. Thanks for taking my question. So that's a good segue actually to what I was thinking but it was -- if you think about the guidance that you're issuing here for Q1, it looks to be in the $1.3 billion or so level for EBITDA, give or take a little bit. But annualizing that will get you to $5.2 billion and then maybe add in a little bit for seasonality, it gets you to closer to $6 billion. Would you consider that kind of trough-like conditions? And as you move through the year in '24, what are some of the things that makes you excited that we could maybe achieve mid-cycle by -- when you're exiting the year? And I guess maybe if you can just comment on what your expectations are for China growth going forward? Obviously, we'll likely see maybe a slower growth environment for the next four or five years versus the last four or five years. Just wanted to get your thoughts on that as well. Thanks. Jim Fitterling : Yeah. I think the things that are constructed to me as we're moving forward is no new capacity coming in, in Packaging & Specialty Plastics. You've got high operating rates in all the cost advantaged regions of the world. And you've got export arbitrage window open to China, as I mentioned, double-digit growth for us in China. And I think our view is we're able to move -- continue to move products. India has been strong. So, we're moving product into India. Mexico has been really strong. We supply a lot of plastics to Mexico by rail. I think that's all positive. I would say our view in Americas, our view in Asia Pacific as China comes back, so will the rest of Asia Pacific, and then our view in Europe is a bit mixed. Energy cost is better in Europe, which I think in the short term helps. It's not as big a drag as it was. But I think longer term, Europe has got some structural issues if we can't get energy costs down even lower. It puts a big weight on the consumer, which puts a big weight on demand, it puts additional weight on the industrial economy. So fortunately, we've got some cost advantage positions there that help us, and I think we'll navigate through that. Back half of the year, we've got Industrial Solutions coming back to full strength. We've got our new projects coming on. I just mentioned $300 million to $400 million from that. That's all in that volume growth number that I talked about. And the margin expansion is just the oil to gas spread on our existing business and the strength that we're going to see in some pricing in polyethylene for the year. So, I think we're going to ramp in to '25, get ourselves kind of back on to a mid-cycle run rate and we're going to -- in the meantime, we're going to pull the levers like we've been doing to manage cash, keep the balance sheet strong, be the first mover in the next wave with the Alberta project, just like we were with Texas-9. This is the right time to do it. This is the time to lock-in the low cost for construction, and we're ready to roll. Operator : This ends our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Gupta for closing remarks. Pankaj Gupta : Yes. Thanks, Rob. Thank you, everyone, for joining our call, and we appreciate your interest in Dow. For your reference, a copy of transcript will be posted on Dow's website in approximately 48 hours. This concludes our call. Thank you again. Operator : This concludes today's conference call.

I would now like to turn it over to Dow Investor Relations Vice President, Pankaj Gupta. Mr. Gupta, you may begin. Pankaj Gupta : Good morning. Thank you for joining today. The accompanying slides are provided through this webcast and posted on our website. I'm Pankaj Gupta, Dow's outgoing Investor Relations Vice President. Leading today's call are Jim Fitterling, Dow's Chair and Chief Executive Officer; and Jeff Tate, Chief Financial Officer. Also joining is our new Investor Relations Vice President, Andrew Riker, who you may remember, was a member of our IR team a few years ago. Please note, our comments contain forward-looking statements and are subject to the related cautionary statements contained in the earnings news release and slides. Please refer to our public filings for further information about principal risks and uncertainties. Unless otherwise specified, all financials, where applicable, exclude significant items. We will also refer to non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures are contained in the earnings news release and slides that are posted on our website. On Slide 2 is our agenda for today's call. Jim will review our first quarter results and operating segment performance. Jeff will then provide an update on the macroeconomic environment and modeling guidance as well as the results of our annual benchmarking. Jim will then provide an update on key milestones for our long-term strategy, which positions us well to deliver growth through the cycle. Following that, we will take your questions. Now let me turn the call over to Jim. James Fitterling : Thank you, Pankaj. Beginning on Slide 3. In the first quarter, Team Dow delivered sequential volume growth and margin expansion. We strategically increased operating rates to capture improving demand, we maintained pricing and we benefited from lower feedstock and energy costs. These results reflect the strength of our advantaged portfolio, including our participation in diverse end markets and our cost advantage positions around the world. Net sales were $10.8 billion, down 9% versus the year ago period but up 1% sequentially, driven by gains in Performance Materials & Coatings and Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure. Volume increased 1% year-over-year. And excluding Hydrocarbons & Energy, volume increased 5%, with gains in all regions. This marks the second consecutive quarter of year-over-year volume growth. Sequentially, volume increased 1% and excluding Hydrocarbons & Energy, was up 3%, led by gains in Performance Materials and Coatings. Local price decreased 10% year-over-year and was flat sequentially as modest gains in Europe, the Middle East, Africa and India, or EMEAI, were offset by declines in Asia Pacific, the United States and Canada. Operating EBIT for the quarter was $674 million, down $34 million year-over-year driven by lower prices in all regions. Sequentially, operating EBIT was up $115 million, reflecting gains in Performance Materials & Coatings and Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure. We delivered cash flow from operations of $460 million in the quarter, resulting in a 94% cash flow conversion on a trailing 12-month basis. This reflects our focus on cash flow generation and enabled $693 million in returns to shareholders. We also advanced our long-term strategy with our higher return, highly capital-efficient Path2Zero project in Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta, where construction started earlier this month. Now turning to our operating segment performance on Slide 4. In the Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment, operating EBIT was $605 million, down $37 million compared to the year ago period, primarily due to lower integrated margins. Local price declines were primarily driven by lower energy and feedstock costs globally. Volume decreased year-over-year driven by declines in the Hydrocarbons & Energy business. This was primarily due to prioritizing higher-value downstream derivative polymer sales as well as lighter feed slate cracking in Europe. Sequentially, operating EBIT decreased by $59 million as improved polyethylene integrated margins were more than offset by expected lower nonrecurring licensing revenue and higher planned maintenance activity. Moving to the Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure segment. Operating EBIT was $87 million compared to $123 million in the year ago period. Results were driven by lower prices in both businesses, which were partly offset by 3 items : lower energy and feedstock costs, improved equity earnings and volume gains in Polyurethanes & Construction Chemicals. Sequentially, operating EBIT was up $72 million driven by improved equity earnings and lower energy and feedstock costs, primarily in EMEAI. And in the Performance Materials & Coatings segment, operating EBIT was $41 million, up $6 million compared to the year ago period, driven by volume growth and higher operating rates. Volume was up year-over-year driven by gains primarily in the United States, Canada and Latin America. Sequentially, operating EBIT increased $102 million driven by higher seasonal volumes and overall improved demand. Now I'll turn it over to Jeff to review our outlook and actions. Jeffrey Tate : Thank you, Jim and good morning to everyone joining our call today. Turning to our outlook on Slide 5. We are seeing signs of improving macroeconomic conditions in several regions, which gives us cautious optimism heading into what is typically a seasonally strong quarter. That said, we are keeping a close eye on inflation, interest rates and geopolitical tensions. The U.S. is benefiting from improving industrial activity with manufacturing PMI in expansionary territory every month thus far this year. In fact, manufacturing production expanded at its fastest rate in 22 months in March. Average chemical railcar shipments were also up 4.3% year-to-date compared to last year through mid-April. And while high interest rates continue to improve building and construction activity in the U.S., building permits were 1.5% higher in March year-over-year, while existing home sales declined 3.7% in March. In Europe, consumer spending and industrial activity remain weak with manufacturing PMI decreasing in February and March. This partly reflects ongoing geopolitical tensions in the Red Sea, which have led to higher freight costs globally. Declines in inventory levels are a promising indicator with March at the lowest levels since July 2022. Economic activity in China continued to recover steadily with signs of improving demand. Industrial production increased 4.5% year-over-year in March. Additionally, retail sales grew 3.1% year-over-year in March, supported by consumer spending around the Lunar New Year. Nonetheless, the property sector remains weak with new home prices continuing to decline through March. Industrial activity in other regions remains constructive. In March, India manufacturing PMI reached its highest level in more than 3 years at 59.1. ASEAN manufacturing PMI reached an 11-month high at 51.5. And in Mexico, industrial production increased further in February. Now turning to our outlook for the second quarter on Slide 6. In the Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment, higher global polyethylene integrated margins, resilient demand in packaging, as well as continued strength in the export markets are expected to drive a $150 million tailwind in the quarter. Additionally, we expect $25 million in tailwinds from our site in Bah\u00eda Blanca, Argentina, which has returned to operations following an unexpected storm in December of 2023. Lastly, we expect a $75 million headwind due to increased plant maintenance primarily in Sabine, Texas. In the Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure segment, consumer durables demand continues to be muted. However, we expect margin expansion on improved MDI and polyols spreads in Europe. We also expect modest seasonal demand improvement in building and construction end markets as well as resilient demand in pharma and energy end markets. Altogether, these represent a $25 million tailwind. In addition, we expect a headwind of $25 million due to planned maintenance in Europe and the U.S. Gulf Coast. This will be partly offset by the completion of a turnaround at a PDH unit in the first quarter. In the Performance Materials & Coatings segment, higher global siloxane prices and seasonal demand increases in building and construction end markets are expected to drive a $75 million tailwind in the second quarter. We also expect an additional $25 million tailwind from a turnaround at our siloxane pillar site in the U.S., while our Deer Park and PDH sites will come back up following planned maintenance in the first quarter. So with all the puts and takes, at a company level, we expect second quarter earnings to be approximately $200 million above first quarter performance. Now moving to Slide 7. As we navigate the cycle and execute on our long-term strategic actions, Dow remains committed to our culture of transparency, accountability and benchmarking. Today, we published the results of our annual benchmarking update, once again demonstrating our strong performance and value creation relative to our peers. The results can be found on our investor website. Dow came in well ahead of pure average and broader S&P 500 with continued attractive 3-year average free cash flow and dividend yields. This reflects our commitment to industry-leading cash generation and shareholder remuneration across the economic cycle. Our 3-year EBITDA margins and return on invested capital are above the peer median with return on invested capital, 200 basis points above our 13% target across the economic cycle. We also delivered best-in-class net debt reduction since 2019, which allows us to deliver on our capital allocation priorities even at the bottom of the cycle. Our achievements in these areas point to our continued discipline and financial flexibility. As a result, Team Dow has set the stage for us to drive earnings growth and increase shareholder returns through the cycle. With that, I'll turn it back to Jim. James Fitterling : Thank you, Jeff. Moving to Slide 8. Dow is well positioned to capture demand and drive earnings growth as the economic recovery takes hold. This is reflected in our competitive advantages and early cycle growth investments which are advancing while also demonstrating Dow's continued focus on operational and financial discipline. And we have a differentiated portfolio with structurally advantaged assets, global scale and low-cost positions in every region. Healthy oil-to-gas spreads, supported by growing natural gas and NGL production in North America, favor our cost advantage and ability to capture continued margin improvements as the economic recovery gathers strength. We've also taken actions to grow Dow's earnings as we execute our near-term, higher-value, lower-risk growth investments that are expected to deliver approximately $2 billion in incremental underlying EBITDA by mid-decade. Since 2021 we have added capacity that will increase our mid-cycle EBITDA by approximately $800 million, including investments in our FCDh unit in Louisiana and our [indiscernible] capacity investments in the United States and Europe that serve attractive market segments such as consumer nondurables and pharma. In addition, we have invested in multiple downstream silicone debottlenecks to address fast-growing applications in MobilityScience and electronics. We are on track to achieve the remaining $1.2 billion of our near-term EBITDA target by mid-decade, enabled by our lower risk and higher return growth projects. These investments represent a significant portion of Dow's earnings growth in the next up cycle. Moving to Slide 9. Dow continues to execute with financial and operational discipline as we invest through the bottom of the chemical industry's economic cycle for long-term profitable growth. Our near-term growth and efficiency investments continue to progress with our propylene glycol expansion in Thailand achieving mechanical completion this month. We are also making good progress on our Decarbonize & Grow strategy, including our Path2Zero project in Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta. Construction began earlier this month, where we're installing the first of approximately 4,000 piles that will anchor the foundation of our new net zero cracker. In addition, all long lead time equipment items have been ordered, further demonstrating our consistent focus on locking in cost efficiencies for this project. We also entered into a long-term agreement with Pembina, a leading ethane supply and transportation provider, to supply and transport up to 50,000 barrels per day of ethane. With this latest agreement, we have secured the majority of our cost-advantaged ethane supply with multiple suppliers in the region. Overall, I expect the Path2Zero project to deliver an additional $1 billion per year in mid-cycle EBITDA growth at full run rates over the economic cycle. In addition, we continue to advance circularity through our Transform the Waste strategy via strategic partnerships and offtake agreements. This includes a recent joint development agreement with Procter & Gamble, which will create a new recycling technology aimed at converting hard-to-recycle plastic packaging into recycled polyethylene. The result will be near virgin quality and lower greenhouse gas emissions than virgin polyethylene. All in, we expect our Transform the Waste initiatives to generate more than $500 million of incremental run rate EBITDA by 2030. Turning to Slide 10. Our actions since 2019 have created a stronger Dow. Over the past 5 years, we have worked hard to improve our balance sheet, to improve cash flow conversion and to build a more resilient company that maintains consistent discipline. This was demonstrated when we delivered $12.4 billion in peak EBITDA in 2021, higher than any other time frame in Dow's history. This has created the opportunity for us to invest strategically at the bottom of the cycle for long-term profitable growth. And as implementation of our growth strategy increases our underlying EBITDA, we will continue to target at least 65% of operating net income to shareholders as we move up the next peak. This means at least 45% in dividends and 20% in share buybacks. Closing on Slide 11, I want to thank you for your interest and ownership in Dow. The team and I look forward to engaging with many of you on our 2024 Investor Day on May 16. As a reminder, the event will be hosted from the New York Stock Exchange. It will also be available via live webcast. More information can be found on our website at investors.dow.com. During the event, we will share progress on Dow's commitment to improve underlying earnings by greater than $3 billion by 2030 that will enable raising the mid-cycle as well as the trough and peak earnings levels. We'll demonstrate our consistent commitment to operational and financial discipline, our capital allocation priorities and our leadership in attractive market verticals. And we'll show how, taken together, this creates significant value creation as we grow earnings and enhance shareholder returns over the cycle. Before I turn it over to Pankaj, he mentioned at the top of the call that we have our incoming Vice President of Investor Relations, Andrew Riker, joining us today. I'd like to take a minute to congratulate Andrew as he takes charge and to thank Pankaj for leading the Investor Relations team over the last 3 years and also for his contributions to our upcoming Investor Day. Pankaj, we look forward to seeing your achievements in your next role leading our Dow Industrial Solutions business. With that, Pankaj, please get us started with the Q&A. Pankaj Gupta : Thank you, Jim. Now let's move on to your questions. I would like to remind you that our forward-looking statements apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. Operator, please provide the Q&A instructions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Hassan Ahmed at Alembic Global. Hassan Ahmed : Jim, a quick question around global ethylene and polyethylene supply-demand fundamentals. On the surface, as I sort of take a look at global utilization rates, they seem relatively slack. But then as one sort of thinks through marginal producer economics, I mean, they seem pretty weak right now and we're obviously hearing more and more announcements of capacity closures, out in Europe. So how do you see utilization rates pan out in '24 and beyond? James Fitterling : Hassan, good question. I would say, obviously, there are differences around the globe depending on the cost positions. And we have a footprint that is very highly advantaged in North America and Latin America and the Middle East. Europe is right now where you've seen most of the focus on supply reductions with a couple of announcements of crackers being shut down. I'd also say China, there's a lot of pressure on operating rates there because the cash margins are negative and have been negative for some time and there's a big arbitrage window open between the United States and China. And so all of those things have really led to much higher operating rates in the cost-advantaged regions. And even in Europe, where we had LPG cracking flexibility in the first quarter and propane was still a little bit high in first quarter but that advantage led to higher operating rates for us in Europe. Our overall operating rates jumped about 10 percentage points in Europe in the first quarter. So I think if you've got a cost advantage position, things are looking pretty good. Europe is a little bit islanded off right now because of the tensions in the Middle East and the Red Sea effect from shipping. And so it's relying on its domestic production for the market growth and there has been some volume growth there. And the Middle East, that has been focused more on Asian demand. So I feel good about it. All of the -- most of the new capacity is in the market already and we're seeing volume growth, second consecutive quarter of volume growth. And we're starting to see year-over-year volume growth numbers. So it feels like we're starting to turn the quarter a little bit. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. David Begleiter : Jim, last quarter, you gave a bit of an earnings walk up to about $6.4 billion, $6.5 billion of EBITDA this year. Do you still believe that number is achievable, if not beatable, given the solid Q1 results? James Fitterling : David, I think with the first quarter results and the $200 million that Jeff mentioned on the call, we're right on track. I would add that, as you go into third quarter, now that we'll have another $100 million from the restart of Glycol 2 in Plaquemine, so $100 million third quarter, $100 million fourth quarter kind of numbers. So we're starting to see that run rate and that run rate right in line with what we need to deliver that $6.4 billion. And then I would say the underlying chemical demand, I talked about in last quarter, it felt like destocking slowed. Inventory levels for us in December were lowest they've ever been. They continue to be low at the end of first quarter and chemical production and chemical shipments are up. And so when you look at those numbers, you say this volume growth right now feels like it's demand driven, not restocking driven. And so I think as we start to move up this thing, hopefully, the economy keeps with us here and we start to see us pick up some momentum on this trend. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Vincent Andrews : If I could just ask, in the PSP guidance for 2Q and that step up to $150 million, can you just walk us around the world and tell us sort of how you're bridging that $150 million? James Fitterling : Yes. Vincent, thank you. And it's mostly a step-up in integrated margins. I think we're looking at about $0.03 a pound globally in integrated margin increase. North America -- Europe may be a little bit more than [ 3 ], rest of the world is pretty flat. We've got, obviously, kind of a one-time improvement. We had Bah\u00eda Blanca down, as mentioned, in the first quarter -- for part of first quarter to the -- beginning of it because of the storm they had in December. But it's back. And so you'll see a $25 million improvement there. So those 2 positives are $175 million. We have higher turnaround costs in the quarter. We're doing the turnaround at Sabine this quarter. That's about $75 million. So net-net, you've got about $100 million up in P&SP for the second quarter. And the volume numbers are good. The margin numbers are good. Exports are good out of the U.S. Gulf Coast. Product is flowing. Operating rates are good. So we're starting to see the positive impacts of all those things. Operator : Your next question comes from Frank Mitsch from Fermium Research. Frank Mitsch : And let me also echo my congratulations to Pankaj. Best wishes in Industrial Solutions. Jim, I was wondering if you could talk about operating rates across the Dow portfolio in general. How has that -- that appears to be one of the positives in the quarter. If you could offer some commentary on your expectations for the Dow engine in 2Q and beyond on the operating rate front. James Fitterling : Sure. Yes, happy to do that, Frank. I'd say globally, at a high level, we were at about 6% which is up quarter-over-quarter. It's -- higher demand obviously drove that, lower energy costs in Europe were a big driver of that as well. The United States Gulf Coast, Argentina, Canada have been running at well north of 80%, some as high as 90% kind of rates. Europe saw the biggest individual step-up, as I mentioned previously but all regions saw a step up in rates. And so I'm optimistic that, that's just a sign of underlying demand coming. So you'd probably think -- I think I mentioned like about 10 percentage points up. That's good ballpark for the whole global number with North America, Latin America being -- continue to be strong and high rates and Europe being a big part of that step up. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Byrne from Bank of America. Steve Byrne : I wanted to ask a question about the hydrogen-fueled cracker you're building in Alberta. And then you also have the investments with the Mura pyrolysis feedstock. For those investments, how would you expect the unit costs of those downstream crackers to compare to, say, Texas-9 on a unit cost? And to drive the return on those projects, do you have sales agreements for the product at a premium price? James Fitterling : Steve, on the hydrogen-fueled cracker, we recover part of the higher unit costs there through the price on carbon. And the team is working on as well, trying to get the premium pricing for that offtake. And I would say our view on that is that it will be there. There's a strong demand for low-carbon emission products, ethylene-based materials. And so we're working on that right now. But the returns on that project are going to be equal or greater than Texas-9 all in. And so when you take a look at it, we are very optimistic about where we're going to be with that project .  And Texas-9 was one of the projects that obviously led us to be able to deliver the $12.4 billion in peak earnings in that 2021, 2022 time frame. So I feel good about that. Again, remember, because of the scale and because of the fact that we get the hydrogen and methane as byproducts off the back of the cracker, the incremental cost is coming through the autothermal reformer, which, part of that is recovered through the price on carbon. And then we have long-term ITCs, investment tax credits, from Canada for that low carbon investment. Those 2 things will make it very competitive with Texas-9. On Mura, Mura will be focused on, primarily on looking at the recycle demand, at which the supply for recycled polyethylene right now is much shorter than the demand. And so there are premiums in the market today for those materials. And the Mura process, in our view, is one of the more highly profitable ones because it uses the supercritical steam to change the product back into a monomer state. So we feel good about the start-up of that project. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Josh Spector from UBS. Joshua Spector : I was wondering if you could share some thoughts on free cash flow for '24 since you kind of reiterated your expectations there on EBITDA. How do you see that tracking? And any update you can provide on any of the nonoperating items that you thought could bridge free cash flow for this year as well? James Fitterling : Jeff, do you want to walk through what you think the free cash flow outlook is for the year? And I would just say, Josh, the one thing we have to remember, as we're turning the corner here, December was the low point from a pricing standpoint and we've seen successive improvements January, February, March. So we go from a use of cash -- a source of cash in the fourth quarter to use of cash in the first quarter. But as we make that turn and earnings improve, we'll start generating the free cash flow out of higher earnings. Jeffrey Tate : Yes. Well said, Jim. Josh, building on Jim's statement there, the other thing I would mention is that we've also started to see, as the volumes have been improving, we're seeing sales ramp up and we saw the sales ramp up throughout the quarter. So our receivables are also ramping up as well from a working capital standpoint. We're also going into a heavy turnaround period as well, which we anticipated. So all of this is in line with our expectations and our projections, especially for the first half of the year in terms of the working capital uses of cash that we would expect and have. But as Jim mentioned, as we go into the second half of the year, we continue to see the volume growth and the volume ramp-up in the sales leading to earnings growth that will get us into a really good position as we think about our cash flow on a full year basis. And we'll continue to have what we like to call unique to Dow, cash levers. If you look over the past several years, we have had anywhere from $1 billion to almost $3 billion on an annual basis of cash levers that we've identified and executed on. And you can expect that to be very similar in 2024. As we work on our Nova judgment, which we've talked about in the past, we continue to evaluate a number of our nonproduct producing assets that we have across our portfolio as well. And we're going to continue to focus on structural working capital improvements that we can make while also looking at opportunities to get cash out of our joint ventures. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Sison from Wells Fargo. Michael Sison : Nice quarter. Congrats, Pankaj, again. In terms of 2Q volumes, will Hydrocarbons & Energy be a headwind again? And I guess, how much, I'm just curious on sort of the core volume growth for PSP. And then just quickly curious on siloxanes if -- why you think there could be improvement in 2Q versus 1Q? James Fitterling : Sure. I think on Hydrocarbons & Energy, I would say, as we went into first quarter because we had -- obviously Bah\u00eda had been impacted by the storm and because we had the arbitrage, obviously, to China and wanted to move more product. We elected not to move materials into the broader market and just focus on higher operating rates. So sometimes byproduct sales are not as high off the crackers, especially for cracking light like we were in Europe and in North America. And so that leads to less volume of byproducts to sell. And sometimes, it's running the derivatives harder. As I mentioned, volume was up 5% on derivatives since first quarter and that was just -- we were moving that ethylene through the derivatives and making more product. I expect that will continue. So we might see Hydrocarbons & Energy be a little bit less but I think you're going to see improved margins on those volumes. And the team is working hard to continue to deliver on the volume growth numbers. We had a very good first quarter result and we've got strong volume as part of that second quarter number plus the higher integrated margins. So I'd say price in China has moved up and demand for the downstream products is good, especially when you think about things like electronics, even continuing into automotive, hybrids and EVs both drive good demand, data centers, chips, thermal management for silicones is big. So the only thing that's a little bit slow is on the construction side. And so you've got higher operating rates in China. You've got better siloxane pricing. We've got personal care markets that are moving into positive territory. So I would say, before we even see a big step up in building and construction, those are already starting to improve. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan. Jeffrey Zekauskas : In your Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure forecast, you have sales going up sequentially 1% or 2% and you've got your EBITDA flat sequentially. And normally, there's seasonal strength in the various construction markets. Why is your forecast so conservative? And then secondly for Jeff, how many shares will be issued? Or what's the amount of options and shares issued that will affect the share count in 2024? James Fitterling : Jeff, I think the biggest thing, when you look from first quarter to second quarter on II&I is because of the Glycol 2 situation in Plaquemine. We had some insurance recoveries in the first quarter that don't recur in the second quarter. So that creates what looks like a bit of a headwind. I think the underlying business is good and the underlying demand is good. If you look at Polyurethanes & Construction Chemicals, obviously, we've seen a step up in Europe and in operating rates. Sadara is also doing more of the marketing of some of those materials and so we see a little bit less volume coming through Sadara, from Dow marketing the Sadara offtake. So that has a little bit of an impact. But I would say -- our view is, we're still seeing construction slightly better and we're seeing, obviously, Europe much better cost position and that's driving the improved operating rates and just that insurance delta is probably the biggest thing. Jeff? Jeffrey Tate : Jeff, in terms of the issuances for the full year and this then captures options, deferred stock, 401(k) plan as well as Dow employee stock purchase plans. We're looking at approximately 11 million shares on a full year basis. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy from Vertical Research Partners. Kevin McCarthy : Jim, I'd like to ask you about your thoughts on the likely pace of capacity rationalization across the global ethylene chain. You mentioned the cash negative margins in China today. Obviously, we've seen some of your competitors announce rationalizations in Europe in recent weeks. So my question would be, relative to prior cycles, do you think we're likely to see more supply come out of the equation this cycle, based on a combination of the current energy regime in Europe and obviously a powerful drive to decarbonize? James Fitterling : Kevin, always hard to predict exactly the pace that things are happening. But we've been under pressure on -- the high-cost assets have been under pressure from a cash cost standpoint for some time. So we're -- it's normal around this time you would start to see retirements. The thing that we should consider when we're looking at our assets likely to be retired, the age of the assets and the older the asset in general, you get a couple of things, those unit costs are not as competitive. It's maintenance costs start to ramp up. And so you have to question putting in big maintenance dollars on top of that asset. And then depending on the environment you're in, CO2 and the emissions off of those assets and what does that do to you longer term because there is a cost in Europe, obviously, for CO2. And if you're not going to abate that, then you have to take long-term decisions about that. So I think that's why Europe has seen the first moves. And obviously, as we've talked about before, there are a lot of policies in Europe that are continuing to drive costs up. So we've seen it not just in petrochemicals but we see it in steel. We see it in other energy-intensive industries. I think we've been fortunate that we are advantaged in Europe because of our ability to crack LPGs and that's helped us tremendously. In China, some of those assets are newer and a lot of state-owned enterprises there. So it may not be at a pace that you would see the changes in Europe. But we just have to keep an eye on that. I think nobody wants to run when you're bleeding the kind of cash that we're talking about, between $100 and $200 a ton. That's pretty ugly territory. So I think you'll continue to see some changes. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander from Jefferies. Kevin Estok : This is Kevin Estok on for Laurence. Just to touch back on silicone trends. I was just wondering if you guys have seen any visibility into restocking in Europe and whether you've seen maybe any green shoots in construction globally. James Fitterling : No, I haven't seen big signs of restocking in Europe. I would say on construction trends, we are starting to see some positive things happening. When you take a look at existing home sales, even though some of the year-over-year trends are down, we're starting to see some marginal improvements, building permits are starting to tick up, which is good. So new homes -- there's a need for new homes in North America for sure. And so you're going to start to see that demand. And what the team says to me is that when we start to see interest rate declines, we see a couple of interest rate declines in a row, you tend to start to see a pretty immediate uptick in the downstream demand for products that are in our polyurethanes business, our silicones business or coatings business. So we're watching closely for that. But I feel like this is more underlying demand driven, some of the markets I talked about earlier, electronics, data centers, automotive, anything that has to deal with energy and thermal management. Those have been strong. Personal care is strong. Fair amount goes into infrastructure. Infrastructure is obviously still good. So as soon as we see some pickup in the housing, I think we're going to start to see another step change. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer from Goldman Sachs. Patrick Fischer : Yes. Just a question around your coatings and monomers business. You had volumes up but when you look at a lot of your big competitors -- or not competitors, customers who have announced already, PPG, Sherwin, [indiscernible],  their revenue was all down in Q1. What's your sense for what's happening in the coatings market this year? Are you guys overshipping, do you think, in Q1 for where the demand level for paints will be this year? And then just how do you see pricing trending in that business for you guys? James Fitterling : Yes, Duffy. I don't think there's any overshipping or stocking going on there. I think, obviously, some customers are more exposed to the contractor business and that's very much driven by new homes and new construction. And then there's the DIY segment. And we're pretty heavily impacted by the DIY segment, so painting existing homes or when existing homes are sold. And so we tend to see that -- that bottom tends to help us. I think, obviously, we had a very strong fourth quarter. We had some turnaround activity in first quarter and still had pretty good numbers. So I think we're well positioned for the peak of the season and second and third quarter. And also some of the monomers demand from time to time can be an added positive on that. And so it doesn't all necessarily mean it's downstream coatings. Some of the monomers going into other markets could help us out a little bit, too. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Roberts from Mizuho. John Roberts : And congrats as well to both Pankaj and Andrew on the new roles. Jim, there were some reports about European warehouses and ports being jammed again with your customers' products. Do you think there's supply chain inventory building again downstream in Europe? James Fitterling : Any particular products, John, that you're thinking of? John Roberts : Just the economic magazines are talking about because of the Red Sea issues, just a lot of safety stock, I guess, being built up again across some supply chains. James Fitterling : I see. I haven't seen it in plastics for sure. I don't know if we've seen any of that in polyurethanes or construction chemicals. Our days of inventory are low. I mean, we're at 41 days of sales in inventory, which is 1 day better than we were in fourth quarter. So I'm certainly not seeing it in our case. And we're pretty focused in Europe on the domestic market. We're not -- we don't rely on Europe as an export hub. So I think that's to our advantage there. The Red Sea, I believe, is going to be the way it is for the next -- for the rest of the year probably. I mean, if things were resolved today, I think it would take about 6 months for the shipping channels to move back around. So I'll just -- we'll just have to keep an eye on it. It hasn't had an impact on us so far. And we're not exporting out of there. So -- and we're still expecting good operating rates in second quarter. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Cunningham from Citigroup. Patrick Cunningham : You called increased demand in functional polymers for the first time in a few quarters. Can you speak to some of the specific areas of strength or products for which you're seeing increased demand? And you've also called it out as the source of some higher return, high EBITDA contribution, incremental growth projects. How meaningful is that benefit in 2024? James Fitterling : Yes. Functional Polymers is going to primarily be driven by infrastructure markets. You think wire and cable is big, automotive is big, golf balls is a big part of it. Footwear sales are improved. So all those areas are very robust. I'd say the power demand, electric -- you hear about it, AI, data centers but just beyond that, the energy transition, electric grids, installations of new, it could be wind, it could be offshore wind, it could be a solar farm, it could be a telecom center, it could be a data center, it could be replacement of wiring in the existing grid. All of that takes the products that we sell and we're the market leader in wire and cable jacketing. So that's been big. And then I think we're kind of set up for year-over-year movements on footwear, which was a little bit slow last year. And then infrastructure also would include things tied to -- imagine membranes for aligning water basins, water treatment basins, membranes for roofing replacement. We do a lot of membranes into cool roofing for building efficiencies. So when you put a new flat roof on a building, you'll see a lot of these very white, light color roofs. We work with our customers who make that material and install those. There's a high demand for that and that's continued and commercial building and retrofits of anything from an energy efficiency standpoint still continues to be high. Solar PV, I should mention, we've got a big new piece of business for solar PV encapsulation. And we put on some of the outer layers that protect the solar panels. And so this is a product that is very durable and long-lasting and it's really picked up over the last couple of years. So those would be the big drivers. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Parkinson from Wolfe Research. Christopher Parkinson : So Jim, there's been a lot of back and forth in the buy and the sell side communities about the $0.03 increase for April and then obviously some preliminary ideas for May. Just, where we stand right here, right now, given the U.S. macro, given where you anticipate USGC operating rates to be on a sequential basis, what's Dow's view of this? We all know what the consensus view is but what's your view in terms of how things play out during the second quarter and how that ultimately sets the tone for the second half? James Fitterling : We're moving up in the second quarter. I would say it almost moved up that $0.03 at the end of the first quarter. And the numbers have continued. The macroeconomic indicators have continued to get stronger, not weaker. So I think with the volume that we're seeing on the downstream derivatives with improved economic business and the consumer still being strong, I think you're going to see it move up in the second quarter. So I think we're very firm on the [ 3 ] April. And as I mentioned, we started at the low point at the end of December and we just saw steady improvement through the first quarter. And so I think we're off to start the second quarter at a much higher rate and see some momentum as we move through that quarter. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Leithead from Barclays. Michael Leithead : I wanted to ask a follow-up to an earlier question on cash flow, maybe for Jeff. I guess, if you hit your EBITDA targets for this year, are you forecasting working capital to be a use of cash or a source of cash this year and to roughly what magnitude? James Fitterling : Mike, yes, we are actually looking at it still being a use of cash on a full year basis as we work our way through, again, the recovery for a number of the dynamics that I mentioned earlier in relation to Josh's question here. But again, as we see the earnings improve based on the volume improvements that we're anticipating, right, we will start to turn that corner. But coming from where we're coming from on our working capital today, it will be a use of cash on a full year basis. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Aleksey Yefremov from RBC Capital -- sorry, KeyBanc Capital Markets. Aleksey Yefremov : I want to come back to silicones. Was the improvement that you saw more on the upstream silicone side or downstream? And as a follow-up, where are your downstream silicones margins relative to your mid-cycle expectations? And  therefore, what's the sort of optionality for downstream silicones improvement? James Fitterling : Aleksey, it's from both. We saw better demand on siloxanes and better pricing and we saw better downstream. We saw improvements in building and infrastructure, which were primarily seasonality driven. We saw gains in personal care. We saw gains in industrial and chemical processing, where some of the products are used as intermediates. We saw gains in mobility and we saw gains in consumer electronics. So all the downstream markets were up. The siloxanes demand was up. The operating rates were up. The pricing on siloxanes were up. So it was pretty balanced on both sides. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets. Arun Viswanathan : I hope you guys are well and good working with you, Pankaj, as well. And so I guess my question is, you're on a run rate now of, say, $6.3 billion, $6.4 billion, $6.5 billion of annual EBITDA. Do you still think maybe mid-cycle level is around $8 billion? And if that is the case, how do you bridge kind of going from $6.5 billion to $8 billion, is that -- that $1.5 billion, would -- are there any discrete items maybe that you'd call out as far as capacity additions? Or is it mainly going to be volume recovery based? Jeffrey Tate : Yes, Arun, I think you're right on top of the run rate. So no comments there. I do think mid-cycle -- I mean, our view of mid-cycle is probably closer to $9 billion. And so to get to that mid-cycle run rate, obviously, we have to have another couple of step-ups to get there. Volume is a big part of it. So as I mentioned, all the projects, on the call that some that we've already put in place that equal $800 million of the step-up and the rest that we're in flight right now, that's another $1.2 billion of step-up. So that $2 billion of improved margins is all volume. And most of that CapEx is either been or will be finished this year and beginning of next year. So I feel good about that. Obviously, the Path2Zero in Alberta comes later. So I think you can see that $1 billion more towards as we're getting to the next peak. That's a '27 to '29 time frame where that's coming in, '27 is Phase 1, '29 is Phase 2. And so if we've got our timing right and that's what we intended, was we got that up and running before we get into the next peak. And so I think we've got the line of sight to the volume that's going to come from here to mid-cycle. When we get to Investor Day on May 16, we're going to unpack all that volume and that trajectory. And then we've got the line of sight into the stuff that gets us greater than $3 billion by 2030, which is next peak type economics. And from where we are, that's excellent growth rates for both of them. And so I feel like we've been through the worst of it here on the slowdown in the cycle. And so it should be more upside than downside from here out. Operator : That concludes our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the conference back over to Pankaj Gupta for closing remarks. Pankaj Gupta : Thank you, Christa and thanks, everyone, for joining our call and we appreciate your interest in Dow. For your reference, a copy of our transcript will be posted on Dow's website within 48 hours. This concludes our call. Thanks once again. Operator : This concludes today's conference call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Dow Inc. 2024 Earnings Report. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I will now like to turn the conference over to Andrew Riker. Andrew, the floor is yours. Andrew Riker : Good morning. Thank you for joining today. The accompanying slides are provided through this webcast and posted on our website. I am Andrew Riker, Dow's Investor Relations Vice President. Leading today's call are Jim Fitterling, Dow's Chair and Chief Executive Officer, and Jeff Tate, Chief Financial Officer. Please note our comments contain forward-looking statements and are subject to the related cautionary statements contained in the earnings news release and slides. Please refer to our public filings for further information about principal risk and uncertainties. I must otherwise specify that all financials where applicable exclude significant items. We will also refer to non-GAAP measures. The reconciliation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures are contained in the earnings news release and slides that are posted on our website. On slide two is our agenda for today's call. Jim will review our second quarter results and operating segment performance. Jeff will then share an update on the macroeconomic environment and modeling guidance, followed by a discussion on how our proven playbook will advance our near-term priorities and support growth. Jim will then provide more color on key milestones for our long-term strategy, including how we will capture earnings upside as macroeconomic conditions improve. Following that, we will take your questions. Now, let me turn the call over to Jim. Jim Fitterling : Thank you, Andrew. Beginning on slide three, in the second quarter, team Dow delivered sequential top and bottom line growth, as well as the third consecutive quarter of year-over-year volume growth. We achieved this despite a slower-than-expected global macroeconomic recovery, particularly in areas like building and construction and consumer durables. Net sales were $10.9 billion, down 4% versus the year ago period and up 1% sequentially, driven by gains in packaging and specialty plastics and performance materials and coatings. Volume increased 1% versus the year ago period with gains led by the United States and Canada. Excluding hydrocarbons and energy sales, which were down primarily due to lighter feed slate cracking in Europe, volume increased 4%. Sequentially, volume increased 1% with gains in all regions except Asia Pacific, which was flat. Local price decreased 4% year-over-year. Sequentially, local price increased 1% led by gains in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and India or EMEA. Operating EBIT was $819 million, up $145 million sequentially, reflecting gains in packaging and specialty plastics and performance materials and coatings. Cash flow from operations was $832 million on higher earnings and an efficient release of working capital, resulting in an 85% cash flow conversion on a trailing 12-month basis. Our focus on cash flow generation enabled $691 million in returns to shareholders, including $491 million through dividends and $200 million in share repurchases. In June, we published our 2023 Intersections Progress Report. This report showcases the positive impact that we are making on the environment and society and importantly, how those actions support long-term profitable growth. Now turning to our operating segment performance on slide four. In the packaging and specialty plastic segment, operating EBIT was $703 million, down $215 million a year-over-year, this was driven by lower integrated margins, higher planned maintenance activity, and lower non-recurring licensing sales. Local peak declines were due to lower downstream polymer prices, primarily in Asia Pacific. Volume decreased year-over-year as higher demand for functional polymers and polyethylene was more than offset by lower merchant hydrocarbon sales, primarily due to lighter feed slate cracking in Europe. Sequentially, operating EBIT increased by $98 million, primarily due to higher integrated margins behind both price and volume gain. Moving to the Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure segment, operating EBIT was $7 million, an improvement of $42 million versus the year-ago period. Results were driven by improved equity earnings, partly offset by lower integrated margins. Local price declined year-over-year, but volume was up, driven by gains in polyurethane and construction chemicals. Sequentially operating EBIT decreased $80 million, driven by higher planned maintenance activity and higher equity losses, as well as lower volumes. And in the performance materials and coating segment, operating EBIT was $146 million, up $80 million, compared to the year-ago period, driven by broad-based business and geographic volume growth. Local price declined year-over-year, but volume was up, driven by gains in both businesses and all geographic regions. Sequentially operating EBIT increased to $105 million, driven by volume and price gains in both businesses and lower planned maintenance activity. Now I'll turn it over to Jeff to review our outlook and share some examples of our playbook in action. Jeff Tate : Thank you, Jim. And good morning to everyone joining our call today. Moving to slide five, in the near-term, we expect macro-dynamics to remain largely unchanged. While global manufacturing PMI has been positive since February 2024, the pace of the global economic recovery has decelerated slightly. This is primarily led by China, where economic growth in the second quarter was lower than the market expected. Overall, we continue to keep a close eye on the weight of inflation on U.S. consumer, global interest rates, and geopolitical tensions. Looking across our four market verticals, packaging demand is seeing global growth, primarily in the U.S. and Canada as the industry experiences robust domestic and export demand for polyethylene. In Europe, soft demand across the value chain is reflected in manufacturing PMI levels, which despite stabilizing, remain in contractionary territory. And in Asia, packaging demand has remained steady, but the reason has been impacted by poor congestion and rising transportation costs. Infrastructure demand, primarily residential construction, continues to be soft across most regions. In June, existing U.S. home sales, which tend to drive residential paint sales for both buyers and sellers, were below prior year levels. And building permits were down slightly year-to-date through June. Eurozone construction PMI remains in contractionary territory and declined to 41.8 last month, down from 42.9 in May. And in China, new home prices were down 4.5% year-over-year in June. Consumer spending has shown resilience in most regions except Europe where consumer confidence remained negative in July. In the U.S., retail sales are up 2.3% year-to-date through June, but furniture and bedding sales remain low. In China, retail sales increased by 2% year-over-year in June, but marked the first month of deceleration since July 2023. And in mobility, China auto production was down 2.1% year-over-year in June amidst the potential for tariff increases and flow to materialized incentives. In the U.S., auto sales were down year-over-year in June after increasing by more than 2% in May. Against this backdrop, we delivered the third consecutive quarter of year-over-year volume growth and will continue to leverage our differentiated portfolio to capitalize on areas of demand strength, while maintaining operating and financial discipline. And I'll touch on these actions in more detail shortly. Now turning to our outlook on slide six. We expect third quarter earnings to be slightly above second quarter performance, continuing our string of sequential improvement. We experience minimal disruption from Hurricane Berly in the U.S. Gulf Coast, and we expect the positive sequential signals in some markets will continue. In the packaging, especially plastic segment, we expect modest top line sequential growth. Domestic and export demand for polyethylene in North America will remain robust, and EMEA will experience typical lower demand seasonality from the summer holidays. In addition, the completion of our cracker turnaround into being Texas in the second quarter will be offset by another planned turnaround at our St. Charles, Louisiana cracker in the third quarter. In the industrial, intermediates and infrastructure segment, market conditions remain mixed. Demand in energy and pharma end markets remains resilient, but consumer durable demand has not shown any significant signs of inflection. We expect an approximately $25 million headwind due to the planned maintenance activity in the U.S. Gulf Coast. Importantly, at the end of June, we successfully started up our glycol 2 facility at Louisiana operations, which will ramp through the quarter and provide a sequential tailwind of $75 million. In the performance materials and coating segment, we continue to see growth in downstream silicone applications across most end markets, but the siloxane prices are still under pressure. Lower seasonal demand for building and construction end markets are expected to be a headwind of approximately $50 million, while lower planned maintenance activity will contribute a $25 million tailwind. Moving to slide seven. As we navigate the current market conditions, we are focused on executing our proven playbook to deliver increased value over the cycle. We benefit from our global asset footprint with leading positions in every region. This is particularly true in the cost-advantaged America, where approximately 65% of our global production capacity is located, and we expect to reach 70% by 2030. With leading low-cost feedstock positions, trust our industry-leading feedstock flexibility, Dow is well positioned to capture growing global demand for our products. And supported by our solid financial position, we remain on track to deliver our countercyclical growth investments. Team Dow continues to operate with discipline as we maintain our low cost to serve mindset, focus on maximizing cash flow, and further strengthen our financial positions. Our actions include continued de-risking of our pension liabilities with minimal, if any, cash outlay. In fact, this month we initiated the termination process for two of our U.S. pension plans by the end of 2025. While not impacting previously earned benefits, Dow is able to provide a secure, cost-effective way of paying pension benefits and reducing administrative costs and risks to the company. Lastly, in the near-term, we expect to enhance our cash flow generation by executing over $1.5 billion in unique-to-Dow levers. We plan to use the proceeds to support our strategic growth investment, including our Path2Zero project in Fort Saskatchewan. In addition, we expect to receive more than $1.5 billion in cash and tax incentives by 2030, which is closely aligned with our CapEx deployment for the project. With that, I'll turn it back to Jim. Jim Fitterling : Thank you, Jeff. Moving to slide eight, our expectations for 2024 reflect a slower pace of recovery in certain end markets. Dow is positioned to capture more than $3 billion in EBITDA upside as we return to mid-cycle earnings levels. We are encouraged by the positive top line signals across our portfolio. This is demonstrated by our year-over-year volume improvement in the last three quarters, as well as price stabilization across the entire enterprise over that same period. In packaging especially plastics, we anticipate supply demand fundamentals to continue improving as the recent polyethylene capacity builds in North America have been fully absorbed by growing global demand. We're also starting to see rationalization of higher cost assets, particularly in Europe. And going forward, we did not expect to see any new capacity in the cost-advantaged Americas until the 2026, 2027 timeframe. In industrial intermediates & infrastructure, we've maintained a disciplined approach to our inventory management. The beginning of an interest rate cutting cycle will accelerate demand in our polyurethan\u2019s business. In industrial solutions, the majority of our U.S. Gulf Coast capacity is aligned to higher value EO derivatives. With the successful restart of our Glycol-2 facility in Louisiana, we will see positive impact in consumer, mobility, pharma, and energy and markets. And in performance materials and coatings, industry siloxane capacity additions are expected to slow due to prolonged negative cash margins impacting non-integrated players. And lastly, our coatings business is highly correlated to existing home sales with market demand forecasted to see pre-pandemic levels by next year. With these positive indicators combined with an economic recovery, Dow is positioned to capture significant annual earnings upside at mid-cycle levels. Next on slide nine, the work we've done to strengthen our financial foundation has allowed us to invest countercyclically in lower risk, higher return projects that will drive more than $3 billion in annual earnings growth by 2030. Our near-term investments are progressing and remain on track to deliver more than $2 billion of underlying mid-cycle EBITDA by mid-decade. To-date, we have added the capacity to deliver $800 million of that $2 billion. So far this year, we've enhanced our product mix to produce higher value elastomers for photovoltaic films and ethylene copolymers that are site in Tarragona, Spain. We're also advancing multiple downstream silicones debottlenecking projects to support growth for liquid silicone rubber and adhesives. Our team in Fort Saskatchewan is making solid progress on our path to zero project. Phase 1 startup is expected in 2027, and Phase 2 will start up in 2029. The project will deliver an additional $1 billion of either got annually at full run rates by 2030. Construction continued in the second quarter where we started our piling program, which will anchor the foundation of our new net zero cracker. Major foundation work is expected to begin in the third quarter. We're also advancing our transform the waste strategy to deliver more than $500 million in incremental underlying EBITDA by 2030 through partnerships and direct investments. In June, we announced the Dow signed an agreement to acquire Circulus, a leading U.S.-based mechanical recycler. This will help us accelerate our goals, while enabling more high-performance circular products that brands and customers are demanding. We expect a deal which includes two facilities with combined capacity of 50,000 metric tons of recycled materials annually to close in the third quarter. Consistent with our best owner mindset, we also announced in the second quarter that we reached an agreement with Arkema to sell our laminating adhesive business, which is part of the packaging and specialty plastics portfolio. That transaction is expected to close by the fourth quarter of 2024. And lastly, in the second-half of the year, we're planning to commercialize products with greater circularity using offtake from both the Valoregen mechanical and Mura advanced recycling facilities. In closing, on slide 10, Dow remains focused on driving earnings growth by executing our playbook, delivering on our capital allocation priorities, and closely managing costs as we advance our long-term strategy. We're committed to operational and financial discipline. We've delivered returns in past generations better than our peer benchmark and we will maintain our low cost to serve mindset, while capturing high value demand and optimizing margins. Our financial flexibility allows us to invest countercyclically in higher value areas that will raise our underlying earnings and drive circularity. With all of this, Dow is well positioned to create significant upside in top and bottom line growth as cycle dynamics improve and we unlock the full benefit of these investments enabling higher shareholder returns. With that, I'll turn it back to Andrew to get us started with the Q&A. Andrew Riker : Thank you, Jim. Now let's move on to your questions. I would like to remind you that our forward-looking statements apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. Operator, please provide the Q&A instruction. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global. Please go ahead. Hassan Ahmed : Good morning, Jim and Jeff. Just a question around Q3 sequential guidance. Particularly as I sort of take a look at some of the commentary around ENSD, it seems that you guys are looking for relatively flat EBITDA sequentially. Obviously, I understand you guys have the St. Charles cracker sort of planned maintenance, but I'm just trying to get a better sense of what's baked into that guidance from an underlying fundamentals perspective. Meaning, obviously, you guys, the industry has North American Q3 price hikes on the table. It seems inventory levels are down. It seems exports have been sort of steadily picking up. So just if you could give me a sense of beyond your planned maintenance what you guys have baked into those fundamentals for the Q3 guidance? Jim Fitterling : Good morning, and I'm happy [Technical Difficulty]. You know, as we look at the outlook for PNSD end of the third quarter, I do expect [Technical Difficulty] $0.02 on margin improvement there. You've got a combination of [Technical Difficulty] actual numbers there, and direction is correct. We do expect, and we have in the plan, that we expect ethane to be up a $0.01 or $0.02, it is not as instantaneously as we sit here today. What I do expect it will be one of the reasons that gas and methane is so low is because you have free flow [Technical Difficulty] down through the Hurricane Beryl. And that backs up volume here at the Gulf Coast. That's going to reverse itself, but I think when that happens, our expectation is, you'll see some ethane pricing move up. In Europe, we have still positive [Indiscernible] spread, but it's a little bit less than what it was in the second quarter, but it's still very advantageous for us to crack propane. I mentioned cracking white, you know, we cracked white in the quarter, which led to less byproduct sales for cracker byproducts in Europe. But the derivative demand is good. If you look at derivatives volumes, across the board they've been up. Asia was a little bit low in the second quarter, mainly because Asia was pushing a lot of export volumes out, especially in China, to get ahead of some tariff barriers. And that kind of caused some congestion over there. I think that's working itself out and I think we'll see continued strong export environment out of the U.S. Gulf Coast. As you mentioned, inventories are low right now. Inventories are right in line with where they've been historically and exports are very strong. So I do think the environment is there for pricing to take hold in the third quarter. I expect the derivative volumes to be strong. We've got advantage cost positions and operating rates are strong for us. So I think net-net turnarounds won't be any more than they were in the second quarter. I think you'll see some slight improvement in third quarter. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Vincent Andrews : Thank you and good morning everyone. Jim, we'd love to get your sort of high level thoughts on two things that might have opposite reactions. One, it does seem like we're finally going to get into a period where interest rates are going to come down, which I would expect to be broadly positive for your business, particularly your exposure to building and construction. But politically, we may be also re-entering a period geopolitically with tariffs and duties and things like that. So I'm wondering if you can compare and contrast, you know, sort of what the impact of both of those dynamics could be for Dow as we look into 2025? Jim Fitterling : Good morning, Vince, I'm happy to do that. On interest rates, we had expected that by this time, we'd probably have seen two or three interest rate cuts in the year, we haven't seen the first one yet. I do think the expectation is coming. If you look at the housing market, I think you're seeing the weight right now of the high interest rates on housing [Technical Difficulty] new builds [Technical Difficulty] you know and employees that are kind of stacking up on [Technical Difficulty]. And part of it's because people are unable to qualify for mortgages at these higher rates. So I think when we start to see mortgage rates get something with a five-hand on them, we're going to see a couple of things happen. We're going to see people, who have financed mortgages at these higher rates of 7%-plus will get some advantage to do a refinance. We're going to see people who've been sitting on the sidelines with properties they want to sell, move into start to sell them, because people can get qualified for the mortgages. And you've got to start to see building credits increase. In polyurethanes and construction chemicals, when that starts to happen, you get a domino effect that happens. You get both existing ones there and you build starting to build them. That drives volume, and then, of course, anytime you have that, you've got appliances, [Technical Difficulty], all the other things that go on with it. And so that tends to wrap it up pretty quickly. We haven't seen that yet. Obviously teams were managing it closely, but we haven't seen that tick up. On the geopolitics side, yes, I think on -- you do on both sides, on the political spectrum, you're expecting a more percussive tone that we're hearing coming out from both sides. I would say that the big driver behind that is in many cases where a lot of capacity has been built in China, there's enough data to suggest that they're being subsidized and those products are being flooded into other markets. And it\u2019s hard to see anti-dumping cases being brought against China around the world in different areas. And so I think you are going to see activities that are going to try to halt some of that from happening in concert with trying to bring the manufacturing back. Today, most of the manufacturing is going to go into Mexico, if you think about it, from our perspective. We haven't had time to see the impact from semiconductors and other things being invested. That will take a few years to get to market. But I think we're going to see increased rates on a whole host of things. Most of them are in the 25% to 50% range. And most of that is what people believe is the amount of subsidies going on to those markets. So we're prepared for whatever case we get, depending on the outcome of the election. And as always, we just have to get on there and make sure that either side understands the supply chains, how product flows, and what's important to keep industry moving, not just here, but in Europe and around the world. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Steve Byrne : Yes, thank you. And Jim, if you change your audio in some way, it would really be helpful. We're having a really hard time hearing you. I have a couple of questions regarding your slide nine. With respect to your Fort Saskatchewan project, that $1 billion EBITDA on a per pound basis, is that comparable to what you would expect mid-cycle for your existing assets, EBITDA per pound for polyethylene, or is this an expansion? And do you have customer commitments that give you that confidence in that, in the profitability of that and maybe just an extension on this, that 3 million tons of transform the waste, you know, the incremental EBITDA on that per pound, I think there must be a huge range depending on the type of product there, because you have a competitor that has a similar objective and the incremental EBITDA per pound is 3 times this? And I would assume that it's relevant to how much is mechanical versus how much is say paralysis driven do you -- can you comment on where do you see the most profitable outlook in your circular plastic platform? Jim Fitterling : Yes. Thank you, Steve. [Technical Difficulty] Fort Saskatchewan [Technical Difficulty] But in general, it's pretty similar to what we see today. And as I mentioned before, I think the upside there is the ability to get the additional value out of the [Technical Difficulty], and it's zero, so one and two admissions. [Technical Difficulty] Those policy and deliverables, I think of how you catch better data and how you deliver the service to better knowledge. And circularity we believe a combination of mechanical [Technical Difficulty] cycle. I think we still feel that long-term and the two-thirds of our volume is expected to be the best in [Technical Difficulty]. Mainly because we're trying to talk about [customer] (ph) forms, we believe, to get the high quality, which is what we need to get those margins. You guys have to integrate [Technical Difficulty]. On the technical side, when the circular investment is a great position [Technical Difficulty], we're focused on trying to move [Technical Difficulty]. When typically we're not looking at making big investments in the [Technical Difficulty], but I think our ability with that time, I kind of stayed to take the company on a circular and move the quality of that 50,000 tons per [euro] (ph) always up allows us to get the kind of management uplift over those in GE that we need to deliver about 500 more. And so it's going to be different by different markets, but it's all going to be driven by the quality of the material that we produce out of those assets. Certainly the demand is there [Technical Difficulty] is in supply, and upon high quality new type of product. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. David Begleiter : Thank you. Good morning. Jim, you're run rating at roughly $6 billion at EBITDA. Consensus for next year is $7.3 billion. How much of that earnings ramp is in Dow's control? Jim Fitterling : David, the biggest will be what we see in terms of the durable goods market and the housing market coming back. Plastics right now, PNSP, silicones and coatings. I think we have a pretty good line of sight and with Glycol-2 coming back in I-9, we feel good about that. The real question mark will be how quickly does polyurethane\u2019s come back, and that's going to be driven by what happens with interest rates and what happens with the housing and construction. That's not just here. That's Europe and Asia as well. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Jeff Zekauskas : Thanks very much. Maybe a couple of questions for Jeff. Your corporate expense was $30 million this quarter, and you forecast -- $30 million versus $60 million a year ago and you forecast $60 million for the third quarter versus $40 million in the year ago period. Why is that higher increment, why doesn't it stay at the 30 level? And second, you've been repurchasing shares. And that share price has been pretty flat since its inception as a public company. What criteria will you use to determine what their share repurchase is a good use of capital for Dow. How will you judge that? Jeff Tate : Yes, good morning, Jeff. Appreciate the questions here. Starting on the corporate side. When we look at the second quarter, you're right, it was slightly lower, more favorable than what we traditionally had. I would say, as you're thinking about the second-half of the year, going to be pretty much in the range of $60 million to $65 million of negative EBITDA, which we've delivered in past times. What we had in the second quarter was we had actually some gains from our insurance operations as well as some lower environmental cost accruals as well. So when you think about the second-half of the year, you can expect it to be in that $60 million to $65 million range. In relation to share repurchases, you're right, we have continued to trend to cover dilution, and that's one of the things from a capital allocation perspective that we've been consistent with. And as we think about the CapEx ramp-up that we have and our commitment to deliver overall 65% more back to our shareholders -- we're going to stay consistent with that at this point because of the cash flow expectations as well as our ability to be able to manage all of those capital allocation priorities. But we will look at from a criteria perspective, what will give us the greatest return over that time period in comparison to the commitments that we have for our capital allocation prioritization. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Sison with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Mike Sison : Hey, good morning. In the first-half, your free cash flow didn't generate a lot. Could you give us a feel of how much free cash flow you generate in the second-half and maybe for the full-year? Jim Fitterling : Jeff, do you want to take that? Jeff Tate : Yes. Good morning, Mike, thanks for the question. From our perspective, first of all, when you look at the second quarter, we saw some really positive side, where would deliver over $800 million in cash from operations. Our conversion rate was at 55% and our free cash flow was a positive $109 million. All of those are sequential improvements over what we delivered in the first quarter. So we're really trending well. As we think about the full-year, Mike, one of the things that we would act is from a working capital standpoint, you can expect the use of cash anywhere from the $600 million to $800 million range. You've seen in our slide deck here, we got some guidance on some of the other key levers related to full year cash flow. But 1 of the areas where we're pleased about is our ability and the joint ventures to be able to get greater dividends out of debt, which we're focused on moving forward as well as our -- looking at our liquidity right now, we're in a really good position. We've got well over $3 billion of cash and cash equivalents and total liquidity of $13 billion. And right now, we don't have any debt maturities of substantive levels until 2027. And the other thing I'd also like to remind you of as well is the fact that over the past several years, DOW has done a solid job of being able to deliver what we like to call unique-to-Dow cash levers of anywhere from $1 billion to $3 billion. And our expectation is that we'll deliver at least $1.5 billion of those levers here in 2024. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead. Kevin McCarthy : Yes, thank you, and good morning. Can you comment, as you look across your portfolio on the monthly cadence in June, as well as your order books in July. Were there any businesses that stood out varied versus your prior expectations through that period. And on a related note, can you comment on the barrel hurricane impact in the third quarter and whether you're expecting that to have a net positive or negative or neutral impact on the quarter? Thank you. Jim Fitterling : Yes. Good morning, Kevin, we've seen pretty solid order book at the beginning of every month. I would say as we finished the second quarter you'd see then some softness towards the end of the month. July order book looks pretty solid as we move forward. Hurricane Beryl, we were -- we ran most of freeport through the Hurricanes, all the power plants and all the crackers ran through. We obviously had damage electrical lines and cooling towers and things. But within a week, we were back up. So I expect that it's not going to have a significant impact on volumes. There will be some cost impact to it. We're insured for it. But there's a deductible. And I don't remember how much that is, Jeff. Jeff Tate : $50 million. Jim Fitterling : $50 million on the deductible. But Beryl\u2019s, freeport's back up and running. And I'd say that we've gotten most of the issues identified and we're fortunate no impact to our employees or no impact to people other than the normal things that impact their homes, but we jump in and help them out so that they're able to focus on what they need to do. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. John McNulty : Yes, thanks for taking my question. Maybe just a follow-up on Beryl. It didn't hit the way some of the major Hurricanes necessarily take down lots of capacity for long periods, but it does look like a lot of assets were taken down, including your own for at least a week or so. Can you speak to what that did to the market for you and in terms of inventory levels and how you're thinking about what that might mean for pricing in the next couple of months or so? Jim Fitterling : Yes. Good question, John. I think it's -- I think you can already see in the market that it's starting to have some impact of firming things up, because it happened early in the Hurricane cycle and early August or early July is typically not when we would tend to see the first hurricanes come through. We tend to see them more in the August time frame. And so I think what you're seeing is that's firming up the sentiment that there will be price increase moves. I think what you're going to see in terms of impacts are going to be different grade by grade so depending on what derivatives are down and what grades are going to become a little bit tighter. And then you've got some planned downtime that's happening on the third quarter as well. So you've got some plan outages for the third quarter. I'd say we're back up and running hard, trying to catch up to those volumes and get customers stock back up at this point. And there is a little bit of concerns starting to come through the market from customers about being ready for the next impact. Hats off to our team for moving product out in railcars and other areas ahead of it. So we were able to get things positioned to be able to react so that we could keep product moving to customers and we always do a good job of preparing for that and doing things in advance. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Josh Spector with UBS. Please go ahead. Josh Spector : Yes, hi. Good morning. I was wondering if you could give some early thoughts on fourth quarter. So a couple of quarters ago, you thought that there'd be some maybe unseasonal improvement as volumes improve. As we sit today, would you think about a normal seasonal in fourth quarter, call it, down $100 million, $200 million in EBITDA sequentially? Or are there other factors you call out that would buck that trend? Thank you. Jim Fitterling : I think plastics is going to continue to see solid volumes and we've got cost advantage. So I think you're going to continue to see plastics deliver through fourth quarter. Silicones is positive. You could see the impact on volumes in the derivatives part. And because we're fully integrated, we have an advantage there. So silicones, I would think is going to hold up well. II&I is going to improve because we've got Glycol-2 back. We've got $75 million of tailwind in the third quarter. I think that will ramp to closer to $90 million for fourth quarter and get up to the $100 million, which is kind of full run rate by first quarter. And so that's good. I think the coatings had a really solid second quarter. And even though I talked earlier about housing and some of the issues in housing our volumes were very solid there. I think what's working in housing right now is obviously higher value homes, and some of the big homebuilders you can see are actually delivering pretty good numbers. That tends to go through the contract side of the business. So the contract painters are doing better than say the do-it-yourself business that you would see. And so that's a big chunk of the market, and that's moving positively. We're benefiting from that, and we're also getting some share gains there. So I think third quarter will continue to be good for coatings, maybe a little bit less than second quarter. The fourth quarter is typically low season for coatings anyway. And that's when we start to get ourselves prepared with maintenance and other activities. So we're ready to run into next year's season. But on those businesses, I would expect you're going to continue to see strength. On polyurethanes and construction chemicals volumes are improving. You even saw that even with some limitations that we had to turnaround downtime in the quarter. You saw volumes improving. Inventories are well under control. So I think if there are interest rate cuts that happen this quarter and next quarter, you're going to see some positive impact there. And then it will be a question of how much of that will flow to the bottom line. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research. Please go ahead. Frank Mitsch : Thank you, good morning. And happy to hear that the sound quality on the answers has gotten materially better. But I believe the first answer that you gave concerned polyethylene, and that came through fairly garbled. So I was just wondering, Jim, since you were very accurate in forecasting the April price increase. Obviously, June didn't go through, but I'm curious as to what your thoughts are with respect to July and the third quarter in general in terms of polyethylene pricing and margins? And then also on the Glycol-2 restart, there was an expectation that it would add about $100 million in the third quarter and $100 million in the fourth quarter. You're indicating today that it's $75 million in the third quarter, which makes sense as it ramps up, would you anticipate that $100 million coming through in the fourth quarter? Jim Fitterling : Yes, good morning, [Frank] (ph), thanks. They brought me probably another microphone here. So I'm sorry about if the first question wasn't answered or understood well. On pricing, we've got prices out around the world everywhere except Argentina for July and August in North America, we've got plus 5 and plus 5 out in the market. That is going to -- you're going to see price stick in the quarter. So price is going to come through. Now the question is how much of all that comes through? I think what we put into the estimate as we've put in that we're going to see $0.02 per pound margin improvement. So net of price. And as I mentioned, I think ethane costs will come up through the quarter. I think it will come up $0.01 or $0.02 through the quarter, if you look quarter-over-quarter. So I think net of that ethane cost increase, you're going to see a $0.02 per pound margin increase in North America. I'd say volume on derivatives around the world supports that inventory levels support that. And I think there's the outside things that we can't predict, like will we have more hurricane activity, but inventories in the chain are low. So I would expect that it's going to go through. When it comes to Glycol, the start-up was smooth and as expected on Glycol-2. Obviously, we've got to get through the product mix, and we've got to get some safety stocks built back up, and that's part of the ramp-up that happens from $75 million to $90 million to $100 million. Could it ramp up more than 90% in the fourth quarter? I guess it could, I mean, usually year-end, there's a little bit of seasonal slowness. So our expectation is it would probably ramp more into the first quarter, which is when we tend to get into some higher volumes across some of the markets. But that's what we've got in the estimate right now. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Laurence Alexander : Good morning. I just wanted to follow-up on your discussion around potential tariff structures and how they might evolve, how do you think the response function in the industry with your customers has shifted that is if there is movement towards new tariffs, how significant a restock cycle do you see that triggering in advance? Jim Fitterling : I don't think anything has started yet, Laurence, on people doing stocking in advance of tariffs. And I think primarily because there's all the uncertainty around the election and what policies are going to actually stick. I think on the same -- by the same token, I think there's a little bit of view that China doesn't know what it's going to do yet from an incentive standpoint for its own economy until it gets a better feel for what's going to happen with the U.S. presidential election. We're doing scenario planning here to look at the impact. As I mentioned, there are antidumping activities going on in different parts of the world because of challenges that we see from things being -- volumes being dropped into markets. And so there's a lot of work going on behind the scenes. I think that will -- we'll get a clearer picture for that by the end of the year. But right now, I would say I haven't seen any uptick in volumes or stocking because of that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Roberts with Mizuho. Please go ahead. John Roberts : Thank you. Jim or Jeff, I'm looking at slide eight in the top exhibit on volumes. You've had relatively easy year-over-year comparisons for the last three quarters, and then you have that in the third quarter as well. But the fourth quarter begins, I think, more challenging year-over-year comps. If we have normal seasonality, will the fourth quarter be down in volume. Jim Fitterling : I still think you're going to see strength, John, in plastics. I don't remember if silicones had turnaround time in the fourth quarter last year. It should be up based on the downstream demand forecast that we've seen. Normal seasonality, I would expect out of coatings, but I think in plastics and silicone, you're going to see up. And in II&I, because of industrial Solutions and Glycol-2 being back, you're going to see up, the question mark will be how much do we see in terms of demand uptick on durable goods, and that will be what determines whether PU is up or not. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Duffy Fischer : Yes, good morning. Two questions. First, Jim, you made a comment that you thought your coatings raw material business did quite well in Q2. A lot of the paint companies have come out and their volumes seem weak. So can you just kind of triangulate that? And then for Jeff, the other assets and liabilities on the cash flow statement has eaten almost $1 billion of cash so far this year, which is much higher than normal. What is that? And what happens that going forward? Jim Fitterling : Yes. Duffy, I'll take coatings. On coatings mix is part of it. So in addition to our contextual coatings, where, as I mentioned, I think in the contractor space and with the customers who are in that space, we've done quite well. We also saw traffic paint improvements, and that's been driven by infrastructure projects that have gone along and also continue to see good response on the innovation side there. The team has done a great job of getting their assets running well, had great uptime and I think has been delivering on market share gains across that taking advantage of their good cost position. Jeff, on the cash side? Jeff Tate : Yes. Good morning, Duffy. In terms of other assets and liabilities, you're right. The primary driver there is we had a reduction in long-term tax payables related to some of our tax audit reassessment over the period. As you may recall, even in first quarter, we had a significant item more specific to one of our regions as well. So those things were somewhat unique from that vantage point here. So it should stabilize here moving forward. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Cunningham with Citi. Please go ahead. Patrick Cunningham : Hi, good morning. I'm just curious on siloxanes pricing in Asia. Would you characterize this as lingering oversupply issues? Or is just the pace of demand recovery not as strong as expected -- and I think there was maybe a bit more confidence on the pricing environment in the second quarter. Did that revert over the past couple of months? Thank you. Jim Fitterling : Yes. Good question, Patrick. I mentioned on the call, the difference between integrated and non-integrated players, I think some of the weakness you see in siloxanes in Asia is from the non-integrated players and as you say, the capacity overhang that is there. Capacity additions have slowed. So we do think we're going to start to see as we move into next year, some pricing improvement on siloxanes. We've been working to make investments in downstream silicone products, which have all been doing well, and we continue to move that way. Really trying to drive that volume growth for those downstream derivatives and sell less into that merchant siloxanes market and more into the downstream derivatives. And you're seeing that start to come through in the volume in the second quarter. That was one of the big drivers. So that was a big driver, plus the fact that you've seen an improvement in downstream demand in things like consumer electronics. You saw a pretty strong automotive business and still good on the commercial construction side of things, which drives a lot of volume of products. Health and Personal Care has been pretty solid. I'd say we see good volume growth year-over-year, kind of 3%, a little bit more than 3%. Mix is under a little bit of pressure, because consumers are trading brands and trading quality maybe a little bit as they're trying to balance their spending at the grocery store and at the pharmacy. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Leithead with Barclays. Please go ahead. Mike Leithead : Great, thanks. Good morning. Jim, just a bigger picture question. DOW is obviously investing a lot for medium-term growth. You've laid out a lot of 2025 and 2030 expansion targets. But at the same time, the overall demand backdrop since about mid-'22 has probably been materially worse than you or anybody has thought at that time. So as that timing gap between near-term weakness, medium-term growth sort of closes, I mean, 2025 is only five months away now. Does that give you any pause at all in some of your investments? Do you need to rethink or pivot any of these expansions and sort of lower for longer economic scenario? Jim Fitterling : It's a good question, Mike. But I would also ask you to think about it and even a longer-term time frame, it takes years to plan and make these investments. And we have to look at what's happened in plastics take for an example. Since 2019, we've seen a 20% increase in volumes in plastics, you can't obviously respond to the market when you see the increase and start to get this capacity in place. You've got to get in place to take advantage of the mid-cycle and the up cycle ahead of time. So typically, when we're at this point in the cycle, it's a common question that everybody asks, but we've got to look through at the long-term trends and the long-term trends for plastics say the growth is going to continue to be there. We've tried to move into the areas where there is differentiation and there's higher growth rates. Whether that's silicones, whether that's plastics, whether that's industrial solutions on the higher value of specialty EO derivatives where we're investing. That's where the dollars are going. So those three markets are consuming most of your capacity expansion. What we've been doing in polyurethanes is more rationalizing the footprint around the higher-value markets, more downstream less commodity-like PO more MDI containing components. And on coatings, obviously, being able to move with the market as the housing market improves. So I feel good about the long-term direction. We're not back at mid-cycle yet. As we get back to mid-cycle, there's a $3 billion step-up in earnings at mid-cycle margins. And then once path to zero comes on in the '27, '29 time frame, and you get to peak, there's another $3 billion step-up to peak. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Parkinson with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Chris Parkinson : Great, thank you so much. Jim, in your $2 billion of mid-cycle upside for PNSP. I understand there are obviously a lot of moving factors there. But if we stick to the U.S. Can you just offer some insights in terms of what you're expecting in terms of integrated PE margins, just given where the current SD dynamic is, export trends, NGLs. Just any color in terms of kind of getting that back would be especially helpful. Thank you. Jim Fitterling : Yes. So mid-cycle margins typically run in the range of $0.27 globally, but that can run from -- in Europe, maybe $0.20 mid-cycle margins to Americas $0.32. When we've gotten to peak the global average on peak would tend to be more like $0.48. And maybe that range would run from Europe being in the $40 million range, 38% to 40% and Americas being as much as 56%. So that's kind of what the outlook is. And of the $2 billion of upside, I'd say some of that is capacity debottlenecking and things that we're adding. So about $800 million of the $2 billion is from additions and tweaking on making some more higher-value products available, like we announced we've done with elastomers and things in Tarragona. And then the rest of it will come from margin expansion. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Aleksey Yefremov with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Aleksey Yefremov : Good morning, everyone. Jim, looking at ACC numbers, North American polyethylene demand this year is roughly at the same level as in 2018, 2019, do you have any thoughts on this observation? Do you think there's another leg up for U.S. polyethylene demand? Jim Fitterling : I do. I think when we look at North American demand, we're starting to see the total domestic demand plus exports getting north of 5 billion pounds. So this is a step-up. Obviously, exports have been a big driver historically, 30% of total demand was export, you're running about 45% of that demand in 2023. Also, I would tend to look at not just U.S. data, but I would also look at Mexico, I mean, we moved product into Mexico the same way we move into the U.S. market. And as I mentioned, one of the biggest consumption increases has been in Mexico with manufacturing reshoring moving into that area. So I think we're seeing good volumes this year in the U.S. I think we're going to continue to see that improve at a steady rate. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Arun, your line is open. Jim Fitterling : Andrew? Andrew Riker : Yes.

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn it over to Dow Investor Relations' Vice President, Andrew Riker. Mr. Riker, you may now begin. Andrew Riker : Good morning. Thank you for joining today. The accompanying slides are provided through this webcast and posted on our website. I'm Andrew Riker, Dow's Investor Relations Vice President. Leading today's call are Jim Fitterling, Chair and Chief Executive Officer; and Jeff Tate, Chief Financial Officer. Please note our comments contain forward-looking statements and are subject to the related cautionary statement contained in the earnings news release and slides. Please refer to our public filings for further information about principal risk and uncertainties. Unless otherwise specified, all financials where applicable, exclude significant items. We will also refer to non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures are contained in the earnings news release and slides that are posted on our website. On Slide 2, is our agenda for today's call. Jim will review our Q3 results, operating segment performance and some key updates regarding the strategic asset review we announced today. Jeff will then share an update on the macroeconomic environment and provide fourth quarter modeling guidance, followed by a discussion on our financial position and progress on Dow's growth investments. Jim will close the call and following that we will take your questions. Now, let me turn the call over to Jim. Jim Fitterling : Thank you, Andrew. Beginning on Slide 3, our cost advantage footprint in the Americas continues to provide strong competitive edge capturing demand growth in attractive markets and regions. In the third quarter, Team Dow delivered our fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year volume growth. We delivered this despite a soft macroeconomic environment, primarily in Europe and China, as well as an unplanned cracker outage in Texas, which has been successfully restarted and is running well. Net sales in the Q3 were $10.9 billion, this is up 1% versus the year ago period led by higher demand and local prices in the United States and Canada. Volume increased 1% versus the year ago period and prior periods. Sequentially, we saw gains in Packaging and Specialty Plastics and Industrial Intermediates and Infrastructure. Local price was flat year-over-year as gains in Packaging and Specialty Plastics were offset by decreases in Performance Materials and Coatings. Sequentially, local price was down 1% due to minor declines across all segments. Operating EBIT was $641 million, up $15 million year-over-year, reflecting higher integrated margins in Packaging and Specialty Plastics, which were partly offset by the impact of the unplanned cracker outage in Texas and higher planned maintenance activity. Cash flow from continuing operations was $800 million down year-over-year, primarily due to higher inventories to support both sales growth and labor related supply chain disruptions. Shareholder remuneration for the quarter was $584 million including dividends and share repurchases. In addition, we progressed our long-term growth strategy including signing a long-term agreement with Linde for the supply of clean hydrogen for our Path2Zero project in Fort Saskatchewan. We also completed the acquisition of US based polyethylene recycler Circulus. This will add capacity of 50,000 metric tons of recycled materials annually to Dow's portfolio. Now turning to our operating segment performance on Slide 4. In the Packaging and Specialty Plastics segment, local price increased year-over-year led by higher polyethylene prices in all regions except Latin America, which was flat. Volume was flat year-over-year as higher demand for functional polymers in all regions was offset by lower polyethylene volumes. Operating EBIT was $618 million an increase of $142 million year-over-year. This was primarily driven by higher integrated margins, which were partly offset by the impact of the unplanned cracker outage I mentioned earlier. Moving to the Industrial Intermediates and Infrastructure segment, local price was flat year-over-year. In addition, volume was down 2%. This was driven by lower volumes in Polyurethanes and Construction chemicals, which were primarily due to a force majeure in MDI following a third-party supplier outage. Operating EBIT decreased $74 million versus the year ago period. Results were driven by higher planned maintenance activity and lower integrated margins, which were partly offset by improved equity earnings. And in the Performance Materials and Coatings segment, local price declined year-over-year, while volume was up 5% with gains in both businesses and across all geographic regions. Operating EBIT was $140 million down $39 million compared to the year ago period, driven by higher raw material costs, which were partly offset by higher volumes. Moving to Slide 5. The strength of Dow's differentiated portfolio is defined by our strategic and purpose built asset footprint which leverages low cost feedstock positions, primarily in the Americas. Our growth investments are concentrated in higher value businesses and regions, particularly where demand is resilient and we have a competitive cost advantage. Over the past few years, we've demonstrated our commitment to operating with the best owner mindset by taking proactive actions with select higher cost assets aligned with the evolving market dynamics. Since 2023, we have undertaken more than 20 asset actions. These include targeted rationalization of our global polyols capacity, shutting down our propylene oxide unit in Freeport, Texas in 2025 to reduce lower value merchant PO exposure, strengthening our coatings footprint with select asset closures and announcing the sale of our laminating adhesives business for $150 million including two manufacturing sites in Italy, which we expect to finalize in the fourth quarter of this year. Overall, these actions have been primarily focused on our industrial, intermediates and infrastructure segment and in the EMEA region. On Slide 6, current market dynamics are impacting Europe, including continued soft demand, coupled with a persistent lack of long-term regulatory policy. This ongoing absence of clear, consistent, and competitive regulatory policy in Europe has resulted in many challenges for our industry. These challenges have been acknowledged in statements by EU government leaders, top economists, and our peers. And while a demand recovery in other parts of the world was expected to provide swift upside across the markets we serve, this alone is unlikely to be enough in Europe. Given these dynamics, we've begun a strategic review of select European assets, primarily those in our polyurethane business. This review includes all value-creating options for these assets and currently consists of approximately 20% of our sales in the EMEA region. We expect to complete this review by mid-2025. We continue to engage with governments both directly as well as through our leadership in trade associations to improve the industry's overall competitiveness in the region. Decisions regarding the strategic review, similar to our prior actions, will focus on strengthening Dow's global portfolio. This enables us to invest in the most attractive opportunities and create long-term value growth for our shareholders. Now, I'll turn it over to Jeff to review our outlook and guidance. Jeff Tate : Thank you, Jim, and good morning to everyone joining our call today. Moving to Slide 7, we continue to experience muted demand across some end-markets and regions with the greatest pressure in Europe and China. Global manufacturing PMI has been decelerating over the past three months and consumer spending remains pressured by persistent inflation. That said, we're monitoring the impact of rate cuts in the US and Europe, as well as recent stimulus plans in China to boost economic activity, which could provide some positive momentum for 2025. Looking specifically across our four market verticals, in packaging, domestic demand in North America is resilient and exports are robust, despite decelerating last month. Demand in Europe remains soft, consistent with manufacturing PMI at the lowest point year-to-date. In addition, China's manufacturing PMI returned to contractionary levels in September after improving in August. Infrastructure demand primarily in residential construction remains low. In the US, housing starts decelerated to negative 0.7% year-over-year in September. Eurozone construction PMI remained soft and new home prices in China declined year-over-year for the 15th consecutive month. Consumer spending has slowed across the globe, reflecting affordability challenges. We've seen consumer confidence weaken in the United States, remain negative in Europe, and decline in China for the fifth consecutive month. And in mobility, demand has softened globally. In the US, auto sales were slightly up year-over-year in September after decreasing in August. And in the EU, new car registrations declined in September after reaching a three-year low in August. China auto production declined for the fourth consecutive month, reflecting weak domestic demand, as well as exports due to tariffs imposed in Europe. Now turning to our outlook on Slide 8. We expect fourth quarter earnings to be approximately $1.3 billion, up year-over-year and lower quarter-over-quarter, as normal seasonality plays out. Now looking into the sequential drivers by segment. In the packaging and specialty plastic segment, lower integrated margins stemming from higher feedstock costs and lower licensing revenue will be a headwind. Following an unplanned event in July, we restarted our Texas-8 cracker at the end of the third quarter, and we expect to ramp operating rates steadily throughout fourth quarter. This will generate an add-back of approximately $100 million in the fourth quarter. We also expect lower planned maintenance activity across multiple sites along the US Gulf Coast and in Europe to provide a tailwind sequentially. In the industrial, intermediates, and infrastructure segments, conditions remain mixed. Demand in building and construction end-markets, will be seasonally lower, but we expect the ongoing ramp of our plant at Louisiana operations, as well as the seasonal uptick in demand for deicing fluid, to offset this decline. In addition, we anticipate a $50 million tailwind through the lower planned maintenance activity along the US Gulf Coast. And in the Performance Materials and Coatings segment, we see continued growth in downstream silicone applications across most end-markets. However, this is expected to be offset by ongoing weakness in the China property sector. In addition, lower seasonal demand for building and construction end markets is expected to be a headwind of approximately $125 million. Moving to Slide 9. Team Dow has built a very compelling investment opportunity even as our industry has faced volatile market conditions over the past few years. By continuing to execute our playbook, deliver on our financial priorities and advance our strategy, we are positioning Dow for long-term value growth. Importantly, we have built the financial flexibility to continue disciplined investment in areas that will raise our underlying earnings, reduce emissions and advance customer circularity needs to drive growth. As it relates to our financial strength, Dow has ample liquidity and a strong investment grade-credit profile. Nearly all of our long-term debt is at a fixed rate and we have no substantive maturity until 2027. We also expect to enhance our near-term cash flow generation through the execution of unique to Dow cash flow levers And we are making solid progress on the evaluation of strategic options for our non-product producing infrastructure assets. As previously mentioned, we anticipate generating over $1 billion in proceeds from the transaction and we expect to share further progress yet this year. Dow's strong financial flexibility, allows us to advance our long-term growth strategy. Notably in the Q3, the team is making good progress on the construction of our Path2Zero project in Fort Saskatchewan. Major foundation work began and approximately 40% of cracker pilings are complete. Aligned to our capital deployment schedule for the project, we expect to receive more than $1.5 billion in cash and tax incentives with more than 80% received by 2030. Our near-term growth projects remain on track to deliver more than $2 billion of underlying EBITDA. This includes capacity expansions in silicones this year that will deliver approximately $70 million of annual EBITDA at full run rates. In our Transform the Waste strategy is expected to deliver more than $500 million of EBITDA by 2030. In the third quarter, we added new products to our growing circular portfolio. This includes REVOLOOP Recycled Plastic Resins that incorporate post-consumer recycled material into cable jacketing. We also introduced the 1st Bio Circular Engage REN polyolefin elastomers for carpet tile backing. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Jim. Jim Fitterling : Closing on Slide 10. Despite persistent softness across many end-markets and regions, Dow continues to leverage our advantaged cost positions to capture areas of demand strength, operating with discipline, and invest for long-term profitable growth. Building on the more than 20 asset-related actions we've taken since 2023, today's announcement that we're undertaking a strategic review of select European assets is consistent with our best owner mindset and focused on long-term shareholder value creation. In addition, we're actively progressing unique to Dow cash flow levers, and expect to share more by the end of the year. Our solid financial foundation allows us to advance our long-term strategy, which is poised to deliver more than $3 billion in additional annual earnings growth by 2030. Dow is in a strong position to boost our core earnings as market conditions improve and we begin capturing the full benefits from our growth investments, thereby enabling greater returns to shareholders. With that, I will turn it back to Andrew to get us started with the Q&A. A - Andrew Riker : Thank you, Jim. Now let's move on to your questions. I would like to remind you that our forward-looking statements apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. Operator, please provide the Q&A instruction. Operator : We are now opening the floor for question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Vincent Andrews : Thank you and good morning everyone. Wondering if I could just ask about the outlook for Packaging & Specialty Plastics in terms of pricing. If I'm reading the guidance correctly, it looks like on a net basis, pricing should be flat for the fourth quarter? Is that correct? And is there sort of the cadence of pricing you're expecting maybe up in October and then give a little bit back traditional in November and December? How are you thinking about it? Jim Fitterling : Good morning, Vince, yes, I think you are reading it overall correctly. We've got an outlook for flat pricing for the quarter, where you have got some obviously expectations that we might see some higher feedstock costs, but still very competitive feedstocks here in the US Gulf Coast. I would think we've got moves out there announced for $0.03 in October and $0.03 in November. And I think our view is typically, that's when we tend to see the movement pricing up and then things soften towards the end of the year. Operator : Your next question comes from Hassan Ahmed from Alembic Global. Your line is now open. Hassan Ahmed : Good morning Jim. Just a question around some of the sort of review work that you guys are doing in Europe. You guys specifically talked about polyurethanes. I'm just trying to sort of get a better sense of all the moving parts with regards to how you see the polyurethane cycle sort of panning out. Obviously, we've seen or about to see some assets change hands within the global polyurethane market. The destocking was particularly severe in polyurethanes, but the supply side seems a bit tepid. So as sort of you sift through all of these moving parts, how do you see the polyurethane market sort of coming out on the other side? Jim Fitterling : Good morning Hassan. Actually, we're still poised for a very good recovery in construction and durables markets, which really drive a lot of what's going on in polyurethanes. I\u2019d add automotive on top of that because I think automotive has been under some pressure in Europe. So I agree with you, there is no signs that there's any stocking and destocking has run its course. But I think we are waiting for that obvious turn in the economy that gets people moving into those segments. And those assets in Europe is really a portfolio shift move. It really has nothing to do with the business. Polyurethanes is a good business, a pretty diverse downstream markets. We've got good positions there. And as I mentioned, we're thinking about 20 asset actions so far across the globe, mostly in II&I, which is really to tighten up the footprint and get our capacity focused on our lowest cost assets there. So I think it is strengthened, both polyurethane business and also the coatings business as well. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Sison from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Richard Garchitorena : Good morning. This is Richard on for Mike. If I could just shift back to P&SP, I know it might be early, but given your comments on global integrated margins declining on a sequential basis in 4Q, how should we think about where margins and EBITDA for P&SP should be headed into 2025? What are the key puts and takes that we should look at? And how are you thinking about your global footprint and export growth rates? Thank you. Jim Fitterling : Yes, Michael, good question -- Richard, I'm sorry. Good question. On P&SP, we -- even -- despite the issues we have at Texas-8 in the third quarter, we still see strong volume growth downstream. So we were able to pull a lot of levers to make that happen. Demand is still good. I\u2019d say, we had a little bit of a slowdown at the end of the quarter with exports because of the dock strikes that were going on at the time. But overall, downstream demand and volume has been good. So operating rates are continuing to tighten up and the cost advantage assets are running strong. As we look forward into 2025, I think you're going to see some continued growth in volume. So we are looking at about 3% organic growth and volume going into next year. We are going to see some benefit from higher operating rates. So from a basis of about $5.6 billion consensus for 2024, that would add maybe $400 million to that. We have add back for two unplanned events. We've got the full year Glycol-2 being fully ramped up, as well as the Texas-8 unplanned outage we had in the third quarter. So the add back of those two is about $300 million. And then from our growth investments, we've got about $150 million from polyethylene and functional polymers debottlenecks, incremental growth projects there. About $75 million from alkoxylates capacity that's coming on in the US Gulf Coast and the full ramp-up of Thailand PG in Asia. And then about $75 million from Consumer Solutions, growth investments in debottlenecks. And they had a strong third quarter, with 6% year-over-year volume growth in silicones downstream specialty applications, so that's another $300 million there. So all-in-all, that's about $1 billion higher, and then you've got some upsides and downsides depending on things that would happen within the window. Operator : Your next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Jeff Zekauskas : Thanks very much. When you think about your Saskatchewan project, if -- you have a different production process in that you'll use the hydrogen, the autothermal reactor from Linde. So if ethane costs are the same, is the production cost in Fort Saskatchewan higher or lower than it is in Freeport? And if so, by how much? And secondly, do you still expect to bring on, I think, 600,000 tons of polyethylene in the US in the second half of 2025? Jim Fitterling : Good morning. Jeff, the answer to your second question -- answer to the second question on 2025 additional incremental growth is, yes. In terms of Fort Saskatchewan, I would say we'll be advantaged on ethane in the Fort, and we believe our ethylene cost up in Canada will be some of the best in the world that we have. So I think it is going to be very similar. We do have, obviously, a little higher cost from running the autothermal reformer to produce that hydrogen that will go into fire the furnaces. However, we do get some of that back through CO2 sequestration, and we are going to be able to get some of that back to the market and selling of ethylene with zero Scope 1 and 2 emissions. So net-net, I think you're going to see returns equal or higher than Texas-9 in the US Gulf Coast, which is our lowest cost asset globally. Operator : Thank you very much. Your next question comes from John McNulty from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Bhavesh Lodaya : Hi, good morning Jim, this is Bhavesh Lodaya for John. So it appears more and more likely that the US and the world in general, is going to see more tariffs and duties being put in place. You have a low-cost advantage in the US, but there are also commodities like polyethylene, where you are very reliant on export markets. In Europe, I believe this is what you alluded to when you spoke about the regulatory actions required. So overall, if we enter this new era of source of more duties across the world, how do you think that plays out for Dow overall? Jim Fitterling : Yeah, good morning Bhavesh. I think, look, we see tariffs today in some of the businesses that we participate in. And we are still a net exporter in general, out of the US Gulf Coast because of the very strong competitive advantages that we have here. The large markets, China in particular, is still an importer and it's going to be an importer for quite some time. So I think that will exist. In most of the other markets, we are in the market to be a domestic player. So we're in Europe for Europe, and for the assets that we have in China, we are in China for China. There's a lot of discussion going on around tariffs. I think we are typically not in the crosshairs of some of the issues that are national security related. So I think that doesn\u2019t have a particular impact on us. And then we\u2019ll walk through what will happen with them. I would say, carbon border adjustment mechanisms are also \u2013 could be considered a form of a tariff as well, and so we\u2019re going to stay eyes wide open to that. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. David Begleiter : Thank you, good morning. Jim, on the European assets under review, are they EBITDA positive? And if so, how much? And if you do close both of your MDI plants in Europe, would you still look to supply Europe MDI from your plants in Saudi and Texas? Thank you. Jim Fitterling : Yes, good morning David. I don't have a specific number to give you on the European assets right now, but they are EBITDA positive. They are good cost positions in the European market. Again, we are looking at all value-creating opportunities. I don\u2019t believe \u2013 I don\u2019t want to preclude anything, but I don\u2019t believe shutting down MDIS, that is going to be a value-creating opportunity, but we\u2019re going to look at everything. Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Byrne from Bank of America. Your line is now open. Steve Byrne : Yes, thank you. Jeff, you made a comment about your customers for P&SP have circularity needs. Are those needs, in your view intensifying? Or are they waning in these days? And is it sufficient to give you the ability to enter into long-term contracts? Your guide for this $3 billion EBITDA gain by 2030 is presumably pulling a chunk out of the Alberta project, but is -- what gives you that confidence to offset those costs with higher returns? Can you get longer-term contracts with your customers for low-carbon polyethylene? Jeff Tate : Good morning Steve. Yes, good question. From our standpoint, we still feel very confident in our ability to be able to generate, again overall for our Transform the Waste strategy, at least $500 million of additional earnings by 2030. And there's no assumptions right now that we see in the marketplace that would have us that would look at that any differently. Operator : Your next question comes from Chris Parkinson from Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Chris Parkinson : Great. Good morning everyone. Can we just take a step back and take a look at the balance sheet and cash flow and just the year-to-date trends? Some of your commentary pertaining towards the end of the third quarter going to the fourth in terms of facilitating growth. And just any framework in terms of the puts and takes that the Street should be considering as we progress into 2025? Thank you so much. Jeff Tate : Hi, good morning Chris, thanks for the question. For us when we look at third quarter, we generated $800 million in cash flow from operations, which gave us an almost 60% conversion rate, which led to actually positive free cash flow in the quarter, which is pretty similar in terms of the range that we had for second quarter. So we've seen some stability there. A couple of other puts and takes that I think are important is that we've been able to maintain our cash conversion cycle at 42 days, which is top quartile in comparison to our peers. And so that's an eight-day improvement that we've been able to achieve versus pre-COVID levels. Another thing that's important here is that our cash balance at almost $3 billion, as well as the additional liquidity that we have of another $10 billion, gives us total liquidity of $13 billion to-date, and we have no subsequent debt maturities due until 2027. And the other thing I would also remind you of Chris, is the fact that we continue to make the commitment of unique to Dow cash levers and being able to deliver at least $1 billion of those cash levers here each and every year, and we still maintain that commitment moving forward. Operator : Your next question comes from Josh Spector from UBS. Your line is now open. Josh Spector : Yeah, hi good morning. I was wondering if you could talk about all the actions that you've done around some of the portfolio changes and some of the asset closures? And just talk about the earnings impact combined. I'm thinking about this more in relation where Dow talks about the earnings corridor, $8 billion to $9 billion in EBITDA potential. If we look at what you've done versus the last 5 years, 10 years of earning those assets, how much of a negative is there in that bridge that we should be building in? Or maybe it's smaller or less than what we expect? Thanks. Jim Fitterling : Josh, good question. I think you should look at it in terms of what are we doing to keep our cost position low. We've typically been able to bring all that capacity into lower-cost assets and run them at higher rates, and so you'll see that improvement in operating rate lead to bottom line improvements. And although some of these have happened in 2023 and '24, we've had some costs associated with getting out of these assets. You'll start to see some positive impact of that as we move forward into 2025. We're typically able to supply all of that, run the existing assets harder. Those are lower cost assets as we move forward. So I think it's more of a tightening up the footprint, making the portfolio more attractive. If you look at where we are year-over-year, we've had an improvement in operating rates of about 500 basis points. In the third quarter, we were up about 100 basis points, and that was because we moved out some maintenance activity in the quarter. So continuing to move that operating rate up will have an impact on bottom-line. Operator : Your next question comes from Kevin McCarthy from Vertical Research Partners. Your line is now open. Kevin McCarthy : Yes, thank you and good morning. Jim, two questions on Europe, maybe one broad one and one more narrow. Just broadly, I think it stands to reason that margins are lower in the region due to higher energy cost [anemic] (ph) demand and some of the onerous regulations that you spoke to in the prepared remarks and in the press release. So I guess my general question would be, if you were to report margins on a regional basis rather than on a segment basis, how much lower would Europe be relative to the Americas or even Asia? Number one. And then number two, as you go through the strategic review, do you have in mind, potential financial consequence of that in terms of the EBITDA uplift or narrowing that margin gap? Thanks. Jim Fitterling : Yeah, good morning Kevin. Good question on Europe. While energy costs are higher, they have come back down and moderated a bit. And so they are going to -- I think you are going to see that new kind of relative competitive floor being based on import LNG into Europe, and we're kind of at that level right now. And they've got -- they've diversified their base away from just the Russian gas that they've had before. So I think that's a positive -- relative positive. We've got a good line of sight to what the energy costs will be there. Demand has been lower. I think construction obviously has been slower. The consumer has been slower. Automotive has seen some pressure from import EVs, as we know. But I think, obviously they will have to adjust to that. I would say when you look at the businesses, obviously I think the biggest delta and where we are right now versus where we were say, in 2020 at the low point in the cycle is the higher cost position of Europe. I think that's a pretty easy way to take a look at it. These businesses, mid-cycle and polyurethanes and construction chemicals, their mid-cycle EBITDA margins are about 15%. And so I think, our view here is to look at portfolio options where we can invest more money in businesses that have higher returns and higher downstream growth rates. The European assets that we're talking about with polyurethanes, make up about 20% of our existing EMEA sales. Operator : Your next question comes from Patrick Cunningham from Citi. Your line is now open. Patrick Cunningham : Yes, hi, good morning. So just on the review of the European assets, what would you need to see from a policy perspective to maintain and run these assets? And then across -- are you positioning with governments and trade organizations regarding the sort of an idiosyncratic risk related to US backing the UN Global Plastics treaty, particularly the plastics production cap? Jim Fitterling : Good morning Patrick, good questions. First on European policy, clearly, I think there are a couple of differences. So in energy, I think, a forward focus on what Europe needs to do to be energy competitive is critical. Also, I think a look at, and a good comparison would be Canada with Fort Saskatchewan and Europe's position on hydrogen. We call the Fort project circular hydrogen in order to run, and we're able to make ethylene from that circular hydrogen at competitive costs with US Gulf Coast economics and also get a benefit from selling Zero Scope 1 and 2 emissions products into the market. The way the UGreen deal is written today, it says that you can only get credit for green hydrogen, which means made by electrolyzers, made with alternative energy or low carbon energy. If I give you a comparison on what would have to happen in Fort Saskatchewan, if I were to have to make green hydrogen to run that asset, I'd have to have 7 gigawatts of electricity, running electrolyzers to make all the green hydrogen to run the Fort. It is just simply not economical, and it won't happen. And so now you've seen there are no projects now moving forward on blue hydrogen. There's no projects moving forward for carbon capture and all these things that were on the table in terms of helping European industry decarbonize are just so far uncompetitive, that not only will the industry not decarbonized, they'll probably have to consider other alternatives. In the United States, well in terms of the international legally binding agreement on plastics, I think we're making tremendous progress. There is certainly no alignment around the world on production caps or [bands] (ph) in that agreement. We think we're all surprised by the shift in positioning of the administration, but we're not at the end of this process yet. And so we continue to advocate that we focus on the issue, which is plastic pollution, focus on the solutions, which are circularity policies, recycled content mandates, extended producer responsibility schemes, all forms of recycling and dealing with the pollution part of the situation. Plastics are the lowest carbon footprint products that are out there. They are easiest to use, they're the cheapest to use. They have the best sustainability footprint. And as we convert to making them with Zero Scope 1 and 2 emissions like we're going to do at the Fort, nothing -- no alternative will be able to touch the sustainability footprint. Operator : Your next question comes from Frank Mitsch from Fermium Research. Your line is open. Frank Mitsch : Hi, good morning. Jim, I appreciate your answer to the question on tariffs earlier in the Q&A with the US Gulf Coast competitive advantage. I'm curious, Brazil just enacted an increase from 12.5% to 20% on polyethylene imports. What specifically may be seeing in that region? And perhaps if you could also offer an early look at 2025 in terms of siloxanes, the interplay between supply and demand, that would be helpful. Thank you. Jim Fitterling : Good morning Frank, good questions. Sorry about the Mets. I'm with you there with the Royals, not making it as well. 12.5% to 20% I think, in the case of Brazil, I think you have to look at tariffs in terms of are you trying to protect the manufacturing in the domestic economy so that you keep a manufacturing base. And I think tariffs of 12.5% to 20%, like you see in Brazil, are meant to do that. I think when you've heard reference to tariffs here in the United States, of [maybe a] (ph) base tariff of 10% for anything that's imported, yes, I think that's driven by a mindset that we're trying to get manufacturing into the United States, not resort to a neighboring country, but into the United States. And so we see tariffs around the world for countries that are trying to protect local manufacturing and trying not to be completely at the mercy of import materials for all of the needs for their economy. I think we're going to continue to see a lot of focus on that and actions like that. On siloxanes, we saw a little bit of tightening and a little bit of pricing improvement. I think we're a ways away. I think we are still in the area where there's opportunity for some rationalization. We've got Chinese capacity that's at negative cash margins right now. The downstream is growing well. As I mentioned, we were up 6% year-over-year in the downstream. The continued outlook for the downstream market is good, even though automotive has been slow, like vehicle production this year is going to be projected to be about 2% lower year-over-year. The growth in electric vehicles has been strong, like 13%, 14%. And when you look at that, that drives a lot of silicones demand. And when we start to see construction come back, that's a high-volume use, and I think you're going to see that pull on it as well. So I think it's a combination of those big volume markets coming back, as well as some assets that are in the cash negative territory having to be taken down. Operator : Your next question comes from John Roberts of Mizuho. Your line is now open. John Roberts : Thank you. Jim, you've got chlorine integration in Europe. So how separable are the decisions you're looking at in Europe for polyurethanes versus the [cab] (ph) assets? Jim Fitterling : They're not, John. Obviously, we're not going to do anything without close contact with our own chlorine assets but also with our partners in Europe. And so we'll keep a close eye on that. Chlorine PO integration is critical for us, and so we will make sure we\u2019re eyes wide open to that. Operator : Your next question comes from Mike Leithead of Barclays. Your line is now open. Mike Leithead : Great. Thank you. Good morning guys. Question maybe for Jeff around 2025. It seems like Jim earlier talked about $1 billion of year-over-year improvement in EBITDA [Technical Difficulty] $6.6 billion -- budget cash outflows in 2025. [indiscernible] CapEx [indiscernible] dividend, interest [indiscernible]. So are there further you need to [indiscernible] cash items you'd expect next year? Or should we expect net debt to remain relatively flat? Just how should we think about net cash flow next year, and sort of how does this impact the pacing of your buyback activity from here? Jeff Tate : Yeah, good morning, Mike, thanks for the question. Short answer on the unique-to-Dow cash levers is yes. We would expect to have a similar type of proceed coming back from some of the activities that we are focused on. Some of those that we've mentioned in the past that we're still working on, besides the non-product producing infrastructure assets, would be looking at our Nova judgment and continuing to make progress on that, as well as looking at some of our joint venture restructuring activities that could also give us some cash opportunities. And so with those unique to Dow cash levers, plus expecting our cash conversion rates to be similar or higher versus what we had this year, coming-off of whatever our 2025 ultimate EBITDA plan is, will give us the opportunity to be able to support our cash uses for 2025. Operator : [Technical Difficulty] Fischer from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Duffy Fischer : Yeah, good morning. Just a couple of questions around the licensing income. So one, how much bigger was it than you expected when you gave guidance after Q2? And then two, was it an unexpected project that came in? Or is it just pulling forward either from the Q4 or next year's cycle? Jim Fitterling : Good morning. Duffy, it is just timing on -- those are driven by delivery of engineering packages and timing on milestones. I'd say it's relatively small in terms of the beat on P&SP. A big chunk as well was moving in St. Charles Cracker turnaround out. As you remember, we were coming off of hurricane \u2013 that turnaround was due to start around the time we were having all the hurricane activity. So we just decided to move it into first quarter just so we could deal with hurricane-related issues and not have to focus on that while we were trying to make the quarter. But I think it was relatively small in the grand scheme of things. Operator : Your next question comes from Matthew Blair from TPF. Your line is now open. Matthew Blair : Thank you and good morning. You mentioned you're expecting higher cracking feedstocks in the fourth quarter. I was hoping you could expand a little bit on what you're seeing in the US ethane market. Do you think that the wider frac spreads that we are seeing so far this quarter are temporary or perhaps structural? And then would Dow expect to enjoy a little bit of an offset here the Devon JV? And is there any appetite to expand that JV with Devon? Thanks. Jim Fitterling : Good questions. And I would say as we look forward, the winter strip on ethane is very similar to where the summer was. Our range on ethane probably for the quarter is in $0.19 to $0.23 range. The frac spreads have been consistently at $0.50 or below. So I think we are probably going to see that continue. Natural gas has obviously been very positive for this as we've had good production, and the hurricanes in the third quarter took some export capability out. I think we're going to see some of that export capability come back in, which is why I think you're going to see some competition for that gas that we didn't see in the third quarter. All that, I think, is around the edges. I think we still got very, very cost advantaged positions. And then what was the second? Matthew Blair : Devon. Jim Fitterling : On Devon. Yes, look we've been very happy with the partnership with Devon. We started that back in 2021 and continue to ramp that up in 2023. Right now, we've done 114 wells with them, and we've got 15 additional ones expected to come online this year. It continues to grow to help us offset our exposures. Obviously, the way we work that deal is we trade that into the market, so it\u2019s a net offset to our cost coming in. And we continue to be very happy with it. It's worked well for both of us. It is a strong partnership, and I think we are looking forward to continuing it. Operator : Your next question comes from Aleksey Yefremov from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Aleksey Yefremov : Thanks good morning everyone. Jim, I was quite surprised to see about $100 million in EBITDA for II&I into this quarter. The segment started the year pretty strongly with $234 million, and then EBITDA continued to soften. Could you give us, just to reflect on this year, what product specifically or regions maybe did not perform as well? And what do you expect next year here? Jim Fitterling : Yes. So obviously, we had Glycol-2 up and running, so that was to a positive. We had price pressure on PO Polyols and we had lower volumes in MDI. I mentioned in the opening that we had a third-party outage in North America, which supplied industrial gas to our MDI process there, the plants back up but still running at lower rates. And then look, the other thing that happened when Texas-8 was out, Texas-8 produces propylene for us as well. And so when we had Texas-8 out, we had to go into the market to get some of that propylene so that was a higher cost. So I think it was on to one-time, the MDI issue is a one-time, which will correct itself. The PO polyols that was a big driving force around the decision to tighten up the footprint in Freeport. So as we go forward, we don't have as much length in PO, which brings the North American market more in the balance. So I think, as we move forward, it is polyurethanes in North America, that was the bigger slowdown and drag in the quarter. Operator : Your next question comes from Laurence Alexander from Jefferies. Laurence Alexander : Good morning. Just on the unique to Dow cash levers, can you give a sense for what the longer-term pipeline looks like say through 2030 or even farther out? After the ones that you've publicly disclosed, I mean how bare is the covered? Jeff Tate : Well, Laurence, this is Jeff. Going out to 2030, we wouldn't be able to get too definitive at this stage. I mean, as we continuously go through our annual reviews of all of our assets and all of our opportunities, we'll continue to identify those things that could create more value across the enterprise and have a best of our mindset as we approach it. But the ones that I've noted in the earlier question around some of the things that are more near-term, are the ones that we've specifically identified that will bring us more of that near-term impact. But going out to 2030, I couldn't give you anything specific at this point, but we'll continue to again, maintain that commitment of well over $1 billion on an annual basis. Operator : Your next question comes from Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Arun Viswanathan : Hi, guys great. Thanks for taking my question. So I guess I just wanted to ask about -- there's been a lot of portfolio reviews, especially of European assets at this point. So just wondering if you've gone through some kind of analysis here, assuming any of those shutdowns happen or potentially portfolio reviews result in shutdowns. How much maybe capacity could be coming out of the industry and P&SP in -- as you look into '25. And maybe if you can give us your thoughts as well on PMC kind of global supply demand as well, just because we've been mired in weakness on the coating side for a while, from a demand standpoint, but maybe there is some green shoots with rates coming down. So do you see any improvement in operating rates on the PMC side as well. So just maybe you could get your comments on both P&SP and PMC utilization as you look into '25? Thanks. Jim Fitterling : Yes good morning Arun. Look, I think, again, our portfolio work in Europe is around polyurethanes. And as I mentioned before, it really isn't driven primarily by shutdowns, we'll look at that. But I think we've done a lot to bring smaller assets down and bring that capacity into our low-cost locations. It's really looking at what is there a better owner for the portfolio? Does that allow us to continue to focus on our Invest for Growth businesses, which went from Investor Day, you'll remember we're P&SP our silicones business and also our Industrial Solutions business. In P&SP in Europe, we have good positions, and we're focused on the domestic market there. So I think our focus there is continuing to make those assets more competitive. There has been about -- and I'm doing this off the top of my head, about 1.5 million metric tons of announcements made already in the industry, on shutdowns that are coming in Europe. I think we'll probably continue to see that in isolated stand-alone cases where you may be facing an older asset that has some high-cost maintenance or other life extension work that needs to happen. So that will be a challenge. I think in most of those asset cases, there was a discussion of cash flow losses for a number of years before those decisions were taken. We're not in that situation in P&SP in Europe. I think on coatings, even though coatings has been slow, we've had really good volume growth this year, growing with our strategic customers, well ahead of what was expected in the marketplace. And I think that will mostly shift as we start to see things pickup in the housing sector and the architectural coatings pick up. We had a lot of growth in traffic paint coatings this year, infrastructure-related. There's a lot of development going on in space there to make road markings that can actually communicate with the future for autonomous vehicles or the autonomous and lane assist type of devices that are put on your vehicles today are requiring some better road markets to be able to -- for them to react with the cars. So I think we'll continue to see growth in both of those, but the housing market will be the big pickup on the coatings business. Coatings is doing well. I'd say monomers is where things need to tighten up a little. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I\u2019d now like to hand back over to Andrew Riker for closing remarks. Andrew Riker : Thank you everyone, for joining our call, and we appreciate your interest in Dow. For your reference, a copy of our transcript will be posted on Dow's website within 48 hours. This concludes our call. Thank you again. Operator : Thank you for attending today's call. You may now disconnect. Have a wonderful day.",

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn it over to Dow Investor Relations Vice President, Andrew Riker. Mr. Riker, you may begin. Andrew Riker : Good morning. Thank you for joining today. The accompanying slides are provided through this webcast and posted on our website. I am Andrew Riker, Dow's Investor Relations Vice President. Leading today's call are Jim Fitterling, Chair and Chief Executive Officer; Jeff Tate, Chief Financial Officer, and Dow's recently appointed Chief Operating Officer, Karen S. Carter. Please note, our comments contain forward-looking statements and are subject to the related cautionary statement contained in the earnings news release and slides. Please refer to our public filings for further information about principal risk and uncertainties. Unless otherwise specified, all financials, where applicable, exclude significant items. We will also refer to non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures are contained in the earnings news release that is posted on our website. On Slide 2 is our agenda for today's call. Jim will review our fourth quarter and full year results; Karen will provide an overview of our operating segment performance; and Jeff will share an update on the macroeconomic environment and our modeling guidance for the first quarter. Jim will then provide details on the intentional actions Dow is taking to navigate the prolonged economic downturn and close out the call. Following that, we will take your questions. Now, let me turn the call over to Jim. Jim Fitterling : Thank you, Andrew. Beginning on Slide 3, there's a lot to unpack in our results this quarter, so let me first walk through the headlines. In the fourth quarter, Team Dow delivered our fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year volume growth despite continued weak macroeconomic conditions. Net sales were $10.4 billion, which is down 2% versus the year ago period, and reflects pricing pressure seen across the industry in the quarter. Local price was down 3% year-over-year and sequentially with declines across all our operating segments. Operating EBITDA was $1.2 billion, which is approximately flat compared to the same period last year. Cash flow from continuing operations was $811 million, resulting in free cash flow of $44 million. Returns to shareholders totaled $492 million of dividends in the quarter, and our total CapEx spend was $767 million. As you saw in our numbers this quarter, we also had a non-cash tax adjustment impacting net income and EPS. Jeff will provide more details on that later in this call. Throughout the quarter, we announced additional actions that continued to support the optimization of our global portfolio for growth, while maintaining a best owner mindset. For example, we continued to ramp up operating rates at our Texas-8 cracker and Glycol 2 unit. We completed the sale of our flexible packaging laminating adhesive business to Arkema for an enterprise value of approximately $150 million. And we've designed a definitive agreement with Macquarie Asset Management for the sale of a minority stake in select U.S. Gulf Coast infrastructure assets for which we expect to receive cash proceeds of up to $3 billion. And driven by persistently weak global macroeconomic conditions, we announced a strategic review of select European assets, primarily in our polyurethanes business, where demand has been structurally challenged over the past five years, making it the highest cost region for several of our key businesses. We are also postponing a maintenance turnaround at one of our ethylene crackers in Europe. This decision will result in us idling this asset starting in second quarter until market dynamics improve. And today we announced targeted actions to reduce our costs by $1 billion and our CapEx by $300 million to $500 million. Collectively, the additional actions are focused on reinforcing our long-term competitiveness as we continue to navigate this prolonged economic downturn. Turning to Slide 4. In 2024, Team Dow continued to advance both our near-term priorities and our long-term strategy to become a stronger, more innovative company. We delivered net sales of $43 billion, operating EBIT of $2.6 billion, and year-over-year volume growth of 3%, excluding merchant hydrocarbon sales. Earlier in 2024, we began construction at our Path2Zero investment in Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta. When complete, the project is expected to generate approximately $1 billion in incremental EBITDA annually by 2030. Dow is also recognized externally through industry-leading awards and certifications. Last year, we earned 12 Edison Awards for Innovation and Great Place to Work and Fortune, named out as one of the top 25 world's best workplaces. Team Dow navigated several challenges over the past year, including weather-related and supply chain disruptions, and continued uncertainty in many regions and markets that we serve. And in response to evolving market dynamics and sluggish demand recovery in Europe, we demonstrated our best owner mindset with more than 20 proactive actions to address higher cost assets. I remain confident in our company's ability to foster a sustainable future, achieve long-term profitable growth, and enhance shareholder returns. Now, I'm pleased to turn it over to Karen S. Carter, Dow's Chief Operating Officer, who will provide an overview of our operating segment performance on Slide 5. Karen S. Carter: Thank you, Jim. I'm pleased to join you all today. And before I begin, I'd like to mention what an honor it is to be named Dow's Chief Operating Officer. I look forward to engaging with many of you, our owners, in the near future. In my more than 30 years at Dow, I have progressed through the organization to most recently leading PNSP, the company's largest operating segment. And I have worked across a broad range of businesses and functions, including global leadership positions within the building and construction and consumer electronics and markets, as well as Dow's polyethylene franchise. This has given me a deep appreciation for our company's competitive advantages, the strength of our innovation engine, and our commitment to delivering profitable growth. As COO, my priorities are to further strengthen our customer engagement, accelerate the commercialization of Dow's innovation pipeline, and enhance reliability and productivity. I am committed to driving business and operational results, while progressing our strategic priorities to deliver long-term value for our shareholders. Now, let's move to our operating segment results. In the Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment, we entered the fourth quarter with a challenging backdrop of ample industry supply, high feedstock costs and a typical seasonal slowdown in demand. Segment results reflected a decrease in local price both year-over-year and sequentially. This was primarily driven by lower functional polymers and polyethylene prices as a result of the October price decline reflected in the market indices and other competitive price pressures throughout the quarter. Despite higher demand for flexible food and specialty packaging in all regions except Latin-America, volume for this segment was down 1% year-over-year. This was primarily driven by lower third-party hydrocarbon sales and non-recurring licensing revenue. Operating EBIT was $447 million, a decrease of $217 million compared to the year-ago period. This was primarily driven by lower integrated margins and licensing revenue. Moving to the Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure segment. We benefited from strong global energy demand, as well as stable consumer and pharma demand. We also experienced typical seasonal improvements for deicing, while agricultural and coatings applications saw normal seasonal declines. Looking at fourth quarter results, local price declined 1% year-over-year, while volume was up 1% year-over-year. This was driven by improved supply availability in our Industrial Solutions business as we finished ramping-up our Glycol-2 unit ahead of schedule. Those gains were partly offset by continued softness in the Polyurethanes and Construction Chemicals business. Operating EBIT for the segment increased $69 million versus the year-ago period. Results were primarily driven by higher operating rates and improved supply availability in the Industrial Solutions business. And in the Performance Materials & Coating segment, volume was up 5% with strong gains across both architectural coatings and downstream silicones. We achieved this despite global weakness in building and construction end-markets as high-interest rates continue to pressure spending in residential markets. Operating EBIT increased $52 million compared to the year-ago period, driven by volume gains and lower fixed costs. Now, I'll turn the call over to Jeff, who will provide an overview of the macros and our outlook. Jeff Tate : Thank you, Karen, and good morning to everyone joining our call today. Moving to Slide 6. While global GDP is expected to grow at similar levels to 2024, recent economic activity is primarily being led by the strength in service-related sectors. In contrast, global manufacturing PMI is at contractionary levels with output and new orders declining in December. Ongoing affordability challenges also continue to pressure spending in housing and durable goods sectors. These dynamics have created a two-speed economy and we continue to monitor key indicators for signs of positive inflection in more challenged end-markets. Notably, this includes the pace of interest rate cuts in the US and Europe and recent stimulus actions in China for any impacts on inflation as well as end-market demand. In addition, we are watching for any impacts from ongoing geopolitical volatility, including potential tariffs. Now looking across our four market verticals, in packaging, we continue to see demand growth, especially in North America with resilient domestic and export polyethylene demand throughout the year. In China, manufacturing activity remains tepid and overall demand in Europe continues to be soft. Infrastructure demand remains weak globally, particularly in residential construction. In the US, mortgage rates are now back up above 7%, representing the highest level since May despite lower Fed interest rates. This is driving ongoing affordability issues with US building permits remaining below their three-year average. China new-home prices also declined year-over-year for the 18th consecutive month. Consumer spending continues to be constrained by persistent inflation in the US and Europe with consumer confidence levels declining in December. In China, overall retail sales were up in December, although year-over-year growth in furniture sales decelerated from the prior month. And in mobility, higher auto sales in the US and China were driven by discounts to clear elevated inventories and government stimulus actions, respectively. We also saw new car registrations in the EU decline 13% in the second half of 2024 compared to the first half of the year. Now turning to our outlook on Slide 7. We expect first quarter earnings to be approximately $1 billion, down $200 million quarter-over-quarter. This is largely due to higher anticipated feedstock costs, which have increased due to the severe cold snap. We expect this to pressure margins as we start the quarter. We will also have higher plant maintenance activity in the first quarter across our three operating segments, but expect full-year plant maintenance activity to be roughly in-line with the prior year. In addition, we anticipate our operational tax-rate to be in the range of 25% to 29%, in-line with our historical rates. This reflects an improvement versus the fourth quarter, which was elevated largely due to higher than expected non-cash tax adjustments. These tax items were primarily related to Argentina, which was amplified by inflation. Audit remeasurements and currency were also drivers for the fourth quarter tax-rate. Next, I'll turn to our outlook and first-quarter guidance by segment. In Packaging & Specialty Plastics, we expect higher feedstocks and energy costs to outpace price increases from a timing perspective in the quarter. As a result, global integrated margins are expected to be lower sequentially. In addition, we anticipate headwinds of approximately $50 million from higher planned maintenance activity, primarily along the US Gulf Coast. In the Industrial, Intermediates & Infrastructure segment, we anticipate lower margins in our polyurethanes business from higher energy costs as well as lower catalyst sales in our Industrial Solutions business. In the quarter, we have planned maintenance activity scheduled at our ethylene oxide asset in [Freeport] (ph), Texas, which will enable the start-up of additional alkoxylation capacity in the US Gulf Coast. This new capacity is one of the near-term growth investments we outlined at our last Investor Day and should support higher sales beginning in the second-quarter. And in the Performance Materials & Coating segment, building and construction end-markets remain soft with high mortgage rates in the US and sector weakness in China continuing to weigh on demand. However, we expect the seasonal demand uptick in first quarter to provide a tailwind of approximately $75 million. In addition, our regular yearly maintenance at our monomers assets in the US Gulf Coast is expected to be a sequential headwind of approximately $25 million. On a final note, last week the US Gulf Coast was impacted by a powerful winter storm. Our manufacturing sites have managed well, but we continue to monitor any further developments both at our sites, as well as across the industry. The current guidance does not include any impact favorable or unfavorable stemming from the storm. Now, I'll turn the call back over to Jim. Jim Fitterling : Thank you, Jeff. On Slide 8, in the midst of the prolonged downturn and slower-than-expected economic recovery that our industry is experiencing. Now it's taking several key actions to further reduce our costs and reinforce our long-term competitiveness through the economic cycle. First and foremost, we're taking additional targeted actions aimed at improving our margins. We announced today that we will implement cost reductions of $1 billion on an annual run-rate basis by 2026. These actions will be primarily focused on third-party contract labor and purchase services. In addition, we are targeting the elimination of approximately 1,500 Dow roles. Last quarter, we announced that we would kick-off a strategic evaluation of our European asset footprint, and we're on-track to provide an update on this work by mid-2025. Lastly, as we complete our in-flight higher return growth projects this year, we're also taking actions to preserve our strong financial foundation. We intend to recalibrate our CapEx deployment to match the current demand and macroeconomic conditions and we'll do so by reducing our 2025 spending by $300 million to $500 million compared to our previously disclosed target of $3.5 billion. We will keep CapEx spending roughly at these levels until we see a clear recovery materialize across broad portions of the end-markets that we serve. Turning to Slide 9. We continue our ongoing practice of reviewing our global portfolio. Last month, Dow entered into a definitive agreement to sell 40% equity stake in select infrastructure assets to Macquarie Asset Management, a leading global infrastructure investor. We anticipate the transaction will close by mid-2025. This newly formed infrastructure-focused company named Diamond Infrastructure Solutions is comprised of assets that support a wide range of services at five of Dow's manufacturing sites along the US Gulf Coast. The new company will operate within Dow and has a dedicated management team with priorities in support of Diamond Infrastructure Solutions strategy. Importantly, Dow will maintain operational control to ensure our standards for safe and reliable operations are upheld. This transaction is expected to generate approximately $2.4 billion of initial cash proceeds for Dow. Macquarie Asset Management has the option to increase their minority equity stake to 49% within six months of closing, which would increase cash proceeds to approximately $3 billion for Dow if exercised. The long-term partnership leverages Dow's operational excellence and Macquarie Asset Management's world leading infrastructure positions to generate incremental operational efficiencies, as well as future growth opportunities with existing and new customers. With enhanced financial flexibility from this partnership, Dow is in a strong position to continue to invest in growth and deliver enhanced returns to our shareholders, particularly as market conditions improve. Closing on Slide 10, as we navigate a challenging near-term environment, we are committed to a disciplined and balanced approach to delivering our cash and capital allocation priorities. Our ability to proactively manage in an extended economic downturn will position Dow well for long-term success. As I mentioned earlier, last week we postponed a maintenance turnaround at one of our ethylene crackers in Europe. This decision will result in us idling this asset starting in second quarter until market dynamics improve. This reduction in planned turnaround spending will keep 2025 turnaround spending levels in-line with the prior year. We will continue to match supply with profitable demand until margins improve. We continue to take proactive strategic actions to optimize our global footprint, drive operational performance and reduce our costs and capital expenditures. In 2025, our additional cost actions and reduced CapEx spending will help us to enhance near-term cash-flow, margins and earnings growth, while remaining committed to our long-term strategic priorities. In addition, our signed agreement with Macquarie Asset Management further strengthens Dow's financial flexibility and the potential to generate up to $3 billion in cash proceeds in 2025. This transaction is consistent with Dow's best owner mindset and track-record of delivering unique to Dow cash-flow levers to mitigate cyclical volatility. We're optimistic that we will continue to see demand growth in attractive end-markets such as packaging, energy and electronics. And once completed, our near-term growth investments, representing higher-return and quicker payback projects will enable improved underlying earnings and margins across the cycle. With a differentiated portfolio and proactive actions to support our solid financial foundation, we are confident in our ability to deliver on all of our capital allocation priorities, including our industry-leading dividend. At the same time, we will continue to maintain our focus on operating and financial discipline to drive long-term shareholder value to ensure that we remain well-positioned for the cycle recovery. With that, I'll turn it back to Andrew to get us started with the Q&A. Andrew Riker : Thank you, Jim. Now let's move on to your questions. I would like to remind you that our forward-looking statements apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. Operator, please provide the Q&A instructions. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin our question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Jim Fitterling : Just before we get to the first question, I wanted to make a few brief comments about the tragic incident that occurred near Washington, DC. Last night. We were saddened by the news of yesterday evening's passenger plane crash. As a company with values centered on people, our hearts are heavy for all those who have been affected by these tragic event. Our thoughts and deepest sympathies are with the passengers, crew members and their families during this incredibly difficult time. Operator, do we have the first question? Operator : Yes, Mr. Fitterling, your first question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Vincent Andrews : Thank you and good morning. Jim, if I could just ask you to revisit the three bridge items we talked about on the last call, one of which was sort of operating rate or macro improvement. The second was on the year-over-year delta and planned maintenance, which sounds like is going to be neutral now. And then third was just sort of the startup of Dow projects that were going to contribute. So if you could just update us on where you see those for 2025 at this point? Thank you. Jim Fitterling : Good morning, Vince. Thank you. Both on operating rate, I would say in fourth quarter, we saw some improvements in overall company operating rate, but on industry operating rate we're still not in an expansionary level yet. Europe has been a big weight on that. Europe continues to be for the industry, about 20% below pre-COVID levels across the board. And if you get into other sectors like housing related polyurethanes, it can even be lower than that. I'd say the operating rates in the Americas continue to be relatively strong. So you're talking about high 80s, low-90s percent types of operating rates. The ethylene chain stronger than the propylene chain, housing and automotive drive a lot in the propylene chain and downstream silicone is obviously doing better than siloxane. So siloxane rates are a drag on it, mainly from capacity adds in China. Year-over-year, we've trimmed things. Obviously, it won't show-up in first-quarter, but we're targeting to be flat year-over-year on turnarounds and that was a big part of the decision to defer the maintenance on one of the crackers in Europe. Probably people don't realize that we have kind of an integration between [indiscernible]. And so in addition to managing the ethylene part of the chain, we have to balance propylene part of the chain as well. And so deferring that maintenance will allow us to save some costs this year. It will also tighten up things from a balanced standpoint around the region. So we think that will be a net positive. And then the startup of the Dow projects in this year, we have several projects that are in-flight. We have projects in polyethylene, which are on-track to start-up by the middle of the year. We have a couple of projects in Industrial Solutions that are on-track to start-up. And then longer-term, we've got our -- our Path2Zero project in Alberta, which is still on schedule for the end of 2027. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Sison with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Mike Sison : Hey, good morning. I guess what we've heard so-far is 2026 overall macro or demand? Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like it's going to be much better than 2025. I mean 2025 versus 2024, sorry. You've got some headwinds here for higher feedstock costs in energy. You've got some cost-savings. So if demand is unfortunately similar in 2025 versus 2024, I mean, directionally, should EBITDA be up, down, flat? I mean, how do you sort of look at that this year. Jim Fitterling : Good morning, Michael. Good question. On 2025 versus 2024, obviously, a big part of the $1 billion of cost actions we're taking are to underpin improved EBITDA in 2025. So we've got volume growth and I mentioned the projects that we'll have starting out this year, which all of them will be able to be sold-out and be accretive from the point that they start-up. So you'll have that. We're obviously not counting on a tremendous amount, although we've shown five consecutive quarters of volume growth. So we're still going to keep taking advantage of our low-cost position and get our share. But I think pricing power is the real question and that's the reason for the cost action is to underpin the improvement in EBITDA. I would say you also have to think about the markets and a lot will depend on demand in the markets. In PNSP, well, I'd say in the ethylene chain, in general, PNSP and ethylene oxide derivatives have continued to be strong. You see that strength in Industrial Solutions. You see that strength. Although we had some pricing slip in the fourth quarter. Overall, we see that strength in the integrated margins of PNSP. So I think that will continue to be a positive sign. I think we'll continue to take the actions that we need to take in Europe to tighten things up there. I don't want to be doom and gloom about Europe, but I think we have to be realistic that downstream demand is not coming back. And so, we're going to have to take actions there to tighten things up. And then, of course, cash, we're going to manage very carefully, which is why you saw the CapEx reductions that we announced to try to stay in a better cash-flow position and keeping our dividend strong is one of the number one priorities. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global. Please go ahead. Hassan Ahmed : Good morning, Jim. A question on PNSP. I'm just trying to sort of reconcile the guidance that you guys gave and what sort of polyethylene pricing you guys are baking in there? You're clearly looking for a bit of a margin squeeze over there and we have a variety of sort of polyethylene price hikes on the table in the US contract wise. And obviously, ethane prices have gone up as well. So I guess a two-part question, what polyethylene prices are you baking in? And what sort of ethane pricing environment are you baking in? Jim Fitterling : Hassan, great lead in for me to welcome Karen to the call and ask her to cover PNSP in those two parts. Karen S. Carter: Yes, good morning, and thank you for the question. I think it's important to go back to fourth quarter and really look at what happened from a pricing perspective. As you know, we saw market prices go down in October by $0.03 per pound. And then prices continue to decline throughout the quarter, really driven by not market moves, but also contract resets that occur generally at that time of the year. So we're coming into 2025 with low prices. But at the same time, as you indicated, we saw input costs increase almost immediately as we got into the year. So we do have $0.7 -- $0.12 per pound on the table for price increases in the fourth quarter, $0.7 in January and $0.05 in February. And as you indicated, we are seeing both ethane and natural gas costs come up. And so those costs are outpacing the rate at which price increases are being implemented. But I just want to reiterate that it is really important that we are going to stand firm on our price increases. Margins have reached a place that they are unsustainable. So you should expect to see that we are going to be resolute in getting those price increases through. Jim Fitterling : I also think, Hassan, that in the -- well, the short term moves and cost increases happen this time of year when the first blast of winter hits and everybody gets a little dose of reality. They also soften typically as the quarter goes on and you move into second-quarter. Natural gas production is strong. It was 106 billion cubic-feet per day last year. We don't see any change in that. The ethane frac spread is $0.50 a million BTU. That's a very good rate. I would say the only other thing is that propane naphtha advantage that slipped a bit in the back-half of the year in Europe. I think it's going to start to come back a little bit, but not dramatically. So it's another reason to balance things out in the cracker fleet in Europe. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Jeff Zekauskas : Thanks very much. The global commodity polyethylene industry is oversupplied. And between you and CP Chem, you're adding another GBP8 billion in North America and Dow is adding half of that between now and 2030. Do you really want to add that or is your plan to close down your European assets so that there's no net addition? When we look at the Lyondel results in Europe, what we see is that, they don't make any money. I assume that they make little money, I assume that's the same for you. So the first question is, do you really want a net addition or are you going to balance additions with closure? And then for Jeff, what happened to the cash-flow? That is -- cash flow is a couple of billion lower than it was last year. EBITDA is flat. Is that a one-time event? And how many shares are going to be issued for management comp this year to add to the share base? Thanks. Jim Fitterling : Jeff, thanks for that. I'll take the first part on ethylene and then I'll have Jeff comment on cash flow. So on supply-demand, I think it's important to remember that what we're adding in Alberta is 2 million metric tons of zero Scope 1 and 2 emissions, ethylene and derivatives and will convert 1.5 million tons to zero emissions. So 3.5 million tons of zero Scope 1 and 2 emissions ethylene. And we're in negotiations now positively moving forward with customers for the offtake for that material. So it is a different part of the mix than what's available today. I do think your point is valid. We're seeing actions in Europe across the industry, which would depend towards reducing capacity in Europe, which is high-cost. And there aren't any signs. I mean there's been a lot of good discussion in Europe around the Draghi report and competitiveness, but there have been no actions that indicate that energy costs or competitive positions are going to improve. So I think you're going to see some contraction there. And I think we have to look around the world at places that are not cost-competitive and tighten up there. Our investments are in cost advantage regions. Like we said in Alberta, you're talking about putting a cracker in the first quartile that has zero Scope 1 and 2 emissions. There's nothing of that scale anywhere in the world for those brand owners and those customers who want that product. Jeff, do you want to cover the cash-flow? Jeff Tate : Yes. Thanks, Jen, and good morning, Jeff. Yes, a couple of things here on the cash flow. In the fourth quarter, we did generate $800 million in cash from operations. And our cash conversion rate was approximately 67%. One of the things that we did intentionally do in the fourth quarter is because of our first quarter 2025 on heavy turnaround activity, we did purposely and intentionally build some additional inventory, especially as some of those turnarounds are going to be in some of our high-growth areas from a business perspective. So some of that was very intentional, Jeff, in terms of the build of the inventory that we saw. In addition to that, we continue to maintain a really strong cash conversion cycle that we've taken out eight days since span and we continue to be very disciplined in our approach to maintaining that ability to not only get the eight days out, but look for opportunities to get maybe another one or two days moving forward. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. David Begleiter : Thank you. Good morning. Jim, on the cost-savings you announced today on the direct costs, are those permanent or are they somewhat temporary? And of the 1,500 roles that are being reduced or eliminated, what regions are they? I presume mainly Europe and what businesses and functions are they attached to? Thank you. Jim Fitterling : Good morning, David. On the cost saves, we're trying to get the structural costs down and keep them at a low-level. So we're trying to make them as permanent as we can. It's about 75% third-party cost saves. It's about 25% direct, which is a little bit lower on the direct percent than typical. I'd say on the third-party cost saves, we feel pretty good about our ability to get that done. We expect to be at about a 60% run-rate by fourth quarter and full run-rate by mid next year. Regions, I would say it's a combination of regions and functions and businesses. So regions that are under economic pressure, obviously, Europe and Asia is a focus of functions where we've not seen productivity improvements is a focus. And then we haven't announced a lot of site closures here. Our European asset review is still underway. We'll have updates on that by midyear. But this is not loaded with site closure costs or anything like that, which is why the recharge is relatively nice. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Byrnes with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Steve Byrne : Yes, thank you very much. [indiscernible] for Steve. I just wanted to go back a little bit to the full-year expectations. And I wonder, are there any other discrete items besides the maintenance spend that will be flat year-on-year, such as the benefit of having the EG2 unit operating for the full-year that can help or be a headwind for 2025 versus 2024? And can you go back also on the polyethylene price increases that you spoke earlier? Just for January because there will be a non-market adjustment based on some trade publishers, how do you expect that to actually impact realizations in January versus December against the proposed contract price increases? Jim Fitterling : Yes. So let me take a shot at the first-half of your question, which is on the full-year. And the things that we should take a look at as we're looking at full-year outlook. And then I'll ask Karen to talk about the polyethylene prices [indiscernible]. So first-quarter margins are going to be squeezed as we said. I would expect the exit-rate of the quarter and first-quarter to be higher as we land those polyethylene prices through the quarter and as some of the feedstock costs come off. So something in the ballpark of a $1.4 billion a quarter from second-quarter to fourth quarter could be more in-line with how we performed if you looked at the last year's results and the market backdrop that we've got. And then you've got about $300 million of cost reductions that we outlined today. And then you have the growth levers that we remain focused on. So we've got Texas 8 ramped back up and we've got our Glycol-2 unit back up in the market. It reached full growth rates or full production rates in the fourth quarter. You see that in the results in the fourth quarter. And then on-top of that, we're counting on a little bit of help from GDP to get there. So I think we will -- I would think we will see things improve. We have a bit in addition to the compression in first-quarter on pricing in PNSP, we've got the turnarounds out, but the full-year turnaround number will be flat. Karen, do you want to talk a little bit about price and what you expect on the non-market side? Karen S. Carter: Yes. So in the first-quarter, a little bit what we saw in December is we'll continue to see some contract resets, but then also we also expect to see some non-market moves as well. But I think the key thing as you think about first-quarter from a margin compression perspective is really that those feedstock costs are outpacing the rate of price increases. And so, if you think about it this way, we have price increases that we are going to implement over the January and February timeframe, but the higher feedstock costs occurred right at the beginning of the year. So you are right, we will continue to see some market -- non-market moves, but again, a few more contract resets as we continue to grow our share on our volume. And then the other headwind that Jim just mentioned is that, we are going to have a few more turnarounds on the energy side, but also in functional polymers. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Josh Spector with UBS. Please go ahead. Josh Spector : Yes, hi, good morning. I was wondering if you could talk about the risk and potential mitigation activities you could do around tariffs, specifically around Canada. I mean, I think I assume that a lot of the tons from your facilities in Canada come into the US versus export markets. I guess, first, can you clarify what that mix is? And if that is right, what can you do to mitigate the impact or how do you plan around this? Jim Fitterling : Yes, good question, Josh. I mean, I think the most important thing is what we're doing right now, which is engage with the administration on providing data for ourselves and also for the industry to understand the situation. And we're starting to see every day like more refinement on what's happening. I think it's pretty clear in the near-term of the discussion is around getting control over immigration and the flow of fentanyl into United States. We're relatively balanced with Canada. We trade both ways with Canada, a little bit more coming into the US from a finished product standpoint, but we've got product that moves both ways. So trying to just have an overall picture of what the energy complex and the petrochemicals complex looks like there, so that we don't create unintended consequences. And I don't think it's the administration's view to do something that's going to hurt the global economy. I think they want to try to create the situation where we continue to have growth in investment here. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Parkinson with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Chris Parkinson : Great. Thank you so much. Jim, just want to dive a little deeper. I think we did it last-time, just how you're thinking about some of the EU assets by country. And I think last summer you were going over the Netherlands and Germany. And there are a lot of strategic reviews going on in Intercontinental Europe right now. So just trying to think about the -- how you fit into like the larger picture in terms of these developments and how they're basically panning out over the next several years? Thank you. Jim Fitterling : Sure. That's a great question, Chris. If you look at the EU, obviously, the number one challenge is energy competitiveness. And so, relatively speaking, Spain has a pretty decent advantage right now from an energy standpoint. So there, we're looking with our partners at Repsol and how do we reduce the combined cost between the two of us on operations in Spain. When you get to the Netherlands, while we announced the idling of a cracker to avoid the turnaround cost this year, I don't want you to assume that that's the answer to the European strategic review and if that really is just something that we have the ability to do this year to manage through the short-term situation. The Netherlands has been pretty competitive throughout and our cost positions have been pretty good there. So we just have to look at the market for ethylene. We're a net merchant ethylene seller, we got to look at those balances and we've got to look at the propylene market and balances and that will drive what we decide to do there. I'd say that the Netherlands as a country still very focused on energy and discussions recently. They still have a focus themselves on adding nuclear power generating capability, which I think is going to help them with their energy costs. On Germany, a lot is going to depend on this election at the end of February. I think it's shaping up that there will be a change in the German government. And if you look at what happened post-COVID, Germany moved fast to take action when the Russian supply on gas was stopped and now has five LNG import facilities operating and it's really shifted the balance on LNG imports. However, the LNG import costs are $10 to $15 a million BTU into Europe. So longer-term, we have to look at what else can we do in Germany structurally to get the cost-down. I think it's going to require state action to make that happen. I don't think the EU is going to do something that drives this. I think it's going to require the states pushing back and there's no state that has more heft in this discussion than Germany. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Frank Mitch with Fermium Research. Please go ahead. Frank Mitsch : Yes, thank you. Good morning and congratulations, Karen, on your new role. Jim, I want to ask about the III segment in terms of the first-quarter. You're calling out $100 million sequential headwinds, mostly from one-offs excluding higher energy. Can you talk about what you're seeing in terms of the pace of business between the polyurethanes and Construction and Industrial Solutions segments? One would thought this US Gulf Coast freeze would be fantastic for your de-icing business, etc. So can you give us -- absent kind of these one-offs, what is really going on in those businesses as we sit here in the first-quarter? Jim Fitterling : Karen, why don't you unpack that? Karen S. Carter: Yes. No, thanks for that question. So if I look at the first-quarter and I'll take polyurethanes and construction chemicals first. We're not really seeing any signs of demand recovering despite the interest-rate cuts in the US and Europe. And as you know, we have several applications in that business that are really sensitive to interest rates. So whether you're talking about betting and furniture, but also obviously in the housing applications as well. And if you think about US home affordability, it remains at its historic lows, but then also interest rates there are above 7%. We also saw in the fourth quarter automotive start to slow. And if you think about that from a US perspective, those inventories are at 10 years high -- 10-year highs. And so that's one of the reasons that we announced on the last earnings the strategic review of our European footprint, really where we're looking at polyurethanes in particular. And so then if I pivot to DIS there, what I would say is that overall demand really does remain stable. We are seeing some green shoots and global energy demand and also pharma demand, which is really good for us. De-icing, as you indicated, is a seasonal tailwind. So we'll see if the cold weather continues to persist. But then one of the things that's notable in the first-quarter around DIS is that we do have increased turnaround there where we're taking our unit and Seadrift down. So that will result in a tailwind for us. So I would say overall, on the polyurethane side, just continuing to see challenging market demand, market macros. But then also on the Industrial Solutions side, with the continued ramp of Glycol-2 that's now fully back, we should see a tailwind there. But again, some of that is being muted with the turnaround that we see in first-quarter. Jim Fitterling : So I would just add, Frank, on automotive, the shape of automotive last year was a pretty strong start to the year in terms of production units. And you saw automotive, I think being positive as we move through the middle of the year and then towards the end-of-the year, a lot of pull-down in inventory in automotive. So dealer discounts and things happening, you saw China moving a product in advance at the end-of-the year because they wanted to get ahead of tariffs. And so we -- I don't know, but we could see similar -- something similar happen this year where automotive starts strong again and we just have to keep an eye on what happens with inventories there and demand in the automotive sector. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Cunningham with Citi. Please go ahead. Patrick Cunningham : Hi, good morning. On the lower siloxane pricing environment, which is impacting PMNC, are China oversupply issues getting better or worse into 2025? And with the focus on more downstream specialties, would you anticipate taking any further actions on upstream assets or do you anticipate others to take actions on capacity here? Jim Fitterling : Good morning, Patrick. Good question. I'd say it's getting better, but it's -- the pace of getting better is slow. And I'd say the business is taking a look at the upstream side and what they want to do in that space. The downstream demand has been good, Karen, maybe make a few comments about how you see things there. Karen S. Carter: Yes, so thanks, Jim. I mean, downstream continues to grow for us quite significantly. And if you look at even last quarter, we grew above GDP and we expect that to continue to occur as we get into 2025. I mean, we are seeing really good downstream growth in our markets like electronics, but also in home and personal care. And so, on the upstream as you indicated, we did see pretty significant capacity additions, primarily in China in the 2022-2023 time-frame, that has slowed significantly, but we're continuing to see an overcapacity situation there. Overtime though with the higher than GDP growth in those end-market segments, we do expect it to come into balance, but we are staying squarely focused on continuing to grow those downstream applications in silicones. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead. Kevin McCarthy : Yes, thank you and good morning, everyone. Jeff, I was wondering if you'd walk-through your view of non-operating sources of cash-flow and uses in 2025, specifically, I'm thinking about after-tax cash proceeds from your infrastructure deal. I think you have some pending litigation with Nova, if I'm not mistaken. And then any cash sources or uses associated with your new restructuring announced today as well as the strategic review of your asset-base in Europe and other items you may care to call out? Thank you. Jim Fitterling : Good morning, Kevin. Yes, if you look at our cash flow for 2025, a couple of things to consider here. If you take whatever the expectations are from an EBITDA perspective for the year, I would assume right now an approximately 70% cash conversion rate over the course of the year. We just provided a guide on the CapEx now in the range of $3 billion to $3.2 billion. So on average midpoint there, $3.1 billion. The dividend, I would make the assumption there $2 billion. And as we mentioned on the call, from a infrastructure proceeds perspective, that could be anywhere from a minimum of $2.4 billion up to $3 billion during the course of the year. Our net interest expense guide is approximately $600 million on a full-year basis. We are continuing to make good progress on the Nova judgment situation there and we should have more to say about that throughout the course of the year. So I would say, Kevin, those are the primary puts and takes as you think about the cash-flow walk from the beginning of the year through the end of 2025. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Roberts at Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead. John Roberts : Thank you. How much EBITDA is involved with the new JV with Macquarie? And your minority interest for 2024 was only $85 million. If Macquarie goes to 49%, how high does that minority interest line-item go to? Jeff Tate : Good morning, John. I'll take that one. This is Jeff. There is no EBITDA impact because this enterprise will be consolidated as part of our normal reporting results. But the impact will be more on the non-controlling interest line once the transaction closes. And obviously, the dividend impact on the cash flow statement will be the other sizable change that you will see overtime. So we'll have more guidance to share once the transaction closes and you'll be able to quantify the potential impact of that at that particular point. And again, we expect by midyear to have the transaction close. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Duffy Fisher with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Duffy Fischer : Yes, good morning. Two more questions on cash-flow. So Jeff, I think you talked earlier about building some inventory for your planned turnarounds in the first half, but working capital ate about $0.5 billion last year when sales and COGS were down pretty meaningfully. So how much release do you think you can get on a full-year basis from working capital this year? And then the second one is that, other assets and liabilities line was a negative $1.1 billion in cash flow last year. What's in that? And does some of that come back eventually? Jim Fitterling : Sure. So good morning, Duffy. In regards to the first question around working capital, what -- right now for 2025, we would make the assumption of a use of cash in the $300 million to $400 million range on a full year basis. Then if we look at the other liabilities line, and assets, right now we're down about $900 million year-over-year, and that's really primarily driven by some of the long-term tax payables and related tax audit reassessments that we had throughout the course of the year. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Michael Leithead with Barclays. Please go ahead. Michael Leithead : Great. Thank you. Good morning, guys. I'll probably just put a bow on the cash questions. There's obviously been a lot of investor focus lately around the dividend, just given the ongoing trough in your current cash generation. And Dow is obviously quite proud of maintaining an industry-leading dividend based on your earlier comments and some of the actions you're taking to free-up cash. So can you maybe just lay out why Dow believes maintaining this level of dividend is sort of the best priority of cash here versus, say, using that cash for balance sheet support or even further organic growth investment. Jim Fitterling : I'll take a shot at it and I'll ask Jeff if he wants to add anything, but north of 65% of our owners count on that dividend. And so, we listen very carefully onto what they want to see. And we have a lot of experience on how important the dividend is to our shareholders. And so that's why it's a top priority for us. Jeff Tate : Yes, the only thing I would add, Jim, is that we don't have any substantive debt maturities due until 2027. And the ones that we have in 2025 are approximately about $0.5 billion, we're in a good position to be able to support on those debt repayments during the course of this year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alexei with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Aleksey Yefremov : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I wanted to clarify if your $1 billion cost-reduction target includes the European actions that you will be discussing in the middle of 2025 or would those European actions be in addition to the $1 billion? Jim Fitterling : You'll have them in addition. I think there are some things that will probably have a little bit of overlap, but the asset discussions will be in addition to what we've just announced. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the Q&A session for today. I would now like to turn the call over to Andrew Reiker for closing remarks. Andrew Riker : Thank you, everyone, for joining our call and we appreciate your interest in Dow. For your reference, a copy of our transcript will be posted on Dow's website within 48 hours. This concludes our call. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today\u2019s meeting. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
