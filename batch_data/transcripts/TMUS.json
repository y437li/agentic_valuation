Welcome to the T-Mobile US First Quarter 2014 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] This conference call is being recorded today, May 1, 2014. And now I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Nils Paellmann, Head of Investor Relations for T-Mobile US. Please go ahead, sir. Nils Paellmann : Good morning. Welcome to T-Mobile's First Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. With me today are John Legere, our President and CEO; and Braxton Carter, our CFO. Let me just read the disclaimer. During the course of this earnings call, the company will make projections and other forward-looking statements that are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. A detailed discussion of the risks and uncertainties that affect the company's business and qualify the forward-looking statements made in this call is contained in T-Mobile's SEC filings, particularly the risk factors included in our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 25, 2014. Copies of T-Mobile's SEC filings are available online from the SEC or at the Investor Relations homepage on the T-Mobile website. The company's projections and forward-looking statements are based on factors that are subject to change, and therefore, these statements speak only as of the date they are given. The company does not undertake any duty to update any projections or forward-looking statements. In addition, during today's discussion, management will comment on both actual results and certain non-GAAP results. Reconciliations between GAAP results and these non-GAAP results are available quarterly on the Investor Relations homepage on our website at t-mobile.com. Let me now turn it over to John Legere. John? John J. Legere: Okay. Good morning, everyone. I'm very excited to be here to talk about our first quarter results. And as I hope you've seen, 2014 started out extremely strong, and Q1 was a record-breaking quarter for T-Mobile. And in a true Un-carrier fashion, we didn't break just one record, we shattered a whole slew of them. So let me jump right in and dive into some of what we are ready to announce today. The wireless industry did continue to grow in Q1, which I think is news up until you could see our numbers. And T-Mobile captured virtually all of the industry phone growth while successfully taking market share from all of our competition. Once again, T-Mobile was the fastest-growing wireless company in America. Our Un-carrier moves have ushered in a consumer revolution, giving consumers a stronger voice. And that's showing up in our results. In fact, we added more postpaid net additions this quarter than all 3 of our big competitors combined. Our total net customer additions were nearly 2.4 million, our first-ever quarter of over 2 million net adds and our fourth consecutive quarter over 1 million. Branded postpaid net additions were over 1.3 million. And here is where it gets interesting. Our phone adds were over 1.2 million, outperforming our nearest industry competitor by a multiple of 12x. Un-carrier 4.0 clearly delivered. And as new devices launch and prompt customers to reconsider which wireless provider is best for them, we believe that Un-carrier 4.0 will continue to give customers the freedom to choose T-Mobile. We delivered top line growth and have set the stage to significantly grow the bottom line in the future. Service revenues of $5.3 billion represent our fourth consecutive quarter of pro forma sequential growth and a return to year-over-year growth. Year-over-year, we grew pro forma service revenue 4.5% and postpaid service revenues by 5.6%, the best since the fourth quarter of 2008. And that was during a seasonally soft first quarter. Q1's adjusted EBITDA of $1.1 billion reflects strong business momentum from the investment we have made in significant customer growth in the ETF offer. We believe this tradeoff is clearly in our favor, given the high quality of these new customers and the benefit of adding them in Q1 for the full 2014 EBITDA. Customer quality continues to be very strong. Customers are signing up for more data, paying their bills and staying with us longer. This is reflected in our record-low churn and improving customer quality metrics. Service bad debt expense declined, and the percentage of Prime customers in both our growth adds and EIP receivables increased significantly year-over-year. T-Mobile continues to thrive and grow. We have a clear strategy focused on addressing consumer pain points, and we are constantly bringing innovations to the market. We won't stop innovating. And we will never stop advocating for America's wireless consumers. In April, we took another series of steps with 4 days of back-to-back announcements. In case you missed it, let me quickly hit the highlights. We launched Simple Starter, a $40 per month unlimited talk, text and 500 megs data plan built for value-conscious consumers. Then we rolled out Operation Tablet Freedom, unleashing consumers to experience tablets beyond Wi-Fi limitations and making us the only major national carrier or retailer to offer LTE tablets for the price of Wi-Fi-only models. Next, we delivered on the biggest launch of the year so far, the Samsung Galaxy S5 with 0 down. Last but not least, Overage Freedom, our final and most compelling new move. We abolished overages for all of our customers. And I challenged AT&T, Verizon and Sprint to step up and do the same. We pioneered this industry movement, and I launched a petition for consumers to speak up via Change.org, where the petition has over 171,000 signatures to date. What a great way to start the year. While the competition has been busy reacting to us and imitating our moves, we've been rolling out new initiatives. And I feel great about them. Now I know you guys want to see all of this in numbers. So I'll start by telling you now that we are significantly raising our branded postpaid net adds guidance to 2.8 million to 3.3 million. I stated before that we would hit the high end of our original guidance. And we're not only doing that, we're raising it further. We are also slightly revising our adjusted EBITDA guidance to account for this investment in significant growth. This is a short-term trade worth making. Well, today marks the 1-year anniversary of the closing of the MetroPCS deal and T-Mobile becoming a public company. What a better way to mark that milestone than with rapid growth and a record-breaking quarter. This turnaround represents a major transformation. We turned a declining business into a growth business. The question is, how? By listening to customers and offering them exactly what they told us they wanted : great service on a nationwide, lightning-fast 4G LTE network; devices when and how they want them; and plans that are simple, affordable and without the restrictions the other guys place on them. These actions delivered results in just 12 months. We added over 6 million total customers, including 2.4 million this quarter. On the postpaid side, we had over 7 million postpaid gross adds, including 2.3 million this quarter, resulting in over 3.5 million postpaid net customers and over 1.3 million this quarter. We achieved record-low churn of 1.5% in Q1, down 40 basis points year-over-year. We went from 0 4G LTE covered POPs to 209 million by the end of the year. We now stand at more than 220 million, not to mention we have the fastest nationwide 4G LTE network in the United States. And as we rapidly integrate MetroPCS, we've added an additional 30 markets and nearly 2,200 additional doors. And we're not done yet. We will continue to move with agility, precision and speed to drive this business forward. Sounds pretty simple, doesn't it? In truth, it takes a lot of hard work from our team to start this Un-carrier revolution. And our stock chart shows that investors recognize the impact of these moves that they are having on the marketplace. Our stock is up nearly 88% since completing the merger last year. And that's as of yesterday's trading. Now let's drill into our Q1 results further. Q1 was a quarter of records. Just listen to this again. We added over 1.3 million branded postpaid customers, our best result ever. That consisted of over 1.2 million branded postpaid phone net adds, another record, and by far the best in the industry. And I'll be glad in Q&A to remind you of the results of the others if you forgot them. Contrary to popular belief, the wireless industry continued to grow in Q1, when you add this to those other devastatingly low numbers. And I think you now see that T-Mobile captured virtually all of the industry phone growth while successfully taking market share from competitors. Our gross adds were up 136% year-over-year and 23% quarter-over-quarter, while our postpaid churn was 1.5% in Q1, down 40 basis points year-over-year and 20 basis points sequentially, a winning combination in this business. Our mobile broadband net adds, consisting mostly of tablets, were 67,000. While our competitors have been living off tablets, we're just getting started and see it as a huge opportunity. We expect our momentum to accelerate as the word gets out about Operation Tablet Freedom. Stay tuned. The quality of our customers is showing up in our churn results, which hit a record low this quarter. Customers are not only coming to us in droves, they're staying with us longer. Quality is also showing up in our customer mix. The mix of Prime customers within the branded postpaid gross adds increased 19% year-over-year. 53% of the EIP receivables were classified as Prime, up 9 percentage points from 44% at the end of the first quarter 2013. And service bad debt expense continues to decline, down 3% year-over-year and 13% sequentially. I also want to point out that our branded prepaid business had an outstanding quarter. We had 465,000 branded prepaid net adds, up 353,000 versus the fourth quarter and 155,000 last year. The improvement was driven primarily by the MetroPCS brand expansion, more than offsetting the migration from prepaid to postpaid that we have seen since the launch of Simple Choice. We saw that migration continue in the fourth quarter -- first quarter with approximately 110,000 customers moving from prepaid to postpaid. Now let me turn to the total customer growth, including wholesale. Total branded nets, including postpaid and prepaid, were almost 1.8 million in Q1. That's up 807,000 sequentially and nearly 1.7 million year-over-year. We also had a solid performance in wholesale in the first quarter with a total of 603,000 net adds, of which MVNO was 383,000 and M2M was 220,000. Combining all of this, we generated 2.4 million total net adds, moving the customer base of T-Mobile close to the 50 million customer mark. This marks our first quarter ever with over 2 million net adds and the fourth quarter consecutively with over 1 million net adds. That is amazing, especially in the seasonally slow first quarter. Let's talk about network. Our network is the foundation of our success. We continue to modernize, increase coverage and speed and meet our customers' rising expectations. Let me give you a few highlights about where we stand today and what we're working on for 2014. We continue to expand our 4G LTE network this year. We now stand at more than 220 million 4G LTE covered POPs, and we're well on our way to covering more than 250 million people this year. T-Mobile continues to deliver the fastest 4G LTE network in the U.S. based on download speeds from millions of user-generated test results and not competitor-funded drive testing. In the first quarter, T-Mobile experienced average download speeds of 16.9 megabits per second, ahead of Verizon at 15.5 and AT&T at 14 and well ahead of Sprint at 8.1. And we continue to ramp up our speeds as we commit more spectrum to LTE and upgrade our cell site backhaul. The most recent data from April demonstrates our continued leadership, with T-Mobile speeds at 18.6 and widening the gap to second-place Verizon at 16.5. We have now rolled out 10+10 4G LTE in 43 of the top 50 metro areas. We've rolled out 15+15 in 9 metro areas and expect to hit 19 by year end. And 20+20 is live in North Dallas and Detroit and will be available in at least 7 markets by year end. As a reminder, with 20+20 4G LTE, customers are getting average download speeds in the 20s and 30s, and we have observed peak download speeds closing in on 150 megabits per second. Our network speed is incredible and just getting better. As you may have heard, our 700 MHz A-Block transaction with Verizon closed yesterday and ahead of schedule. The transaction results in a net gain in spectrum position in a significant number of major markets, complements our already best-in-class mid-band spectrum position and, importantly, covers 70% of the existing T-Mobile customer base. Combining with our existing A-Block holdings in Boston, T-Mobile now has low-band spectrum covering 158 million people or approximately 50% of the U.S. population in key places such as New York, L.A., Dallas, Houston, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Washington, D.C. and Detroit. In total, our low-band spectrum covers 9 of the top 10, 21 of the top 30 metro areas in the U.S. We will quickly commence deployment of this spectrum in 2014 and can't wait to get started. There will be more spectrum to auction over the next 2 years, including low-band. We appreciate the work of the regulators to enable fair and competitive access to the spectrum for all parties. And we are carefully weighing our options on the best path forward. Now let me provide you with an update on the MetroPCS integration, which continues to exceed even our own expectations. The MetroPCS customer base is rapidly migrating to T-Mobile-compatible handsets. Currently, 53% of the total MetroPCS customer base is already on the T-Mobile network, up from nearly 40% at the end of the year. In terms of spectrum, more than 50% of the MetroPCS spectrum on a megahertz POP basis have already been refarmed and integrated into the T-Mobile network at the end of the first quarter, up from 25% at the end of the year. In 2013, we added 30 new MetroPCS markets, and we will continue to ramp up distribution. We've added 500 new Metro distribution points in Q1, bringing the total to nearly 2,200 doors in the expansion markets and a grand total of 9,000 MetroPCS outlets nationwide. Last quarter, we gave you a detailed update on synergies and integration costs. And we will be providing further updates on our progress when we present our year-end results. Let me just tell you that we remain confident, more than ever, that the synergies projected at the announcement of our transaction were conservative and are coming in ahead of expectations. As evidence of this, I will again highlight that we are moving MetroPCS 3G CDMA customers to a better, faster network and offering them a better experience on the T-Mobile network. This will enable us to accelerate the shutdown of the CDMA portion of the MetroPCS market in several markets in 2014, a year earlier than expected. We plan to shut down the CDMA portion of networks in Philadelphia, Las Vegas and Boston later this summer with the potential for early shutdown in several additional markets in 2014, all while ensuring a seamless transition for our customers. Overall, what an incredible quarter. Now I'd like to turn things over to our CFO, Braxton Carter, for our review of the quarterly financials and guidance, and then I'll be back to answer questions. Braxton? J. Braxton Carter : Yes. Thank you, John, and good morning. I'm so excited to share these fantastic results with you. Let me start by discussing our revenues and adjusted EBITDA for the quarter. All figures for 2013 are presented on a pro forma basis to allow for an apples-to-apples comparison. In the first quarter, total revenue amounted to $6.9 billion, growing at more than 15% year-over-year and 0.7% quarter-over-quarter. The year-over-year growth was primarily due to strong equipment sales. And it's important to point out that the sequential increase was driven by the growth in service revenues. Equipment sales were down $133 million versus the fourth quarter while service revenues were up $168 million. The decline in equipment sales is largely attributable to the accounting treatment for our ETF program, which reduced equipment sales and adjusted EBITDA by approximately $100 million. In the first quarter, we financed $1.2 billion of equipment sales on our Equipment Installment Plan, or EIP, up slightly compared to the fourth quarter of 2013. Going forward, we will see service revenue become an increasing driver of total revenue growth. For me, service revenues were a key highlight this quarter, the fourth consecutive quarter of sequential growth and a return to year-over-year growth, which was 4.5%, a great start to the year. This growth was due to the significant increase in customers and a moderating decline in ARPU. We generated nearly $1.1 billion of adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter, reflecting the pressures of a significant acceleration in growth, strong uptake of the ETF offer and record smartphone sales. First quarter adjusted EBITDA declined 12% sequentially as customers responded to the ETF offer in huge numbers, creating growth at a time where there is typically a seasonal slowdown. The uptick of the ETF offer amounted to approximately 21% of branded postpaid gross adds with a corresponding equipment revenue and adjusted EBITDA impact of approximately $100 million. We also had record smartphone sales of 6.9 million units and a branded postpaid upgrade rate of 7%, down from 9% in the fourth quarter and up from 5% in the first quarter of 2013. Underlying cost discipline remained strong, and as you can see from the essentially flat SG&A line and cost of service, which increased only modestly. Turning to ARPU. Branded postpaid ARPU declined by 1.4% sequentially in Q1. And that is a significant improvement compared to the drop of 2.9% in the fourth quarter. We are still seeing ARPU decline due to the ongoing adoption of the Simple Choice plan, which puts pressure on service revenues. We are encouraged by the fact that we have already gone through most of the migration, in contrast to our competitors, who are just starting out migrating to value-type plans. At the end of the first quarter, 75% of our branded postpaid base was on Simple Choice or Value plans, up from 69% at the end of Q4. We continue to expect ARPU will generally stabilize in the second half of 2014 once we are done with most of the migration to Simple Choice. We also expect the recent price changes, like increasing the price of our 4G unlimited offer and eliminating affinity discounts for these customers, will help us achieve our ARPU goal. I also want to give you an update on branded postpaid average billings per user, or ABPU. As a reminder, this is branded postpaid service revenues plus EIP billings divided by average branded postpaid customers. It approximates what we receive on a cash basis from our customers on a monthly basis. Looking at it this way, ABPU of $59.54 in the first quarter grew 3.9% year-over-year and 1.3% sequentially. These numbers show a significant acceleration from Q4, when the ABPU was up 1.4% year-over-year but down 0.5% sequentially. And I also want to give you an update on our customer quality metrics. Our service bad debt expense was down 3% year-over-year and 13% sequentially. And service bad debt expense as a percentage of service revenues was 1.4%, down 12 basis points year-over-year and 26 basis points sequentially. Total bad debt expense was up $13 million sequentially and $30 million year-over-year due to the tremendous growth in our EIP program. But the ratios remained well within our bands, and we are confident we are adding the right customers. Lastly, branded prepaid ARPU grew slightly both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter, reflecting growth in monthly prepaid plans that include data services. Turning to cash CapEx and cash flows. We spent a total of $947 million in cash CapEx in the first quarter, supporting the ongoing investment in our [indiscernible]. That was up 7% compared to the fourth quarter and down 23% compared to the first quarter of 2013. We continue to expect that full year 2014 CapEx will be between $4.3 billion and $4.6 billion with a bit of a ramp later in the year as we start shutting down the CDMA portions of the MetroPCS network and commence the rollout of 700 MHz. And we continue to see the benefits of our spend as our 4G LTE network, the fastest in the nation, covers more than 220 million people in 284 metro areas. While supporting the necessary network modernization, we also remained focused on free cash flow generation. In the first quarter, we generated simple free cash flow, that is adjusted EBITDA minus cash CapEx, of $141 million despite the cash outflows associated with our successful ETF program launch and the significant growth that we've recorded. A recent factoring agreement benefited cash flow from operating activities by $434 million in the first quarter. In terms of working capital, total EIP receivables, net of allowances for credit losses, increased by $540 million from Q4, reaching a total of $3.1 billion in Q1. I want to point out that the sequential increase in our EIP receivables of $540 million in Q1 was less than the $679 million sequential increase we experienced in Q4 as strong growth in our EIP collections more than offset slightly growing equipment sales financed on EIP. To put it simply, the working capital drag appears to be decreasing. Based on our current projections, the EIP program is expected to cross over in the course of 2015, meaning that total EIP billings will exceed the amount of EIP financed, resulting in a decrease of total EIP receivables. Our cash position remains strong. We had ending cash of approximately $5.5 billion. Pro forma for the acquisitions of 700 MHz A-Block spectrum from Verizon, which closed yesterday, our cash balance will be reduced to $3.1 billion, still leaving us with significant financial flexibility. Net debt, excluding towers, amounted to $14.6 billion at the end of Q1 or 3x our pro forma combined adjusted LTM EBITDA at the low end of our target range of 3 to 4x. Pro forma for the spectrum deal, our net leverage ratio will be 3.4x. Let me now turn to our guidance for 2014. Given our Un-carrier initiatives, we expect the momentum in branded postpaid customer growth to continue and would currently expect between 2.8 million and 3.3 million branded postpaid net additions in 2014. That is up from our prior guidance of 2 million to 3 million branded postpaid net additions and an increase of 550,000 postpaid customers at the midpoint. Adjusted EBITDA is now expected to be between $5.6 billion and $5.8 billion. That is a revision to our prior guidance of $5.7 billion to $6 billion. We are reducing our adjusted EBITDA guidance slightly to incorporate our new guidance for customer growth in 2014. Cash CapEx is expected to be between $4.3 billion and $4.6 billion. That has not changed versus prior guidance. The transition to Simple Choice plans should be largely complete by the end of this year with the penetration of Simple Choice and Value plans reaching 85% to 90% of the branded postpaid base by the end of 2014. Again, that has not changed versus prior guidance. As to the second quarter of 2014, while not providing quarterly guidance, I want to point out that we do not expect that Un-carrier 4.0, our ETF offer, will have as dramatic an effect on customer net additions as it did in the first quarter. However, we are still experiencing significant customer interest in our Un-carrier propositions and our ETF offer, which should be taken into account projecting Q2 adjusted EBITDA. Let me now turn it back to John for a recap of the highlights. John J. Legere: Okay. Thank you, Braxton. It was, as you could hear, a record quarter on many fronts, which was enabled by the hard work of T-Mobile employees. Consumers have noticed, and the word is spreading like wildfire. The consumer wireless movement is rapidly approaching a tipping point, and that's when this gets really interesting. The first year of Un-carrier has been terrific, but it's going to pale in comparison to what lies ahead. The wireless industry, as you can hear, did grow in Q1. Big news. And T-Mobile captured virtually all of the industry growth while successfully taking market share from the competition. Now I'm going to recap highlights one more time, in particular because Roger Cheng has spent the whole call tweeting to me and because Dave Barden's writings suggest he might not have heard them the first time. So on the 1-year anniversary of going public, T-Mobile celebrated with rapid growth and a record-breaking first quarter : 2.4 million total net customer additions, our largest number of customers added in a single quarter; over 1.3 million branded postpaid net customer additions, including more than 1.2 million phone adds. Small recap, by the way, Verizon's were minus 138,000, AT&T's were positive 100,000 and Sprint's were minus 747,000. 136% year-over-year and 23% Q-over-Q increase in branded postpaid gross customer adds. A record 6.9 million smartphones sold in Q1. We are growing service revenue. This was our fourth consecutive quarter of sequential service revenue growth, which grew 4.5% year-over-year. And we expect to convert this into adjusted EBITDA growth in 2014 and beyond. We're adding the right customers, more Prime customers, customers who are purchasing higher data buckets and customers who are staying longer. T-Mobile is in a growth phase where we expect to drive further momentum and continue investing in profitable growth. We're raising our subscriber expectations for the full year after only 1 quarter. And we're clearly not done yet. Now I think we're ready for Q&A, operator. First question, please, Shelley. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Kevin Smithen with Macquarie. Kevin R. Smithen - Macquarie Research : Given the success you had after Macklemore at CES, we were surprised you didn't crash Sprint's Pharrell concert this week. I wondered if you could discuss porting ratios with AT&T, Verizon and Sprint over the past several weeks. I know these companies have all launched new EIP plans with some promotional pricing. And I want to see what the development has been in the latter half of the quarter and into April, if you can provide that specificity. John J. Legere: Yes. Let me start that, and then I'll ask Mike Sievert to comment on it. First of all, the reason we didn't go to the Sprint party is that if I hear that \"Happy\" song one more time, I'm going to stab somebody. And I'm not sure how it would sound on intermittent connectivity either. The second thing is, on the porting ratios, we're going to be a little less specific. I think by the end of last quarter, we told you that, roughly, the postpaid porting ratios were 1, 2 and 3 for the big guys and moving in our direction. I will tell you that in early January, they moved to oh-my-God to 1, numbers that I'm sure the industry has never heard and ones that we hasten to even post. They've moved to a little more rational level, as you would expect, after the churn. I would just simply say that they are in a far superior position as to where they were last quarter and ones that even into April show a very strong business. And the ratios in the early part of the quarter were, I think, things that no competitor has ever seen. So we hastened to even show those. But Mike, do you want to comment on that? G. Michael Sievert : Yes, the only thing I would add is that, obviously, Q1 was a very competitive quarter. I mean, all of the major competitors had significant new news. There were pricing actions from both AT&T and Verizon. Sprint has a new initiative that they appear to be very proud of but which -- that which is hard to pronounce. And despite all of that, this was the quarter that T-Mobile delivered record growth. And as John said, porting ratios hit unforeseen levels. And so we haven't disclosed them. We think that they sort of distract from the main message and they hit such levels that it'd be hard to predict whether or not those levels would be sustainable. But it's important to see that T-Mobile is executing and outgrowing the competition in a time, a Q1 period, that was historically very, very competitive across all competitors. John J. Legere: Yes. Kevin, let me give you the bookmarks. This is the only piece I'll let you talk me into it on this. And I know it was really hard to pull this out of me. On one end of the continuum, with one competitor, we actually had individual days that approached 17 :1 on porting ratios. And if you tick that to the other side, I think it's 0.03, 0.04 [ph] or whatever. And there has never been a day in 2014 ever that any competitor has been over 1 with us, so you can take it from there. Obviously, when we stop being coy about a statistic, it's because it's heavily in our favor. Operator : And next, we'll go to Phil Cusick with JP Morgan. Philip Cusick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : I guess, on that point, churn at 1.5%, I looked back and I haven't seen a number that low from a noncellular carrier in 10 years since Nextel was still around. But this first quarter didn't used to be a seasonally low quarter. And given what may be a sort of prepaid upward action going on in your base, should we think of this as sort of seasonally low and then that ramping up a little bit? Or is this still a number that's on its downward trajectory through the year? John J. Legere: Two or 3 things to think about. One is just to play the tape back, since this is a Happy Birthday 1-year for the company, our original goals were to take the 2.5% postpaid churn over successive years from 2.5% to 1.9% to 1.8% to 1.7% at the end of 2016. So we're well ahead of plan. A lot of that has to do with the tremendous network quality that we've gone through. Second point I want to make is it is always important here to put a little footnote in to even amplify the strength of these numbers to remember that we are 100% no contract, no service contracts. And the base of our competitors being far more premium, family, governments, you can question what the target of their churn will be if they go at some point to 100% no contract. We're very satisfied with the 1.5% level. We don't think it'll be a straight line. But we definitely don't think we'll ever return to the other levels. And I think as the network improves with the 700 band that we announced yesterday and that gets to be deployed, we think we have longer-term ways to stabilize and even further decline. But our target is not the existing churn levels of our larger competitors, which we think are temporarily artificially low. But 1.5%, we're very pleased with. It's ahead of our plan. But there's no spike in it that we can point to that we expect to go away. J. Braxton Carter : Phil, you brought up, I think, another very interesting point, and that's the prepaid momentum that we're seeing with the business. And we're very, very excited about the MetroPCS expansion. And that was the primary contributor to that significant year-over-year increase in prepaid net adds. I will tell you, while we don't disclose Metro results individually, the churn profile at Metro is also at an all-time low, amazing retention. Again I think it's a testament to the super-high-quality network, the very rapid migration of the MetroPCS customers over to the T-Mobile network. And we're very encouraged with what we're seeing from a retention standpoint with that brand. John J. Legere: Yes. And I think prepaid churn has gone down considerably. So I think the prepaid churn level is down to 4.3%. And the interesting point is we know that the numbers, the average revenue per user and the churn levels at MetroPCS on the prepaid side were always better than the prepaid magenta brand. And we're now at greater than 60% of our prepaid and rising that is made up of Metro. So we're seeing those benefits and expect to continue. Operator : And next, we'll go to Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson. Craig Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC : Two questions, if I could. First, John, you've obviously proven, at this point, that you can grow your base extraordinarily quickly. Strategically, at what point do you pivot, if at all? Do you think about the longer-term value of this strategy being -- eventually taking some measure of price? Or is it all based on the leverage of your fixed costs? And then a question for Braxton. Just to -- I know it's early days, but as you think about the AWS-3 auctions coming up and the incentive auctions coming up next year, can you just give us some insight into how you would think about financing those spectrum acquisitions, if you have anything to say on that topic yet? John J. Legere: Yes. I'll start, and Braxton can actually segue or Mike can on the first half of the question as well. Yes, we are clearly proving that we can accelerate growth. And it's basically a simple formula associated with solving customer pain points and removing some of the arrogance of the industry. It's not rocket science. And we don't think we're anywhere close to finished with the painfully obvious points that we can attack, that we'll continue to focus on the growth. I would say that it's important to note, as you dig deeper here, especially in the first quarter, if anything, we solidified our pricing envelope in Q1. We added a higher pricing tier. We added a low-end price point but a less-featured option that provides profitability for us in an entry point. So there's no price reduction as a lever for us. And we've been very clear that this ETF program, Contract Freedom's final nail, the attack on the family plans, is a highly profitable approach if done correctly. And so far, it has proven out to come through at the ways that we anticipate. I don't think Braxton or I or the team has ever wavered from our 5-year planned statistics of a highly profitable business growing in operating free cash flow and growing very strongly in EBITDA margin percentages. And we're on track for that. And having these results very front end-loaded in this year help even greater in that plan. So yes, there's no expectations on our part to sacrifice profitability for significant growth. And frankly, the amazing news to us is that we don't need to. But Braxton or Mike, do you want to... J. Braxton Carter : Yes, it's -- when you look at the decision to put the Un-carrier 4.0 ETF offering at the very beginning of the year, part of the calculus there is that enhancing growth in the front end of the year will certainly pay back within your -- and be accretive to the overall results. Q1, from an EBITDA margin standpoint, given the significant investment in our growth, which will pay massive dividends in the future, given the quality of customers that we're bringing on -- remember, we previously talked about 2/3, roughly 2/3, of the flow that we're getting on the ETF offer are the very highest credit quality customers that have the longest tenure with us. You look at the guidance that we've given. Even with very significant acceleration in growth, we're growing EBITDA by 7%, if you take a look [indiscernible] of our guidance on a year-over-year basis, which implies that there's a lot of improvement in the underlying margins that's going to occur during the year. There's multiple factors relating to that. We talked about a decline curve over the year on the ETF offer. You've got MetroPCS synergies with the shutdown of the networks that we've talked about or the CDMA portion of the network that we've talked about. And you also have a lot of other internal initiatives that are just kicking in that are going to be accretive. But we are very, very focused on growing profitability and cash flows over the long term. And what's exciting, when you look at this type of growth and you project that growth on what it does to EBITDA in '15 and beyond, the free cash flow generation of this business gets pretty exciting. Mike, do you want to add anything? G. Michael Sievert : Just quickly, the only thing I would add is that in contrast to what John and Braxton just said, there are plenty of cynics out there, including our competitors, that would tried to convince you that what we're doing is buying growth in an uneconomic way. And what I think we're hearing from both John and Braxton is that the opposite is true. What we're really doing is bringing in the highest-quality customers in our history at a marginal cost from the Un-carrier 4.0 that's a little bit higher as well but far outweighed by things like superior credit class, superior data attach, higher ARPUs, a more Prime credit -- higher EIP attach on these customers as well, which forecasts better churn profiles on them. So we're really, really pleased with the economic system that we have going right now from the Un-carrier moves. These are high-quality customers, so they're going to have great returns. J. Braxton Carter : And as to your second question on the upcoming auctions, we are currently analyzing all the rules. We're awaiting the final rules. We're very supportive of the commission and their initiative to ensure that there is competitive access to adequate spectrum to the competitive carriers on keeping it from being completely monopolized by the predatory duopoly. Again, we have made no final decisions as to the amount of our [indiscernible]. We're analyzing that, and proceeds would come out of existing cash balances with some potential debt financing. John J. Legere: I'm just going to footnote both of those topics for you also. On the first item, I want to amplify that while all this was going on, the attach rate to JUMP! has gone to 81%. We have about 5.3 million people signed up for JUMP!. And the shift to the higher-tier data plans, we've had an attach rate to the higher plans of over 84%. So customers are moving up and moving into Simple Choice. They're moving up, and these things enhance profitability for us as well. On the second point, I think it's important to note, one of the fun things that's happening right now in the United States wireless industry is there's a small taste of what real competition looks like. And the big beneficiaries here are consumers. They're having a ball. Consumers love to see what's going on. And the big guys, rusty as they may be, are attempting to move, and it's fantastic. I mean, so the U.S. industry is seeing a glimpse of what competition looks like. And the decisions that are made in the industry over the next year as to how this spectrum is allocated and how decisions on consolidation and other variables take place is going to be critical decisions to let this U.S. wireless industry continue this game the way it's being played with this all-out wrestling that is perfect for consumers in changing and keeping the United States wireless industry at the forefront of the world. And I think that's a little glimpse as to what's going on. So these are big, bold things that will happen in the industry, and we love the hand that we're holding in that game. Operator : And next, we'll go to Colby Synesael with Cowen and Company. Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : Two questions, if I may. The first one, just want to talk about tablets. Yes, I guess, relative to your competitors, the net adds is a little light, clearly focusing on phone adds right now. But when you think about, over time, you're going to want to start to focus more on monetizing your current customer base, should you be more aggressive on tablets right now? Is the plan that you put in place, I guess, in October working to what you would want it to? Do you have to do more? Just a little bit of color on that. And then the other question is, you've had your value plans in the market now for about a year. You've had the JUMP! plan out since last July. When you look at the resale value you're getting from the devices that you're kicking in, I guess you could even add the ETF in terms of customers giving you their old devices, are you achieving the value for those phones that you were initially anticipating when you put them into the third-party market that effectively makes the math work out based on what you were initially expecting? John J. Legere: Yes. I'll start and throw the ball to the evil genius of the team, Mike. This is a great topic. We're kind of excited about this one and holding back on it. And it is one of those things where if I was one of the other guys -- think about the growth in the industry. The prepaid growth in the industry in Q1 was about 2.2 million subscribers when you look at about 0.5 million phone net adds, of which we got 1.2 million, and about 1.7 million tablets, of which we were not really playing totally in that space. We understood that. And we started in this quarter, after a small start last quarter, of just testing this game. And Operation Tablet Freedom, which was an attempt to get people to stop with these Wi-Fi devices and give them LTE-connected devices at Wi-Fi prices with 1.2 gigs of data free per month for the rest of the year, and then moving, of course, to our lifetime free 200 megs of data. I would tell you that the early response that we got was phenomenal. So a phenomenal, one of those oh-my-God changes in growth. But what those things have told us, this is a space we can really play. And now what's important that you can look for from us is our shift to tablets won't be what you've seen so far. What you've seen so far is players moving to no or negative phone net adds and, therefore, having some positive tablet adds. Now we want to continue very strongly in the phone net add business and grow considerably in the tablet business and then, of course, move to an environment where people are using these devices interchangeably, all LTE-based, all connected. So I think watch this space for us, but not as a way to fill in a hole or not to back up the truck with cheap tablets to fill in numbers. But Mike, do you want to... G. Michael Sievert : Yes. I think just to amplify that, our competitors are relying on this tablet growth, which is a less valuable subscriber in terms of revenues per gigabytes consumed, just to get to 0 on their postpaid net adds or maybe to the first 100,000. And so they're leaning in on that because it's all they've got. Our Un-carrier movement has been systematic since the beginning about focusing on the biggest problems in the biggest space of the industry, and that's smartphones. And we've spent the last year focused on solving consumers in that high-value segment of the industry. And I think the results speak for themselves. But as John said, we're finally coming around to tablets. And we got started only in the fourth quarter. That was when we launched the iPad. That's the significant tablet play. And so we're brand-new with this. Our fourth quarter push was very interesting. But what was much more interesting was Operation Tablet Freedom, launched 2 weeks ago. So you'll have to stay tuned to see how that goes. But you should hear from us some confidence and some excitement about the tablet space. John J. Legere: And I know a number of you go to our stores and do channel checks and see what's going on. If you go in the stores now, the buzz is tablets. The momentum continues on the devices, but the environment is that we've cracked the code. The tablets are moving in a very big way as opposed to the last few quarters. And I think we've only started to innovate in this space. Both Un-carrier moves on the tablet as well as technological shifts in how we think about tablets will be coming from us. Operator : We'll take our next question from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : It comes on a little bit from that last comment on tablets. You obviously raised the net add guidance for the year. But if I look even at the high end of the guidance, it implies a run rate almost half of what you did in the first quarter. And it seems like, given your momentum over the last few quarters, that's a pretty low bar. Can you just talk about the upside to that number? And in particular, we've just seen AT&T pull their ETF offer. Sprint's ends next week. But presumably, you're assuming that your ETF offer continues through the year, and that will help, plus tablets, and drive incremental adds. John J. Legere: Yes. Several things. One is, remember that even at the new guidance that we've given, it still assumes a postpaid run rate of equal to or greater than 0.5 million a quarter. And I think being respectful of the environment and making sure that we put numbers out that we're comfortable with, I think that's the guidance that would serve for the year. Remember, this is only Q1, it's only April. So we're attempting to be conservative, if, in fact, you're all ready to get used to 2.8 million to 3.3 million postpaid adds from T-Mobile being conservative. I think that may take a small time for a couple of the folks on this call. You want to grab into the tablet question? G. Michael Sievert : Yes, I think -- look, I mean, there's a lot of potential for us in the rest of this year. But we don't know what all the rest of the moves from our competitors are going to be. And we'll have to see what happens. But the thing to know from us is we tackle the opportunity one quarter at a time. As Braxton said, we see huge opportunity going forward from Un-carrier 4.0, which, to answer your question, that ETF offer, it's not a promotion. When we launch something with an Un-carrier label on it, that's a commitment to a structural change in the value proposition. We're against contracts. We ended them a year ago for our own new customers. We ended them for the industry in January. And we're going to keep that offer going as long as there are a significant number of customers trapped in contracts in this industry. John J. Legere: Yes. That's a fun topic, right? I don't want to speculate on it. But there's a couple of things, as Mike said. When we announce something in the interest of consumers, it's a change on our behalf to the industry, from our standpoint. And we don't care how long it takes. We ultimately believe that the industry will move to these variables. And remember that this was not ETF payments for us. This was Contract Freedom. So when you take no contracts and the ability for people at the time to make decisions to move over, we have determined that's it. We will do it forever. Okay, so that's number one. Number two, what we've seen is most of our competitors' responses are still time-based, one-off responses to us as opposed to structural changes in the way they serve their customers, whether it was a, if you guys remember, a big touted, \"We're going to pay x amount of dollars for anybody that wants to leave T-Mobile and come to us. Oh, we were only kidding you.\" It's a strange period where they can't believe that they can't just switch and change the environment. And a temporary ETF that's pulled off the table is going to hurt more in their statement to customers. And it also says that they can't figure out structurally the economics of how to make it work. So these are very positive signs for us, but ours will continue. And again, I think it's the -- if not -- if they don't change, it's the end of these plans, right? I mean, one of the things that we haven't talked about is, on the highest-usage devices that we have now, unlimited customers are pulling down over 5 gigs of data a month. And on average, it's about 3.6 gigs on an unlimited plan. So if you take those, along with the elimination of ETF payments, family plans are dead. And so it's only a matter of time. But the game hasn't played out, and you can continue to see us play in that space. Operator : And next, we'll go to Walter Piecyk with BTIG. Walter Piecyk - BTIG, LLC, Research Division : Okay. I guess I'll take the bullet on the deal question. Right now, the FCC, they're probably like doing cartwheels about your subscriber growth for preserving competition. Can you just talk about how you think competition could improve or not improve with any type of market consolidation? John J. Legere: Yes. As I said in some of my comments, this is the start of competition. And again, don't confuse yourselves. And you, of all people, would not be confused by this. The big are still the biggest. These are big, huge people who are probably calculating ways that they can protect their 55% and growing EBITDA margins and cede some share but not change the structure of their whole base in profitability because of the size of what they have. And they're probably playing the long game over 5 to 7 years' worth of spectrum aggregation and CapEx investment, et cetera, and believing that this is clearly a scale game. So as I sit here and look at the growth and momentum, there's a lot of questions that come up. When you play this game over 5 years or so, there are capital requirements and there are multiple ways to continue to play aggressively and to close the gap on the big guys. One of them, of course, that we've been very consistent on is that consolidation to create scale from several subscale players and to provide pooling of capital and pooling of scale and capability is one alternative. And I don't -- we've always said that we think, ultimately in the industry, it's a consolidation game that's a matter of when and not if. And again, that's not just amongst the 4 that you see. It's amongst multiple other tangential players that are sitting on the periphery of the industry looking in, who may want to play, and multiple players that are not seen, so whether it's cable industry, et cetera. So I guess, that's -- we've been consistent on that with no clear statement on timing. Otherwise, there are multiple paths that we need to look very hard at from the standpoint of the capital and the deployment. But when you're growing aggressively and profitably the way we are, we think the hand is a pretty good one to play. So consolidation is clearly... Walter Piecyk - BTIG, LLC, Research Division : Is that timing -- John, is that timing meaningful? Meaning that when you say it's when as opposed to if, is it kind of useless to have consolidation 5 years from now because, basically, things will have come together or some companies may have been in a much worse situation at that point versus now? I mean, how do you view the difference in timing? John J. Legere: Again, consolidation is -- again, as a statement of providing scale and profitability, you can look at it at any point in time. Would consolidation be a positive for the environment now? Of course. Would it be a positive in 2 years from now? It depends upon the players and who they are from a standpoint of what you're looking at as the environment. So we don't -- I know the question, Walt, is leading towards questions about specific consolidation opportunities. And we don't have any comment on those ideas. We just know that our scale, our growth and our momentum could benefit from a significant scaling of the fixed assets and the capital that's required to continue to move. And we are very pleased with the kinds of competition we're able to put to the big guys. And consolidation is one way that we know we could continue to put it aggressively to them over time. Walter Piecyk - BTIG, LLC, Research Division : Okay. And then just if I could sneak in one ops question, which is that Sprint and Verizon -- I think maybe AT&T might have said the same thing, but they're all like, \"Well, January, T-Mobile was kicking our ass, and then like as the quarter progressed, we put in place things that were -- that improved it.\" So sequentially, as they look it through the quarter, they were saying that on a month-by-month basis, that they were able to push back on these ETF plans. So if you can comment kind of how you were exiting the quarter and how things looked at April relative to March or, overall, what the run rate looked like. John J. Legere: Yes. I think, if they're happy with the way customers are migrating as of May 1, it's fine with me. I mean, I'm perfectly good with this. And these are not just Sprint customers coming. I mean, obviously, the Prime credit increase in the quality of our customers are because they are coming from the biggest of the big. And again, we're not talking about porting ratios. Yes, we've seen some response from them. But again, all I can say is, if they're comfortable with the way they are today, then let's go forward from here. G. Michael Sievert : I would just add, there's some truth to what they're saying, and we should all agree that it's probably not sustainable for us to expect to be able to maintain those 17 :1 porting ratios we saw at some periods during the quarter. Walter Piecyk - BTIG, LLC, Research Division : But Mike, doesn't that beg the question that you talked about the pricing envelope? So if there was a pushback through the quarter and that continues, do you have to make another adjustment to that pricing envelope? G. Michael Sievert : Well, you saw us make some pretty significant moves early in Q2. And that's what you've seen us do all through the Un-carrier movement. You've seen us stay ahead of the competition, stay ahead -- set the pace, set the tone of what's being talked about and be unconfused and unresponsive to what they're doing and be focused on solving customer problems. That's worked incredibly well for us since we started Un-carrier. The other guys are responding to us, and you can see how effective they're being at doing that just by looking at all the numbers in Q1. John J. Legere: Yes. Well, a couple of things. I think you've seen this and you've commented on it in some of what you've written. The meaning -- the most meaningful pricing changes in Q1 were really seen as AT&T changing their pricing envelope versus Verizon, right? I mean, I think that's really what took place. And that's the confusing move that has taken place between these guys, not us. And I think, with what we've done with consumers, when you look at Contract Freedom and anytime upgrade and international data roaming and Tablet Freedom, these people are not sitting there waiting for a $10 price reduction from AT&T. It's not going to happen. And I think that's the learning that they've had, that it's not just an old game of people sitting, looking for what's the cheapest by $0.02. They're a detested provider by these consumers, and it's going to take a lot more. And as I said, so far, it was a very aggressive quarter. But as you said, they put changes in, they took changes out. I think that does more to confuse each other. And the game really, I think, right now, is between AT&T and Verizon with each other. I don't think Sprint's really playing right now. And I think they are comfortable with that statement. And I think that will continue for a while. But I think we're pretty pleased exactly where we are. Operator : And we will take our final question from Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays. Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Research Division : And just tailing on the prior question, John, on further consolidation could enable increased competition. I was wondering if you'd be able to share your thoughts on whether or not you think the regulatory agencies would be supportive of further consolidation in the wireless market. Clearly, as the prior question mentioned, the regulatory agencies seem to be supportive of what you folks are doing in the marketplace. And I would welcome any thoughts there. And whether or not you folks would be onboard and somehow supporting further consolidation, I don't know if there's anything that you could do to help enable that type of move. John J. Legere: Yes. I appreciate the question. And again, this is a very complex series of things that can't be looked at in isolation. And I think Chairman Wheeler and the FCC have their hands full on multiple topics. And I think we have to be careful to confuse any individual topic at a time when the attempt is -- and when the Chairman came in, his speech on day 1 and before day 1 was competition, competition, competition. That's what he wants. And in order to have competition, you need to handle the spectrum questions and the auctions that are required. And so to try to simultaneously look at the number of competitors and consolidations and the auctions on a forward-looking basis is a very complicated set of decisions. And I think you have to look at them all at once. Like how do we look at the type of number of competitors that create the best competition in the industry and simultaneously keep stability so that we can set rules and have successful auctions and let spectrum not be the variable that causes competition to cease to exist? So I think I understand clearly what he's trying to do and the timing of each of the variables. And I think we have to respect and fall into his portfolio of how that's done. But I do believe, ultimately, these could all be handled in a way that's best for consumers, where you can have a fair look at consolidation and the number of competitors that provide the best competition and then an auction process and a use of that set of proceeds to get the best competitive long-term situation. So that's the way I look at it. And I don't think you can do any one in isolation without running the risk of forcing one decision to be made in the broader envelope. So I think that's -- respectfully, I think the FCC has their hands full. And I think we need to work with them on all these questions simultaneously. Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Great, that's helpful. And just one other follow-up question around your network. I mean, clearly, you've got subscriber momentum in the marketplace for several quarters now, regardless of how we view sort of your guidance. But it does seem like the momentum probably doesn't subside any time soon. From a network perspective, with folks starting to increase data usage, trade up to higher data plans, how is your comfortability in terms of network quality and the type of investments you'll need to put into the network in order to support a lot more of this data traffic? John J. Legere: Well, I'll let Neville take that because he just woke up when you said the word network, and then I'll... Neville R. Ray: Who could sleep through this call, John? My goodness, a lot of great news. No, I think if you look at the network performance, we're just in a great spot. I mean, we've got great LTE out there today. I mean, the speeds in performance, the latencies on this network are second to none in the industry right now, which is tremendous. What we're doing is we're adding capability as every week goes by. We're adding density to this network on the LTE front. We're adding coverage breadth. We're adding speed enhancements with new backhaul. And most importantly, we're adding more and more spectrum to the T-Mobile network. As we accelerate the combination of the T-Mobile and Metro businesses, more and more spectrum is being put onto the T-Mobile network. So our growth position and our ability to support the growth, the great growth we have as a business at this point in time and as we look forward, is in a great place. I'm very confident with what we're delivering. We actually widened our gap on speed performance against the other big guys in the last month. So killed it in Q1, and we're widening the gap right now. So performance, I think customers are coming onto this network, some for the first time, and they're really surprised about the quality and capability that we've built here. And we have a strong path to increase and improve that performance as we move through this year. And as John mentioned and Braxton mentioned on the call, we now have the 700 MHz asset to start to deploy inside '14, bringing great coverage improvements in buildings, suburban fringe. So we continue to add to a great network story as we move through this year. So I'm very excited about what we have in front of us. And our ability to support the growth is extremely strong right now. John J. Legere: Okay. With that, thank you, everybody, for listening in. And we'll see you next quarter. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the T-Mobile US First Quarter 2014 Conference Call. If you have any further questions, you may contact the Investor Relations department.

Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division Kevin R. Smithen - Macquarie Research Operator : Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the T-Mobile US Second Quarter 2014 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] This conference call is being recorded today, July 31, 2014. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Nils Paellmann, Head of Investor Relations for T-Mobile US. Please go ahead, sir. Nils Paellmann : Good morning. Welcome to T-Mobile's second quarter 2014 earnings call. With me today are John Legere, our President and CEO; and Braxton Carter, our CFO. Let me just get to the disclaimer on Slide 2. During the course of this earnings call, the company will make projections and other forward-looking statements that are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. A detailed discussion of the risks and uncertainties that affect the company's business and qualify the forward-looking statements made in this call is contained in T-Mobile's SEC filings, particularly, the risk factors included in our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 25, 2014. Copies of T-Mobile's SEC filings are available online from the SEC or at the Investor Relations homepage on the T-Mobile website. The company's projections and forward-looking statements are based on factors that are subject to change, and therefore, these statements speak only as of the date they are given. The company does not undertake any duty to update any projections or forward-looking statements. In addition, during today's discussion, management will comment on both actual results and certain non-GAAP results. Reconciliations between GAAP results and these non-GAAP results are available in the Investor -- quarterly, on the Investor Relations homepage on our website at www.tmobile.com. Let me also point out that they have -- that there should be a small change on Page 8 in the deck. The last bullet should read properly, agreements to clear encompass A-Block metro areas in pipe markets covering more than 13 million POPs on top of many markets already free and clear today. So with that said, let me now turn it over to John Legere. John? John J. Legere: Okay. Good morning, everyone. I brought my [Audio Gap] [Technical Difficulty] John J. Legere: Okay. good morning, everyone. I brought the team here to New York Stock Exchange today to talk about our second quarter results and to reflect on the fact that it was in the second quarter of last year that T-Mobile began trading right here. We've done a lot in the last 15 months, we've got a lot more to do. In this quarter, we achieved a bunch of new milestones and are ready to report our progress to you, so let's jump right in. T-Mobile continues to be the fastest-growing wireless company in America. It now has 50.5 million customers. In the second quarter of 2014, we grew our customer base by a total of 1.5 million total net additions, making it the fifth consecutive quarter that we've delivered over 1 million total net adds. Now that's 7.6 million total customers added over the last 5 quarters since we launched the Un-carrier revolution. Our branded net adds for the quarter were also just over 1 million, surpassing this milestone for the second quarter in a row. And on the metric that you all track most closely, T-Mobile led the industry once again with 579,000 branded postpaid phone nets, and this was more than the other 3 major carriers combined. We also finished #1 in branded prepaid nets too, at 102,000 against losses at all of the other carriers. Finally, we've broken the code on tablet sales and sold almost 5x as many tablets in Q2 than in Q1. We continue to see the future upside in tablets, wearables and other devices. This momentum and the level of these customer acquisitions result has translated into total revenue growth of 8% year-over-year, the industry's best this quarter, as with our service revenue growth of 7.1%. By aggressively managing costs, coupled with the revenue growth, we also led the industry in adjusted EBITDA growth of 33.4% quarter-over-quarter. Bottom line, I'm very proud of the performance the team delivered this quarter. On the network front. The T-Mobile network is the fastest nationwide 4G LTE network and I intend to keep it this way. The 4G LTE network now covers more than 233 million Americans in 325 metro areas. Neville and his team are aggressively rolling out our wideband LTE, upgrading our limited remaining 2G footprint to 4G LTE to increase our speed, and we already have started our 700 megahertz A-Block rollout to further increase coverage and quality. I'll take you through these in a bit more detail in a moment. Now it's no secret that I'm possessed with giving our customers nothing short of both a fantastic network -- of both a fantastic network experience but also how we care for them. And all you have to do is follow me on Twitter to see that. This morning, J.D. Power's announced that we finished first in their semi-annual wireless customer care survey for both the T-Mobile and MetroPCS brands. For the T-Mobile brand, this is the first time since February 2011 that the company has received the highest ranking. For MetroPCS, it is the fourth time in a row. Taking all of this in together, we're in full gear and the team is totally focused. Finally, we expect our positive momentum to continue into the second half of 2014. We're increasing our guidance range for branded postpaid net adds this year to 3 million to 3.5 million, and we are not changing our adjusted EBITDA guidance despite this increased customer growth. Now over the last 5 quarters, we turned the declining business into a growth business by simply listening to our customers and offering them what they told us they wanted : great service or a nationwide lightning-fast 4G LTE network; devices, when and how they want them; and plans that are simple, affordable and without the restrictions the other guys place on them. During the second quarter, we continue to accelerate and aggressively drive change into the wireless industry, solving pain points and innovatively advocating for the customer. We kicked off the quarter in April 9 where we launched 3 days of Un-carrier, and we launched our Simple Starter $40 plan, Tablet Freedom and Overage Freedom initiatives. On June 18, we launched Un-carrier 5.0: T-Mobile Test Drive, a new program that invites customers to try our network and an Apple iPhone 5S [indiscernible] for free. On the same day, we launched Un-carrier 6.0: Music Freedom, which allows customers to stream music from the most popular music services without the data usage counting against their 4G data allotments. We will continue to innovate and we will never stop advocating for America's wireless customers. Stay tuned for Un-carrier 7.0 later this summer. Now let's drill into our Q2 results a little bit further. Total branded net had another great quarter at a little over $1 million, up 409,000 a year on a year-over-year basis. Decomposing the 1 million total net ads, branded postpaid net adds were 908,000, up 220,000 from a year ago. Breaking down the branded postpaid adds further, we did 579,000 branded phone net adds, which once again led the industry. We also posted a record 329,000 mobile broadband net add, mostly tablets, up almost 5x from the first quarter. This reflects the success of our Operation Tablet Freedom, which we launched in April. Tablets have become a big part of our business and a big part for the wireless industry, and this quarter's results show that T-Mobile can play to win in that area as well. We see it as a significant opportunity going forward and we're just getting started. The quality of our customers is showing up in our churn results, which continue to be at record lows, and in our customer quality metrics. In the second quarter, branded postpaid phone churn was 1.5%, flat sequentially and year-over-year. And the mix of Prime customers within our branded postpaid growth ads increased 9 percentage points year-over-year. Customers love the T-Mobile experience and they're staying with us longer. This is more we can do, and having regained our #1 position at J.D. Power, the team is focused on it completely. I also want to point out that we have the industry's best branded prepaid performance in the seasonally lower second quarter. We had 102,000 branded prepaid net adds, up from a loss of 87,000 last year, while every other major carrier had negative prepaid net adds in the second quarter. The improvement was driven primarily by MetroPCS brand expansion, more than offsetting the ongoing migration of prepaid to postpaid. Sales of smartphones, including branded postpaid and branded prepaid, were 6.2 million units in the second quarter of 2014 compared to 4.3 million units in the second quarter of 2013. Smartphone sales accounted for 93% of all phone units sold. Now let me turn to customer growth, including wholesale. We generated nearly 1.5 million total net adds in Q2, marking our fifth consecutive quarter with over 1 million net adds and a total of 7.6 million since we launched Un-carrier. We had a solid performance in wholesale in the second quarter with a total of 460,000 net adds, of which MVNO was 235,000 and M2M was 225,000. Our network. It's a foundation of our competitive formula and we're building our network data strong. Let me give you a few highlights about where we stand today and what we're working on in 2014. We continue to expand our 4G LTE network. We now stand at more than 233 million 4G LTE covered POPs and we're well on our way to covering more than 250 million people this year. And we're continually working to improve our network breadth and quality. As part of our 4G LTE network expansion on our limited remaining 2G footprint, we have our first 1,900 megahertz 4G LTE sites on air and more are coming. This rollout should enable us to cover more than 280 million people with 4G LTE by mid-2015. We've also launched voice over LTE or VoLTE this quarter ahead of our competitors and the service covered 107 million POPs today. But I'm happy to announce that as of now, we have full nationwide coverage with more than 200 million POPs covered and growing. So the 107 million was at the end of the quarter, 200 million is as of today and now we're nationwide. In January of this year, I told you we were the fastest nationwide 4G LTE network in the U.S. based on download speeds from millions of user-generated test results. On the last call, I gave you a lot of download speed stats that show T-Mobile as the fastest network in the first quarter. Well, I'm happy to report that we continued our speed leadership for another quarter. Our average download speed based on user-generated test results of 19.3 megabit per second is ahead of Verizon at 16.8 and AT&T at 13.8, and way ahead of Sprint at 9.7. And our speed leadership actually increased during the second quarter. Our speed advantage versus Verizon went from 1.4 megabits in the second -- in the first quarter to 2.5 in the second. And versus AT&T, whose network actually got slower this quarter, our speed advantage went from 2.9 megabits per second last quarter to 5.5 megabits this quarter. We continue to amp up our speed as we commit more spectrum to LTE and upgrade our cell site backhaul. We've now rolled out 10x10 4G LTE in 43 of the top 50 metro areas, and we continue to grow our wideband LTE footprint, currently covering 17 metro areas and aiming for at least 26 by year end. As a reminder, with wideband LTE, customers are regularly observing speeds into 70 megabits per second range. Our network's speed is simply incredible. And all this breadth, quality and speed is happening before Neville and his team really start cranking on the 700 megahertz A-Block spectrum. That will be another game changer for us, so let me give you an update on what lies ahead. Our 700 megahertz A-Block spectrum covers about 158 million or about 50% of the population and 70% of the existing T-Mobile customer base. It covers 9 of the top 10 and 21 of the top 30 metros in the U.S. I'm thrilled to report that the first 700 megahertz sites are already on air. Compatible handsets are being field tested right now and are expected to be available for sale by the fourth quarter. About 1/2 of the markets covered by A-Block spectrum are encumbered by Channel 51, limiting our ability to use the spectrum until after the incumbent broadcasters are relocated. However, Neville and his team have already entered into agreements to relocate broadcasters into new frequencies in 5 markets covering more than 13 million people, making those markets available for launch in 2015. This is in addition to many markets which are already free and clear today, such as Washington, D.C., Miami, Dallas and Houston, just to name a few. We have recently entered into agreements to acquire A-Block spectrum in additional markets for multiple parties covering 8.7 million POPs for approximately $50.5 million. That translates into an average megahertz per POP price of approximately $0.48 compared to $1.85 per megahertz POP price we pay in the Verizon A-Block transaction. As we've said before, we will be opportunistic and disciplined on price, and I believe we have several options for adding low band spectrum to our portfolio, including the 600 megahertz incentive options next year. Now let me provide you with an update on MetroPCS integration, which continues to exceed even our own expectations. The MetroPCS customization is rapidly migrating to T-Mobile compatible handsets. Currently, 2/3 of the MetroPCS customer base is already on the T-Mobile network. That's up from 53% at the end of Q1. In terms of spectrum, approximately 60% of the MetroPCS spectrum on a megahertz POP basis has already been refarmed and integrated into the T-Mobile network at the end of the second quarter. That's up from 50% at the end of last quarter. We also have continued to ramp up distribution in the 30 MetroPCS expansion markets. We added 900 new MetroPCS distribution points in Q2, bringing the total to 3,100 doors in the expansion markets and approaching 10,000 MetroPCS outlets nationwide. Now that's as compared to Cricket, which last reported an approximate 3,000 doors. Now on to an update on synergy and integration costs. With another quarter under our belt, we remain more confident than ever that the synergies projected at the end of the announcement of our transaction were conservative and are coming in ahead of expectations. We'll give you a full financial update on the synergies target as we report full year results. But today, I want to highlight that in early July, we shut down the CDMA portion to the MetroPCS networks in Boston, Hartford and Las Vegas. That's 2.5 years ahead of initial plan. We will be shutting down the CDMA portion of the MetroPCS network in Philadelphia later this summer, and we'll potentially shut down several additional markets by year end, all while ensuring a seamless transition for our customers. Now why is this important? Well, we're moving MetroPCS 3G CDMA customers to a better, faster network and offering them a superior experience. The conversion also frees up spectrum that we can refarm and reuse to improve the speed and quality of the T-Mobile network. And finally, it allows us to realize the synergies from running a leaner single-network structure. It will be a one-time cost associated with these network shutdowns, approximately $250 million to $300 million in 2014. But it is also, materially, it moves the synergy timeline forward. As a reminder, we eventually seek to realize cash savings of $1.5 billion annually in terms of total merger synergies. Note that the one-time cost will be excluded from adjusted EBITDA. Overall, another great quarter. Now I'd like to turn things over to our CFO, Braxton Carter, for a review of the quarterly financials and guidance, then I'll be back to answer questions. Braxton? J. Braxton Carter : Thank you, John. I'm so excited to be here at the New York Stock Exchange with our leadership team sharing these fantastic second quarter results with you. Let me start by discussing our revenue adjusted EBITDA for the quarter. All figures for Q2 2013 are presented on a pro forma combined basis to allow for an apples-to-apples comparison. In the second quarter, total revenue amounts to $7.2 billion, growing 8% year-over-year, the highest growth rate in the industry. The year-over-year growth was primarily due to service revenues, which accounted for about 2/3 of the growth. On a sequential basis, total revenues increased by 4.5% and that is a significant acceleration from the 0.7% growth rate we reported last quarter. The sequential increase was due to growth in both service revenues and equipment sales driven in part by a lower impact from the ETF offer. Going forward, we expect to see service revenue becoming an increasing driver of total revenue growth. In the second quarter, we financed $1.3 billion of equipment sales on our Equipment Installment Plans or EIP, up 7% compared to the first quarter of 2014. Service revenues were again a key highlight in the quarter. The fifth consecutive quarter of sequential growth and acceleration in year-over-year growth from 4.5% in the first quarter to 7.1% this quarter. Even more significant, T-Mobile led the wireless industry in service revenue growth. Please note that service revenues in the second quarter were impacted by $43 million due to a reduction in certain regulatory surcharges and a revenue adjustment for expected customer refunds on premium SMS charges. Without these 2 one-time non-reoccurring factors, the growth in service revenues would have been 7.9% year-over-year. We generated 1.45 of adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter, up 14.7% year-over-year and up 33.4% quarter-over-quarter. The adjusted EBITDA margin increased by 600 basis points, up sequentially to 26% as operating expenses remained basically flat despite increases in customers and revenue growth. Smartphone sales remain strong at 6.2 million units. The branded postpaid upgrade rate was 8%, up from 7% in the first quarter but down from 10% in the second quarter of 2013. I think these are very strong results that show our financial strategy is working. Customer growth, followed by revenue growth, followed by adjusted EBITDA and cash flow growth. We still have much work ahead of us to keep this momentum going; however, we are clearly demonstrating that this model works. Turning to Slide 12. I wanted to start by letting you know that we will be reporting a new metric, branded postpaid phone ARPU, which is more consistent with the presentation of our competitors. Essentially, tablets are becoming a larger piece of the business and can distort some of the underlying phone metrics. Branded postpaid phone ARPU will allow a more apples-to-apples comparison. Branded postpaid average growth billings per user, or ABPU, as a reminder, this is branded postpaid service revenues plus EIP billings divided by average branded postpaid customers. It approximates what we receive on a cash basis from our customers on a monthly basis. ABPU, up $59.79 in the second quarter, continue to grow unlike some of our competitors, up 1.8% year-over-year and 0.4% sequentially. Branded postpaid phone ARPU declined by 2.3% sequentially in Q2 compared to a drop of 1.3% in the first quarter but an improvement compared to the 2.8% drop we experienced in the fourth quarter of 2013. Please note that phone ARPU in the second quarter of 2014 was impacted by 2 one-time non-reoccurring factors already mentioned in connection with service revenues. A reduction in certain regulatory surcharges and a revenue adjustment for expected customer refunds on premium SMS charges. Excluding these 2 factors, branded postpaid ARPUs would've been approximately $49.93, a drop of 1.1% or $0.55 compared to the first quarter of 2014. We are encouraged by the fact that we are already through most of the migration in contrast to our competitors who are just starting out migrating to EIP plans. At the end of the second quarter, 80% of our branded postpaid base was on Simple Choice plans, up from 75% at the end of Q1, rapidly approaching full penetration. We continue to expect that phone ARPU will generally stabilize in the second half of 2014, once we are done with most of the migrations to Simple Choice. We believe that recent pricing actions, like the requalification requirements retain corporate discounts, the elimination of corporate discounts from new customers and the increase in the price for 4G unlimited from $70 to $80, will help us achieve our ARPU goal. Also, I wanted to give you a quick update on customer quality metrics. The mix of Prime customers within our branded postpaid gross adds increased 9 percentage points year-over-year. The percentage of Prime customers within our EIP receivables was 53%. Lastly, branded prepaid ARPU grew both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter, reflecting growth in the MetroPCS customer base. Turning to cash CapEx and cash flows. We spent a total of $940 million in cash CapEx in the second quarter, supporting the ongoing investment on our network. This was essentially flat compared to the first quarter and down 15% to the second quarter of 2013. We continue to expect that full year 2014 cash CapEx will be between $4.3 billion and $4.6 billion, with a bit of a ramp up later in the quarter -- later in the year as we shut down the CDMA portions of the MetroPCS network and continue the rollout of 700 megahertz and the deployment of 4G LTE on the 1,900 PCS spectrum. We continue to see the benefits of our spend as our 4G LTE network, the fastest in the nation, covers more than 233 million people in 325 metro areas. While supporting the necessary network modernization, we also remain focused on free cash flow generation. In the second quarter, we generated a significant positive simple free cash flow, that is adjusted EBITDA minus cash CapEx of $511 million, up $370 million versus the first quarter of 2014. In terms of working capital, our EIP receivables, net of allowance for credit losses, increased by $497 million from Q1, reaching a total of $3.6 billion in Q2. I want to point out that the sequential increase in our EIP receivables of $497 million in Q2 was less than the sequential increase we experienced in Q1 of 2014, continuing the trend from the prior quarter as strong growth in our EIP collections more than offset growth in equipment sales financed on EIP. To put it simply, the working capital drive continues to decline. Based on our current projections, we continue to expect the [indiscernible] program to cross over in the course of 2015, meaning that EIP billings will exceed the amounts of the EIP finance. Our cash position remains strong. We had ending cash of approximately $3.1 billion, leaving us with significant financial flexibility. The decrease compared to the first quarter was due primarily to the acquisition of the 700 megahertz A-Block spectrum from Verizon with a cash outlay of $2.4 billion. Net debt, excluding towers, announced at $17.2 billion at the end of Q2 or 3.4x our pro forma combined adjusted LTM EBITDA near the middle of our target range of 3x to 4x. Let me now turn to our guidance for 2014. Given our Un-carrier initiatives, we expect the momentum in branded postpaid customer growth to continue and currently expect between 3 million and 3.5 million branded postpaid net additions in 2014. That is up from our prior guidance of 2.8 million to 3.3 million branded postpaid net adds and an increase of 200,000 postpaid customers at the mid-point. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $5.6 billion and $5.8 billion. That is unchanged versus prior guidance despite the expected increase in customer growth. Cash CapEx is expected to be between $4.3 billion and $4.6 billion. That has not changed versus prior guidance. The transition to Simple Choice plans should be largely complete by the end of this year with the penetration of Simple Choice plans reaching 85% to 90% at the branded postpaid base by the end of 2014. Again, that has not changed versus prior guidance. While not providing quarterly guidance, it should be noted that several of our cost initiatives, as well as top line initiatives, will have a more positive impact on the fourth quarter due to the timing of such initiatives. Let me now turn it back to John for a recap of the highlights. John J. Legere: Okay. Thank you, Braxton. And a huge shout out to all the T-Mobile employees out there who continue to put in all the hard work necessary to drive these kind of results. Let me recap a few highlights. T-Mobile is the fastest-growing wireless company in America. We led the industry in both total and service revenue growth, and we had the best adjusted EBITDA growth quarter-over-quarter. And we had the best branded postpaid phone and branded prepaid net adds. We have the fastest nationwide 4G LTE network. We're rolling out improvements to increase our coverage, speed and quality, including already starting the A-Block rollout, and we have the best customer service nationwide. We've regained the highest ranking in J.D. Power wireless customer care for the T-Mobile brand, and we maintained it for the MetroPCS brand for the fourth time in a row. And finally, we expect our positive momentum to continue into the second half of 2014. We're increasing our branded postpaid net adds guidance to 3 million to 3.5 million, while making no change to our adjusted EBITDA target. And we're not done yet. Now let's move on to Q&A. To make a final comment, I'm hoping that this will be one of the last quarters you have to put up with what was about a 20- to 30-minute monologue, and we're looking to find an Un-carrier way in future quarters to do these earnings calls, so stay tuned. Now I think we're ready for the Q&A, operator, so please, first question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Nice to see the increase in the postpaid add guidance, but you've already done 2.2 million adds. Even at the high end, it's only a 1.3 million second half. And it seems like with your new Un-carrier initiatives, with the recent promotion and with a new iPhone launch coming, that you've got an opportunity to have some nice acceleration into the back half of the year. So are you just being conservative there? Or are there some other puts and takes we should be aware of? John J. Legere: Simon, I think it's a great question. I think that we've consistently demonstrated that we're very balanced in the way that we provide future guidance. I want to point out that we've increased our guidance consistently throughout the year as things have developed. We certainly are balanced in that approach. And I also want to point out since being a public company, TMUS has beat, met or exceeded on every piece of guidance that we've given. J. Braxton Carter : And Simon, I would say, yours was more a statement than a question, and I do think that our guidance is, as we have always done, is conservative and there are no gotchas [ph] that you should be searching for. Operator : We'll go next to Amir Rozwadowski of Barclays. Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Research Division : I wanted to talk a bit about sort of the pricing trajectory. It seems as though we've seen some of the year-over-year declines in terms of your ARPU ease over the last couple of quarters. And according to your prepared remarks, we should continue to see that trend into the back half of the year. What type of competitive environment are you anticipating with respect to achieving that type of goal? And if some of your competitors decided to get a little bit more flexible with respect to their pricing, do you have the flexibility to adjust accordingly, if needed? John J. Legere: I'll start, and then Mike and Braxton can chime in. I think it's a good opportunity to answer a few things. One is everyone's obsession with ARPU can rest assure -- I know a question is, are we still on track for a second half stabilization of ARPU and net increase? And the answer is yes. Much more importantly, ABPU or the average billing per user, is something that we think greater reflects even in the short term in the period we've gone through what's happening with the revenue streams of our customers. And in Q2, the average billing per user was up 1.8% sequentially and 3% year-over-year, and that shows, of course, what we pointed out, is that as you move from the way we do business historically as an industry to separating devices and providing the financing, you need to add several items together to show what's happening with the billing environment. So ABPU is already increasing at a nice pace. ARPU will stabilize in the second half as we planned. An interesting item to note is that most of our competitors are not only seeing the ARPU issues that go with moving to a financing environment that we did previously, but ABPU was down in the quarter. So I think our pricing -- our environment is very strong and will continue to be. From a competitive environment, not to be cocky or to point out, but we are the competitive environment. And I think what's very important is our actions on the Un-carrier, our moves and our promotions are not based on reacting to anybody. We've been going straightforward since we started this initiative and doing things that we know we can profitably do and that customers will respond to. The competitors are responding to our moves, which has been happening very aggressively on their part for about 2 or 3 quarters. So I reiterate what I said last quarter. No one needs to sit back and wait what happens when the big guys attempt to beat up on the little guy. They've been trying their best for 2 or 3 quarters and this is about what you get. I mean, if you're talking about some of our more closer competitors like Sprint, come on, I mean they -- with some of our recent promotions, they would have to change price by 100% to get into our range. So we're very comfortable with where we are. We're doing it in an environment that, as you can see, profitability is growing, service revenues are growing. And I'll just point out that by your own analyst reviews, consensus estimates by most analysts, even before these earnings, were about $7 billion in EBITDA for next year and we've guided $5.6 billion to $5.8 billion. So yes, we're comfortable the momentum will continue. G. Michael Sievert : I would just reiterate that, John -- it's Mike -- just to say the pattern you're describing is that for the last 3 or 4 quarters, we've been making moves, others have been responding and during that time, we've been driving significant value into this business and positioning it for margin expansion. And so the patterns are already there. What the question supposes is that going to change, and I think what everybody needs to realize is our competitors are in full-on response and compete mode and yet we're outpacing the industry, not only on customer acquisition, but this quarter on sequential EBITDA growth. And we think there's a strong opportunity for us to continue to monetize that going forward into next year. John J. Legere: I'll add, and by the way, I liked the report that you did a couple of weeks ago that was also focusing on T-Mobile's management making all the right decisions and moves that it needs to make in any environment. That was very well done. I think what's really happening is there is now a period where people are starting to wonder, can the competitors actually just respond to this Un-carrier movement? Or is it something with sustainable momentum? And I think the biggest news of Q2's results is the qualitative aspects here have stopped the alarm bells of what -- when Contract Freedom and ETF payments were announced, which is not a program, these are not huge discount programs. They are very profitable moves that are built into our program that we can sustain very strongly. I appreciate the questions. Operator : We'll go next to John Hodulik of UBS. John C. Hodulik - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : A couple of things. First, do you guys see the upcoming iPhone refresh as an opportunity to take share in terms of high end subs? And if so, why not keep the $100 promotion you announced, I think it was early this week, keep it going through that launch period given how profitable it is? And then secondly, obviously, there's been a lot of talk about the possibility of a sale of the company. Given all the momentum you have and the visibility you have in terms of keeping that momentum going, why consider a sale now to potentially a company that doesn't have anywhere near the momentum? If you know what I'm saying? So that's it. John J. Legere: Your questions included most major items, as well as 2 or 3 announcements in there. First of all, you're not going to get me to use the iPhone 6 word on this call. And your attempt to say, should we sustain our promotion pricing past the announced date to the iPhone launch date suggest that we know or you know when it is, and we're not going to deal with any of those. But let me just say, there's been some great reports written as well in the past week that I think offer some great insights about what's happening in -- as it relates to some of these. Now this couples that, 33%, this was a Morgan Stanley report, sorry for quoting one to you, John, but the 33% of wireless customers are likely or somewhat likely to consider switching over the next 6 months. That's #1. Interestingly, of the 4 major carriers, T-Mobile has the lowest percentage of customers that are likely or somewhat likely to switch. And then, of course, when you look at a potential iconic device that's coming to the market, T-Mobile, because of a lot of variables, has the lowest percentage of our base in the iPhone product because of we've only recently launched it. And what that does, it makes us far less susceptible to this new device being a switching event of our customers and a major upside possibility for us. Because amongst other things, T-Mobile was seen as a likely destination for those switchers. So if a switching event is coming, a major one, we've got a big pool of players that are moving. I think we've got a huge opportunity. On the promotional offer that we made, listen, we can respond very quickly. We can make offers and coming in and out of the market. We don't need to test our pricing for 6 months to think about it. So what we've done is something very aggressive. And by the way, it's not a pricing move. It's a data bucket move. We already had a 4-for-$100 offer. We think it's going to be very competitive and we can respond with additional or other offers as need be, and we think this one will be very successful. To your last question, when -- your preface of your question was this deal that we keep talking about -- I just want to point out, you keep talking about it, we have never talked about it. And I would only point out a few things, and we can have more questions on this as we go along. T-Mobile is doing absolutely everything that is necessary as part of my stated strategy to both organically and inorganically prepare this company to continue to grow and be highly successful. Inorganic options for the acceleration of the T-Mobile brand are always an opportunity. There are multiple of them that we will continue to consider, but the things that we're doing right now in Q2, in Q3 and move on, are the things that this company needs to do to be a viable long-term player. And we've got multiple options to consider and will consider. And when we have something to report on those topics, we'll let you know. Operator : We'll go next to Jonathan Chaplin of New Street Research. Jonathan Chaplin - New Street Research LLP : I just want to actually follow up on John Hodulik's question. So firstly, given the momentum that you guys have in the business and the fact that you think it's sustainable, shouldn't -- and given the sort of a scale, nature of this business, with this growth, shouldn't EBITDA next year be a lot higher than the 7 billion that consensus has in their models? And if that's the case, if you're generating this kind of incremental scale organically, I just want to hit on John's question again, why consider a deal now when all of this -- when the primary driver of a deal would be to gain scale and you're gaining scale organically at the expense of somebody you might merge with? John J. Legere: Yes... Jonathan Chaplin - New Street Research LLP : Given the inhospitable regulatory environment, it just seems like there's a lot of risk associated with a deal like that now. John J. Legere: And again, as I said, I don't think -- let's take 2 or 3, and then I'll be glad to come back around to this. We have never commented on this sort or any other deal, and I'm not going to comment on a specific ones. We have always been clear. If you look at the long term of the wireless industry, it is a scale game. It is an industry here where the #1 and 2 players are hugely more powerful from a standpoint of scale and capital, et cetera, than the rest of the industry. We've been very successful, and we see a path forward to be highly successful as a stand-alone company, but we also know that we could significantly accelerate that growth and create an even higher level of competition in the U.S. wireless industry by various forms of accelerating this platform. Now from a standpoint of what we will do inorganically and when, we haven't commented on that. Obviously, we will always consider the benefits to shareholders and the questions you raised will be part of the things that we will consider. And I would point out that we have multiple versions of things that we can do inorganically with this company and multiple versions of timing as to when we do them. Importantly, from the results that you see today, is that the company is not in need of doing something to be successful in the short to medium term, and I think that's slightly different. There is -- in the industry, there is a dramatically different performance level of businesses going on between the 4 major wireless carriers, and I think that's important. We're not going to give guidance on next year, but I think one of the things you're starting to do, and I will take a short, brief celebratory success that you're starting to question whether a $5.7 billion to $7 billion consensus view for EBITDA is sufficiently large, and I'll take that as positive feedback, but I think Braxton and I and the management team have been consistent over the past 5 quarters or so that the growth right now that we're playing through will pay itself back in dividends for earnings growth and free cash flow growth in the coming quarters and years, and we are more bullish on that than ever. Operator : We'll take our next question from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan. Philip Cusick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : I guess, let's focus on the gross ad momentum. Can you talk about the mix of gross ads needing a buyout? And then is there a shift at all in where your ads are coming from as carriers have responded to your efforts? John J. Legere: Yes, I mean, I'll let Mike talk about that because a 30% annual increase in gross ads is certainly something to probe in on. G. Michael Sievert : Yes, it's -- the momentum is terrific, Phil. And it really speaks to the difference in our approach versus our competitors' approach. We continue to see -- and we heard about even yesterday, promotions that swap-out, that change from our competitors. And what you see from us with this Un-carrier strategy is a layering of value that's significant, that changes the industry and that's permanent. Un-carrier 1.0 is still in effect. Un-carrier 2 JUMP! still out there. Un-carrier 3.0, it's good forever, the world is your network, and so on. So what we're doing is essentially adding value to customers' experience with us and they're rewarding us in growth, as John said, with 30% year-over-year gross add growth this quarter. You saw in our guidance that we're increasing it for the 2nd straight quarter in a row, so obviously we remain confident. We provide numbers that we think are conservative. But the strategy is showing that customers are really resonating with our brand. And they're resonating with it because we're executing a very, very different strategy in the market than what we see from our competitors. John J. Legere: Yes, and again, an interesting item is, based upon the results that everybody has reported, there's generally an assumption that the customers that are coming to T-Mobile are coming from the large base of bleeding that's taking place at Sprint. And I think that's certainly an industry opportunity for all of us, but I think reports have been written that I think makes the most sense, which is if you look at the prior wireless carrier of the postpaid customer base of T-Mobile customers, it's significant amount of them and the most of them are former AT&T customers, which means based on the size, that the size of the opportunity continues to be huge when you start to look at the network performance relationship and the degradation of performance of their network, the JDP customer service capabilities, the size of their base, the iPhone base, the likely switchers. So the opportunity base here is very large for us and very well scripted. G. Michael Sievert : Just to your specific question about Contract Freedom, we did disclose in our investor quarterly that as we predicted on the last quarter, that the Q2 impact of Contract Freedom was significantly less than the Q1 impact. So less customers came in and took that deal as we predicted. We think that, as Braxton talked about in the last call, we think that's the long-term trend here as obviously the people most interested in the offer will act the quickest. However, it could change. It could slow depending on the device. The previous question was around a potential new device from Apple, for example. We see, as John said, a big opportunity if that were to happen. And that could reinvigorate interest in the Contract Freedom offer as well for obvious reasons. John J. Legere: I would urge you all to continue writing that Contract Freedom is T-Mobile using significantly discounted price to allure customers at the sake of profitability loss because things couldn't be further than the truth. But another quarter or 2 of our competitors thinking that's what it is and not figuring out what the mechanics are would be beautiful. Because I've seen the business case, and we can discuss these over time, not only is the business case something that looks at a very lucrative customer gross add at these new customers at a very quick payback, but we've exceeded that business case in a great way, which makes this, and all the other variables with the Un-carrier move, tools that we can sustain and we would love to continue to do, and we'd love forever for people not to be able to figure out the mechanics of doing them themselves. Operator : We'll take our next question from Ric Prentiss of Raymond James. Richard H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division : I had a question back on guidance for a second. Obviously, pretty successful in the net adds, raising the guidance. You mentioned, John, in your comments that there's even further upside in tablets and even wearables. I think I've seen you wearing them. As you think about the guidance, how should we think about what tablets involved there? As the timing for a new acronym, Braxton, maybe ARPAD, average revenue per account plus device payment to kind of capture how much you're getting from people's tablets and wearables of the future. John J. Legere: Mike, you want to talks about it? G. Michael Sievert : First thing I would say is we're very excited about wearables coming with their own radios, and we're seeing some of these on the horizon. And so we're entering an era where people are going to want to experience 4G LTE connectivity from a variety of different devices. We see an era where people may have a tiny purse for their -- a tiny phone for their clutch, a bigger tablet for their purse, a wristwatch phone for their run, a ruggedized phone for the beach and all of these things being connected to the macro network. And we're gearing our plans, assuming that, that world unfolds, including how we plan to charge for our services, et cetera. So we think there's a really exciting potential there. We're not giving guidance on how it breaks down. Obviously, that vision that I just talked about will only get started this year with a few devices out of the gate. Tablets are the big phenomenon right now outside of phones. You saw our tablet momentum increased 5x this quarter over last, so we really found our stride in tablets. But you also saw that we continue to focus on the big profitable segment of this industry, which is smartphones and we led the industry once again in postpaid phone net ads, which is very important that we continue to focus there and win, and we think in some cases, our competitors are kind of hiding behind tablet adds, which, by many measures, are less valuable. You can use our own investor quarterly to parse our tablet ARPU, which you very quickly get through using the numbers we disclosed there, about $24 per tablets, which we're very proud of, but it's a lower number than what you get from smartphones. And so we'll continue to stay focused on what drives real value to the company and what drives real value to customers and keep them in balance. But we're not going to be sort of giving you a breakdown on the numbers on what to expect between the different platforms. John J. Legere: Yes, but that said, I think what we're doing is leading the industry also in how to look through what's happening in the information and the customer decisions and understand the reality of how we're growing. And I think, let's be clear to what Mike said, and I think it's slowing down now. But 2 or 3 quarters ago, as T-Mobile started to really dominate the phone add business, in a short term, competitors were virtually giving away tablets, calling them postpaid adds and masking their declines. And I don't think anybody's fooled by that anymore. There's definitely a different revenue model associated with tablets. And what we've started to show is, yes, we're going to play in the tablet space profitably, but not at the demise of our other businesses. We're going to play in the wearables and accessories. We're going to call them what they are and there's a different -- and by the way, the revenue models may shift and we'll adapt and play to that as well. So I think everybody sees what it is. That's why we're getting ABPU and ARPU and postpaid phone net adds and tablets, and we'll give as much information as possible. But with our retail presence in our brand and our association with our customers, you're also seeing, by the way, a significant growth in accessory sales and high-margin products in our stores as well. And we'll try to give as much information so you can understand what's happening with us, but also we'll help you try to understand what isn't happening at our competitors. Just a service we provide. We're going to take one more question and then we're going to have to go talk to some of the TV shows and reiterate what we told you here. Operator : We'll take our last question from Kevin Smithen of Macquarie. Kevin R. Smithen - Macquarie Research : Can you talk a little about your plans for the AWS-3 auction and the incentive auction, how you fund both of these and a little bit about the reported $10 billion Spectrum JV with Sprint? What's behind that? And given different potential inorganic scenarios, how will that play out if there is no consolidation in the space? John J. Legere: We're going to need a guide here that is the same way, what does postpaid mean? What does reported mean? Because certainly, there hasn't been any reported, kind of, deals associated with how we're going to participate. We've been very clear that Spectrum is extremely important for us. We plan to participate in the broadcast options. We're looking very closely at our roles rules in AWS-3. We think we've got significant wherewithal to raise the money and use the capital that we have as a company to be highly successful in both of those options as well, but I don't know if Neville, or Braxton, if either of you want to comment? J. Braxton Carter : Yes, let me provide a little bit more color. I think with existing liquidity and access to the public debt capital markets that we're more than comfortable that we have the flexibility to participate in the upcoming auctions. And our preference, as certainly I've said in prior call, that any incremental capital would come through debt and not in equity to do this participation. John J. Legere: Yes, and I -- the good news, let's reiterate one of the things that we talked about. With what's happened over the past 5 quarters, the success of the Un-carrier, the momentum that we have now playing into another variable, which is there are some very good opportunities for us to gain continued scale in spectrum, and we have the capital to do it. So if you play the tape forward over the next year or 2, you certainly see that both with our performance, the capital availability and the auctions that are coming, we've got a good runway in front of the company to continue to grow and be highly successful. So we look forward to them and we plan to be successful in both options. Okay. Well, I think that's about as much time as we have. I thank everybody for listening in and we'll see you again next quarter. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the T-Mobile US Second Quarter 2014 Conference Call. If you have any further questions, you may contact the Investor Relations department. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect and have a pleasant day.",

Hodulik - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division Operator : Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the T-Mobile US Third Quarter 2014 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] This conference call is being recorded today, October 28, 2014. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Nils Paellmann, Head of Investor Relations for T-Mobile US. Please go ahead, sir. Nils Paellmann : Thank you very much. Welcome to T-Mobile's Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Call and first-ever open Twitter conference. With me today are John Legere, our President and CEO; Braxton Carter, our CFO; and other members of the senior leadership team. While this is an Un-carrier call today, we still have a disclaimer. So here is the disclaimer. During the course of this earnings call, the company may, will make projections and other forward-looking statements. A detailed discussion of the risks and uncertainties that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements can be found in T-Mobile's SEC filings, particularly the risk factors included in our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 25, 2014. The company's projection and forward-looking statements are based on factors that are subject to change, and therefore, these statements speak only as of the date they are given. The company does not undertake any duty to update any projections or forward-looking statements. In addition, during today's discussion, management will comment on both actual results and certain non-GAAP results. Reconciliations between GAAP results and these non-GAAP results are available in the Investor Factbook on the Investor Relations home page on our website at tmobile.com. So with this, let me now turn it over to John. John J. Legere: Okay. Good morning. I now have a new objective for the next quarter, which is to come up with an Un-carrier IR disclaimer. It's hopefully the only piece of our earnings call that is still traditional and verbose and somewhat unuseful and it's boring. We are doing something different this quarter. As you probably know, we sent out a very comprehensive Factbook and story of what happened in the quarter to alleviate the need for the long, scripted speeches that you tune out to before you can get to Q&A. So what we're going to do is we're going to have Braxton make very brief upfront comments, very factual, and then we'll going to move into all Q&A. And it'll be in 2 formats, as we said, one, dial-in, as well as on Twitter, and it'll be a combination of the analysts that have very deep questions to go through and an assortment of other people coming into both lines. So I hope this works. We'll take feedback on it. I know we certainly enjoy it more. And with that, I'll turn it over to CFO, Braxton Carter. J. Braxton Carter : Okay. Thank you, John, and welcome, everyone, to our Un-carrier earnings call. Now onto our third quarter results. We had a fantastic quarter with the biggest growth in our company's history. It was our best quarter ever in terms of branded postpaid net additions. We added 1.4 million branded postpaid customers in the quarter. Branded postpaid phone net adds were 1.2 million, more than double the second quarter, and yet again, we led the industry. The same story applies to prepaid, where net adds were 411,000, up 4x versus the second quarter and also leading the industry. We added 10 million total customers over the last 6 quarters, including 2.3 million in the third quarter alone. And the gains from subscribers are translating into financial results. Service revenues increased at a double-digit percentage rate, 10.6% year-over-year to $5.7 billion. That is another industry best and an acceleration from the second quarter, where service revenues rose 7.1% year-over-year on a pro forma combined basis. Branded postpaid average billing per user, or ABPU, grew 4.2% year-over-year to $61.59, which was the highest in the company's history. In other words, the monthly amount our customers pay us is at an all-time high, demonstrating the strength of our model and our customers' enthusiasm for our offerings. Adjusted EBITDA of $1.35 billion this quarter was flat year-over-year and down sequentially, significantly impacted by the higher cost associated with the record customer growth we experienced this quarter. We believe we're adding the right customers with high customer lifetime values. So this trade-off is worth making. Moving over to the network. We continue to get bigger and better. We now cover 250 million people with 4G LTE, already reaching our year-end goal and are now targeting at least 260 million by the end of 2014, 280 million by mid-2015 and 300 million by the end of 2015. The rollout of the 700 MHz A-Block spectrum is progressing well with first sites already on air and handsets in the market, and we're beginning to hit our stride there. We are also converting our 1900 spectrum from 2G to 4G LTE to add coverage, speed and depth to our network. Finally, we are continuing to introduce Wideband LTE, which is configurations of at least 15x15 megahertz 4G LTE to new markets, and we currently have an operational in 19 markets, with at least 26 scheduled to be lit up by year end. We have continued to innovate on the service side, offering our customers more means to communicate than anyone in the industry. This past quarter, we rolled out Un-carrier 7.0, which unleashed Wi-Fi and made T-Mobile the first U.S. carrier to adopt Wi-Fi calling across all its new smartphones at retail. We also boosted coverage by offering postpaid customers a free Personal CellSpot device to replace the aging routers in their homes, and we brought Un-carrier to the skies by partnering with Gogo to enable free in-flight texting. We were pleased when Apple recognized our innovation at their iPhone launch event in September, calling out T-Mobile as the first U.S. partner to launch both VoLTE and Wi-Fi calling on both the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. We appreciate the shout-out from Apple and the publicity around Wi-Fi calling. It certainly helped our iPhone sales, making the launch of the new iPhones our biggest launch ever. Finally, we expect a strong finish to the year. Our momentum continues, our network is getting better every day and we expect a strong holiday selling season. Given our optimism, we are increasing our guidance range for branded postpaid net adds for the full year by over 1 million to 4.3 million to 4.7 million. We are keeping our adjusted EBITDA guidance range unchanged at $5.6 billion to $5.8 billion, but anticipate the actual outcome will be at the very low end of the range given the expected customer growth momentum. Let me add by saying a few words about ARPU. In the third quarter, branded postpaid phone ARPU increased 1.1% sequentially. Excluding the impact of nonrecurring factors in the second quarter, ARPU stabilized from Q2 to Q3, despite the ongoing migration to Simple Choice plans. I am pleased to report that the stabilization in ARPU that we have been talking about happened in the third quarter. I do want to point out when looking forward to the fourth quarter specifically, we expect branded postpaid phone ARPU will be down approximately 2.5% on a sequential basis, primarily due to 2 factors. First, we saw incremental growth well beyond the expectations we gave you, driven partially from lower ARPU but very successful in the NPV positive onetime promotions, including the 4 for 100 promotion. This incremental growth is estimated to reduce Q4 ARPU by approximately 1.7%. Secondly, we see a reduction in certain regulatory surcharges, which are estimated to reduce Q4 ARPU by approximately 0.8%. The reduction in regulatory surcharges is not EBITDA-affecting since these are pass-through charges. When normalizing for this EBITDA-neutral item and for the incremental high-quality growth beyond the forecast we gave you, we are right on track on ARPU stabilization. We expect ARPU to increase sequentially in Q1 of 2015, demonstrating the short-term nature of these effects in Q4. Our customers continue to deepen their relationship with us, using and paying for more of our services than ever before; reflected in the all-time high average billings per user, or ABPU, we saw in Q3. In summary, we continue to execute, and our growth story is far from over. Now we are ready for Q&A. Let me point out that we won't be able to take or answer any questions regarding spectrum or spectrum strategy due to the anti-collusion period in connection with the pending AWS-3.0 auctions. [Operator Instructions] We will start with a question on the phone. Operator, first question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : If I look at the full year EBITDA guidance, which you maintained, coming in around the low end, which is what you cited as the likely target in the release, would still imply a fairly meaningful inflection higher than the fourth quarter. Your net add guidance implies that maybe things will slow down a little and so perhaps, there could be a benefit from lower customer acquisition cost, but it seems there's a lot more going on there. So I was hoping you could dig into that just a little bit. J. Braxton Carter : Yes, you're absolutely right, Brett. There is a lot more going on, and we started talking about this at the end of the second quarter. That's -- there were numerous cost transformation initiatives that we had in place, as well as numerous top line initiatives that would have more of a proportional positive impact on the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. And let me tell you that we're very, very focused on growing, not only our sub base with very high-quality subs, but also growing our profitability and our cash flows and the creation of substantial shareholder value here. And we're very, very excited that we were able to deliver this type of guidance on growth within the EBITDA envelopes that we have been recently guiding to. Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : But is there any way you can maybe break it down just a little bit? I mean, I can sort of do the math and figure out what the lower level of gross adds would yield. I'm just trying to close the gap there. J. Braxton Carter : Yes. So, obviously, the third quarter was the largest growth quarter in the company's history. And I think one of the real positives there, not only from a postpaid standpoint, which was record shattering, look what we did from a prepaid standpoint. During a period of time where prepaid has the slowest quarter of the year, substantial growth, so very, very positive about that. But you're right. You can do the math. And Brett, I also want to point out, we are conservative in the way that we position our forward growth. I mean, have we ever missed our guidance? No. We have continued to at least meet or beat our guidance. John J. Legere: I think, Brett, the one way to think about it is, the low end of our guidance on postpaid net adds is somewhat similar to what AT&T and Verizon collectively added in Q3. So it's still a pretty aggressive piece of business. But there's certainly some leeway there. J. Braxton Carter : Let me -- on the cost and the top line standpoint, we've continued to really look at transformation. A complete focus on the simplification of our value proposition through Un-carrier and how that translates to driving costs out of the back office of the business. Now we have continued to significantly invest in the front line in care, but there's a lot of efficiencies that we're harvesting from a back office standpoint that are really coming to fruition in a larger way during the fourth quarter and will continue throughout 2015. From a top line standpoint, you know we've taken steps to, in a very consumer friendly way, position unlimited at a higher rate in the marketplace. But we also did other things, Brett. One of the things, if you remember, we eliminated corporate discounts. Why have a corporate discount when you have the simplicity and world-class pricing with Simple Choice? And we eliminated it prospectively for all customers, for all future customers. But with our existing customer base, we went through a revalidation. And that revalidation was completed during the third quarter and really doesn't hit full impact into a fourth quarter. So that's another example of one of the more incremental benefits to the fourth quarter. John J. Legere: Okay. Let's do one more on the phone and then I'm going to jump over to Twitter and then come back to the phone. So operator, next one on the phone. Operator : We'll go next to Kevin Smithen with Macquarie. Kevin R. Smithen - Macquarie Research : John, I think the last time you were quoted as saying that most of what you've done in the last year is actually raise price. So you weren't -- your target was never to be sustainably the value leader in the market. How should we kind of think about ARPU progression here as we move through the year? And given all the progress you've made on the wide LTE and turning up 30, 40 megahertz of spectrum, could you possibly move to a tiering or charging a higher ARPU for those customers that are getting 20 to 70 megs of downstream? John J. Legere: Yes, thanks for the questions. I'm going to get Mike Sievert and then Braxton involved. There's a lot in there. There's certainly some -- our pricing, what we've done over the past year, which I think should be compared and contrasted to what others are trying to do. Also, a good chance for us to talk about our position on tiered pricing and on things that are taking place, as well as some proposed competitive differentiated pricing strategies. A lot of which we think are part of the trickery of the industry that we won't participate in. Let's start, Mike, with pricing and then we can talk about ARPU trajectory and some of how we'll look at it. G. Michael Sievert : Yes, couple of things. First of all, the ABPU, or average billing per user, that are -- is the total amount our customers pay us on our bills, reached its highest level ever in Q3. And that's not because of price increases. That's because customers are showing a deep commitment to our products and services. They're using them more, they're getting tremendous value from them and therefore, they're paying us more on their bills. But I will say that Un-carrier, through 7 moves now, has been incredibly disciplined. We've given these amazing experiences to customers, great value proposition, while maintaining a price that allows us to profitably grow the company. We think that's really important and very, very different from what we've seen out of the gate from Sprint in the last couple of months as they got started on their moves. They came in, and I think facing a tough environment, employed a scorched-earth pricing approach. And they said, right there, as soon as the CEO took over, that they were going to have to do that because their network is deficient. I don't think customers are willing to trade off a good experience for a scorched-earth type of price. And then it really begs the question, what's the second and third move? We're 7 moves into this. Our brand is becoming known as somebody that tackles pain points in the industry and frustrations that customers have, solves them, gives them a great experience. How do you follow up doing a $50 unlimited? I think it's -- they're going to struggle with that, and I think people are going to be a little bit disappointed in the numbers that they post as a result. So it's really about good balance, focusing on value, but also focusing on profitably growing the company so we can keep this Un-carrier revolution going indefinitely. J. Braxton Carter : And Brett, very clearly, the fourth quarter is a trough in ARPU. And we clearly stated that you're going to see it increase in the first quarter, and let's go a little bit deeper on that. We're pretty much at the end of penetration of our base into Simple Choice in the whole EIP construct. We ended the quarter at 84%, our guidance for the year end on the upper side of that range is 90%. And 90% is about as far as it's going to go because some of our partners and other offerings don't offer Simple Choice or EIP. And that has been really what the drag has been on EBITDA on a sustained basis, and we're really past it. And we'll be past it at the end of the quarter. That impact would have been much more significant without a lot of the innovations and other items that we're bringing to the marketplace that more than offset the full amount of the potential dilution there. And things like data attach, things like our JUMP! proposition and other innovations that we bring to the market. So again, we're very optimistic about our increase of ARPU going into next year and more good stuff to come. But I really want to emphasize again, average billing per user, highest in the company's industry, highest in the company's history and up over 4% year-over-year. I mean, that says a lot right there. Kevin R. Smithen - Macquarie Research : And do you have a policy, to John's point, onto your pricing? G. Michael Sievert : Well, what we've done this year is we've introduced an additional tier. So it's $80 or, call it, plus $30 on a family plan to get to the unlimited level. And that reflects the tremendous growth we've seen in usage. And look, we're not going to make a forward-looking prediction about pricing other than to say that we're interested in giving customers a great experience, and we're going to charge fairly for that. We intend to be highly competitive, but also disciplined and I think you've seen that now through 7 moves that we're keeping things in balance and focused on giving great value, but also profitably growing our company. John J. Legere: I'm going to jump over to Twitter for a second, and I've got to give credit to the handle, it's @DanielHSQR, credit because he was first in the queue. We want to thank him for that. We want to un-thank him, for he asked 10 questions all at once, dominated our entire screen. He kind of crashed our mechanism here, so we are at least going to we acknowledge you, so everybody can follow you on Twitter and then crash your feed. So let's just take one interesting question amongst the 10 and there's 2 of them together. One of them is about talking with investors and talking with consumers, many are unaware of Music Freedom and why. And what's the reception, and the uptake of Music Freedom and any changes in some of this daily usage because of music stream . So I'll let Mike talk about that. And I'm just going to preface as I hand it to Mike to say, we could probably insert into this sentence 2 or 3 other Un-carrier moves like international data freedom, et cetera, which is to us, a double-edged sword. I mean, one is, there is clearly a lot of awareness that we can increase. Second is, that as people hear about these things and the reason the question's being asked, it's almost a no-brainer that they switch to T-Mobile, which suggests that our moves have long-term legs as we raise the awareness, but Music Freedom, in particular, has gotten a lot of attention. I'll let Mike talk about it. G. Michael Sievert : Well, that's really the point. I mean, we've done 7 or 8 major moves here. And by the way, we're #1 in growth in the industry while being #4 in advertising. And so the struggle is how do you tell people about all of these incredible things that we've done for customers with our Un-carrier move? So the truth is, we're relying on the public. We're relying on enthusiasts. We relying on people to tell other people about it. And that's working because we are the fourth, a distant fourth, in advertising spend, but #1 in growth. By the way, on Music Freedom, Neville's statistics, he's sitting right next to me, tell us that we're streaming 60 million songs a day for free for our customers, which is an amazing statistics showing that, yes, they absolute are using and getting an amazing benefit from this. Un-carrier 7.0, we just did last month, everybody's focused on Wi-Fi freedom and Wi-Fi calling, but we announced an exclusive partnership with Gogo that allows you to text completely free and receive your voice mail completely free on Gogo flights nationwide. So it just keeps the list of things we're doing for our customers just keeps getting longer. And the challenge is for us to get all those pieces out. Even if people don't understand every single move we've made or would fail our pop quiz, what they do understand is that we are the brand changing wireless for the better. The statistics on that are crystal clear. We're far and away the brand most famous for this, and we think that's contributing to our growth and, certainly, was one of the reasons why we had the biggest growth quarter in our company's history in Q3. John J. Legere: And it' s 8 :28 a.m., and I haven't done any acquiring of customers yet. So @DanielHSQR, I'd like you to write at @JohnLegere, and tell me whether you're a T-Mobile customer, why not and what can I do to make sure that you are one, and then you can have Music Freedom, too. Let's take another call from one of the analysts, and then I'm going to go back to a Twitter call from the tech community that is clamoring to speak with Neville Ray. Operator : We'll go next to Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : John, you talked last night about multiple players entering the wireless industry over the next few years. Can you talk about your opportunity there as a wholesale provider, helping those folks offer MVNO type services? Is that something where as your network gets built out and you add more capacity for MetroPCS you can really differentiate from your competitors? John J. Legere: Yes. Listen, I said a lot of things last night, some quotable, some that I hope wouldn't be there when I woke up this morning. The comments, though, let's just think out loud because clearly, this is a long-term strategic discussion about migration of the value chain and different players entering what we see as, \u201cthe wireless space\" now. That doesn't necessarily mean that this is the migration of other people being the interface and the provider of customers and us being the wholesale provider. Although, there is -- there are scenarios where you could picture one part of what you do with others being that. There are also tremendous amounts of people with content that are trying to get to mobile distribution that would like to use our brand and our customers and certainly, tangential industries, especially, if you get into wearables, you can start to think of a lot of other players that are a tangential to the current industry who are probably be coming in. That's more of the type of discussion I was having. So the specifics of what you're doing, certainly, part of a longer strategy for us could be something associated with our build out of our network and a portion of it being a underlying carriage provider to a new opportunity from others in the industry. But I don't have any specific people or relationships in mind. I just want to make sure you understand that, for us, there are multiple tasks; organic, inorganic and the organic growth of our company is the most important now and provides a standalone value and long-term shareholder value. But you've got to think creatively about this industry. And when you do, you'll realize that T-Mobile and where it's going and what its brand is, is a natural kind of ally in some fashion to a lot of other players trying to get to the customer base in the United States. J. Braxton Carter : Okay. What are you pointing at? John J. Legere: Yes. We're going to go -- I'm going to do one over here. There's a lot of people on Twitter that are giddy over the fact that Neville Ray is here. So temporarily, we'll tee one question up that we don't understand what it says and Neville would answer it in a way that we don't understand what he said, but a whole community will be very happy. This is @atomic50. Let's try this one. Team, clarify PCS 1900 LTE deployment in the early core, early refi of HSPA+, GSM, et cetera? Neville, maybe you can talk about that. Neville R. Ray: Yes. It's an urban core question. So we've announced today we're at 250 million POPs of LTE coverage, which is well ahead, that was our year-end goal. We're now at 250 million, and we're shooting for 260 million by the end of the year. And I think the other piece that we talked about in the materials is the 300 million LTE covered POPs number by the end of '15. So big, strong improvements in that -- in the LTE footprint. To the specifics on the question, it was asking about what we're doing in the urban core around PCS LTE. Most of our build on PCS LTE is outside of the urban core at point in time. We will be refarming as we move into '15, more of that PCS spectrum, but the rationale behind that is we have such a strong spectrum position in the urban core today. We've recently announced more markets moving to wideband LTE, which is committed spectrum at 15+15 or 20+20 megahertz, and our progress there is continuing to move at a rapid pace, 19 major markets today with Wideband LTE and 26, so another 7 markets before the end of the year. So our capacity position is strong. We will refarm PCS in the urban core as and when we need to, but our primary push right now is to expand our footprint with PCS LTE as we have a strong capacity position in the urban core. Just one quick thing to add on that capacity position. A great proxy to look and think about what's being offered in the marketplace today is the speeds that you can see and support on your LTE network. And as most of you know, we're the fastest LTE provider in the U.S. We have been for all of the year so far. Quarter-to-date, we still are, and we look to maintain that position. Verizon comes in second, AT&T a third and Sprint a very distant fourth place. You have capacity, you can support greater speeds. So we win on that front today, and we win very well in the urban core markets. John J. Legere: Okay. That was our tech dose for the morning. Let's go back to the calls. Operator : We'll go next to Walter Piecyk with BTIG Research. Walter Piecyk - BTIG, LLC, Research Division : I think I should want stay with Neville on some tech questions, John. Can you talk a little bit about what the data usage has been like. When you've kind of unleash these -- sat channel LTE networks. And also, I think Verizon, when they first launched their AWS spectrum and they sell these speed uptakes and they were saying speed was going to slow down over time, I think that's actually -- there's been some evidence of that. I'm just curious, as you've kind of launched these new sat channel LTE networks, have you seen any type of -- with the uptake of customers, obviously, the customer growth is really strong. Have you seen any pullback in how that network is performing and if not, when could that happen? What type of subscriber level are you going to have to hit from -- for you to see some of that kind of capacity-generated slowdown in speeds? John J. Legere: And as Neville starts, Walt, I want to let you know that you personally are responsible for the 23 tweet storm that I put out after taunting me on Twitter as to why I wasn't speaking up. So everyone who is pissed about their feed being clogged, this is the man that you can thank for that. Walter Piecyk - BTIG, LLC, Research Division : And don't forget to follow me, @WaltBTIG, as well [indiscernible] for that matter. We'll see -- how about a retweet on that? Neville R. Ray: I don't want to run over again what I was just going through. But we're the fastest LTE provider in the U.S.. We maintained that position. That was a very marginal decrease in speeds from us as for others, as we work through 3Q. But we're back again adding more spectrum to our LTE offering and that's the path forward. The combination with Metro afforded us this great opportunity to build highly contiguous spectrum assets in the mid-band, so more lanes on the LTE freeway. And we're doing very well right now. Walter Piecyk - BTIG, LLC, Research Division : But has the average usage of the customers increasing? And can you give some type of sense what the usage is? I think Joe was saying that there was some data you provided out of California talking about a 2.5 gig of usage from your customers. Can you give anything, any average on a nationwide basis on how that may have increased on the fatter channel networks? Neville R. Ray: Yes, I mean, I don't think we've -- obviously, we're seeing customers come on to the network in great numbers, and we're supporting a great experience for them. That's the plan. Unlike others, we want customers to use the service when they subscribe to us and give us their dollars. So average payloads, I mean, we've talked about in that 2 to 3 gigabytes per month range. So that's up, that's moving from where we were last year, but that's our plan, Walt. That's what we plan to do, and we look to see more uptake and more growth on this network, that's the entire plan that we are working on in '14. We look to continue that push in '15 as we'll bring more spectrum assets like our 700 MHz more formidably to the markets. Walter Piecyk - BTIG, LLC, Research Division : But I think just, I'm sorry, well one last one. I think 2 to 3 gig is much higher than what other carriers have talked about as far as the usage on their networks. And you're saying that, that's a level that you expect to go even higher. So I'm just curious where your spectrum position provides that advantage, where you'll start to see slow growth? Because if Verizon's customers go to 2 to 3 gig or 4 to 5, I'm not sure that the spectrum necessarily enables them to provide that -- those types of usage levels of their customers. I wonder if you can just elaborate on that, and that's my last question. Neville R. Ray: Yes. We don't disagree. I mean, if you look at the spectrum holdings on a per customer basis, that's one lens to look at this, and you compare us and you take that ratio of spectrum against the supported customers, we're in a good place. Our ratios are in the 1.5 to 1.6x range. For Verizon and T, it's one or less. So their ability to support those types of growth capabilities and numbers becomes more limited as growth comes upon the industry. It's our plan to support high levels of usage and growth on this network. Our LTE network has come on from 0 POPs to 250 in a very shorter period of time, and we packed a lot of spectrum into that offering. We're refarming aggressively, adding more spectrum assets to LTE portfolio. So we're in a good place, and we think it's a differentiator for us. John J. Legere: Walt, again, I think their average use is -- are getting somewhat in that zone already. So if we're at 2.7 gigabit average user. They're probably 2 at Verizon already. Neville R. Ray: [indiscernible] about 2. John J. Legere: And AT&T's about 1.5, and that's rising, of course. So I think their capability to handle that with the spectrum they have is certainly a good question far greater than the question on us. And obviously, on unlimited plans, the median user across our base is even higher, right? So we've got -- we are already with our network handling much bigger use. So we know what that looks like. I think they're just getting into that zone. That's a very good question. We'll go over here. We'll give another Twitter question for the network folks device, @sidekicker89, dead giveaway that he's probably 25 years old. It's @tmobileir, how many devices are 700 MHz capable? Some devices can't even get LTE on 1900 like my HTC One -- M1. So no... Neville R. Ray: Yes, take the 2 pieces. I mean, so 700 MHz, we're delighted with progress there considering how recently we acquired those assets. But handsets are coming on thick and fast. There's 8 planned for this quarter, and we already have our first in the market. Great handsets like the Note 4 from Samsung. So we're making great progress there considering we've been working with our handset providers for, what, about 9 months. As we move into '15, our plan is to have everything that's LTE capable to have 700 MHz support. So that's that piece. There was a tag on the question about 1900 LTE. Thankfully, not -- the PCS band has been in our LTE products, the vast majority of them for some time. There are a small number of handsets that don't support LTE 1900, but it's a very limited percentage of our base. Apologies to the questioner coming in there if that's not on his handset, but the vast majority of LTE terminals that we have today support the 1900 LTE band. John J. Legere: Okay. Let's take another dial-in question. Operator : We'll go next to Mike MacCormack with Jefferies & Company. Michael McCormack - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Thinking about the subs and, I guess, fourth quarter, looks a little bit conservative. I guess, your thoughts on iPhone 6 supply, and I know the 6 Plus has been constrained. Also, thoughts regarding maybe Sprint. They've talked about, and you guys have talked about porting ratios getting a bit better. I'm just trying to get a sense because it looks like you're pretty good, obviously, a pretty good slowdown potentially quarter-on-quarter, which is usually pretty good holiday season. And then maybe just some thoughts looking into next year, consensus looks awfully low versus the 2014 performance. John J. Legere: Okay. Let's wander around with that a little bit, and I'm not sure we're going to comment on 2015 until people can absorb some of what's going on here today. But remember, our first guidance on postpaid nets was 2 million to 3 million, then 2.8 million to 3.5 million, 3.5 million to 3.8 million, now 4.3 million to 4.7 million. So I would, clearly, as Braxton said, say it's a conservative estimate for us. And we are, I'll add onto it, it's -- we're talking about Q3, but it is the end of October, and we're pleased with the momentum that carried into October so it's not -- your question about conservatism is a good one. The porting that's going on in the industry, I would say a couple of things about. And the first one is important. While it's a natural, every bone of my body just naturally wants to compete with anybody on anything, we don't need to beat Sprint down to succeed, right? That's not -- and vice versa. Now there's a fallacy in the industry that AT&T and Verizon are going to sit where they are and T-Mobile and Sprint are going bash each other over the head and exchange customers. It's highly likely that what you're going to find is that's not what's going on. So we'll see how Sprint's results are, but if I was a betting man, I would bet that the momentum they're getting, if they're getting some, is coming from AT&T and Verizon, which is really positive. For us, right now, the porting ratio, as with everybody, are in a very good place. As I said last night, if everybody's okay with the way it is right now, I'm okay. Let's just keep it where it is. So far in October, we're porting 2.2 to 2.3 with AT&T and Verizon and about 2.5 with Sprint. That is steadily up Q2, Q3 and now with AT&T and Verizon, call it, 1.5, 1.6 or so to 1.8 to 1.9 now to 2.3, 2.2. Now Sprint has gone, Q2, from 3.5 to 1 to Q3 to 3.6 to 1, and they're about 2.5. So we're still porting highly favorably with them, but across the board, it's good. So you may see that, which would be, I think, really positive, that these customers that are going to test Sprint's network, don't come from T-Mobile and I do hope that they do well because they'll also add to the competition. So that's some of my feelings on that topic. Michael McCormack - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : And I think, John, on the iPhone 6 supplies are dampening fourth quarter adds? John J. Legere: Well, there's good news and bad news. Obviously, the iPhone was the biggest phone launch we've ever had. And the demand for that product line is and was unheralded. Supply in some aspects especially in the iPhone 6 are getting better. There's line of sight out to what's happening with the 6 Plus and I think that's what everybody -- I don't think it's dampened customers' desire for it, I mean, it's a beautiful product and very well done. But as far as Q4, I don't know Mike if you want to comment on the iPhone? G. Michael Sievert : Yes. I mean, well we've got -- we'll be dealing with supply issues on the 6 well in the November and on the 6 Plus for the majority of the quarter. And obviously, this is a great share taking opportunity for us if once we work through the supply. Even with the supply issues, the momentum that we're seeing is terrific. But look, people change carriers when they change phones, and we've always said, this is a big moment for us because this is a big device launch. And so far those predictions are turning out to be true. As to the conservatism in the Q4 numbers, if you look at our guidance, it implies a number for Q4 between 700,000 and 1.1 million postpaid net adds on the quarter. That midpoint is better than last year. It's better than the sum of the phone net adds that AT&T plus Verizon delivered this past quarter. So while may be conservative, it's also a good, strong solid quarter. And we're going to show balance. I mean, we're going to grow and be disciplined about our growth during a season that's traditionally very expensive to compete. John J. Legere: These last 2 answers were our attempt at humility, I hope they went well. Let's take another dial-in question. Operator : We'll go next to Timothy Horan with Oppenheimer. Timothy K. Horan - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division : Two questions. John, last year, you mentioned roaming rates and the FCC maybe is talking about lowering your roaming rates that you pay. Could you just elaborate on that a little bit? Does the FCC have the authority to do that, maybe the probability that you would assign to that? And then secondly, just on the synergies from MetroPCS. Could you give us an idea of where you are on that run rate or more importantly, how much more is there to go there? John J. Legere: Yes. I will -- I'm not going to amplify too much on the first piece because frankly, there is pending activity in Washington that I'm in no position to get the outcome on. There was a Guggenheim article written this week that suggested there might be some correlation between the FCC's decisions associated with the delay in the auction and the desire to do something favorable for Sprint and T-Mobile on roaming rates. And certainly, I think that would be a great potential outcome. They referenced decisions sometime in the December time frame, but I have no inside track on that. Outside of the fact that we know Washington loves the competition and the competitive environment, and I think they feel somewhat accountable, to make sure that all the players have the tools necessary to compete. And that would be one area. So no inside information on that, but something to watch. The whole MetroPCS story is one that we just don't talk about enough. And I'm going to start with the fact that in the prepaid space, driven heavily, if not, almost entirely by the MetroPCS brand, we had 411,000 prepaid net adds this quarter, and this is not a seasonally great quarter for Metro in the prepaid space. And remember, the ARPU here is $37.92. So this is a strong base of business and the momentum continues. Now quietly, what we haven't updated up on much is, when we announced this transaction, a significant part of this transaction comes from about $1.5 billion worth of savings when you ultimately close their network down, which means that we carefully had to migrate their customers to new handsets or to an experience off of that network. And at this point, 84% of the MetroPCS customers are no longer on the MetroPCS network. And that's a gigantic move and about 63% and growing of that capacity or that spectrum has been refarmed. So what all we did guide to this year is that the onetime cost associated with that network transition would be about 250 million to 300 million this year, 97 million of which we took in Q3. And in Q4, we're going to update you on the overall savings of what could be anticipated, but it's a story of an integration and a merger and a brand that I'm very, very proud of. And just a comparison lastly, the prepaid base that Verizon grew 9,000 last quarter and AT&T's, with their recent acquisition, shrunk 141,000. So great -- thanks for letting us talk about that topic. J. Braxton Carter : And Tim,let me add one thing. The actual positive synergy realization has really been de minimis for 2014. Now we'll start stepping into it in 2015, and then hit the full run rate that John's talking about, CapEx and the OpEx of $1.5 billion in 2016. And technically, from an accounting standpoint, you've got to completely decommission those sites before you can start realizing financial benefits of the synergies realized. That's why there's not a significant impact on 2014. John J. Legere: Okay. Let's take another dial-in, and then we'll go over to Twitter again. Operator : We'll go next to Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Philip Cusick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : John, last night, you called out Sprint's 10 for 100 promotion as potentially driving more lines than are really valid. Are you creating the same problems with the 4 for 100 promo? Can you talk about the customers that are coming in there? And what they cost you in ETFs. And you've talked about it being NPV positive. Can you give us a little more detail? And are they all connected to active handsets actually using the devices? G. Michael Sievert : It's Mike. Just a little bit of color on that. First of all, the people coming on from that promotion tended to skew a little bit more BYOD than our average, not a lot more, but a little bit more which helps moderate the cost. So that's good news. Secondly, the OpEx on these customers looks good. You know what happens when you've got a family of 2, and they add a third or a fourth, you pick up the extra revenue from that extra customer, but you don't pick up a proportional amount of cost because they don't call care that much more, et cetera. So you get some nice business benefits there. And what we had talked about was a onetime suppression of ARPU in Q4 that recovers in Q1, partly driven by the promotion, but you'll see some OpEx benefits because those customers are lower cost to care for. So on balance, we're really, really pleased with how it went. We were able to deepen our relationships with our existing customers, give them a great value proposition. It wasn't the majority of our loading. It was a promotion. It wasn't one of our structural Un-carrier moves, but a promotion that we're really pleased with how it went. J. Braxton Carter : And Phil, the final part of your question was phantom adds. And we can actually track usage by line, and this is not something that we're the least bit worried about on 4 for 100. And contrary to what a lot of people think, 4 for 100 has always been part of the Simple Choice lineup. It's just that with this promotion, we increased the data allowances in the 4 for 100 and I think that's very different than doing a larger line offering that, hey, why not? If I can get the phone and take the extra lines and are you really using them or not, and I think that's what John was referring to. John J. Legere: And I think if you did a United States census there, it would show you that there are more families of 4 than there are families of 10. But who am I? Time will tell on that. And this is something that we went into understanding and we're very comfortable with. There's a number of Twitter questions coming in on the same topic and I'm going to let Mike use this as a chance, @tailor_ [indiscernible] . His version is, why hasn't [indiscernible] came in with the negative version. There's several with the positive. But the negative version here is, why hasn't the T-Mobile Test Drive program generated as many tests asked John Legere expected? And importantly, John Legere had no huge expectations, but he did offer 1 million test drives. And 1 million test drive offer stands. And I'd also pointed out last night and often, you need to understand, when we do Un-carrier moves that start with a philosophy about solving customer pain points, these moves are structural and permanent. So the test drive, the ability to try, which started with the iPhone 5s, we are doing this not only to drive short-term business, but because we think that's the way the industry should be. So we're learning how to do it. We're looking at ways over time to expand the program. We'd like to see the whole industry create a process where people can test drive. So from that standpoint, it's a long journey, one that we're very patient with and one that we'll stick with. But to talk about this specifically, Mike, comments? G. Michael Sievert : Yes. I mean, I think you've touched on the test themselves. The fundamental measure of this thing is whether or not it's causing people to take a fresh look at our network and change their perception of our network, which itself has changed so much in the last year. And on that measure, it's been a resounding success. There's been complete reassessment by the public of what we offer when it comes to a network. We've launched our new network campaign, backed up by the incredible advances we've made from going from 0 LTE 1.5 years ago to 250 million of the fastest LTE with more data capacity than AT&T or Verizon, and we're explaining all that. But look, you can explain all that in TV commercials, but when you back it up with a test drive, it says, it's totally free, just come check it out. Whether or not people take you up on that test drive, it shows them that we're not bullshitting them, that we really mean it and that the network really is that good and people start to be willing to reassess. Now some of those people are reassessing because they actually took that test drive, which is great as well. I mean, we've made it available. It's totally free. We're very proud of it and with the partnership with Apple that brought it about. Separately, we announced when we got it started that eventually, we would keep it on the contemporary handsets when they're in good supply. We're very anxious to make that update as well, which I think will not only continue our long-term commitment to this program, but probably reinvigorate the actual test themselves. John J. Legere: Okay. Let's go to the phone, operator, take the next question. Operator : We'll go next to Tom Gritter [ph] with Wall Street Journal. Unknown Attendee : Quickly, can you talk about churn in the quarter? You're still much higher than AT&T and Verizon. Can you get it down? If so, how do you do that? And then just second, was there a tablet number for the quarter? And how do tablets factor into the net add guidance? John J. Legere: Yes. Let's wander around with that one, Tom. The -- remember, the starting point for us in postpaid churn was 2.5% and that was a variable that as we set out a multi-year plan, we anticipated that would take several years to get down to the 1.8, 1.7 range, driven obviously by the progress in our network and our care teams. That's gone extremely well. And as you know, this quarter about postpaid churn was 1.6%, which is flat, but just with the seasonal adjustment between Q2 and Q3, we are 1.5% plus last quarter. We are very comfortable. That's a very positive range. Couple of things to think about is, certainly, we don't have the government and enterprise base that AT&T has which has a much lower churn level, as well as we are 100% no contract. And so there's a lot of reasons. This is way ahead of our plan and I think part of our success is that churn. We will try to get it down further, but that's a range that is something we planned for and we're very positive about. I think the other guys' churn is -- has been a kind of a hallmark as to why they've been able to maintain huge profitability. And I think the bigger question is, how are they going to fare in their model as that churn starts to approach 1.0 and numbers up that they're heading to? But this is ahead of our plan, and we're very comfortable with it. G. Michael Sievert : And AT&T has spent an unheralded amount of money, attempting to resecure their base over the course of this year. And I think we're going to find and there's some predictions being written out there right now, that their basis aren't very secured at all, despite all that expense and all those efforts. Our Un-carrier campaign has always been targeted and giving their customers a better experience over at T-Mobile. And we intend to demonstrate with our next couple of Un-carrier moves that if they think their base is secure, they're quite mistaken. So we're looking forward to solving some more pain points of the market, focused squarely on some of the disadvantages of doing business with the big 2. John J. Legere: Tom, I had an experience last night that I have every time I can get an audience of 500 or 1,000 people. And I was asked, how many use T-Mobile. And remember, we've got 16.5% market share. So it's never more than a loud and proud few. In any group, if I ask the following questions, how many of you is AT&T? Pretty sizable base. How many of you got your first iPhone from AT&T? Pretty sizable base. How many of you hated it and are really discontent with them and will consider moving to another carrier? 2/3. So I think there was articles written this week that as many as 20 million of their 75 million customers are not locked down. And in this period of new device change, I think that's a fascinating ground for us. And I think the possibilities for us and the challenges for them seem to be tremendously connected. So -- but thanks for your question, Tom. Now let's do one more on the dial-in. And at some point after this, I also want to make some comments because we are not going to let all these Twitter questions just go away. And we'll make some closing comments on how we're going to handle some of those. But let's take one more question on the phone. This will be our last question. Operator : We'll go next to John Hodulik with UBS. John C. Hodulik - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Maybe first for John. You talked about the porting ratios, but can you maintain the momentum and the share, specifically of handset net adds that you showed this quarter in the fourth quarter and beyond, while sunsetting the 4 for 100 promotion and while seeing the renewed pressure from Sprint, which is now focusing on share, that's #1. And then for Braxton, looks like the fourth quarter margins, you're going to see a nice uptick. As we said in the previous question, is that sort of 28%, 29%, 30% general range? What we should start to think about as we look out into 2015? John J. Legere: Mike, do you want to start? G. Michael Sievert : Yes, I mean, if you look at the quarter ahead, as I said a few minutes ago, and you take our guidance, it implies 700,000 to 1.1 million on the quarter on net adds, which is more than last year and more than the sum of the phone net adds that AT&T and Verizon did this last quarter. So it's a strong solid quarter. We've got a lot going for us, including some nice momentum into October. We think iPhone is a share-taking opportunity. Note 4 is a share-taking opportunity. It's a device-centric quarter. So just because we're pulling back the promotion doesn't mean we're not playing hard. It's not a quarter that's usually driven by rate plans. It's more driven by devices, and we intend to play hard in devices this quarter. We guide somewhat conservatively on this, but if we hit the midpoint of this guidance, that also will be a solid set of numbers, as I said. And we have been very disciplined all along at playing smartly. We've got 3.6 million postpaid net adds in the bag so far, and we have focused the majority of those on smartphones because they're better customers. Higher productivity customers, higher ARPU, better usage profiles where our competitors are basically hiding behind tablet nets, some of which are of dubious quality and whether or not they're really even real customers. So we're really proud of the mix. It was 200,000 tablets, 1.2 million nets on the phone side, which is a very, very high-quality profile, and we're guiding for another strong quarter in Q4. John J. Legere: And John, I went out of my way and I maintain the position of pointing out that this isn't a game about us beating Sprint. I don't want to let that be viewed as that we're not being Sprint as. We are, summarily, beating Sprint consistently. And I don't think we should, or we won't, you guys can do whatever you want. Let's not get too carried away with somebody that went from dead to showing a pulse. I mean, they've got a lot of work to do, and we're still porting 2.5 to 1 with them. That's not exactly calling a need for a task force to figure out what to do. So we're very strongly rolling. Our gross add flow was up 46% year-over-year. A couple of things -- and I know they sound a bit like pablum when we talk about it, if there's something going on with the Un-carrier moves that have taken place, not only the awareness needing to grow, but our brand is accreting significant value and a huge portion of all carrier's customers are now seeing T-Mobile as the #1 company that are taking the most steps to change wireless for the better. That has tremendously positive ramifications. And when you do any survey about likely switchers, et cetera, while some of the offers Sprint is laying out are getting headlines mainly because they woke up, it's not necessarily the kind of thing that feels brand loyalty and over time, I think that's a big deal for us. Now let's also know, in addition to brands, we happen to have the fastest network. So one of the big things that we've learned this year, that Sprint and others will need to learn, yes, you can get them to come, but will they stay? And right now, our network experience, what we just outlined is 250 million POPs and we're announcing we're going to move to 300 million, that is a great experience and it's the fastest one, our GDP award-winning customer care. These are all part of this multi-period success. And lastly, we -- 4 for 100, as it was designed, was a onetime offer, but we are the only ones that offer unlimited on a family plan, which you can get. And I don't want to make any announcements, but hell, the last thing we did was our fourth Un-carrier move this year, which is Un-carrier 7.0. What do you think is coming around the corner to you? 7 plus 1 equals Un-carrier 8. So let's wait and see what happens. So thanks for your questions. Listen, this format has been fun. We could probably allocate more time to it in the future. Anybody want to make a comment on what we're going to do with the Twitter questions? We're going to do our best -- I'll make it. We're going to do our best to answer as many of these as we can going forward. I, of course, will be on my own handle, answering all of my own Twitter, but give me 6 hours or so to catch up with the flow, and we're very proud of this quarter and we look forward. Braxton, any final comments? J. Braxton Carter : We definitely appreciate everybody, and I hoped you enjoy the Un-carrier earnings. And definitely looking forward to next quarter. John J. Legere: Okay, everybody, thank you very much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the T-Mobile US Third Quarter 2014 Conference Call. If you have any further questions, you may contact the Investor Relations or Media departments. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect, and have a pleasant day.",

Welcome to the T-Mobile US Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2014 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] This earnings call is being recorded today, February 19, 2015. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Nils Paellmann, Head of Investor Relations for T-Mobile US. Please go ahead, sir. Nils Paellmann : Thank you very much. Welcome to T-Mobile's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2014 Earnings Call. With me today are John Legere, our President and CEO; Braxton Carter, our CFO; and other members of the senior leadership team, including our newly minted COO, Mike Sievert. Let's get to the disclaimer. We have another Un-carrier move today. We have a short disclaimer. During this call, we will make projections and statements about the future performance of the company, which are based on current expectations and assumptions. Please consider the risk factors included on our annual report on Form 10-K that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. In addition, we will comment on non-GAAP financial results on this call. You can find the reconciliations between GAAP and these non-GAAP results in our Investor Factbook on the Investor Relations page of our website. Let me now turn it over to John Legere. John J. Legere: Okay. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Welcome to our -- the second Un-carrier earnings call and open Twitter conference. We've actually added a live video stream here from the New York Stock Exchange. And on Twitter, you're going to get to see what it's like right here in the room with the full behind-the-scenes experience, as harrowing as that is, sort of like one of those restaurants with an open kitchen where you get to see the chef prepare your meal and decide how you feel about that. But we're going to keep pushing the edge and making this a true Un-carrier experience for everyone. We'll generally go with the same Q&A approach as last quarter. However, we did learn last time that to accommodate more of your questions, we're going to extend the call for, and I'd be clear about this, up to 90 minutes and take questions via Twitter, text and on the phone. But certainly, if after 17 minutes, you are completely happy and the stock is going up considerably, we'll feel free to terminate it at that point in time. You're going to see in the video that our CTO, Neville Ray, is not in the room today. He's joining us remotely since he's out testing remote venues' and destinations' network coverage, which is a long way of saying he's skiing somewhere today in an undisclosed location. So be safe out there, Neville. Let me give you very briefly some of the highlights of our really fantastic results. The net is the Un-carrier revolution continues. 2014 was a record year of growth as T-Mobile continued to be the fastest-growing wireless company in America, and we really blew away all of the competition. Our 8.3 million total net additions clearly demonstrates the continued power of the Un-carrier approach. Now 4 million of these were postpaid phone nets, which is the best in the industry by a very long shot. Let me put that in perspective for you. We captured virtually all, as in 100% of the industry postpaid phone growth in 2014. And compared to our main competitors, we added 3x as many postpaid net phone additions as Verizon, 5x as many as AT&T for the full year. In the case of Sprint, I would have to say it's infinite. For those of you that understand the algebra, you'll understand. I'm sure we'll all come back to that in a lot of different fashions during Q&A. Now we are #1 in the prepaid segment with over 16.3 million customers. We added 1.2 million customers for the full year; again, the most in the industry and as much as 14x our nearest competitors. Much of this is fueled by the rapid expansion of our MetroPCS brand, which is now operating in 55 markets, up from the 15 when we closed the transaction, and a lot more to talk about with Metro today as well. Here's another insight, and I know you've been looking for a lot of final insight as to what took place in '14 and what took place in Q4 and what's taking place now competitively. Our postpaid porting ratios for the full year were 2.15, and we were positive every single week of every single month for the whole year with every carrier. So we'll go into that in some detail. But for the entire year, there was no week when any carrier posted -- ported positive with us. And these are even improving into Q1. So we'll talk some about that as well. The strong results are also an affirmation of our improving brand strength. The magenta brand is getting stronger and stronger as evidenced by the fact that our postpaid share of gross adds has increased 46% on a full year 2014 over 2013, and that bodes very well going into '15. And the Un-carrier revolution is, as you've seen, far from finished. We made a few significant moves in the fourth quarter, including introducing Un-carrier 8.0: Data Stash. We also brought back the popular 4 for $100 promotion and launched a 2 for $100 unlimited family plan promotion. Data Stash in these continuing promotions have carried the momentum into the first quarter of 2015, and we'd be glad to field questions on whether future Un-carrier moves are coming around the bend. T-Mobile's blazing 4G LTE network continues to be the nations fastest. We ended '14 with 265 million 4G LTE POPs. That was significantly ahead of our committed 250 million target. And by expanding our network to 300 million 4G LTE POPs by the end of '15, we intend to further level the playing field with our major competitors. We are quickly deploying Wideband LTE already live in 121 market areas and are aggressively deploying low-band spectrum, most recently launching 700 MHz A-Block spectrum in Houston and Dallas. And now that the AWS-3 auction is complete and the quiet period is over, let me just touch on that topic. I weighed in on the auction outcomes yesterday but want to reiterate what we always said that we would be disciplined to this auction, and that's exactly what happened. We won 151 licenses for approximately $1.8 billion in total spend at an average price of $1.59 per megahertz POP, which is significantly low than the average in the paired auction. We improved our mid-band spectrum positions in a number of markets, including Houston, Miami and Kansas City, to mention a few. Overall and for the near term -- near-to-medium term, we feel good about our mid-band spectrum position. For sure, the unrestrained bidding by the largest 2 carriers in the recent auction confirmed the importance of a robust spectrum reserve in the upcoming incentive auction for low-band spectrum, with the 2 guys, large guys, currently control 73% of all low-band spectrum. And if the government wants a competitive wireless market, they need to establish auction rules to reflect that. In addition, we don't want to see a delay in the upcoming broadcast incentive auction. The sooner it happens, the better. We plan to participate strongly in that auction to obtain needed low-band spectrum that will strengthen our coverage footprint even more. Now our CFO, Braxton Carter, will provide you a quick overview of the key financial highlights, and then we'll get to your questions via Twitter, text message or on the phone. Braxton? J. Braxton Carter : Hey, thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Let me give a quick snapshot of our financial results. Our industry-leading customer growth is translating into strong financial performance. With an adjusted EBITDA of $5.64 billion up 6% year-over-year, we achieved our guidance even while blowing away our customer growth expectations. In fact, we were the only major U.S. wireless carrier with expanding sequential EBITDA margin in the fourth quarter. Once again, we led the industry in revenue growth with year-over-year service revenue growth of 13.6% and 19.4% total revenue growth in the fourth quarter. We've also delivered on the MetroPCS synergies. We expect to decommission all of the remaining CDMA markets by the second half of 2015, and we expect to incur additional onetime network decommissioning costs in the range of $500 million to $600 million with substantially all the costs expected to be incurred in 2015. Total onetime network decommissioning cost, CapEx and OpEx, since the acquisition of MetroPCS, are expected to be between $1.5 billion and $1.7 billion, which is $600 million to $750 million lower than the original synergy guidance given upon the formation of TMUS. The total NPV of synergies is now expected to be between $9 billion and $10 billion, up from our original projections of $6 billion to $7 billion. We expect to reach full run rate synergies of at least $1.5 billion by 2016. We have a strong outlook for 2015 that balances growth and profitability. We see continued momentum for the Un-carrier and are targeting 2.2 million to 3.2 million postpaid net additions in 2015. At the same time, we are targeting adjusted EBITDA of $6.8 million to $7.2 billion, which represents an increase of approximately 25% at the midpoint. Cash CapEx is expected to be in the range of $4.4 billion to $4.7 billion, slightly up from 2014. I would like to point out that adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter of 2015 is expected to be significantly impacted by a large investment to front-end growth in 2015 just as we did in 2014. In addition, the first quarter will reflect the accounting treatment of Un-carrier 8.0: Data Stash, which is expected to have a noncash impact in the range of $100 million to $150 million. The accounting treatment of the initial 10 gigabyte allotment from Un-carrier 8.0, which is a noncash revenue deferral, is expected to fully reverse itself during 2015. Rather than going on about such a great year, let's get onto your questions. You can ask questions via phone, text message or via Twitter. We will start with a question on the phone. Operator, first question, please? Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from John Hodulik with UBS. John C. Hodulik - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Just a couple of quick ones. First, John, as you look out to the competitive environment in '15, how does it compare to what you saw starting out 2014? And then the 2 million to 3 million net adds you guys are calling for, for this year, I mean, can you guys do that and still see improving ARPU trends at the same time? And then I guess, lastly, first quarter of last year, you had a huge quarter, I think, as a result of the ETF from Un-carrier plan. As you look out into this year, you've got a strong momentum, you've got the Data Stash. Can we expect to see a similar quarter from a net add standpoint in the first quarter of '15 that was on '14? John J. Legere: All right. I'll start talking about the competitive environment, and then I'll let Mike weigh in on questions 2 and 3, and we'll all chime in on him. The competitive environment into '15, obviously, is intense. The difference between '14 and '15 is going into '14, there was a question about what will happen? What will Sprint do with their network? Will they come out and fight? Or will they keep the -- pardon us while we redecorate sign out there? Will AT&T and Verizon respond? And I think all of that played out as you would expect. We're in a similar spot. We're still waiting to see what Sprint is going to do with their network. However, they're swinging the bat pretty hard, trying to get some activity flow. And I think AT&T and Verizon played really hard, and they felt the pain really badly. In Q4, I think the hand on the hot stove by the young child didn't feel pretty good, and they're taking the hand off the stove. So it's an interesting move into '15 because I think what T-Mobile has shown is it's not about what we're doing until somebody else responds. We've got a truly differentiated approach to the wireless industry that customers are responding well to. Our consideration is up a great way. Our share of gross adds is up considerably. Our brand value is up tremendously, and there's plenty more to do. So going into '15, I think the competitive environment is intense. We're prepared for it. We're thriving on it. As I said, our postpaid porting ratios last year with 2.15 overall. They are stronger so far, I think, through the first 1.5 month, and it'll continue. And it's about brand and it's about Un-carrier. And I think there's a bit of schizophrenia on the other guys that they're going to have to sort out. \"Hey, we're never going to lower our self. We're not going to compete, they're trying to take our low end.\" That was Verizon, and then a couple of years later, they tried to lower their low-end prices and raised their data bucket prices. I think AT&T is working on so many other things. Somebody needs to remind them that they've got a U.S. wireless consumer base. And we're rooting for Sprint. We need Sprint to help us give -- take a few shots at the big guys and cause a little churn in the industry. And churn is good for us. So that's off the top of my head. But whatever it is, either they continue to fight and we continue to aggressively grow the way we are. Or they laid out and moved a few share points to us, and we're okay on either front. But Mike, do you want to talk about the... G. Michael Sievert : Yes. I think what's the best thing about the competitive environment that we're facing right now is that our data is crystal clear, that people are not choosing T-Mobile because of price. As John said, they're choosing it because of the overall value proposition that we offer as the Un-carrier, and that's fascinating. Because if you were to ask the big guys whether or not there's a price war on, they're likely to say -- they'll try to downplay it, but the truth is they're likely to feel over there like there's a price war going on. Because if you've been sitting around like they have, charging too much, overcharging, over-monetizing customers and treating them the way they treat them, then when we come in with a more rational value proposition, it sure feels like a price war to them. From where we sit, not at all. In fact, people are choosing us because of the rounded Un-carrier value proposition that we have, which kind of -- it makes it interesting in comparison to Sprint, who has really focused, since they began playing harder last summer, on price. Just price, price, price. And what's interesting is this category is so important to consumers that that's just not enough. I mean, this is something we're not willing to make compromises and trade-offs on something as important as wireless. And so we've struck a nice balance here between focusing on the fastest 4G LTE network, a great experience, and then Un-carrier value proposition that's about solving their wireless problems, not just about low price. And that's really attracting people. The numbers speak for themselves with 4 million phone net, substantially all of the phone nets in the industry. And John, you also asked about ARPU. Do you want to jump in on that one, Braxton? J. Braxton Carter : Yes, I think that, John, one thing you need to take into account is disclosures that we put out about the Data Stash and the 10-gigabyte allotment. That is a noncash revenue deferral that impacts the first quarter, which will have a corresponding impact on ARPU. But it's very important to note that, that will reverse completely through 2015 as that is actually utilized. And of course, that 10-gigabyte expires at the end of the year, so there will be no impact at all on 2015 ARPUs. Now once you take that into account, the one thing that we need to be aware of is that we have a tremendous focus on increasing family plan, activations with the Un-carrier. And we're going to do that in a very, I think, prudent manner that creates a lot of value throughout the year. But that can be decretive to ARPU at given points in time, given what we're doing from a promotional standpoint. But from a holistic standpoint, that is very accretive to EBITDA. When you're looking at the NPV of those additional family units coming on and the different acquisition costs relating to it, it is absolutely the right thing to do for Un-carrier. And we will -- again, we're not going to share competitive future moves, but it's something that we all need to be aware of. And if that does happen, there's definitely a benefit to the model in that we all know that family plans are much more stickier, are much more accretive to value creation. So yes, we're very, very optimistic with what we're seeing for 2015. John C. Hodulik - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : And just lastly -- as you say, given the momentum you guys are seeing, could you do 1 million plus net adds in the first quarter similar to what you did last year? J. Braxton Carter : The first quarter of last year was significantly north of 1 million on postpaid phone adds. Of course, we said that we're making a very large investment at the beginning of the year, and we're very pleased with what we're seeing develop. Getting to the level that we had in the first quarter of '14, and if you remember, we had Un-carrier 4.0, which was our ETF offering. That's going to be tough because there's a lot of embedded demand for switching that immediately got triggered when we did that. But it's fair to say that we're very optimistic about what we're seeing for the first quarter. John J. Legere: John, it's interesting, the component what you'd said. I don't want to go too deeply into this. But I would tell you what we've learned in our business is that we could do 1 million net adds any time we choose to at any point. And what we refined our skills on recently in Q4 is the ability to manage growth and profitability to our liking, which is a beautiful spot to be in from a standpoint of managing and balancing growth when you want to grow and how you want to grow. And so it's very exciting for us. But appreciate your help. Let's go to -- let's take one more on the phone, and then I'll jump around and do some of these [indiscernible] of Twitter and other questions coming in. Operator : We'll go next to Simon Flannery at Morgan Stanley. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : John, you made some management changes yesterday. I was wondering if you could just provide a little bit of color about what you're trying to achieve there. And then Braxton, a good news on the synergies, $1.5 billion in '16. How much of that is flowing into your guidance for 2015? John J. Legere: Yes, thanks. I publicized a number of the changes that we made yesterday. And just very quickly, what they are is a -- it's a redefinition of my senior leadership team in a couple of ways. So one is raising up to a senior leadership team level directly, both the Retail leadership in Ami Silverman as well as Customer Care and service direct on the team in naming Jon Freier. We then also named Mike Sievert as Chief Operating Officer of the company and acknowledging the great work that he's done, but also acknowledging a continued need for a much more focused Chief Operating team to focus on the next level of Un-carrier growth. In that organization, also reporting to me and reporting to Mike, we expanded Tom Keys' responsibilities, who, as you know, is the MetroPCS leader who's done an incredible job and named him the President of T-Mobile Indirect, giving him all Indirect responsibilities as well and having him work with Mike on the trade-offs, et cetera, required there. And then key move behind that is -- behind Mike as the Chief Marketing Officer of the company, also, on the senior leadership team is Andrew Sherrard. Andrew, actually, was here as the acting CMO preceding Mike and I. The mystery will be out soon that a lot of what we did actually, Mike and I stole from Andrew, who had the ideas when we got here. So that's a few of the moves, and we can talk more a lot about that, but it's a great focus. One thing I would say is Jim Alling, who's -- was the acting CEO when I got here and was the operating lead for the T-Mobile site. He'll be moving onto some other opportunities, and we're taking some time also. He's very loved in the company and thank him for all the great work that he's done. But thanks for bringing it up. J. Braxton Carter : Yes, Simon, on your other question, I'm just -- to kind of toot the magenta horn here for a minute. In the history of wireless, I mean, I think this is textbook M&A integration. We have transitioned all but 1 million of the legacy MetroPCS customers off that CDMA network onto the highest speed network in the country that Neville and his team have built. And we've done it with estimates of losing 3,000 to 4,000 customers. The integration has been seamless, and it's also been significantly accelerated over the original timeframes that have been laid out. And it's that acceleration plus a significant beat on the cost to achieve that's driving another $3 billion worth of total NPV of synergies into our business. We will not reach the run rate synergy realization until 2016. That's because we will have all the networks decommissioned. You saw we just shut down Atlanta and Detroit. All the California markets were shut down in the fourth quarter, plus some others. And the issue here is you have to completely decommission those CDMA networks before you can start realizing the synergy benefit from that decommissioning. So not all of it happens in 2015, but it's fully embedded in our EBITDA guidance of $6.8 billion to $7.2 billion, a partial run rate of that synergy. But I think the important thing to note is we'll be $1.5 billion or over for 2016, which we're very, very excited about. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : So basically, there's more synergy to come '16 over '15? J. Braxton Carter : Absolutely. John J. Legere: Okay. I'm going to jump to a few quick ones in the Twitter feed. This may be a Mike -- I'm not sure, which feed it is, but I think it's Jeff -- @jeffpas2. Any future plans working with BlackBerry? And I would just -- we don't have a lot to report. I would say that we are having discussions with BlackBerry. We're very optimistic we have nothing to report at this time, but I think both we and BlackBerry understand that there is a hardcore zealot of T-Mobile fans and BlackBerry fans that want to see that 2 of us do something together. That message has been received. John and I have spoken, and our teams are trying to find a way to make that work. So nothing to announce, but we're positively disposed on the topic. Okay, let's see. Yes, just a quick one here too, as well. Can you give any color in the uptake other Personal CellSpot offering? Mike? G. Michael Sievert : Yes, we're well on track. This is something that we launched in September of last year called Wi-Fi Un-leashed, and it has several components to it, one of which is the Personal CellSpot. We said at the time that we would do at least 1 million Personal CellSpots well-placed to give great coverage to people in all kinds of nooks and crannies of the country, including their basements, and that -- it's just been wildly popular. So that's a trajectory that will be easily achieved. And probably as importantly, what we did on the same day is we announced that every phone that we carry in the T-Mobile stores will either, at the time of the launch and shortly thereafter, support Wi-Fi calling. And that's been something that our customers have responded incredibly positively to. Because people know that despite what the wireless industry would try to make you believe, that there are places, whether it's basements or out in the woods or faraway places or certainly overseas and doing travel, when Wi-Fi connection is there, but cellular connection either is indoor, is hard to get or hard to pay for. And so we're really proud of this. We're the only one supporting it across the board. We're the only ones with it, for example, on the i Phone 6. It's a real differentiator. John J. Legere: Okay. Before I take the next Twitter question. Let me just do a technological check and see, Neville, if you're there. If so, please speak. Neville R. Ray: Yes, I'm good, John. John J. Legere: Okay. Neville R. Ray: With you guys and hear you loud and clear. John J. Legere: Okay. So there's a number of questions coming in. I'll just read one of them from Christian Prenzler. But Neville, why don't you use this for a quick, and I reiterate that term, update on what's going on with the great work that you all have done in the network. But the question that came in from Christian is, \"Hi, everyone. How has the 2G to LTE expansion been versus expectations, cost, time, et cetera?\" Neville R. Ray: Yes, I think that's a great place to start, John. I mean, the acceleration and the momentum we have on our LTE expansion is [indiscernible] delighted to see it coming at the end of last year [indiscernible] target in place. And to the heart of the question just raised, I mean, the traction [ph] on our footprint came from 2G to LTE conversion in the 1900 MHz band. That momentum continues. We look to be at 280 million by midyear, if not the full. And you mentioned in the opening comments, the goal for the year is 300 million covered POPs of LTE. That's a pretty remarkable story, considering that we had nothing, if you went back just about 2 years ago. And that is going to be, I think, pretty stunning in the marketplace. It's all of the [indiscernible] geographic expansion of our LTE footprint in a matter of months. It will put us on par geographically or very damn close with the Big 2, and that goal is in sight for us. We have a lot going on with the combination with Metro that Braxton referenced. That's been just a tremendous program for us. We're into -- we're well along on the back 9 here with New York and Miami left to go. The synergy piece that I'd love from that deal has been our ability to exercise the combination of the spectrum. And 75%, 3/4 of that spectrum, now being used on the TMUS network and more to come. Think about more spectrum coming over to T-Mobile usable today in AWS-1 and big markets like New York and Miami in the first half of this year. No waiting on Spectrum to clear from auctions for T-Mobile. We're going to be adding to our LTE strength as we move through just the first half of this year, let alone second half. So a lot going on, very excited about the expansion of the network, the performance, and we love that fastest LTE crown. And game on. Let the competition try and catch us. John J. Legere: Okay. I'm taking now a Twitter question because one of our prolific followers on Twitter, @waltBTIG, Walter Piecyk is -- I think I've seen at least 27 questions from Walt. So before he beat somebody where he is, we'll take one of them here, and maybe we'll see him in the other queue. But this question says, \"Phone ASPs were up. Preference for higher capacity iPhones or EIP enabling, driving higher-end purchases?\" You want to use that, Mike, to delve into what's going on there? G. Michael Sievert : Yes. Fourth quarter, it's no surprise, was a huge quarter for everybody on high-end phones, driven by the launch of the i Phone 6. But for us, there were some particular dynamics. And one thing that's interesting to note, Walt, is that T-Mobile sold 28 million smartphones in 2014, over 30 million phones overall. We think with some of the vendors, that puts us at #1. We think we may be #2 overall, but Q4 was dominated by the i Phone 6 as well as the Note 4. And so we did see average selling prices go up. And we're attracting a different kind of customer. And that's been a journey that we've been on for over a year now since the Un-carrier really started to kick in to its highest gear in January of last year with the launch of Contract Freedom. What's happening is we're bringing suburban families who can afford multiple super phones, and these are Prime customers. You're seeing our bad debt rates fall, you're seeing our Prime portfolio continue to improve, and you're also seeing higher-end phone sales. So all those things are tied together, and it really shows how our brand has evolved over the past 1.5 year and the kind of customers we're now attracting. John J. Legere: Okay. And Walt, I'm sure we'll get more a lot more from you. Appreciate all you're following as well. Let's take -- go back to the phone operator. Operator : We'll go to Phil Cusick at JPMorgan. Philip Cusick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : So if I take your fourth quarter EBITDA number and multiply it by 4, I get to the midpoint of '15 guidance, which is pretty rare in the wireless industry. So one, can you talk about the puts and takes of getting that EBITDA number? It seems pretty conservative. And second, how do we move from there to free cash flow? You said that the drag from EIP is going to slow into '15. Do you expect to use the this other receivables to offset that? How should we think about it? John J. Legere: Yes, I'm going to turn this to Braxton, but I will just say there should be a big sticker on our earnings, which is do not multiply times 4. Do not extrapolate, divide by 4 for Q1. We are very confident on the guidance that we're giving, but if you look at last year, for example, the shape and the curve of what we do with our EBITDA in our investments throughout the year have somewhat of a predictable pattern. And I think Braxton will outline. There's a couple of very specific items in Q1 to look at. So the EBITDA growth, we feel extremely comfortable with, but simple algebra on how to put it into each pew in the church, that needs a little help. And Braxton, why don't you pick up on that? J. Braxton Carter : Yes, sure. And I think that's right on, john. I think when we look at the shaping of the year, we should all be informed with how we executed in 2014. We're making a very significant investment of front-end growth in the year. As you've heard from the team and John that we're very comfortable with the momentum that we see so far in the first quarter, and that's the best time of the year to grow. You pay for that growth in year versus growth that comes onto the fourth quarter, where you just have the acquisition cost and no resulting margin coming in from those customers. We've already talked about the Data Stash 10-gigabyte gift element being a deferral out of first quarter that completely reverses on the year and has no impact. But I think when you look at the year in total sales, what we've done here is establish a reputation for always meeting or exceeding our guidance. And the credibility that we get from doing that, we think, is very, very important, especially when you look at the shaping of activity throughout the year. We have a fairly wide range that we have given on our postpaid growth. Like last year, as we demonstrate growth throughout the year, we will tighten that range. And quite frankly, our aspirations are at the very high end of that range, if not higher. So all that needs to be taken into account when you look at the overall EBITDA guidance that we've given. On your other question -- and again, I think this is a milestone year for T-Mobile. When you look at what is implied by the guidance that we've given, there's very significant simple free cash flow accretion to this business. And when you look at it on a levered basis, we are net generating cash in 2015, which is the key to ultimate value creation. And the changes in working capital, and we have had a very, very significant on-balance-sheet investment on -- and our EIP. That's moderating because the base is now 89% penetrated, and we said the terminal penetration, because not all of our customers and partners can offer EIP, is about 90%. We're at 89% right now. Now certainly, there was a larger increase in the fourth quarter that was driven by the i Phone 6. So we definitely expect, on a fully levered operating free cash flow basis, to generate positive cash, which is a milestone. And I think it's a testament to the whole thesis that we've had with Un-carrier: Turn this into a significant growth platform leading to double-digit revenue, service revenue, reoccurring service revenue increases, which is now resulting in significant double-digit increases in the EBITDA and brings us fully levered operating free cash flow positive. John J. Legere: Okay. Let's go to the next question on the phone. Operator : And we'll go next to Rick Prentiss at Raymond James. Richard H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division : First, congrats, Mike. Well-deserved on the COO role. One more guidance question, then we'll probably move one from there. Braxton, I think from what I'm hearing, '15 should look like '14. We looked back to '14. We used the same phrase as you did. You blew away the net adds based on the original wide range of guidance, and yet you were able to really almost hang on at the low end of the EBITDA, even with blown away guidance. Should we kind of look at '15 being a similar thought process on how you guys plan things given the competitive environment? J. Braxton Carter : Absolutely, Rick, and thank you for emphasizing that. As I said, our aspirations are significant for this year. But the positioning of our EBITDA and everything that we continue to do from cost transformation, the MetroPCS synergy starting to layer in, we're highly confident that we will deliver EBITDA at a very nice place within this range even with higher growth. So absolutely. John J. Legere: I think you've got a really good handle on it. I think our competitors in the industry seem to think of a lot of what we're doing all at the same time as phases that they do one at a time. Now we have a significant constant cost-reduction program going on, and we reduced cost by over $1.1 billion last year. We continue that every single week and will. There's always further cost to reduce. At the same time, we're aggressively investing in our network and IT capabilities and growing, because our business is on a fast trajectory, plus driving profitability. So it's an -- these are phases for us. This is how we intend to run the company. And we said a couple of years ago what our medium-term goals were for revenue growth and profitability and cash, and we're dead on those, and we'll continue to update you on it. Let's -- I got to take one Twitter question that's coming in from Judah. It's at @Judahe. This is going to give you more followers than I think you've got in the last 2 years. His question is, \"Any comments you can share on FCC's Title II plan and how it might affect your Music Freedom?\" For those that everybody knows, that there will be an FCC vote on February 26. And from what we understand about it, obviously, we are big proponents of a free and open Internet. But I think the short of it is, it's a 300-page document that certainly we haven't been able to crawl our way through. But I'm comfortable that if passed, as we understand it, it will have no impact on Music Freedom. And relative to our competitors, I think we would continue to drive forward with our business as it is. So that will be a big event for us, and we'll keep an eye on it. Let's go back to the phone again. Operator : And we'll go next to Brett Feldman at Goldman Sachs. Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : So based on what you were saying around the first quarter and how well it feels like it's going, this is going to be the second year in a row where your first quarter shapes up to be a very big quarter from a customer acquisition standpoint, which is the absolute opposite of what we've historically assumed the first quarter is supposed to look like. And so I'm just curious, what have you seen that has caused you to say, this is the quarter where we want to go hunting for customers aggressively when it seems that the rest of the industry tends to feel -- sit there a little less aggressive? John J. Legere: Okay. Well, let's just put a couple of things in perspective, then I'll turn to Mike, who will try to wrap it through. Remember now that we've had 7 quarters in a row, over 1 million net adds, right? And we've had 3 out of the last 4, over 2 million. So it's become a normal way of us doing business, and our share is still low enough that we see it continuing into the foreseeable future. Second is, what's also becoming apparent is our growth is not related to our competitor's actions. We have waited right through periods of their activity and inactivity and continued to grow. So it's directly related to how we choose to deploy our capabilities throughout the year. And obviously, as both Braxton and Mike said, Q1 getting a fast start is the most economically advantaged way throughout a year to get a return within the -- we'd certainly have started that, and we have more that we're going to do very early in the year. But Mike, if you want to jump in on that? G. Michael Sievert : Yes, I would just add, it's a great time to play. And if you look at the fourth quarter, we showed a lot of discipline in the fourth quarter to keep things in balance. We posted great growth numbers. I mean, I -- and we're very pleased with our growth numbers. But we also posted a big EBITDA performance and kept things in balance. Why? Because the fourth quarter is a really expensive time to play. And it's interesting to us that our competitors don't seem to get that as they plowed all kinds of irrational money into the fourth quarter, and you saw the damage that it did. We didn't play that way. Now Q1 is a pretty good time to play. People are flushed with cash. In many cases, because of the tax effect, the competitive environment is moderated a little bit. Last year, we played hard. And of course, in a company that has fiscal years on calendar years, our investments that we make in Q1, even if they're significant, we can recoup within the year. And you saw our EBITDA shaping last year where growth was very big and EBITDA was light in Q1 and then it shaped through, and by the end, we had a very big finish on EBITDA and balanced growth. And that's something that we've been saying today as a shape that you can expect to be repeated again this year. John J. Legere: And just think about. So Q4 ends, dust settles, we all head into Q1. What happened? In Q4, Verizon and AT&T had 14% and 23%, respectively, increases in postpaid churn, unheralded increases in churn. And they both reported significant margin pressure. So it didn't feel very good. We are announcing a record year, great probability and growth in Q4. And I'll clue you in. I mean, from November 1 through mid-December, we were watching. And if you saw, Q4 is a little bit like amateur day. It's like the people that only go out on New Year's Eve. There's all the activity focused and through Black Friday. So even with them playing and us somewhat watching to make sure that we were balanced, I've already given you the result. Now we go into -- we left, we came out hard in the second half of December and we leapt into January with tremendous momentum, then started putting in a series of programs early in the year. And before you can catch your breath and see if they are going to respond to those, I think you won't have to wait later than March-ish for us to put the foot on the pedal again, which is just going to cause a series of meetings this week with all the new wireless CEOs, I think. Let's go ask -- we'll stay on the phone, we got a big queue there. Operator : We'll go next to Michael Rollins with Citi. Michael Rollins - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : The question. Curious if you could talk a little bit how you're proceeding with cost of capacity going forward. John, I think you've put up a blog last night talking about the auction. And as you look at the success you've had in growing customers to date, how do you think about the capacity that you have on your current spectrum position and platform of sight? John J. Legere: Okay. Why don't I let Neville start and maybe Peter in the room. But Neville, this time, don't use your Sprint phone. Neville R. Ray: How is that, John? Is that better? John J. Legere: It's a little better. Good. Keep -- stay on that. That's smart you switched. Neville R. Ray: Just for the record, I'm outside of the U.S. borders, John. So it's not our network, but there we go. No, I think, Brett, to your question, the capacity position we have, and we've talked about this at length. We're in a very good position with the mid-band spectrum portfolio that we have, and we've added to that during the auction. Although AWS-3 spectrum is not going to be in commercial use for some time. When I roll back to, we've combined the 2 most dense networks in the country between Metro and T-Mobile. The spectrum synergies, the site synergies, all of those capabilities are spinning off a lot of capacity that affords us to put the best LTE into the marketplace today, the most capacity and the most speed. The numbers speak for themselves. But, obviously, we're not sitting on our laurels. We have more spectrum to migrate from the Metro business, as I referenced earlier. We continue to work on our network densification over 12,000 DAS modes within business right now, and we continue to push there. Our first small cells' in place. We're pushing my mobile [ph] 2x4 and 4x4, which has significant capacity benefits. And then you look to '16, we're looking to start leveraging unlicensed spectrum with technologies such as license-assisted access. So a lot of capability in the ground for us. On top of that, we're adding 700 MHz this year. And that program moving extremely well, another 10 megahertz of great spectrum coming to bear. So we have a lot of growth ahead of us, but the capability on the network to maintain and support that and, at the same time, deliver that great performance that Mike talked about. John J. Legere: Yes, and I'll just add again. There'll be plenty of forums for us to talk about incentive auctions and Washington policy. And don't get me wrong, I'm not whining and waving the white flag that things won't continue the way they are. There are various forms of ways that we can succeed. What I'm really trying to put a light on for the United States consumer and for Washington itself is this competition that is happening, if you like it, you've got to do things to ensure that it will continue. I would submit to you that most of, if you take Verizon's investment in their network, and I don't know what that thing is they call that whatever it is, that name they gave -- XLTE. It's kind of a -- it's a fancy branding name for, \"We woke up and invested in our network because speeds were slow.\" And in effect, most of those changes are coming because we forced them into it on behalf of the consumer. Now when you go out to these auctions, this low-band spectrum, this is a once-in-a-lifetime activity, there's no more coming. And they control the predominant share, and we just had an auction. And in that auction, if you take the players that are competing right now, that would be AT&T and Verizon, they controlled 93% of what came out when you move aside what this had. So going ahead, if you allow them, they will use one of their weapons, which is economic prowess and the ability to pass that onto customers, as a way to just control the tables. And it's one of those times where, if you look at all of Washington policy and the various auctions that take place, there were a number of things to accomplish. One of them happened. The trust backing up with $45 billion, which is really good for the country. It funds public safety, which was one of the issues. But they have as a goal something that hasn't been accomplished yet, which is to ensure competition continues to exist. And yes, this will play into multiple other policy issues associated with industry structure, et cetera. So I think it's something that the American consumer should watch and understand. And more money into Washington if, in fact, you think about it as nothing more than how much does AT&T pay, maybe they paid $6 per American consumer. And if they turn around and pass it onto them, that's not really the way it should be. So that's that front. No whining, just going to lay it out. Let's get the rules set. And with a good set of rules, we can have this fun competition game in perpetuity. Michael Rollins - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : And if I could just follow up just real quick. John, do you look at DISH as a possible strategic partner or as a competitor? How are you looking at that entity today? John J. Legere: No, I mean, I would add -- I would put DISH in the same category as a lot of potential influencers in the wireless industry. And to the big guys, everybody's a threat, right? Google coming into the business is a threat, soft SIM is a threat, DISH coming in is a threat. To us, they're all great for increasing flexibility and competition. And the interesting part about T-Mobile versus AT&T and Verizon, their thought process on anything they need to do is that they go buy it. We become a standalone adjunct to many other versions of how the United States industry arranges itself for the next phase of competition. So I look at the spectrum portfolio and the video content, et cetera, that DISH has as a fascinating idea to consider. But most interesting is I'm very confident in the fact that, equally, those other players are looking at T-Mobile as a fascinating brand and distribution capability in an innovative group of people that could become a platform to them. So it's an exciting set of options that the company is in a great position playing a portfolio from. So no, I think DISH is a great opportunity, both for the country and for possibly T-Mobile. G. Michael Sievert : I'll just add one last thing John since -- or Michael, since you asked the original question on the cost of incremental capacity. I'd say the answer is for us to put an incremental gigabyte to work, it's a lot less than our 2 major competitors, a lot less. And because our cost of capacity is predicated on the spectrum that we have per customer, which is the superior position to that of AT&T and Verizon. And if this spectrum auction that just finished validated anything, it validated the superior position in mid-band that T-Mobile already had going into the auction with the best portfolio in the industry and by far the best when you adjust for our size. So spectrum per customer continues to be an advantage for us, and that makes the cost of an incremental gigabyte lower for us. John J. Legere: One more on the phone. Operator : And we'll move next to Jonathan Chaplin at New Street Research. Jonathan Chaplin - New Street Research LLP : Two quick questions, if I may. First, John, I'm wondering if you can expand on the comments you just made with respect to MVNOs. It was really in the -- reported in the press that Google has an MVNO with you. I'm not sure how much you can comment on that, but I'd love your -- to get more insight into how you think about MVNOs in general, how you can partner with people like Google and maybe cable companies without undermining your own business. And then on the DISH theme. How open you would be to entering a network sharing agreement with somebody like DISH and how feasible that is for you with your -- with the way that you're network's constructed? And then quickly for Braxton. Your detractors or your competitors would say that in order to get the growth that you're reporting at the moment, you guys are digging deeper and deeper into the subprime base. And we can't see it in the bad debt numbers that you report. My understanding is that you guys just have a different approach to assessing credit, and I'm wondering if you could expand on that a little bit. John J. Legere: You sure that's all? Jonathan Chaplin - New Street Research LLP : That's it. I said it all without taking a breath. John J. Legere: Let's -- let me jump around. I'm going to start by commenting on the last item that Braxton will answer after I go through some of the -- your preliminary questions. But yes, I think you had it right, our competitors/detractors. I -- my first comment is the longer that their answer on our success is fear uncertainty and doubt and financial markets kind of attacks, the better. Because they're really missing the boat, which I've said many times. If I woke up running Verizon or AT&T, I would immediately realize that my issue is with the customer. And with those capabilities, the day they wake up and realize that they just have to realize that they've abandoned their customers, their customers hate them and they're losing them because that's not what they're focused on, they may do well -- better, but this fear, uncertainty and doubt. I gave a stat last quarter that I'd reiterate and -- which is, if you look at all the customers that are porting from Verizon, 93% of them that are postpaid, so not taking, and 77% of them are prime, right? So if -- to those customers that are leaving, somehow you are the prime customer that this industry wants and they think that you're inadequate and they'd love you leaving. So if you're sitting over there, that's how they think about you. It's just not true. And frankly, I think that behavior and thought process open the door, for example, to Smartphone Equality that we announced this week. There's just some things that even we find that are just age-old bureaucratic, power military hierarchy thinking. But when you stop and an individual customers says to you, \"Hey John, Mike, Braxton, I've been your customer for 7 years and I have never not paid my bill.\" And then we do analysis and we realize that variable is a better indicator of future payment capability than anything else, a, because the smartphone may be the most valuable thing in their life. And the fact that they missed a car payment 6 years ago, and one of the rating agencies has them low, doesn't matter. But those guys won't think about it, a, because they don't talk to individual customers and, b, they think of them as credit classes, not as individuals. So that -- I love it, by the way. I hope Fran [ph] has a call after right now and says some highfalutin stuff targeted straight at all the analysts, just -- that'd be fine with me. Back to the beginning question. We have a long-standing historical relationship with Google. We love all of what they're doing. It's highly disruptive. I'm not going to comment at all on anything that may or may not be happening by them or us. And frankly, I'll save my Google rumor bump for another time when we need it more. And on things like network sharing. I think the big questions around now relate to what is DISH going to do with their capability. And frankly, we're open to all versions of it. There's a lot of question underneath that. So far, I would say, most of the analysis on what is Sprint doing and what is DISH doing, they're very spreadsheet oriented. They're not really taking fully into account that underneath this is real execution and integration and creation of capabilities, either for wholesale or retail customers. And it takes an awful lot of capability that, I think, we'll get rational about that. So we'll wait and see. But I see no version of what DISH is doing as not being a positive for us. And we'd be interested in each aspect of it including some sort of a sharing. But obviously, if there's a sharing, somebody has to create it to be able to be shared, which also is opportunity for us. Braxton... Neville R. Ray: John, it's Neville. If I could just jump in. I mean, the last time I looked, I don't think DISH has a network to share. So -- but we have a great one. And we have a great history combining technologies and we have a very clean band plan that allows us to host equipment very rapidly. So great opportunities for us to host somebody else's spectrum for sure. But Charlie [ph] does leave the network at some point in time. It does have build-out requirements. So... John J. Legere: Braxton, do you want to get the last piece? J. Braxton Carter : Yes, John. So I think that you definitely highlighted the bad debt. And the right way to look at bad debt, because we've gone off balance sheet with part of our service receivables, is looking at bad debt plus the loss on the factor. I mean, that's a holistic view and the right way to look at it. And what you've seen is the last 2 quarters sequentially, the actual total dollars have decreased. And that's in the context of a rapidly growing business with more and more customers coming on. And the facts are the facts. Yes, we have some highly sophisticated credit mitigation techniques that we deploy. Over the last 2 years, we've actually tightened credit. We further tightened credit in the fourth quarter. We're very comfortable with the types of customers that we're bringing in. And remember, we're getting the vast majority of our flow from AT&T and Verizon. So I think John covered a lot of other aspects that put the spotlight on this issue. And -- but the facts are the facts. And we're actually having decreasing real dollar, total bad debt and loss on factoring. And that's a prime indicator of what we're doing. John J. Legere: Okay. We're going to jump now. I have to give on Twitter. You see, there's a skill here. As you know, I'm a prolific person on Twitter. But Walt Piecyk has the line of the day, Jonathan. I'm sure it's directed at you. And this is -- Walt's tweet is, \"Too bad, analysts are not limited to 140 characters on quarterly call.\" Well done, Walt. You're the man. Okay. I hesitate to do this, but I'm going to do it anyway. There's a question coming in on SMS. And I'm going to be very brief on it. We can talk about it a lot later. Yes, I kind of wondered where those -- all right, I'll do it then. When do you expect to pass Sprint? And I've been very gracious on this. And as the year ended and people are saying, \"Hey, he predicted he's going to pass Sprint and he didn't.\" Well, we did. That's the gig. Let me give you a little history on this topic. Going into 2013, Sprint had 55 million customers. At the end of sort -- going into '14, they had 55 million customers. Going into this year, they have 55 million customers. In that period, they lost 3.3 million postpaid customers as well. At that same time period, T-Mobile had 33 million customers. We merged with MetroPCS and went to 42 million customers. And we've since added 13 million customers to get up to, guess what, 55 million customers. But a little footnote I think you all should take a look at in Sprint's filings. In Sprint's filings, there's an industry standard that between 60 and 90 days on MVNO customers, if there's no usage or revenue, we all turn them off. Between AT&T and Verizon, it's at a 60- or 90-day. That used to be their policy for Sprint. They actually changed their policy to 6 months. And if you go to their filings right now, there are 1.7 million customers at the end of the year with no usage or revenue greater than 6 months. So do the math. But I decided I'm not going to bring that up today. Because at the run rate that we are talking about, by the next quarter or 2, the math will be easy enough for even Walt to figure out in 140 characters. Okay, let's go back to the phone then. Operator : And we'll go next to Kevin Smithen of Macquarie. Kevin R. Smithen - Macquarie Research : There's been a lot of talk about use of unlicensed spectrum, both by Neville and by Verizon in the last few days. Can you talk about when those chipsets will actually be available? And is there concern over interference from Wi-Fi and other uses on that on those bands? And how much capacity can this really free up for you over the next several years? John J. Legere: Okay. Neville? Neville R. Ray: Yes, thanks for the question, Kevin. Just I'll be brief. I mean, it's a push into unlicensed primarily are our focus. And I think Verizon is on the 5 gigahertz band. There's a lot of spectrum there over 500 megahertz, a lot of it's underused. Or if used at all today, the approach is to be a very good neighbor with any Wi-Fi use that's in the band. And the timing, a lot of momentum in the industry from the chipsets, handsets, infrastructure guys. So we're looking early '16 to potentially have the first commercial products in market. Kevin R. Smithen - Macquarie Research : And you mentioned 12,000 DAS notes today. I mean, kind of think about the use of 5 gigahertz, how many small cells will you need to effectively utilize that spectrum long term? Neville R. Ray: It's tough to predict, Kevin, on those type of numbers. I think the first application that you'll see on 5 gig and LAA will be in building and it will be primarily in building commercial, but potentially consumer, too. The great thing is we will move to outdoor. The performance of LTE in the 5 gig band is significantly better, the radio performance, than what's seen with Wi-Fi. But it's early days to call out numbers, but a great small set opportunity as we move into '16 and '17. John J. Legere: Okay, let's keep on the phone. There's a big backlog. Operator : And we'll go next to Joe Mastrogiovanni at Credit Suisse. Joseph A. Mastrogiovanni - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : A couple, if I could. One, are there any other attractive blocks of 700 A-Block spectrum still available on the secondary market? And then, Braxton, there's a significant level of cash on the balance sheet. Can you just talk about the funding requirements over the next couple of years and your ability to meet those requirements? What do you think is the right leverage for the company? John J. Legere: In -- let me start and ask Peter Ewens to briefly comment on a topic he could probably pontificate on until tomorrow. But Peter? Peter A. Ewens: Yes, so just a brief comment on the A-Block. Look, we're always interested in A-Block. We said we'd be disciplined acquirers. We're going to stick to that. I think -- unfortunately, I think a lot of sellers now are going to have unrealistic value expectations. So we'll just have to watch the secondary market and see. I mean, we're interested in that spectrum. We look to acquire more, but we're only going to do so on valuations that makes sense for us. J. Braxton Carter : Yes. So the second part of the question on funding requirements. Obviously, we showed a great deal of discipline in the AWS-3 auctions with a total spend of $1.77 billion. And looking at our year-end liquidity, we obviously have a lot of firepower on the balance sheet. When we look at our requirements over the next couple of years, I mean, we've made it very clear that looking at perfecting our low band footprint is a priority. And I'll reiterate right now, our long term guidance that we've had since the formation of TMUS is that leverage needs to be in the range of 3x to 4x. We're very focused on our ratings. And you get over 4x levered, you will definitely be in a position for ratings downgrade that is no interest to us whatsoever. Our leverage at the end of 2014 is 3x pro forma. For the final payment to the SEC for AWS-3 is 3.2x. But when you look at our leverage, given the guidance profile that we put out for 2015, we have a very significant opportunity to fund all and more than what we think our needs will be with internal cash generation and debt. There are no plans to do any additional equity. John J. Legere: Okay. Let's keep on the phone. Operator : And we'll go next to Craig Moffett at MoffettNathanson. Craig Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC : I wanted to just sort of come back to this discussion that you've been having on the call today about Wi-Fi and small cells and things. When you made this, the decision to enter into the MVNO agreement with Sprint, our understanding is that it includes some measure of least cost routing and it also has a large Wi-Fi component to it where they're going to be taking traffic, in general, off the network. Can you just talk about how you think about the competitive risk that companies like Republic and FreedomPop and perhaps even Google pose to the economics of the macro cellular network when more of the traffic starts to go over Wi-Fi, and presumably more of the value in the eyes of the customers starts to be associated with Wi-Fi relative to where it is today? John J. Legere: Pete, do you want to start? Peter A. Ewens: Yes, so I'll start. I think you said an MVNO agreement with Sprint. So I don't think we have any. Craig Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC : I'm sorry. I meant to say Google, I'm sorry. Peter A. Ewens: So I just have a couple of comments. So first of all, with respect to Wi-Fi. I mean, we're not running away from Wi-Fi. We're running towards Wi-Fi. I mean, the fact of the matter is a great deal of everyone's traffic today is on Wi-Fi, and yet usage in our cellular network continues to grow by 50%, 60%, 70% per year. So we don't see Wi-Fi per se as a threat, we see Wi-Fi as a natural complement. And Mike can comment on the stuff we do with Un-carrier 7.0 and Wi-Fi Un-leashed, but we're really running towards and embracing it. As to the Wi-Fi-only offerings, they certainly will have a place and we're not against it. And we think for certain customers, it's kind of the equivalent of Lifeline cellular service. It's a -- if it's Wi-Fi-only, it's a modest functionality today. It will improve, but the vast majority of customers want to be able to connect anywhere they are. And so they'll -- although I'll play the role, and we're for -- we're absolutely for competition and proliferation in the market. John J. Legere: I think it shows on how we're different from our competitors, too. I mean, Neville just talked about how we are fully embracing unlicensed LTE as a major opportunity. We think it's a terrific technology. And we made a major deal last year out of Wi-Fi Un-leashed. And as Peter said, we're running towards it. We see some of these emerging players as potential compliments as part of the future and part of what consumers are looking for. If there are congested areas, if there are urban areas and Wi-Fi is there and it has capacity, why shouldn't your phone be able to attach to whatever is providing you with great capacity and great experience to not only conduct your data, but to make great phone calls as well? And we're really the only carrier that thinks this way about solving the problems of the customer, what the customer wants, where is the customer, how can we provide from all kinds of different technologies and resources the thing that solves their problem. And then we'll build our business model around it. And it's just the way we're wired as a company, it makes us very different from our competitors. And I think it's inherent in -- there's a lot of questions that relate to the cable players or to Google. And the questions get a bit specific about what the specific thing is that it sounds like they're launching and what our role is. And I think much broader, as I have been saying for well over 1 year or 2, that we need to think differently about the industry structure around serving the needs of the current wireless customers and the portfolio of what their requirements are. And you need to think about Google or DISH or Comcast or the other players as having ideas evolving that their existing customers want to dabble into areas that intersect with what we have. And as opposed to it being a threat, I think the reality is whatever it is they're envisioning trying to provide their customers, we have a significant greater portion of what that offer is and the relationship with the customers than they do. So it's a perfect opportunity for us to continue positioning this brand, positioning with our customer's innovation and solving their needs and then discuss with some of these other players as opposed to, \"Oh my God, here they come.\" T-Mobile becomes a great example of how they may be able to accelerate their needs and expand ours. So again, looking over 5 years, these are all great opportunities for us to accelerate the momentum and to partner with other people and help solve their issues as opposed to worrying about digging our heels in. Okay, let's see. We're going to take one more on the phone, and then there's 2 I want to do on Twitter. Operator : And we'll go next to Amir Rozwadowski of Barclays. Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Research Division : I was wondering, Neville, actually, if we could talk a bit more about the network improvement strategy here. If we look at the latest reports out of RootMetrics, what we've seen is a stark improvement with your network, particularly in metro areas. How should we think about sort of the overall expansion in terms of being able to build upon that improvement from a nationwide perspective as well as how that can filter into sort of enhancing the brand recognition even beyond what you folks have done so far? John J. Legere: Go ahead, Neville. I think that's a great question for you to cover. Neville R. Ray: Yes, absolutely. So I think, clearly, the Root data is starting to catch up with what we've been telling the marketplace for a year. And so there were some reflection of progress we've made in '13 and '14 in the recent results, but the testing still lags what we've really done over the last 3, 4 months. And in the metros, I mean, the top 30 metros, I mean, the Root data will tell you, I mean, we're just killing it. Nobody is close to us in terms of speed and performance in the top 30 metros. And we're actually winning the lion's share of the overall awards even from Root. I mean, we're a small second -- a minor second place to Verizon, but ahead of AT&T, and clearly well ahead of the Sprint guys. And so I think to your question, Amir, with obviously the expansion of the LTE footprint is our major goal as we move through '15. And to take that metro footprint where we've been really powerful and strong with the depth of LTE, expand that with the 1900- and 700-based LTE into more and more key parts of the U.S. And the geographic footprint expansion I referenced earlier is going to be extremely compelling. The areas where we've already upgraded our 1900 footprint and our 700 roll out in key markets like D.C., Minneapolis, Cleveland, Dallas and Houston, now are benefiting from 700 megahertz. The difference is really being melded. This is a very material game changer for us. We have a lot of 700 to roll out, almost 190 million POPs of licenses in the house today. 75% of that cleared or contracted to be cleared. So it's going to be a big year in terms of seeing that great performance that we've had in the metro areas expand into other key parts of the nation. Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Excellent. And then just a quick follow-up on the prior commentary around the broadcast auction. In terms of funding for being able to support any additional spectrum, acquisition, it sounds like we should think that when that auction comes to fruition, you have sort of funding should be from ongoing cash expectations as well as potential debt funding. Is that the right way to think about things? J. Braxton Carter : Yes, existing -- that is correct, existing cash plus debt. No plans for any additional equity. John J. Legere: Okay. Here is a Twitter question from T. Vola [ph]. With the popularity of Data Stash, do you see the program lasting beyond 2015, 2016 as a permanent? The answer is, yes. It's permanent. And I use this as a chance to reiterate that the Un-carrier moves are attempts to change the wireless industry structurally. It's an attempt to get everybody else to do it, so it's not a matter of wondering if they'll reply. And they're permanent, they're permanent structural moves. That's a commitment we make to customers. It's also something that explains why it bothers our competitors so much, because it's not a special, it's not a program. And by the way, it's not intended to have a short-term impact. As Mike said, one of the big tricks of what we're doing is that the Un-carrier and T-Mobile is all about creating change in a set of benefits and opportunities that are the brand that customers want to come to. And then things like Contract Freedom are a way to solve the barriers to get you to come where you want to be. And that's very different than the industry kind of norm, which is everything is about the special and everything is about the decision factor. And so yes, Data Stash is here to stay. And I think the verdict so far is one follower who didn't quite figure out what the issue was it's trying to be solved but had a cute name and some old patents that they wanted to get out the door, so they did it. So we'll see. But I think they'll all come around. My prediction is it'll take for one of the bigger carriers probably a year to figure it out, a little bit more pain. And so we'll see. But they'll come at some point. Okay. We're going to run out of time. Let's go to the phones one more time. Operator : And we'll go to Colby Synesael at Cowen and Company. Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : Two, if I may. The first one, you talked a lot about front-loading the growth in the year and making a large investment. I was wondering if you could just provide a little more specificity on what that actual investment is? Is it simply just the cost of the promotions or is there something more there? And then also, as it relates to churn, we've obviously seen churn come down over the last year or 2. But it seems to be stabilizing now, at least on a seasonal basis. Is the churn number that we saw roughly in 2014 good proxies for what we should be thinking about for 2015? J. Braxton Carter : Yes. So from an investment standpoint, it's an investment to drive additional growth. The growth certainly comes with acquisition cost. So it's a combination of anything that we do from a promotional standpoint plus additional volume, and that's the appropriate way to look at it. Yes, I'll pass it over to Mike to talk a little bit about the churn dynamics. We're seeing some very favorable trends so far in the first quarter. But with that, I'll hand it over to Mike. G. Michael Sievert : Yes, just picking up on what Neville was talking about on the network transformation, I'll give -- my personal color is I've been associated with the wireless industry since 2002, the beginning of the year, and I've never seen a network transformation like what this team has pulled off over the last 2 years. And '15 will probably even outdo what Neville has done and his team have done over the last 1.5 year. And so we've got huge aspirations for network this year based on utilizing those 700 megahertz assets that were purchased, enrolling LTE to 300 million POPs from where we are. And so we really are optimistic about the continuing evolution on churn to your question. Now when's that benefit start to come in? We're not going to give you a lot of detailed thoughts. But this year, I think you can expect some modest improvement. And -- but in the long term, there's real opportunity for us. And here's the part that's interesting. We don't need it to make good on the promises that we've made to you and to our investors. Our model is based on the churn we've got. Now, again, I think we've got real opportunity. But our business model works at these levels, and that's because our cost structure is radically different than our competitors. What would happen if AT&T and Verizon were sustainably above one, like we saw last quarter? All hell breaks loose in their business models. It's just totally different for us. And we're a different company with a different model. We can make good on these promises and we see real opportunity here. And by the way, 2015 is off to a pretty good start on that metric. John J. Legere: Yes. Last item on that is, I would say, adding to it -- when we set out 3- to 5-year plans 2 years ago or so when we stepped into this. Churn is already better than we anticipated in our conservative assessment, it would be at the end of that period. So we've had a lot of success. So as Mike says, we can operate at these levels. Second is, there'll obviously be a seasonal decline in Q1 on churn that we're already seeing. But there's a very important part that Mike was amplifying. We get all social, et cetera, get all up in arms every time there's one of these Root reports, et cetera, and you can't change the experience that customers are having on a network by putting out a report. Sprint, right now, everybody knows their networks in trouble, and you can't change that with a report. And I speak from experience on this. Is 2 years ago or so, when we had no LTE, we have very carefully individually been working with every customers to raise their expectations as to when they can expect what in their experience with us, and we delivered. So the LTE deployment which are moved to 300 million has been very targeted ahead of plan. This 2G to 4G migration, we are giving customers specific location information as to when they will experience the change. And things like Wi-Fi calling, et cetera, it's just an understanding as to how to migrate that experience. And in the time periods, in the 2 years, and even in the short future where customers don't have the right experience, our track record of how we work with them, to move them off and to work with them as to when they come back is impeccable. So this journey is quite predictable. And as Mike said, each month that goes on, the T-Mobile experience is changing and changing. And I think the biggest scary component for our competitors is the realization 1 year or 1.5 years ago, when it became clear, T-Mobile's goal is to create the best experience on all aspects in the United States over a period of years in 300 million POPs. And then when you get out to, this is back to what I was on the soapbox on, one of the components that our competitors worry about is the only missing link in that vision is the low band spectrum that will come in the auctions. And if you take a number of years in the U.S. and you give nationwide low band spectrum to T-Mobile deployed in the way we can, it's permanent competition. And so that's really where we are. And managing individual customers during the journey is something we've done very well. Okay. I think we might have room for one more question. But then we've got to run and I'm going to go show my bad hair-do on a few TV shows, in case you haven't had enough. Why don't we go to the phone for one last question. Operator : And we'll go to Jonathan Schildkraut of Evercore ISI. Justin Ages - Evercore ISI, Research Division : This is Justin for Jonathan. I was just hoping you could talk about the EIP financings and billings. And whether in 2015, if you see the billings overtaking the financings? J. Braxton Carter : That's a great question. You can see that with penetration of the base now being about 89% on Simple Choice, that there's not a lot of additional significant EIP financing that will go on the balance sheet. Now in the fourth quarter, you saw an increase in EIP financing versus the run rate that we had in the third quarter and the second quarter, and that was really driven by the i Phone 6. So that definitely will moderate throughout the year. And the other part of the equation is the amount of what under classic accounting would be recognized as service revenues is now over $1 billion in the fourth quarter. So yes, the projections are that the billings will overtake new EIP at some point during 2015 with one caveat. If we once again blow away our growth projections and attract significant growth above and beyond what our current guidance is, that inflection point could potentially move out to '16. But it'd be solely a function of growth, and that's a high-class problem to have. Definitely appreciate your question. Okay. So thanks, everyone, for listening in. It's been great talking with you this morning. And we're looking forward to speaking with you again next week during the Deustche Telecom Capital Markets Day in Bonn, Germany. And we appreciate your time. Have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the T-Mobile US Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2014 Conference Call. If you have any further questions, you may contact the Investor Relations or Media Department. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect, and have a pleasant day. J. Braxton Carter : Bye-bye.",

Welcome to the T-Mobile US First Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] This earnings call is being recorded today, April 28, 2015. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Nils Paellmann, Head of Investor Relations for T-Mobile US. Please go ahead, sir. Nils Paellmann : Good morning. Welcome to T-Mobile's first quarter 2015 earnings call. With me today are John Legere, our President and CEO; Braxton Carter, our CFO; and other members of the senior leadership team. Let's get [ph] to the very brief disclaimer here. During this call, we will make projections and statements about the future performance of the company, which are based on current expectations and assumptions. Please consider the risk factors included on our annual report on Form 10-K that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. In addition, we will comment as usual on non-GAAP financial results on this call. You can find the reconciliations between GAAP and these non-GAAP results in our Investor Factbook on the Investor Relations page of our website. Let me now turn it over to John Legere. John Legere : Okay. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Welcome to the first quarter Un-carrier earnings call and our third open Twitter conference. We're providing a live video stream again, so you can actually watch all the action that\u2019s going on here from San Fransicsco if in fact that\u2019s what you feel like doing today. Now we're going to generally go with the same Q&A approach as last quarter. And to accommodate all your questions, we\u2019ve allocated up to 90 minutes, certainly won\u2019t use all that time as in fact it\u2019s not necessarily. We\u2019re going to take questions via Twitter, text as well as the dial in questions that we normally take. But before we go into that and to make it brief we did send the information out. I just want to give you some of the highlights of what was a fantastic quarter for the company. Now we clearly started the year with a bang. 1.8 million total net adds in Q1 and that included 1 million postpaid phone net adds. So I will carefully say that we are very confident that our postpaid results are the best in the industry by a long shot and that we have captured all of the industry postpaid phone growth in the first quarter of 2015 and importantly as I\u2019ve told you before we won\u2019t stop and these results prove that. A significant accomplishment of the quarter was delivering all time low branded postpaid phone churns of 1.3% with the second two months of the quarter actually lower than 1.3%. Now, this is a record low for us. It\u2019s down 17 basis points year-over-year and it demonstrates the real improvements we\u2019ve made at T-Mobile. The Un-carrier is taking hold and it\u2019s giving customers not only a reason to come but a reason to stay and we continue to rapidly improve and expand our network which is a major source of increased customer satisfaction. Sequentially churn decreased 43 basis points and benefited from the moves we made plus particularly industry dynamics as well this quarter. Now, the number one question that I always get is how long can T-Mobile keep tearing up the industry and putting up these types of numbers. And I just want to point that we have a market share by the way of about 16.5% among the big four. Now this is dramatically up from about 11.5% two years ago but we still have a long room to grow. Our share of growth adds or SOGA and our porting stats show that more customers are joining the Un-carrier revolution and our churn number shows that our customers are staying with us longer. So I think those things bode very well for us. In Q1 by the way, our postpaid share of gross adds was an estimated 26.4%, which was up 120 basis points from Q4 within intra quarter high of 28.4%. Now we continue to see our brand winning in the market place and by the way we continue to be aggressive. For the last two years, or eight full quarters our overall porting ratios have been positive. For the last five quarters by the way since Q1 of 2014 they have been positive every month against every carrier no exception. That momentum carries forward into 2015. On a postpaid porting ratio we were 1.93 overall in Q1 which was up from 1.7 in Q4. We improved versus every single one of our peers. And so far in Q2 by the way we\u2019re accelerating further, that\u2019s up to 2.2 overall and versus every competitor it\u2019s up as well. Our fantastic growth is fuelled by two primary drivers, our Un-carrier moves and our data strong 4G LTE network. First, in terms of Un-carrier we made another significant move in the first quarter. We launched Un-carrier 9.0: Business Un-leashed doing for business what we\u2019ve already done for consumers by eliminating pain points and forcing change. Post lunch, weekly retail business sales have more than doubled. We also launched Un-contract which puts an end to price uncertainty and guarantees simple choice customers that their rates won\u2019t go up. And we introduced Carrier Freedom or T-Mobile pay off your outstanding device equipment installment plans or leases when you switch to the Un-carrier. Second, T-Mobile\u2019s blazing 4G LTE network the fastest in the US continues to get better and better. We\u2019re reaching more Americans every day. We ended the first quarter with 275 million POPs of 4G LTE and we plan to expand our network to 300 million 4G LTE POPs by the end of 2015. This will level the coverage playing field with our major competitors. We are quickly deploying wide band LTE already alive in 157 markets and targeting more than 200 markets by year-end. In addition, we are aggressively launching low band 700 megahertz A-Block spectrum now alive in 55 markets. On May 1st our acquisition of MetroPCS reached it two year anniversary. Look at what we\u2019ve accomplished since then. Our prepaid business is nearly three times the size it was prior to the combination with MetroPCS and we\u2019re now the nation\u2019s largest prepaid carrier, and we are making great progress on the MetroPCS integration with the majority well over 92% of the MetroPCS customer base already on the T-Mobile network and 80% of the spectrum already reaffirmed for use on the T-Mobile network. This past week we announced more industry innovation and disruption by partnering with Google on Project Fi. This is going to make people think differently about wireless and I love that. Anything that shakes up the industry status grows [ph] a good thing for both US wireless consumers and T-Mobile. In terms of network, we led the industry on unleasing Wi-Fi last fall. Project Fi lets customers easily access Wi-Fi and cellular networks and there is no doubt that Google and us share a vision that is great for customers. So in summary we\u2019re off to an incredible start to 2015 with the best customer growth in the industry fuelled by disruptive Un-carrier moves and the network that continues to be America\u2019s fastest. We expect to have gained all of the industry\u2019s most valuable branded postpaid phone customers while delivering all time record low branded postpaid churn of 1.3%. And we\u2019re nowhere close to it being done. Now our CFO Braxton Carter will provide you with a quick overview of the key financial highlights and then we\u2019ll get straight to your questions. Braxton. Braxton Carter : Thanks, John and good morning everybody. I\u2019m so excited to be here to again provide financial highlights to another outstanding Un-carrier quarter. Our industry leading growth again translated into strong financial performance. Service revenues were up 9% year-over-year, total revenues were up 13% year-over-year and adjusted EBITDA grew by 28% year-over-year. We are highly confident that these growth metrics will again lead the entire US industry. And it is important to note that we achieved this growth despite the non-cash revenue deferral from Data Stash which reduced adjusted EBITDA by $112 million in the quarter. Sequentially service revenues declined 0.9% but this was due entirely to the impact from Data Stash. Excluding Data Stash, service revenues grew 0.9% sequentially and double digit 11% year-over-year. And customer quality remained strong. Bad debt and factoring expense as a percentage of total revenue declined year-over-year and bad debt expenses excluding factoring also declined in absolute dollars in the fourth quarter. The sequential increase in factoring expenses was primarily the result of a non re-occurring item due to a change in our factoring agreement. Prime flow of EIP receivables remained in line with the overall trends over the last two years. As expected, adjusted EBITDA declined from the fourth quarter but this is due to our stated intention to invest heavily in growth in the first half of 2015 as well as the Data Stash impact. To echo what John said before, we see momentum accelerating into Q2 as we continue to invest in growth. The Data Stash impact will also turn from a headwind in Q1 to a tail wind as the year plays out. We have revised our strong outlook for 2015 by increasing guidance for branded postpaid net adds from a range of $2.2 million to $3.2 million to a new range of $3 to $3 5 million and we are maintaining our adjusted EBITDA guidance of $6.8 billion to $7.2 billion even with the higher customer growth expectations. Cash CapEx is also maintained at $4.4 billion to $4.7 billion. And while we don\u2019t guide on branded postpaid ARPU I think we\u2019ve seen the low as it will increase from here. Excluding the impact from Data Stash ARPU declined slightly sequentially due to our strategic investment in family plans which are an investment very worth making given the higher NPV, greater retention and lower acquisition cost associated with family plans. All other ARPU metrics on ABPU, ARPA and ABPA increased sequentially and year-over-year excluding the impact from Data Stash and that our average billings per account reached a new record high of $145 even including the impact of Data Stash. In addition, our expectation is that earnings per share will be positive for all the remaining quarters and for the full year of 2015. With regard to the second quarter we expect a meaningful recovery in EBITDA compared to the first quarter tempered by the impact of continued strong customer growth. We remain very confident and being able to exceed our full year EBITDA guidance. We\u2019ve delivered strong financial results in Q1 and maintain a strong outlook for 2015. We won\u2019t stop. Rather than go on about such a great quarter let\u2019s get to your questions. You can ask questions via phone, text message or via twitter. We will start with a question on the phone.  Operator, first question, please? Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs Brett Feldman : Was obviously quite strong in the quarter, could you talk a bit about the extent to which you think that was seasonally seeing lower churn across the industry and to what extent you think its structural and any incremental color you can provide around that would be helpful. And then just as an extension of that question, how are you thinking about churn or how were you thinking about churn for the remainder of the year when you updated your net add guidance? Thanks. John Legere : And Brett before you go up, you came in after I think your first sentence. I\u2019m assuming that the entire question was about churn. Brett Feldman : Yes, sorry. John Legere : All right, you want to start Mike. Michael Sievert : Yes, hey Brett this is Mike. Churn hit a record low and what\u2019s more interesting is that the sequential improvement was the biggest in the industry. So everybody had pretty good churn this quarter. But we had the best improvement on a sequential basis. And so, yes there were some industry dynamics but those industry dynamics favored T-Mobile. The truth is people are reacting to both the Un-carrier story and what it delivers them but most importantly this is driven by the radical improvements that we\u2019ve made over the last year in the network. It\u2019s not retric [ph] people are coming to this brand, they are kicking the tires and they are liking what they see and they are staying at record rates, it\u2019s simple as that. John Legere : Brett there is from a standpoint of the company and where we see it going and how things are going since we embarked on this journey. When we initially Braxton and I started giving our five year views for what we thought the company was going to do, you just recall that the churn on the postpaid side back at that point was about 2.5% and it was our plan that we could gradually in successive years get it down to about 2017 is when we thought it would be 1.6 and so we\u2019re running well ahead of that as I think we kind of said and Braxton is going to elaborate. There are some seasonal increases in churn in the second half of the year that you can expect but outside of that I think that the churn changes in the business are somewhat directly co-related to the amazing changes that are taking place in our network and I think those are only going to get better plus the customer care improvements in our company are fantastic and the feedback that we\u2019ve been getting on that front is fantastic as well. So as we start planning the new few years we see these kind of churn levels with some seasonality that there being no reason why we can\u2019t continue to perform this way. Braxton, do you want to comment. Braxton Carter : Yes Brett. I think it\u2019s really one of the true highlights of the quarter in a very, very significant development. And a couple of things I want to add is when we do our cohort analysis on churn the highest churn in a customer\u2019s life is during the first six months of tenure. And we see a steady fall off of churn as that customer matures overtime. And obviously with 8.3 million net additions another outstanding growth quarter in the first quarter we have a fairly young base which means that from a more mature standpoint our churn is actually elevated. John has had the reasons very well incredible network performance amazing innovation from a marketing standpoint. But one of the things that we\u2019re really excited about is with 700 megahertz rollout can do and Neville will talk about the great progress that we are seeing with the rollout of 700 megahertz and a very key part of the business case and the rationale behind that investment was customer retention. So, yes there is some seasonal impact but we think that we have a lot of things going on and especially that one of the best customer service organizations in the industry and that\u2019s really going to help us in the future and continue to effectively retain our customers and that is the holy grail to the economics of the wireless business. Nils Paellmann : Okay, let\u2019s take one more on the phone then I\u2019m going to jump over to twitter and then we\u2019re going to go to the text message. So let\u2019s take the next dial in question, operator. Operator : We\u2019ll take our call from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Simon Flannery : Thanks so much. John you talked about the upside you still have to market share the headroom you have and you recently launched Un-carrier 9.0 around the enterprise. Can you just talk a little bit more about what you see as the opportunity there and if you can share any earlier results since you roll that out? Thanks. John Legere : Yes, the \u2013 first of all Un-carrier 9, I\u2019m sure everybody has gotten a chance to see what it was. I think that\u2019s got incredible upright to the business for a number of reasons which is when I talk about the combined market share that we have across the big four in the wireless spaces, it\u2019s far far, far or less on any aspect of the business side. And the immediate impact of course on small and medium businesses and people going into the retail stores, its\u2019 actually up about 128% in the weeks that followed. So a significant surge and I think on the business side, that kind of flow is not something that can\u2019t get even greater and greater in size and I\u2019ll let Mike comment that in a second, but I think Simon there is some things that excite me significantly about our ability to continue to grow. I only talked about the 16.5% because if the people are starting to think about the sizeable growth and we\u2019ve gone from 33 million customers to 57 million customers in the last two years including Metro coming in. And the porting, postpaid porting ratios are continuing to escalate and from a standpoint of the things that we\u2019ve launched, I have two things to say, we launched 9 Un-carrier moves and yes, 10 is coming very soon to a scared set of carriers near you. But most importantly what we track and Mike tracks very carefully is the awareness level in the United States on all customers and on likely switches of the first nine moves that we\u2019ve done and I can only tell you that the awareness levels of some of our most innovative moves range from 10% to 29%, which means that two thirds of the customers that are out there don\u2019t really know that we have free international data roaming and they don\u2019t know some of the things that are constantly once they understand are major switching move. The components of Un-carrier 9 are absolutely phenomenal. I mean the simplified pricing that\u2019s taking place, the way data is being handled, the tools that we are giving to small business with GoDaddy and Microsoft and then the implications for families on the business family discount it\u2019s a big deal and the thing I can\u2019t measure, but I wish I could is an addition to the 128% flow that\u2019s happening in our stores. What\u2019s happening in the business customer rooms of AT&T and Verizon as their customers are strolling in with T-Mobile\u2019s transparent simplified pricing and asking those scared to debt [ph] business players, hey, can you please explain to me how my 1050 line is $10 a line and includes a gig of data. And I\u2019m pretty sure that these guys have no comment. So that piece I like as well and it\u2019s so far so good, but Mike you want to comment on\u2026 Michael Sievert : Well just that to amplify what John is saying this is really about opening up a new front for us. And the time to do that is when in your main thrust there\u2019 s tons of room left and you think about our 16.5% market share. It shows we have got tons of room left on the consumer side while at the same time plunging ourselves into real competitiveness in the business space. And for those and our maths geniuses 128% growth that\u2019s a doubling of our flow rate which was already well established just in the last two months. So we\u2019re really really pleased with how the worlds responded to this and remember Un-carrier 9 wasn\u2019t just for business, it also included the Un-contract a really innovative new way for people to think about how they can rely on their pricing and their value proposition from us forever and also involved Carrier Freedom a big extension of our contract freedom initiative from last year and that will pay off not just your early termination fee but will pay every penny you owe on your old phone as well. So really, really great contribution to our quarter\u2019s results in Un-carrier 9. John Legere : Hey give me one thing too. You notice on some of the last calls with our competitors they have now decided that porting ratio is not something they want to talk about. It\u2019s like that doesn\u2019t mean anything to us, one thing you notice with us is we\u2019ll talk about all of them. Any variable you are in, and no variable in, in of itself is going to give you the full list, but they are all good leading indicators. Let me give you an explanation why the other carriers don\u2019t want to talk about porting ratios. For Verizon, the Q4 porting with T-Mobile was 1.4 so you get that certainly 1.4 times as many customer came in this direction as the other one. And then of course in Q1 when they were going to get aggressive it went to 1.6. And so far in Q2 it\u2019s 1.8, so the trend is fairly clear. AT&T is interesting, they were 1.8 then they went to 1.85 and so far they are 2.05. And if you\u2019ve been waiting to ask the question as to and I do think it will be interesting to see Sprint\u2019s earnings I think they are doing some interesting things but just from a standpoint of the postpaid porting ratios with Sprint they were 2.2 in Q4, they went to 2.45 in Q1 and they are running 2.75 in Q2. So, so far certainly not worthy of a task for us to understand how to change the trend, so a little\u2026 Simon Flannery : Thanks for all the color. John Legere : Let me go over and take one twitter message because he is tweeting all of us on the side as well and he\u2019s probably periscoping himself while he\u2019s tweeting. But Walt, Walt Piecyk, an avid twitter user and follower has the question and he\u2019s already told us that I shouldn\u2019t answer it which means he wants a detailed technical answer from Neville Ray. Does the plan to expand LTE to 300 million POPs require more 700 megahertz spectrum purchase? Michael Sievert : And maybe Neville, while you\u2019re at it \u2013 that one from Reed [ph] as well, because this is on the same topic from Reed Dear? John Legere : Reed says says, yes, when will new coverage build out kick off and will it be 700 megahertz, its only full LTE, MTS, GSM suite? Neville Ray : So, the immediate answer is, no, we don\u2019t require any more A-Block licenses to reach the 300 million POPs of LTE. And so if I look through the balance of the year tremendous progress through Q1 to 75 million in the books. We\u2019re said, we are targeting 285 mid-year very, very confident on that metric. And to get to the 300 million, it\u2019s a combination of our continued work to modernize our sites with AWS and PCS-based LTE. And building on the great progress we\u2019ve had with 700 megahertz build already this year through the end of the year. This is on existing licenses we own. We\u2019re on an incredible tear. We\u2019ve had great success actually clearing any license encumbrance issues that we have across the vast majority of the markets that we\u2019re targeting for this year, so we have over 80% of the licenses clear and free for us to build and operate within. We have 1000s of sites already construction complete and coming up. The list of markets continues to grow. And so, just as of this morning we lit up and turned on Denver with our A-Block license, so that adds to D.C., Minneapolis, Philly, Dallas, Houston, Detroit, Tampa, San Antonio, Colorado Springs, that list is kind of growing with 700 momentum every day. So, delighted with our progress we have a clear path with the licenses that we cleared to-date to get to the 300 million. We\u2019d love to do more. Performance results are truly exciting. We\u2019re seeing big enhancements on in building coverage, the performance and reach in suburban and rural areas with 700 is spectacular and we\u2019ve got a great handset lineup building, the new Galaxy 6, Samsung 6 that came out, 12 -- band 12 capable and just rocking away on that new 700 spectrum. So we\u2019re making great progress there. The second question about new build, we are building out the sites across markets, many of those in areas where we don\u2019t have 700 megahertz spectrum, that program is already well underway this and there are improvements in multiple markets coming through without 700 build. I\u2019ll stop there. John Legere : Okay. Let\u2019s jump around. Operator, I think we have next questions from Philip Cusick. Operator : From JP Morgan. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. This is Eric in for Phil. CapEx came in a little lower than the run rate. What was the reason for the lower spend, are you guys waiting anything before ramps? And then, with regards to factoring, what should we expect from that going forward? Are you guys looking to factor handsets as well, as well as the service receivable? Braxton Carter : Yes. The CapEx profile is just purely timing. We are again reiterated our guidance for the $4.4 billion to $4.7 billion in cash CapEx spend during 2015, so I wouldn\u2019t read anything into slight dip in Q1 CapEx. On the factoring fronts, there will not be any more service receivable factoring. But we have been transparent in the capital and liquidity section of MD&A that we are in fact exploring securitization of the $4.9 billion net that we\u2019ve invested off of our balance sheets and EIP receivables. And this is something that we continue to take a look at. Of course, structurally we would be looking at something that was very favorable from a cost of capital standpoint in regards to putting say, five, four year bonds out in the marketplace. But just stay tune. Something we\u2019re looking at, but no definitive announcement at this point. John Legere : Okay. I\u2019m going to jump over to the text message, because the first question that\u2019s come in is something that I\u2019ve been seeing on various forms of social media overnight and in the last couple of day. Is it true that users 20gig plus are now being throttle. It\u2019s not prioritization because speeds are hovering around 0.02 speeds. Now couple of things, first of all, I want to make sure you understand those of you that are writing in as well. You are heard, I did read the Reddit trend on this and see what\u2019s going on and I\u2019ve seen it starting to fuel on social media. And I will just tell you that there -- from my observation there are multiple issues being talked about at the same time they have nothing to do with each other and I want to reiterate that on unlimited 4G LTE customers we do not throttle. So that\u2019s the thing that people are hovering around. And I did see the Reddits and the social media definitions about individual customers who happen to be high users, who are showing very low speeds. And one of the things that is being conversed and I\u2019ll give you solution in a second, is that very well publicize only in areas where our network is completely congested for short periods of time, it could seconds, it could be minutes, it could be periods of time where large volumes of people are that the network management practice is how do you clear out he congestion at a time when nobody has speeds. And I think what I\u2019m watching happening is we must have some high volume users who are in congested areas who are looking at their speeds and believing that they are being throttled and putting several items together on the threads. But I want to reiterate, we do not throttle 4G LTE unlimited customers. And what I think we\u2019ve decided to do. I talked with the team this morning is we\u2019ve going to setup some sort of a separate forum, maybe we\u2019ll do a Reddit AMA or we\u2019ll do periscope discussion just too deep dive into this. So we don\u2019t give you a short answer, but those of you that are trying to connect this together and say, hey, its T-Mobile throttling? We\u2019re not throttling. And so, let\u2019s take that off to the side but also make sure you understand that your comments on Reddit. Your comments on Twitter and various forms of email and social media. We are seeing all of them. So I appreciate the question coming in and I know it\u2019s indicative of a question a lot of people have. Okay. Let\u2019s go back to the phone for the next question. Operator : We\u2019ll take Jonathan Chaplin with New Street. Jonathan Chaplin : Thank you very much. I'm wondering if you could give us little more color on the arrangement from Google? So I guess two quick questions. First of all, our understanding is that you can pull a plug on the relationship once they get above a certain threshold of subscribers, and I'm wondering how large that is. And secondly, it seems like Google is going to pour R&D into disruptive technologies, particularly around sort of Wi-Fi to cellular handoffs. And I'm wondering to what extent your agreement with Google gives you access to the sort of the IP that they developed through this process? John Legere : Okay. Well, couple of things and I\u2019ll see if Mike wants to. We\u2019re not going to disclose terms of the agreements with Google, but I would say, the last thing in my mind right now is how to unhook Google. I think this is one of the most exciting thing that\u2019s going on and its great enhancement for us in a very profitable relationship and one that we\u2019re very excited about. And I think it\u2019s quite consistent with our business going forward. But we\u2019re not going to disclose the terms either on how we can extend, expand or exist and/or any of the technology sharing relationship and other things. Michael Sievert : And we certainly are excited about it. I mean, this is a strategic partnership. We\u2019re excited about it really on two fronts and it really goes to your questions. The first one is we expect to make on this. This is something that allows more customers onto our network on terms that are very favorable for T-Mobile. We\u2019re probably more importantly this is something where we get to collaborate deeply with some really smart thinkers and that our whole DNA around change, changing the norms in the industry, bringing about things that are better for customers, tackling a bunch of the important why questions and why not questions that remain in this industry and they\u2019re passionate about that too. And so we get to go look at what\u2019s possible together to implementing these technologies takes work on both sides. And yes, to the premise of your question, if there are things that land on the Google side that turn out to be popular many of those thinks we can bring over and offer on the T-Mobile side as well due to the collaborations. So, we\u2019re really excited about it. We think it will be great for us financially, but as importantly -- we\u2019re of like mind. And this is about disruption and it\u2019s about changing the norms and the standards in the industry and we think it really lines up nicely with who we are. John Legere : I\u2019ve actually said a couple of times as well. Even I see this, there\u2019s a big difference between way our business is structured, the way we think about customers, the way we think about where the industry is headed. And what to most of our competitors is a threat or something they hope to not see coming is something that we embrace and want to enhance. And it\u2019s very clear and this question on Google can go into a broader array of thinking about the future of the industry. And it\u2019s very clear as we all see it that contents and social media and entertainment are all moving to the internet and the internet is all moving to mobile. And so there\u2019s a real synergy between what we\u2019re doing. And I think we think far to simplistically about the four major carriers and what the structure of the industry is going to be without understanding that the tangential players in various industries are touching mobile players in the way that\u2019s going to make the partnerships and the capabilities and the go-to-market approach of us with them and T-Mobile being the most likely obvious candidate to do these things. It\u2019s quite an exciting time and this relationship with Google is just one small aspect. Neville, did you want to say something. Neville Ray : Yes, just a quick comment on the kind of the R&D and especially on the Wi-Fi calling. There\u2019s no doubt we\u2019re the leading company on across the earth really on Wi-Fi calling and you\u2019ve seen how others have embraced our capabilities notably the Apple team with the iPhone 6 launches and T-Mobile the first who enable Wi-Fi calling and transition into voice over LTE environment, which is absolutely the future of this industry. And so I think for the Google folks there\u2019s R&D and capabilities that they are looking to leverage from us as much as the other way, which is great to see. So clearly there\u2019s a Wi-Fi capability on the Google Fi service. At some point in time we can get to where we are with handover into the VoLTE environment, but that\u2019s going to take some of the other folks that they are working with to actually even launch VoLTE and start moving towards to future state of these networks. John Legere : I\u2019m going to jump over to the Twitter feed, then we\u2019ll come back to the phone and then I actually saw Rick Prentiss who got a question coming in on text. So we\u2019ve got things going on. Now first wireless I\u2019m going to have it reader of has a question, this T-Mo not feel any pressure who invest in areas like connected car, Internet of Things that complement the consumer business. I think that\u2019s a consistent question to what I was just saying. Now if you think about a number of adjacent industries and businesses, its heavily likely that our two biggest competitors Dumb and Dumber will continue to attempt to use their balance sheet and they access profitability from their business that we\u2019re competing in to go invest in own and control all aspect of the industry that they feel like they need to compete with, which will therefore annoy and cause all of the other innovators in those space to look at people that they want to work with partner with, invest with, align with or merge with in order to play in that space and its highly, likely that the innovation will come from other than the one big one that Dumb and Dumber buy. And so yes, we don\u2019t feel pressure, but we see ourselves uniquely positioned to be the player that these innovators look to drive their business to mobile customers as well as the large array of retail presence with our brand, but I know Mike, you think about this is lot. Did you want to comment? Michael Sievert : I\u2019ll just say that, the short answer is Internet of Things yes, variables absolutely, connected cars probably not so much, but there\u2019s a lot of areas converging here and we\u2019ve got seeds planted in a number of different areas either alone or with partnership, but I also thing that this quarter\u2019s results are steady in the value of focus. Look we kicked everybody [Indiscernible] on postpaid phones. That\u2019s where \u2013 that\u2019s what our view and I think everybody in the industry understands that\u2019s where the profits are, that\u2019s where the customers are, that\u2019s how we can change the industry. And you\u2019re going to see everybody else trying to find something that points you in their results because we\u2019re taking all of the valuable customers. AT&T is going to point to $10 tablets or somebody is going to point to their low revenue connected cars. I\u2019m quite sure Sprints going to prance around and point at low value prepaid customers as something to points you when we\u2019re rolling up all of the valuable customers in the industry. And as long as everybody is doing that and they\u2019re happy with that. I\u2019ve got to tell you, we\u2019re very happy with that. John Legere : I would like to point out for everybody on the call that we\u2019re 43 minutes into the call and Mike Sievert and I have yet to use any following at this point in time and I\u2019m quite proud of that. Let\u2019s go to the phone for the next call. Operator : We\u2019ll go to Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays. Amir Rozwadowski : Thank you very much. John just wanted to see if we could dissect some of the positive subscriber momentums you folks have experienced. Specifically, you mentioned that you benefited from some prepaid conversions to postpaid, and I believe you gave a number of around 195,000 was the net benefit. If we think about your expectations for continued subscriber momentum, how much of that is predicated from this type of conversion versus around competitive displacement. And from a bigger picture perspective, how should we think about these two pools of subscribers sort of merging, given some of the changes that have occurred to pricing and contracts that you folks have initiated in the market? John Legere : Those are very good question. Let just roll a few pieces together there, right. So, we\u2019ve had eight quarters in a row where we\u2019ve added more than a million net customers to the business. On the postpaid phone side we\u2019ve let the industry totally in five quarters in a row, six of the last seven. Here\u2019s a fun factoid for you. We added more postpaid phone customers this quarter by a factor of three than AT&T has added in the some total of the last two years. So these are trends that are not just one quarter. The migration from prepaid to postpaid. This is something that we embrace tremendously. And this two variables here, I ask the team to talk about this as well, because most of things that we\u2019re seeing is the industry and we may have spent a bit too much time on this black and white between prime and sub-prime and when it relates to what we\u2019re seeing from smartphone owners that were heretofore classified as sub-prime their payment streams on this most important item that they have with some enhancement things like smartphone and quality what we can expect is quite strong. But from a standpoint of the trend and what are the expectations, Mike you want to talk about that. Michael Sievert : If you think about just to amplify what John saying, in this quarter we had the highest migrations from prepaid to postpaid that we\u2019ve seen, certainly our smartphone a quality initiatives which is an initiative to let high value customers into our postpaid side. People with proven payment track record we\u2019re now letting them into our postpaid side, which actually increases the quality of the postpaid base which is quite counter intuitive. But as evidence by the fact that bad debts rates are falling year-over-year and sequentially as a percentage of total revenues, so you can see that whether it\u2019s on the bad debt side or whether it\u2019s a the achieving record churn level even as this dynamic has unfolded, it shows you that the quality of the customers that land at T-Mobile on the postpaid side, not as evidence by their credit ratings but as evidence by their performance with T-Mobile is as good as it\u2019s ever been. Amir Rozwadowski : And then Mike, just to follow up on that comment, if we think about sort of the quality of that subscriber because there have been a lot of questions around sort of the different levels and tiers of subscribers across the industry, how do we think about the marginal benefit of making that transition from a prepaid customer to a postpaid? It does seem like from a brisk perspective from potential churn, you folks have the controls in place to manage that risk, but I'd be interested in terms of the marginal benefit for pulling that type of subscriber on? John Legere : Yes, I start maybe Braxton can add to it, but the way we use is that once we get somebody on the postpaid we\u2019re able to really deepen the relationship with them. We get a better uptake of family plans. We get better uptake of data attach. We get much better uptake on super funds, the devices that have the best retention, partly because that\u2019s the place where people qualify for our device financing and so all those things creates sticky factors with our brand because they delight our customers. We don\u2019t believe in the kinds of sticky factors that are all about tying people down. We believe in the kinds that are about adding value to that customer relationship and our customers are voting with their dollars. This quarter we hit an all time high on average revenues per account as our customers on the postpaid side partly fueled by this dynamic, you\u2019re asking about have deepen their relationship with us. Paying us more than ever before in service revenues on an account basis and when you adjust for Data Stash paying us more than ever before on a total billing spaces as well. And that\u2019s not because we\u2019ve raised our prices. It\u2019s because we\u2019re earning a deeper relationship with our customers. Braxton Carter : I actually love \u2013 I love the genesis of this question, because let\u2019s be candid when we say these questions are being raised what we mean is that big and bigger this is their explanation as to why we\u2019re growing and they\u2019re not. They are taking our low end sub-prime customers. And I have got two things that are very important for me to say to my two friends in the ivory towers. If everybody is happy with the way things are going let\u2019s just keep doing it this way. I can tell you exactly how many quarters it will take before we\u2019re bigger than them completely. Second is, when you change your mind and you go to customers and you change your thought process they won\u2019t listen to you anymore. And what\u2019s fun for me is that Dumb and Dumber are they talk about customers like they are thing. And I know in Verizon\u2019s earnings they\u2019ve refer to we\u2019re not going to chase those low end customers that are price sensitive, and come on these are customers that are choosing to go somewhere else and I know the wireless guy over at AT&T, he actually refer to the customers as these are things we\u2019ve acquired and since we paid money to acquire them we\u2019re going to hold on to them as long as that Reddit continues we win, because customer don\u2019t think or what to behave that way. And at the top of all we do, the Un-carrier revolution is about changing an industry run by those kinds of more on and changing things for the benefit of consumers and it creates brand and that\u2019s the momentum that we\u2019re really into it. The questions around that is so exciting for me, because it means that there are further quarters where they\u2019re going to sit over there and try to protect that fortress and that\u2019s a best news of all after two years of us kick in their [Indiscernible] that will continue be able to keep doing it. Sorry for the rant but I just woke up its early here. Why don\u2019t we try Rick since he was innovative enough to try texting us, question from Rick Prentiss any thoughts about the broadcast incentive options in terms of timing and rules setting? Neville, you want to start and then I will certainly pontificate on this? Neville Ray : Yes. Rick, I\u2019d love to see it as soon as possible I think this is a major event for the industry. It\u2019s probably the last opportunity for many, many years to further level deploying field wireless, low-band spectrum and all the success that we\u2019re driving through with our A-Block low-band spectrum is critical for composition in the industry and today way too much of it, 73%, 74% is in the hands of the big two. And that needs to change. This auction is a vehicle to enable that change. I think the FCC Mr. Wheeler, are very focused on driving that auction to a successful outcome in the first half of 2016 and we love to see that, and we\u2019re excited about more low-band spectrum being release to the U.S. marketplace. Critical for competition as you look out into the future of this industry. John Legere : Yes. I have a few thoughts on this and I won\u2019t spend too much time on it. Couple of things to think about, one is I think what we\u2019ve learned out of Washington in the past year or so is when they set their minds to certain items you can predict that they\u2019re going to happen. I think that the FCC and Chairman, Wheeler are pretty clear that they want this auction to happen early in 2016 and so I have got a belief that based upon track records lately that that\u2019s where we\u2019re headed. Second is with the AWS three auction that took place, a tremendous amounts of money were raised, but one of the objectives of the auctions that was not accomplished is doing the things with spectrum that you need to do to ensure a competitive environment takes place. So that will be pinnacle in this auction, which is why we certainly have rallied around the idea of having a reserve of at least 40 megahertz or 50% of the spectrum and not allowing more than one person to get more than 20 megahertz. And I think with those we plan to be present in the auction. And for me now our team here thinks ahead and we think about the time that Neville not only deploys what we are doing in the 700 we deploy the 300 million POPs but we also get a nationwide swath of low-band 600 and we deploy that. And you look out for three years to five years and you start thinking of the competitive environment and that its better for America and its better for consumers and it makes Verizon and AT&T compete aggressively for their customers. So I think Washington believe that and I think the American population does, so I have to believe that\u2019s going to be the outcome and I think it\u2019s going to be \u2013 it\u2019s going to be a very positive event for the whole industry. So those are our thoughts on the process and we\u2019re going to be driving our business as if that\u2019s going to take place. Neville Ray : Christian asks on that very topic, Christian Princler [ph] on that Twitter. We\u2019re going to see marketing shifts to tell customers about this coverage footprint and all the expansions in Q4 and Q3. And the answer is yes, and in fact you\u2019re going to see us doing something that nobody in the industry has done a lot, which is very favorable comparing ourselves to Verizon. Let\u2019s face it, we are the fastest 4G LTE network in the country. We have more data capacity per customer than AT&T or Verizon and now we have this rapidly unfolding coverage footprint. By the end of the year we\u2019ll compare with anybody. What we did last month was we rolled out the first crowd source maps in the industry. We\u2019re the only ones in the industry putting our data and what actual real customers experiences are on every street corner. So you can see what have real customers experience in that area. And we\u2019ll continue to augment that and make it better and better/ But the idea is about transparency, truth, honesty, showing what the crowd is really experiencing while we undertake the most rapid expansion of network LTE that the industry has ever seen. So you\u2019ll be hearing a lot more from us on this topic. Michael Sievert : And I just -- you watch these non-stop ads that are being placed just do a little ticker and think about the costs of having every second commercial now be one of Dumb and Dumber\u2019s assessments with bicycles, with pieces missing and trying to convince you to never settle et cetera. We\u2019re going to have to reply to that. But here\u2019s what I would suggest you. Right now, nobody argues, it\u2019s very clear, T-Mobile has the fastest 4G LTE network in the U.S. So, we could spend millions of dollars but we don\u2019t on that, why settle for slow, when you can have fast. Secondly, we know everyone knows that Verizon for example is more expensive, they\u2019re more complex, they are less flexible, they are less focused on their customers and they are less likely to adapt to what customers want in the future. Now I can\u2019t tell you the date but there will be a time when T-Mobile coverage will be superior or equal to Verizon then what. We\u2019re faster. We\u2019re bigger. We\u2019re more focused on customers. So that day is coming. I can\u2019t put it on the calendar but it\u2019s coming. And that is why when you see this question on the auction they don\u2019t want any part of that. What commercial could they run? Do business with us because we\u2019re more confusing. We hate -- we hate to more. We\u2019re less complex. We really need your profitability with our 55 points of EBITDA margins, so we can go invest in content. So we can hold you hostage for that too. I mean that\u2019s what\u2019s going on and it\u2019s exciting. Two years into the Un-carrier here\u2019s we are, two years from now. I can only imagine. Let\u2019s go to the phone and I think Craig is the next question. Operator : We\u2019ll take Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson. Craig Moffett : Hi. John, you talked in the past about the benefits of consolidation in the industry. I wonder if you could reflect on the recent developments around Comcast and Time Warner cable, and just does that change your view about the feasibility of the wireless industry being allowed to consolidate? John Legere : Actually let\u2019s that topic, right, because I\u2019m going to add a few words to the sentence I\u2019ve always use. I have always said on consolidation, it\u2019s not a matter of if it\u2019s when and how and now I\u2019m going to add and who, because I think as we think ahead you need to think I still reiterate that in five years we will think it comical that we thought about the industry structure as the four major wireless carriers and as I said before and as Mike says many times as content and entertainment and social are moving to the internet and the internet is moving mobile, these industries, the adjacent industries are in the same game that we\u2019re in. So whether it\u2019s what you see Google doing. What you see the social media companies is doing or as you start to see cable players trying to move content Wi-Fi integration with mobile network et cetera, these are individual customers that are looking at both offer sets. So I think you need to think about the cable industry and players like us as not competitors but potential partners and alternatives for each other in the future. So I think once you broaden the definition of things and I think in my mind the fixed wire and home broadband industry is the one that was of a concern there, but when you start to broaden the definition as I said of content and entertainment and video going to customers on fixed and mobile devices together and you start thinking of that industry is a far more broad set of potential partnerships integrations and mergers that the United States could be looking at and in that case I think you will see consolidation of a much broader set. Okay. Let\u2019s got to the one more in the phone and then we\u2019ll jump over to Twitter. Operator : We\u2019ll take John Hodulik with UBS. John Hodulik : Okay. Great. Thanks. John, just a follow-up to some of your comments, it does seem like the number of new promotions in the industry is starting to slow here in early 2015, just as some bigger carriers are talking about being more price disciplined. Is that what you view as really driving the subscriber momentum you have and some of the reporting ratios and you expected to help as we move through 2015? And then maybe for Braxton, just looking at the financials, cash flow from operations is a bit weaker than we thought here in the first quarter. Could you talk a little bit about what was driving that? Was it timing differences in the working capital or some more color on that would be great? Thanks. John Legere : Yes. Let me start and throw to Mike. I don\u2019t care what they do. The amount of promotions which are usually reactive temporary attempts to stem their erosion versus us, our plans of what we do and how we rollout Un-carrier moves and promotions is agnostic to whether they do anything or not. And our pace is not going to slow down. Our focus on the customers will not slow down. We have multiple Un-carrier moves continuing to come. And frankly this could just be some of competitive strategy 101 [ph] that learned 25 years ago in school and then just protecting themselves and trying to assess whether for their own greedy profitability its cheaper to seed a few share points than to price their whole base down. But our focus has been on our customers and our brand and our momentum and with eight quarters in a row of reporting positively against the industry whether they are in a promotional period or not we\u2019re continuing to grow, our brand is continuing to grow and frankly I don\u2019t think it matters what they do over the next quarter or two. However, I tend to like to the idea of them laying down and if they want to continue to do that, it would be well appreciated. Michael Sievert : Here are some numbers just underscore what John saying, just to prove the point. Look at the fourth quarter, everybody says, this was a quarter of hyper switching and serious competitiveness, everybody put everything in. We delivered a 1 million postpaid phone net adds. Q1 was a period everybody said, oh, it\u2019s pretty quiet. There wasn\u2019t much switching. Churn is down for all the carriers. Maybe people were taking a breath. We delivered a 1 million postpaid phone net adds. We delivered a 1 million in both quarters sequentially in completely different environment and it really shows you what John saying is the case. We\u2019re executing our game plan. Our game plans working. Customers love this value proposition and we\u2019re completely uninterested in the promotions of our competitors. Neville Ray : And your question on operating free cash, John, I think the shaping of that was as expected. With an investment in growth upfront in the year which has a benefit of paying for itself in Europe from an EBITDA standpoint. We expect that there will be a decline in EBITDA and certainly guided to that on our yearend earnings call. I think one of the bright points here is when you look at the major item that\u2019s been affecting working capital which is our investment in EIP, net investment of $4.9 billion at the end of the first quarter that growth in EIP significantly moderated from the fourth quarter. We did $1.4 billion in growth EIP new receivables, but our billings on existing EIP receivables offset all but $150 million of the investment which was a very significant moderation. And I\u2019ll reiterate on a fully levered operating free cash flow basis T-Mobile US will be a net generator of cash in 2015 and it gets very exciting when we look at the growth benefit in our cash flows when we go out the outer years. John Legere : Just stay tune, don\u2019t get confuse as to what is an aggressive offer or customer proposition that shows that competitors are finally waking up and serving customers. I mean, two weeks after or one week after Verizon said they are not going to chase low end customers. They came out with an offer and let me tell you what the offer was. It was the creation of mid-tier data bucket, which is nothing other than the insertion of something that will spin the cycle back to tricking customers into buying data buckets that are small than the ones that they had before so they can charge them overages when they exceed those data buckets. So it\u2019s going to be highly ineffective, but it still isn\u2019t a stopping and a listening to customer and providing them what they want and I particularly celebrated AT&T earnings, the summary of which is high, we\u2019re one of the biggest companies in the world, we\u2019re going to raise the synergies on our direct TV process then we\u2019re going to close at this quarter, any questions. Which for me is not exactly what American Wireless consumers wanted to hear from them and the focus on those guys. Did you see on the Twitter, anybody got what they want to take? One of the top ones is SMS. It\u2019s a very outdated method of communication, any plans on T-Mo\u2019s part to implement a newer form over the top communication. Yes, absolutely. I\u2019m not going to tell you what and when though, but as sooner that you might think. Some that came in on text which is for John. A marriage of two [Indiscernible] networks, why no partnership with cable? They can use your network for their wireless offering. You could use their network to deploy small cells et cetera. This is again I won\u2019t get into this specific of it, but I think I am quite consistent on what I just said. These are the kind of things. If it\u2019s something intuitively obvious with the integration of technology of the ability to interface with customers is going to provide a better capability to customers. The market will find those alternatives and that is why I\u2019ve been consistent since day one. These are not -- adjacent industries are not threat. They are just partnerships for integrations waiting to happen. So yes, you\u2019re absolutely right, bring it on. We\u2019re going to the phone. And I\u2019m going to give a little warning here. We have more time. We\u2019ll take the questions. But at about six minutes, I\u2019ve got to go because I\u2019m going to be on CMBC in like 22 minutes or so and we\u2019ve calculated how long I have to get over this. So let\u2019s go to the phone and at some point if I disappear I\u2019ll announce it and then the team can continue. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Michael Rollins with Citigroup. Michael Rollins : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I'm wondering if you can discuss a little bit more about the integration with MetroPCS? In terms of what cost savings you've been able to generate to-date and how you think about the flow of those savings and maybe some metrics we should be watching over in the future? Thanks. John Legere : I don\u2019t know which one you guys want to talk about and I appreciate you bringing it up, because it is one of the most amazing stories of what we have. It bodes well if we need to do further mergers and integrations in the beginning. I want to start by saying we have 16.4 million prepaid customers now and we are by far the biggest prepaid business and we\u2019re three times bigger than we were before they came in. And I think maybe you guys can just pick up on the exactly where we have with how many customers are left to move off of CDMA on to our network and what these savings are and what they are look like in the future. Braxton Carter : Yes. I think definitely textbook execution, the whole strategy of migration of this space over to the T-Mobile network. But we are really at the very tail end of that. We disclosed today that we now have less than 500,000 customers utilizing the T-Mobile \u2013 utilizing the old legacy MetroPCS CDMA network, which means that we\u2019re getting very, very close to shutting down the three major remaining markets from a CDMA network standpoint. What we said is, we still expect that to happen in this second half of this year. We believe that we\u2019ll be in a much better position to give you a precise dates in connection with the second quarter earnings call. But these larger markets will take some time to decommission. And Mike that we\u2019ve had discussions about really not being able to account for the realization of the synergies until those sites in these shutdown markets are completely decommission which is anywhere from a three to five months periods. So, we expect that we\u2019ll achieve very good timing on that, but the full run rate of those synergies will not occur until 2016 at which point we\u2019ll be at a 1.5 billion run rate. And that I think bodes very, very well when you\u2019re looking at the EBITDA progression along with the growth that we\u2019re putting on in the current year to what we\u2019ll see what EBITDA for 2016. Neville, do you want to add anything? Neville Ray : Yes. The one thing I\u2019d add on top I mean, we \u2013 the program is so ahead of schedule it\u2019s incredible. The progress has been truly amazing and we\u2019ve so successfully grown the Metro brand throughout this in new markets in the prior metro market situation. The piece that\u2019s usually exciting for me is the spectrum story. And as Braxton reference, there\u2019s a small, very small number of customers left on CDMA and that\u2019s supported us this opportunity to ahead of the synergy and run rate savings coming through from decommissioning of the network. We\u2019ve been able to move the spectrum across to LTE and through really fuel and drive this wideband LTE story that you heard, John reference in the opening comments. So, we\u2019re adding more and more spectrum. Pretty much every quarter has gone by we\u2019ve added more and more spectrum to our LTE offering and that continues through this year and that\u2019s been a huge benefit for our customers that supported our fastest LTE position. That\u2019s a five quarters in a row now who would have believe that five quarters in a row T-Mobile feeding the likes of Verizon on LTE the best fastest performing LTE. And a big part of that success has come through our ability to secure early access to MetroPCS spectrum. So, that\u2019s a big, big part of the success story, we look forward to the decommissioning moving a pace and great cost savings and synergy savings hitting that full ramp as Braxton said in 2016. Braxton Carter : And hats off to the MetroPCS team. We\u2019ve done this migration with very, very minimal impact to the MetroPCS customer base and you can see that reflected in the overall churn metrics on prepaid. So we\u2019re very, very pleased. The team has done an amazing job. And I think the vision that was led out with the original merger of these two companies you\u2019re seeing that totaling come to fruition, so very, very exciting. Michael Sievert : Braxton on Twitter, there's a question that we haven't gotten to yet, which is from [Indiscernible] around, can you comment on the impact of Data Stash on net income, EBITDA, ARPU et cetera and maybe you could give us a little bit of a overview on this. Because even with all that folded in we had record, we think industry best year-over-year EBITDA even with that extra temporary, artificial pressure built in we had ARPA at its highest levels ever, but there is still an impact from it that was short term and non-cash maybe you could talk about the size of that? Braxton Carter : It\u2019s a great question. I really appreciate you highlighting that. So with Data Stash we gave existing customers a 10 gigabyte gift of data throughout year and that\u2019s the way that we do things. We never rollout a new program or we don\u2019t consider the base. I mean, that\u2019s one of the key tenants and foundational principles that we have with Un-carrier. And from an accounting standpoint when you give that type of offer to a base, you have to allocate part of the revenue that you\u2019re receiving from those customers on to this new piece of the offering that you have in the marketplace. So, what that meant is in the first quarter we had a $112 million non-cash revenue deferral that impacted EBITDA. It hit the top line fell down to EBITDA and that was completely a non-cash timing issue. As our customers utilize the 10 gigabyte gift throughout the year and it does expire at the end of the year that $112 million will fully reverse during the year and there will be zero impact on EBITDA and that income for what we\u2019ve done through the year. And I think that\u2019s important to note because when you look at all of these metrics on service revenue on the face of it had a slight decline but you normalize for this non-cash accounting item we actually had about a 1% increase in the sequential service revenues and that applies to all of the metrics that we put out. The average billing per user, the ARPU of two-thirds, the decrease of the APRU were directly related to the Data Stash 10 gigabyte gift. So that\u2019s really how it works. Nothing to be alarmed about but what is a little bit of a headwind in Q1 will turn into a tailwind and its part of the shaping that we expect to the year. And again, I said we\u2019re highly confident that we\u2019ll deliver on EBITDA and all aspects of our guidance of not exceed them. John Legere : That kind of helps people understand the shape of the year, right, because if you think about EBITDA at the center point of our guidance is 25% year-over-year growth and in the first quarter we delivered 27.6%, so we\u2019re already ahead. But that\u2019s with this rather artificial non-cash timing oriented Data Stash accrual that we put in. If you look at our operational results and you put that a $112 million on top operationally we were really 37% year-over-year improved in EBITDA showing that we\u2019re well on our way to that 25% and then with push in midpoint on the year. And so the shape of the year is that it\u2019s lower and then it builds throughout the year and as Braxton\u2019s says, we remain very confident and the guidance that we gave. Braxton, you want to go on the phone for another one. Braxton Carter : Yes. Let\u2019s do that. Let\u2019s take Mike McCormack Mike McCormack : Couple of things, Braxton on ARPU, you outline as sort of Data Stash reversal and clearly looking at and up into the right functions throughout the year I assume and granted 4Q 10,000 pressures perhaps from new promotional activities, but is it out of the question to think about handset ARPU going positive on a year-over-year basis in 4Q. And then maybe just one with respect to the EIP payouts its early days, but what\u2019s been the reaction by consumers that offering? Braxton Carter : Yes. Really good question. So, when you look at the shaping of ARPU from Q4 to Q1, there was a 3.8% decrease, but when you normalize for the non-cash Data Stash impact that we just discuss ARPU would have decreased to 1.2% and what that 1.2% relates to is our investments in family plans. AT&T and Verizon have a very high percentage of their base in family plans. We all know that there is higher customer retention with family plans, where our acquisition cost, higher MPV, so we\u2019ve made a conscious decision by pulsing promotions in the marketplace since specifically the four for 100 that we did in the late Q4 and continue throughout Q1 and had some ARPU dilutions but when we\u2019re looking at the value creations and the MPV of the customers that we\u2019re bringing in it\u2019s a trade off well worth making. The family plan promotions at this point have been promotional. We\u2019re not going to talk about some of the future innovations that we have plan, but I think Un-carrier 10 coming soon, we\u2019re excited about that as well as other innovations throughout the year I think one of the challenges we have as a management is with the innovation and things we are bringing into marketplace how can we continue to target these family units coming out Verizon, AT&T with a little bit of ARPU dilution, although it makes a lot of sense, but offset that dilution which has been fairly minor with other innovations that we bring in the marketplace and this is something that the team is certainly interested in. From an EIP standpoint we are now at 91% of our base. It is eligible to take, to really utilize the EIP construct. But as we control it by overall credit profile and that\u2019s what I think is one of the really cool innovations that we put in the market place by having well qualified customer who pay this onetime for every month for a year can now take advantage of a full EIP construct and all the cohort analysis that we\u2019ve done on this shows that they act exactly like a prime customer. And the earlier results have definitely bored us out. From a Collection standpoint you are seeing very favorable trends from an overall bad debt and we look at it holistically. We take off our bad debt, factor in the losses on factoring. And on an absolute dollar basis when you adjust for the factoring change in our agreement in the first quarter which we have disclosed you are actually seeing improvements in the overall bad debt profile for three quarters in a row. And I think that\u2019s very, very significant, but it goes hand in hand with churn. When you look at the churn progress, look at the retention of the customers our value proposition our network is resonating, so we are very pleased with what we are seeing. But when you combine EIP with [Indiscernible] you have I think some very interesting dynamics and that remember was our Un-carrier 2 offering and what it did is it really freed everybody from the old paradigm and our expectation is the majority of customers will actually jump before they get their EIP paid off. And we\u2019re seeing that with some of the older EIPs at this point. I think a lot of it will be driven by new, significant generation handset launches. I mean the iPhone 6 certainly was a very significant in the fourth quarter. But the GS 6 the other things that we are seeing a lot of interest in jumping up to these new platforms. Michael Sievert : And that\u2019s one of the reasons why the churn profile is so much smoother than it was under the old contract model where you had these really spiky periods of churn laid in contract tenure while people had pent up demand to go do something differently. Our customers don\u2019t experience that. The vast majority of people with EIP also have jump which gives them the Freedom to start over at any time on a new device and it really smoothes things out because it serves their needs. I think like you ask specifically about the EIP pay off program too. Mike McCormack : Yes and just from an inbound perspective what you guys are seeing? John Legere : Yes, it\u2019s been really popular. It\u2019s a natural extension of contract freedom that we launched last year. We\u2019re calling it Carrier Freedom because now we\u2019ll pay off the ETF or and/or the device. I would just say it\u2019s been popular and it\u2019s been slight in early going. It\u2019s been slightly less expensive to us than we had anticipated. Typical our cost in the $100 to $150 range so far a little less than we had modeled. So if its\u2019 popular and a slightly less costly then we have thought so far so good. Mike McCormack : Hey Braxton, if I can just maybe \u2013 on the cash flow comment you said net cash generation 2015, is that predicated on equipment factoring or is that a totally different discussion? Braxton Carter : Yes I think anything that we do on EIP factoring would just be enhancing to that profile. Analyst Okay, great. Thank you guys. John Legere : There\u2019s one on text that says Neville if Sprint sold some of that 2.5 gig spectrum would you be interested in buying it, would it be a good solution for dense markets? Neville Ray : The fun question I think you kind of have to ask Sprint first what they are doing with their 2.5 gig spectrum. And I think there\u2019s been a series of uncertain headlines in terms of what will happen there. I still say where\u2019s the spark I suppose is my comment, but if at some point in time they figure that stuff out and they decide that they have more than they need and they look to move into a sell process of course we\u2019d look at it. 2.5 gig is \u2013it does suffer with propagation and in building penetration I mean it\u2019s not the best spot on the spectrum map but kind of work in intension [ph] of environments relatively well. So I think you kind of have to ask the question of Sprint what is their plan and the network strategy, what do they plan to do with 2.5 outside of that they are pretty light on other spectrum and you can see that in terms of the LTE performance they have today, probably the slowest in the nation by a big distance. So we\u2019ll wait and see and once I sold themselves out with the 2.5 gig strategy we\u2019ll see if they push any of this to market. John Legere : And we have a great spectrum portfolio. That\u2019s allowed us to be smart and opportunistic in how we enhance it. So we were very smart and how we brought in the 700. We were very smart and how we handled the AWS auction last year, opportunistically bringing in spectrum at a fair price and we would be smart and opportunistic if the spectrum that comes to market that we can get to extend our customer experience at a fair price then we are always interested. Michael Sievert : I think the only other thing I\u2019d add is that with opportunities in and our license to specially with license assisted access in LTE so this is 5 gig spectrum that\u2019s going to be a real opportunity in 2016. We are aggressively trailing solutions and we are confident we can bring their services to market next year. And that again is kind of a then [Indiscernible] application set, it sells with LAA leveraging 5 gig on license. So there are going to be a series of alternatives that the surface that we are working very hard on to assist in kind of the urban capacity and 2.5 gig is by no means the only path or option. There\u2019s also a 3.5 gig spectrum option and process which is moving through the FCC right now, so some good activity in that area. Neville Ray : Okay, we\u2019ll take our final question on the phone Paul from Bernstein. Paul: Great, thank you. I had two questions, the first is you are the first carrier to complete the transition of your base the EIP and I was wondering if there is anything that surprised you operationally or financially about serving a base that\u2019s all on EIP as opposed to the traditional contracts? And then the second question is with regard to tablets. I think you guys are probably still under penetrated compared to TNBC [ph] to tablets. And I was wondering sort of why you think that is and whether we should think of that as a source of growth going forward? John Legere : We just we could all jump in. On the first piece I think we just got it a second ago. With phone payment plans and jump the customer is much of a participant in their choices with us. There is way more transparency and what they are paying for and what they get for what they are paying, and so satisfaction is a little bit higher. People like this construct a lot more than they like contracts. And they have a lot more freedom of movement because with jump they can move to the new device at any time, at virtually anytime. So what that does is it smoothes out as I said before the churn curve which is great, it makes it more predictable and we are serving the customer in a better way and I think that\u2019s one of the dynamics at play. Michael Sievert : And on that [Indiscernible] transparency on the true cost and value of that phone, we\u2019ve actually seen people keeping their phones longer than we had anticipated in the initial business case. And I think that\u2019s very, very healthy for the industry. When everything was buried into a contract, no visibility phone were viewed more as disposable items and I think there is no more of a true consumer appreciation for the value of handsets in the marketplace and I think that\u2019s very, very healthy for the industry. And your second question was related to tablets. John Legere : Yes, I think our results show that we\u2019re really focused on the best customers in the industry. And what we find is when we have a finite set of marketing and distribution dollars to invest in our growth we want to be investing in the things that get the very best returns for our shareholders and satisfy the most possible customers. And that\u2019s why we\u2019ve been going after the postpaid smartphone business. We\u2019ve managed to extend the industry leading prepaid business even despite a massive, we think irrational competitive onslaught. We think Sprint will be prancing around bragging about prepaid results that they probably weren\u2019t able to economically acquire and we think the big guys faced with major losses on postpaid phones have been forced into the lower return tablet business, either $10 a month customers they are investing massive amounts to get these $10 a month customers just to be able to demonstrate that they can get points on the scoreboard. We\u2019ve been extending our tablet business every quarter systematically, methodically, extending our base, serving more and more customers and we think that\u2019s the way to do it. Generally around seasonal times we come in with a short term offer or sale around holidays and then the rest of the quarter we have a great value proposition on tablets. Our customers can add tablets to their plans for $10 a month but unlike the other guys we are charging $10 and giving you the gig included. The other guys charge $10 a month just to give you access to the data you\u2019ve already paid for which is on top of everything else slightly absurd. Paul: Great. Thank you very much. Braxton Carter : Okay, well we want to thank everybody for dialing in, for the twitter questions, for the text message questions. We are looking forward to the second quarter and being back with you in three months. Thanks for your time today and have a good one [ph] Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the T-Mobile US first quarter 2015 conference call.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Nils Paellmann, Head of Investor Relations for T-Mobile U.S. Please go ahead, sir. Nils Paellmann - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you. Welcome to T-Mobile's second quarter 2015 earnings call. With me today are John Legere, our President and CEO; Braxton Carter, our CFO; and other members of the senior leadership team. Let me briefly read the disclaimer. During this call, we make projections and statements about the future performance of the company, which are based on current expectations and assumptions on Form 10-K includes risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Reconciliations between GAAP and the non-GAAP results we discuss in this call can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website. Let me now turn it over to John. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us and Roger, we already have your message that you don't upgrade that next quarter. But welcome to second quarter Un-carrier earnings call as well as open Twitter conference. And once again, we're also providing a live video stream. So, you can watch all the action here in Seattle, if I just had to remind both Braxton and Mike they were on camera, because of the things that they were doing here on the side. We're generally going to go with the same Q&A approach \u2013 sorry, my mic wasn't on. So, just assume all the things I said before this were humorous and helpful. We'll generally go in the same Q&A approach as last quarter. And to accommodate your questions, the call will last and I say this up to 90 minutes. We certainly won't keep you that long and left there is a burning desire for asking questions. We'll take the questions on Twitter, text, and on the phone, so whichever style works for you. So as you probably know, the mood is good here because we had a fantastic quarter. And before I get into the Q2 results, I just want to share a little bit of an update over the past few weeks. We spent the summer making our signature moves even better with Un-carrier Amped. Our Un-carrier moves, I'm quite sure are already the best in the industry, but we always listen in any form of talking to our customers, so we always take action. Now, that's our philosophy, we never launch something in just forget it. We always listen, how to make things better and we decided to go forward and do it this summer. Now, starting on June 25, and in rapid succession, we launched, we launched one a JUMP! On Demand. Get the phone you want, when you want it at no extra cost. And this includes the industry's lowest monthly cost to get an iPhone 6, when you trade in a smartphone. Then we announced Mobile without Borders, extending coverage and calling to Mexico and Canada at no extra charge. So, now you get all of North America that's three countries of the price of one. And then an amazing family plan, 10 GB for All, where each and every family member on a four line gets 10 gigs of 4G LTE data per person, no sharing required just $30 a line. Now, just a couple of days ago, we amped up things with Apple. First, we amped up Un-carrier 6.0 just Music Freedom and added Apple music to our list of streaming music solutions. Now Music Freedom covers 95% of all streaming music in the U.S. with 33 services live at this point. Second, we've Amped up the industry's best iPhone offer and made it even better. You now get an iPhone 6 or 6 Plus with JUMP! On Demand if you do it by Labor Day and you can lock in monthly price on the next iPhone and get priority access when you buy your new iPhone, which is a big deal. So, it's kind of busy few weeks. We spent the summer giving more to T-Mobile customers, while as usual, our customers spent the summer doing the opposite. It's actually kind of depressing to watch them box in customers as they struggle to react to the Un-carrier revolution. Whether it's Verizon launching a totally lame discount on long distance to Mexico and Canada as their attempt to reach Mobile without Borders, or AT&T adding back a $15 activation fee for Next. Frankly, they almost make my job too easy and I appreciate that from them, keep it up. So not surprisingly, as the carriers punish their customers, those customers are fleeing to T-Mobile. Since we released our customer numbers, two of our competitors have announced their quarterly results, not surprisingly, it appears that we captured all of the industry's postpaid phone growth once again. With 760,000 branded postpaid phone net adds, we knocked it out of the park. Verizon was a distant second so far, we beat them just by a little or actually we beat them by 400,000 net adds, despite the fact that they tried hard to stem their losses with their geese commercial and some high porting bounties, and we can talk more about that in Q&A. And the distance between us and AT&T in terms of postpaid phone net adds, it was almost 1.1 million this quarter. Overall, we had 2.1 million total net adds in Q2 and one million branded postpaid net adds. Now, in four of the last six quarters, we've had over two million net adds, and it's the ninth consecutive quarter with over a million. In five of those, we had more than one million total branded postpaid nets and Q2 was the fourth quarter in a row with over one million branded postpaid net adds. We're winning customers now interestingly, we're keeping them, customers are staying; in fact, branded postpaid phone churn reminded at our record low level of 1.3%, down 16 basis points year-over-year. Our momentum continues going into the third quarter and it continues with positive porting against all of our competitors. We've had nine quarters in a row with overall positive postpaid porting ratios, and Q2 also marks the eighth consecutive quarter where postpaid porting ratios versus Sprint were greater than two to one. Customers are coming to the Un-carrier in droves and we're delivering strong, sustainable results. The results speak for themselves. Now, let's talk about the rapid expansion of the nation's faster 4G LTE network, which now reaches nearly 290 million people. We are ahead of our schedule to reach our year-end target of 300 million, we now cover 212 market areas with Wideband LTE and we're on track to be in more than 250 market areas by the end of the year. We're also way ahead of schedule on the deployment of low band 700 megahertz A-Block spectrum, which is already rolled out in 141 market areas with many big markets including New York and L.A. coming in the second half of 2015. Essentially, all markets with the 700 megahertz A-Block spectrum have now been cleared or have a path way to be cleared; again, well ahead of our earlier expectations. Now let me talk about MetroPCS, it's been less than 28 months since we joined forces with Metro and I'm pleased to announce that our network transition is complete. We've now reformed a 100% of the MetroPCS CDMA spectrum finishing the customer and network migration 2.5 years ahead of the original schedule. If you look at our competitors, it has taken others more than a decade to achieve what we accomplished in just two short years. Obviously, this sets us up to realize full network synergies with MetroPCS by early next year. And finally, some breaking news that just came out this morning that we're very, very proud of. T-Mobile is back on top in customer service with J.D. Power ranking T-Mobile number one in Wireless Customer Care. Congratulations to our customer service team who busted their butts to treat our customers well, and their problems every single day. We're rewriting the rules in the wireless industry and our Q2 results show the effects. Our results are rock solid all around both operational and financial. We've been very busy. But, we have no intention of slowing down either. Now, our CFO, Braxton Carter will provide you a quick overview of the key financial results. And then, we'll get to your questions. Braxton? J. Braxton Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP : Hey, thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Let me give you a quick snapshot of our financial results. But first, let me say that the thesis of turning T-Mobile into a growth platform, resulting in double-digit revenue growth translating the strong EBITDA and cash flow is certainly playing out as demonstrated in the second quarter. In the second quarter, we delivered industry leading growth across the board. Service revenues grew by 12%, while total revenues were up 14% year-over-year. And even with this incredible growth, adjusted EBITDA came in ahead of expectations at $1.8 billion, up 25% year-over-year and 31% sequentially. The adjusted EBITDA margin expanded from 26% in the second quarter of last year to 30% this year. Net income and earnings per share also came in strong with earnings per share of $0.42 in the second quarter, up from a loss of $0.09 in the first quarter. And as we previously stated, we'll be solidly profitable for the full-year 2015 in all remaining quarters. Based on these great results, we are increasing our postpaid net adds guidance to a range of 3.4 million to 3.9 million, while maintaining our adjusted EBITDA guidance of $6.8 billion to $7.2 billion and our cash CapEx guidance of $4.4 billion to $4.7 billion. To be very clear, our financial guidance excludes any benefit from the impact of JUMP! On Demand as it is too early to quantify this benefit. We intend to disclose the aggregate non-cash impact from JUMP! On Demand and Data Stash in future quarters. There was no significant impact on our financial results from JUMP! On Demand or Data Stash in the second quarter. In summary, we've delivered all around very strong financial results in the second quarter and maintain a very aggressive outlook for 2015. We won't stop. Now, let's get to your questions. You can ask questions via phone, text message, or via Twitter. We'll start with the question on the phone. Operator, first question please? Operator : And we'll go to Mike McCormack with Jefferies. Please go ahead, sir. Michael L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC : Great, thanks. And Braxton, I certainly appreciate the disclosure on the leasing impact, and also the true definition of free cash flow. So, much appreciated on that. I guess, on the first question, thinking about handset postpaid ARPU, you guys are making really good progression there. Just trying to get a sense for your thoughts on the back half, particularly as we have continued Data Stash reversal maybe in the fourth quarter more heavily, against fourth quarter potential promotions? And how we should be thinking about that progression of improvement in the year-over-year declines? And then the second question is on the secondary handsets. The JUMP! On Demand product or program should result in decent volumes coming back at you. I just want to get a sense for how comfortable you are, valuation for those secondary handsets coming in, and the available channels for you guys have to resell those into? Thanks. J. Braxton Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP : Sure, Michael, first of all, let me thank you for the comments. I mean, we pride ourselves on being more transparent than all the other carriers. I don't know that anybody is really disclosing the non-cash impacts of leasing programs or rollover programs, and we think that transparency is important. And specifically on cash flow, we are at an inflection point. And when you look at cash flow from operations that we have very clearly laid out and improved our disclosures, you'll be able to track the progress on a quarter to quarter basis. And I think the appropriate way to look at it \u2013 this is a proxy for true operational cash flow. So taking into account, all changes in working capital, versus a simple free cash flow computation. But we do think it's appropriate to exclude the one-time decommissioning costs on the MetroPCS network, which will only occur through the end of this year, and you've seen our guidance out on that. So, from a pure operational standpoint, we are already generating true cash flow from operations, considering all changes in working capital. On the ARPU, I think it was one of the great stories this quarter. We were, I think, very transparent that we would see sequential, significant step-ups in ARPU, relating to the charge that we took a Data Stash in the first quarter. And we've quantified that in the Investor Factbook, that excluding the impact of Data Stash, we actually had an 1% underlying increase in ARPU. And what that shows is the overall strength of our underlying ARPU. And when you look at the other metrics that we disclosed, ARPU in the per account metrics, we actually are hitting all-time record highs in all of those metrics. And our guidance of \u2013 increases in ARPU after the first quarter, we certainly still expect stabilization to increase in ARPU throughout the year. The one caveat that I will tell you, is that that we do believe that family plan penetration is extremely important. And this is a sweet spot for us, with the expansion of our network, and the value proposition that we're giving. We will continue to promote family plans. And you saw our latest Un-carrier Amped move with the 10 GB for All. But I think it's a great move, and we still expect stabilization to increase in ARPU. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay, operator, hold to the next one on the phone, because just so we can get used to using the way they're all coming in. I'm going to do a real quick one that came in on \u2013 actually, Howard, @4GHoward is being, multi-tasking \u2013 it's come on in TMUSearnings and @TMobileIR. I'm going to take that, and then I'm going to do a text question. Then we'll come back to the calls. And I'm going to be really quick on Howard's first question, which is he wants to know will T-Mobile offer a plan like @Sprint's #AllIn for $80, and then he goes on to describe what it is. I'm going to simply say to you, that the Sprint $80 all-in plan is the return of contracts. So that, from a standpoint of, is \u2013 when will be offer something like that? I thought I'd been very clear, never. So the contracts will not return, Sprint's all-in is a contract two-year oriented plan, and we will not be moving in that direction. Now on text, something came in, and I could read the phone number, but then I'd be like President Trump's giving (17:13) out the numbers. How many LTE POPs, how much band 12 has been deployed, and lastly has the band 12 deployment in L.A. been completed? I'm going to turn this to Neville. And while I turn it to Neville Ray, I'm going to acknowledge on this call the organization that Neville runs, that I said in my opening comments has been accomplishing things on the deployment of our network, that have never been seen before in the wireless industry. So on behalf of that, really, a proud hard-working team, let Neville brag and give you an update on these. Neville R. Ray - Chief Technology Officer & Executive VP : Thanks, John. So, tremendous progress on the LTE footprint. I think the great news is we are right on the heels of AT&T and Verizon. They can see us right in their rearview mirror right now. The number is 290 million \u2013 it's actually slightly north of 290 million covered people in the U.S. today. Our midyear target was 280 million, so we're well ahead of that plan. The goal for the end of the year is 300 million. We've talked about that many times. I'm very confident we will deliver that early, and we're pushing very, very hard to drive that number north of 300 million by the end of 2015. So great progress there. The text question outlined, what's happening with band 12. So just to decode that for some of you, that's the low-band spectrum that we secured from one of our competitors some time back. We're making tremendous progress with that spectrum. The rollout is well ahead of our expectations. There were some interference issues that we had to deal with, with adjacent broadcasters, and we've actually crushed those issues over the last six months. The team has executed way beyond our plans. That's allowed us to really accelerate and amp up our rollout on low band. Our customers are now starting to really experience the benefit of low-band coverage, great in-building, really expanded suburban and rural coverage. So great, great story coming through there. And there was a specific on the end of the question about what's happening about L.A. specifically. I'll say that key markets such as L.A. and New York, which were really in our plans for 2016 for low-band coverage, are now pulled into 2015. And deployment has already started, it's well under way in L.A. We're not yet done, but we will be done at least six to nine months ahead of our original plan, and that market will be up and running with significant low-band coverage inside this year. And I'm hopeful we can actually reach the majority of that goal inside this quarter. So tremendous progress on band 12, tremendous progress on LTE overall. And kudos to the team. It's tremendous execution right now. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay, operator, we'll take the next question on the phone. Operator : And from UBS, we have John Hodulik. Please go ahead. John C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thanks, guys. Couple questions, maybe a follow-up on the A-Block for Neville. Can you give us a sense for how many POPs you'll have covered with A-Block by year-end, especially pulling in New York and L.A.? And then, you may not want to answer this, but do you expect sort of support for band 12 in the next iPhone release, and is that why you pulled those networks forward? And if so, what kind of a boost do you think, or does it help as you look out to 2016 in terms of network performance and subscriber growth? So that's it on that topic. Then real quick on the margins, you've reached a new level here on margins. If we look out to the second half, is that 30% level sustainable? Thanks. Neville R. Ray - Chief Technology Officer & Executive VP : Let me take the first piece, then John. So the licensed area we have with our band 12 A-Block licenses is just shy of 190 million POPs, covered people. We won't get all of that done this year, but I tell you, we will get damn close. We're well over 100 million right now. The number is kind of around 130 million. You add L.A., New York, Atlanta, markets like Seattle, Sacramento, these are all big markets coming on between now and the end of the year, and we will get very close that number. So we're accelerating our plan inside 2015. You're totally right, the benefits in terms of customer performance, what this means in terms of speed, this is capacity, too, it really sets us up for a great customer experience in 2015. But probably more importantly in 2016. And we're driving very, very hard on the handset front. My goal is to have at least 50% of our customer base with a band 12 handset by the end of this year. Now, is there an inherent assumption in iPhone in there? Can't say. We can never disclose what Apple's plans are or are not; we don't know. But I'm very hopeful that there will be band 12 capability in the next set of iPhones. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, I think, John, I think let's break Neville's sentence apart. His sentence was that we can't disclose because we don't know. I mean, Apple's very secretive. We don't even know if and when they're coming out with a new device, although we already created a plan to help you get it when it does come out. And the question of do we expect band 12 support? The answer is yes. I mean, we certainly would expect that, and we'll look forward to hearing that in the near future. J. Braxton Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP : And, John, on your last question, on the 30% EBITDA margin, is that sustainable for the balance of the year? If you look at the guidance which we just reiterated with a much higher growth outlook, yes, it certainly implies that this level of margin is sustainable for the balance of the year. John C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks, guys. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Great. Let's stay on the phone for one more. Operator? Operator : And the next is Ric Prentiss with Raymond James. Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thanks. Morning, guys. J. Braxton Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP : Morning, Ric. Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, obviously, very nice growth, and I'll echo the comment about really appreciate you're going to provide the JUMP! On Demand benefit in the future. That's really important for us. You guys have a history of obviously taking care of the customer, listening to what they want. We're one month in, but what do you (23:41) take rate will be, and where will that head? John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Are you asking about JUMP! On Demand specifically, Ric? Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Yes, specifically JUMP! On Demand leasing. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, we expect it to be the most popular option on the eligible devices. We've launched JUMP! On Demand on all of our superphones, the iPhones, the Galaxies, the flagship LG phone. It's the most flexible way to get a new smartphone from T-Mobile, and really it's pretty obvious. I mean, you've got absolutely no payment due upfront, not even sales tax. It's a simple by-the-month payment, and there's no way to ever pay more than the sales price on the phone. So you get all of the benefits of ownership as well, and a lot more flexibility along the way, because we're the only ones in the industry offering upgrade rights throughout your journey with that phone, anytime you want to move to the next one, with zero cost or penalty or fee associated with the upgrade. So we don't see why it shouldn't be the default choice among the vast majority of people on those eligible devices. Now, we're continuing to offer EIP in JUMP! and that's important because some people have established themselves on that path. They've earned a right to an upgrade with JUMP!, they might want another one with JUMP! They've got established on a family, they're familiar with it. So we'll continue to offer it, but you can expect our emphasis on the high velocity superphones to be on JUMP! On Demand, because it's just a better offer for our consumers. And I think Ric, one of the things \u2013 the picture I'd' like to paint is, certainly there was a lot of logic to our non-stop deployment of the Un-carrier Amped summer. And in effect, what's about to happen now is back-to-school season. So, when it's time for people to go into stores as we know they do in heavy numbers going back to school, the combination of new things that are going to be discussed with them, including JUMP! On Demand and Mobile without Borders, and 10 GB for All, and locking in your next iPhone, it's a plethora of really amazing new tools. And as Mike said, in that basket of things, we expect a pretty high take rate on this as well. So, we're pretty excited about the coming back-to-school ramp up, with all of what we've announced. And I'm sure there will be more. Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. And one other question, kind of a strategic question. With AT&T closing the DirecTV deal and Verizon pending offer, how do you think about, how important is video to wireless customers, content to wireless customers? And how do you compete in that type of marketplace then? John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. And I again, I appreciate that question as well. First of all, it remains to be seen, outside of an announcement, what's going to happen on both of those. I'm not sure if you interviewed 10 young millennials in Times Square as to how panting they are for Go90, or whatever that item is, that's coming from Verizon in the future. I am not sure. Let's wait and see. Now on the broader question, as I think Mike was the one who coined this term, and we use it in here to think about this. As we all know, the world is moving to a point where content is going to the Internet, and Internet is going mobile. And yet thinking about that in this context, in which they are thinking about moving video content to mobile devices. So everybody is moving in that direction. One of the things that I think about, is in that continuum, we do one of those things extremely well right now. We do pieces of the others, but right now we are a very successful, fastest growing, fastest network in the deployment of things to mobile devices. Now what I think is happening, and I'll use the example of Mobile without Borders, when dumber decided to spend $4 billion, as the way they would think about offering cross-border services to Mexico. And before they even got a chance to do it, the significant players on the other sides of the border and we got together, and created a superior way to do this, because that was the competitive environment and they believed in the same offer. I think what's happening now is, everybody else who is looking to be successful in getting the content to the Internet, to the mobile devices, is a potential opportunity for T-Mobile to partner, ally, merge with, going forward in the future. And one of the things I would say is, getting the video and content to the mobile subscriber is as hard as a things that for those players to do, without someone like us, as it is for us to go there. So we are moving in that direction. And that opens up obviously, a huge amount of inorganic options and partnership options for the company. And when you combine those with what I think we've demonstrated, our standalone business model is scalable, and has legs, and been successful over the period of time into the future. Those two together I think, bode extremely well for T-Mobile. Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. And obviously, Neville's team put that in place as well with the network. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Operator, next question. Operator : From Goldman Sachs, we have Brett Feldman. Brett Joseph Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Operationally, over the last few quarters, the reduction in churn has been a big success. It's been a big part of the growth of subs, and a big part of what's happening with EBITDA. And so, that inevitably becomes the number one concern for a lot of people, which is, are we going to see that metric go up? Will people who are coming off all the EIP commitments and jump back out into the market? Or have you already taken measures to essentially mitigate the risk that, the success you were having two years ago, getting people to sign up to commitments, leads to risk over the next few quarters that they might leave? J. Braxton Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP : Yeah, Brett. Great question. Let me put a couple facts out there, and then we can also look at some of the things that we've recently done with Un-carrier Amped. First and foremost, we've been doing EIP for over four years now, and looking at cohorts during this entire period, the bear thesis that there is a significant uptick in churn after the 24 month period is absolutely false. And something that we have not seen in any of the cohort analysis that we've done. And I think it is pretty simple to understand why. That's kind of a thought that comes out of the old contract paradigm. But with devices, very few people actually wait two years now to upgrade their phones, especially with the industry innovation that we introduced with JUMP!, and now the JUMP! On Demand. So that's factor number one. Secondly, absolutely the reductions in churn, which I think is a hallmark of this quarter and what you've seen develop over the last two years, it's based upon a very high-quality super-fast network and super innovative and creative marketing, and an absolute focus on the customer in customer service. And you saw the number one J.D. Power's award today, and that's what's really happening there. So, there's obviously seasonality with churn. Everybody can go back and look at all the quarter-to-quarter on stats, so certainly, you have some variability. But the important thing is looking at the continued trend of year-over-year, and we're very confident and comfortable with what we're seeing with customer retention. And we are actually focused on improving it. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Brett, I would say that, the start of your question, hopefully it's not part of the input to it. But the next time you find yourself picking up a Dave Barden report, drop it, put it down, and step away from that report. It can only cause harm to your otherwise, brilliant thinking about the industry. And I guess, the important part for me is, that when we started this Un-carrier revolution, the churn was 2.55%. And this is not a one-time blip in churn, this has been a consistent increasing churn picture. And churn is different for us, because churn previously was a measurement, I believe in this industry, of what happened in that moment of truth, at the end of 24 months of being ignored, as people needed to make another decision. And that's not really what's happening with our customers. And what we do, and we've demonstrated the last three or four weeks again, we constantly are finding ways to give things to our customers and solve pain points, and we've created a belief and understanding as part of this revolution that that will continue. And if you look at what Neville is doing with the network, and you look at the report that came out today, with JDP ranking our customer service as number one, these are also big variables that we think bode extremely well for the future. But from a standpoint of the doom and gloom scenarios of what's going to happen, step away from that report. It's harmful for your health. Brett Joseph Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Thanks for taking the question. J. Braxton Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP : Okay. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay, let's try to grab one here. Okay, a very detailed question from Walt Piecyk, and Walt, we'll take one from the others. But is a very good question, which is, why is Neville Ray, not wearing a T-Mobile shirt? I don't want to say anything, Walt, but I'm confident that Neville's undergarments are T-Mobile at this time. Neville R. Ray - Chief Technology Officer & Executive VP : They've read the webcast lately. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Walt don't roll down any further. Walt, I did want to take this. There is a question here, Neville, maybe we could talk about. Does the completion of 300 million LTE POPs this year mean anything for capital investment next year? Do you guys want to... Neville R. Ray - Chief Technology Officer & Executive VP : Well, I'll start now \u2013 I'll pass it to Braxton, I mean obviously, we're going to continue to invest. We want the tremendous growth platform and growth story for our business today. We still have more work to do. In 2016 for sure, we want to continue to expand and improve the reach and quality of the network. And then we plan to advance our coverage as well as the density and capability and capacity of our network. This is absolutely the right thing to do at this point in time and as we move into the future. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. We'll get Walt on his \u2013 he's in the queue over here, but let's go back to the operator. I think the next questioner might be Roger. Operator : Roger Cheng from CNET. Please go ahead, sir. Roger Cheng - CNET: Hey guys, how are you doing? J. Braxton Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP : Hey, Roger. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I like that Macklemore (35:07) Roger Cheng - CNET: You're not getting tired of it? All right, well. Let me ask about the customer growth. Obviously, I'm obsessed about customer growth. What is the mix going to be down the line? Obviously, you're seeing with AT&T and Verizon the mix is more tablets, more connected devices. Do you see phone customers still being the majority of your mix of customer growth for the next couple quarters out? And just a follow-up, in terms of that other segment, do you see any other opportunities in M2M other connected devices as well? John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Very good. And as I hand that to Mike, I'll just add the snarky introduction that just to remind people that are dialing into the call, that aren't as steeped into looking at these numbers as others, is when you move from right now in the industry from postpaid and prepaid subscribers, to tablets and connected devices, right now in the AT&T and Verizon world, let's be clear, those are no ARPU or minimal ARPU free tablets and $1 ARPU connected cars. So, that's the main reason that they are kind of looked at that way. The evolution of which, we have shown our ability to target tablets when we choose to and we're very confident that we can use that going forward. But Mike, if you want to go through the mix there in some of Roger's question. G. Michael Sievert - Chief Operating Officer : Yeah, Roger. It's a great question. I just don't think, it's a matter of mix at our competitors. It's a matter of what they can do. And so, in an environment, where they simply can't get positive phone net adds anymore. And haven't been able to find success in that for many quarters. They've turned their intention to lower value types of products that they can acquire. And I'll be doing the same thing if I was there. So, it's really a matter of what they can do. They hit this kind of terminal size where their phone churn, although the churn rates are fairly good, some of the best in the industry, their size is churning out so many customers that we are feeding on, others are feeding on. That they just can't out run that with their gross adds. They don't brand value propositions that are attracting enough people on the front end to refill the churn on the back end. And that has to do with their size and it has to do with the fact that what they have to offer isn't resonating with the public as well as it needs to. And so they've turned to these lower value things as John said. Our strategy is really different. Ours is simply to focus on the highest value customer segments that's big families, it's postpaid, it's monthly recurring prepaid customers and go win in those segments, because our brand's resonating with the customers who use wireless the most to our most engaged in the industry. And that's why you see, not only our customer numbers at the best in the industry, but you see the underlying help of the business. Our churns hitting record low, our average billings per user at a record high, our customers are more engaged with our products and are actually buying more from us, and therefore paying us more than at any time in the history of our company. So, really shows you that, we just have a very different strategy and ours is really working when it comes to attracting high quality, high value customers. Roger Cheng - CNET: All right. Thanks. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. I think Michael Rollins is next. Operator : Michael Rollins from Citi Bank. Please go ahead, sir. Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Yeah, hi. Thanks for taking the question. First, I was wondering if you could size the amount of cost of service that's left from the MetroPCS network in the Q2 results, so we could think about what's going to come out, as you finish shutting down that network? And then the second question I had was, can you talk about how successful the sales team is at attaching additional features and options to your base rate plan? As we look at our current rate of promotions, and try to think about the ARPU translation for that, could you maybe give us a little bit of a bridge of how you start with these great plan offers, but what customer spending may ultimately look like, on average of course? Thanks. J. Braxton Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP : Yeah, Mike. So, on the MetroPCS synergies starting to flow through the results. They are certainly starting to flow through the results. And you're seeing a reduction in cost of service. And remember, the real reduction is actually larger than the decrease that you're seeing in cost of service, because we are continuing to expand the geographical breadth of our network. But needless to say, we will not be at run rate until the very end or early next year on the plus $1.5 billion of cash synergy, which is about a $1 billion worth of OpEx until 2016? John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. On the attach question, it's really pretty straightforward, Mike, and it's one of the things that really makes our model work. And think about it, us being in excess of 80%. And we talked about average billings per user and average billings per account being at all-time high, ARPU being a surprise on the high side. And so, people can make a mistake of looking at our promotions like our current 10 GB for All offer, or last year's 4 for 100. And conclude that customer quality would atrophy because of those things. But in fact, our team's highly successful at getting attach on things like JUMP! and insurance and data plans. That 10 GB for All offer that we have out there right now is very attractive as it stands, but also for just $10 more, customers can double their data on any of their lines or all of their lines. And our team is very successful at helping customers right size their usage and get the attachment. So, that's shining through very strongly in the result that we've reported this morning. Okay. Let's do Kevin Smithen [Macquarie Capital] and then I'm going to go to text question. Kevin Smithen - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: All right. One quick question, one of your competitors talks about their new mobile streaming platform that's going to \u2013 they think significantly lower report outs to you and others. How is mobile video thought of in your company, and do you have a plan to try to attack this new mobile streaming platform at your largest competitor? Neville R. Ray - Chief Technology Officer & Executive VP : Yeah. We've talked about this Kevin a few minutes ago, a little bit which is \u2013 there is no doubt, by the way that video is extremely important to all of our users. T-Mobile users have the highest consumption rates of anybody that the most engaged in the category. Video is the number one application consuming resources on our network the most \u2013 one of the most widely used applications by our customers. The question is this, do people want their wireless carrier to curate their video options? Do they want us to do the picking for them? And if they do, we'll be there as John said, our approach to it will be different than how our competitors are doing it, which is gobbling up companies and creating walled gardens and so on. But we are listening, what we do at the Un-carrier is really simple. We go to customers, we find out what they want and then we go do that. And if our customers want us to be in the video business curating and picking video, and if we can add value to that by being both in the content and into network, with synergies between the two for efficiency sake or value sake, then we'll do it. But the question really is what do customers really want? And do they want us in that business. Kevin Smithen - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Got it. And question for Braxton on free cash flow, if I can. We've seen in the first half a big working capital hit, when should we start to see the sequential EBITDA growth translate into big free cash flow ramp? J. Braxton Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP : Well, if you look at the free cash flow disclosures that we have on, in the Factbook. You saw a very substantial improvement in the operating working \u2013 in the operating cash flow including all changes in working capital. The primary burn on working capital is the continued investment in EIP, which has been significantly moderating. We also paid down, and when you do a detail analysis on the Q, a fairly substantial reduction in accounts payable in the second quarter. But, I think the important thing here is that the EIP is a function of growth. So, to the extent that we continue to have the momentum in the growth here there will be some incremental burn. But certainly, and as we said on the year end call, our growth aspirations were fully embedded in our EBITDA guidance, in our cash flow guidance. And we're much higher than we had originally positioned in the marketplace. And you know that we are conservative in the way that we position growth, which I think is wise given the overall environment. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay, I'm going to go to a question, that's coming on Twitter. It's Arthur (44:47) I don't know if I am abbreviating your name, Arthur Pielack (44:51) and it's \u2013 came in and said on postpaid ads, what was the breakdown on porting from other carriers? Let me say a few things on that, because as I outlined up front, this story is one that I want to put in a context. And I'll give credit where it's due during this analysis. But it's been nine quarters that we are positively ported with the industry. Let's just say, the entire time of the T-Mobile Un-carrier revolution. And in six quarters or actually 19 months now, the porting has been positive against every single carrier. So, that's the backdrop. You also know that we just raised our guidance for postpaid ads for the year. So in that context, I would just say in Q2, based on the results we're talking about, the porting was 1.5 with Verizon or as you know, for those you are experts in this \u2013 it's 1.5 to us for every 1 to them, which is very, very positive. It was 1.9 with AT&T, and it was 2.5 with Sprint \u2013 to be fair, 2.45. Now, we're pretty much into July. So the comments I can make on July are that we remain positive with all the carriers. We remained at least 2 \u2013 around 2 with Sprint, which is a \u2013 it's a wonderful trend. We remain in the area of \u2013 exactly where we were with AT&T. We're about 1.83, so relatively flat. Now, we are trending about 1.2 or so, up a little of 1.2 with Verizon. So Verizon has made some progress in the short term in the month due to the very heavy porting pay that they're doing, but if you think about where they are now \u2013 so I give credit where it's due \u2013 a tiny adjustment, but overall the porting for T-Mobile on the postpaid side very, very strong, continuing with all carriers, and in July some progress with one of the largest players in the world handing out cash to attempt to still not get to the point where they can add customers from T-Mobile. But making a little progress probably with their geese phone ad, which I thought was kind of cute. Okay, let's go back to the phone. Operator : We have Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Just carrying on from that theme of the porting ratios. You've had the iPhone for a couple of years now. You've got some attractive new offers for the iPhone related to the ability to upgrade to the new device. Can you just give us some color on where the iPhone is in terms of your mix of your subscriber base, and what you see as the opportunity? There must be a lot of 5s coming off to your contracts over the next few months, and your ability to sort of disproportionately benefit from that with some of your new offers? Thanks. G. Michael Sievert - Chief Operating Officer : Hey Simon. It's Mike. Yeah, I can only be somewhat helpful there. We don't break down our base by device. But let me give you a little bit of color. Overall, we believe that our penetration of iPhones is the lowest, and that means our opportunity is the highest. And we really see that as a source of strength for us going forward. Overall in our flow rate, you see iPhones and the main competitive device, Samsung Galaxy devices, being roughly speaking equivalent in their flow rates right now, in our business. And so, it really is more an issue of the base than it is an issue of the flow. And with a smaller iPhone base it means we're less vulnerable to switching at the time of big iPhone launches, and it means we have a bigger opportunity to gain switchers at the time of iPhone launches. And as John said, we can't say whether or not there's a big iPhone launch coming, but if there is one, we would see it as a real opportunity for us. And particularly, with the great work that Neville's doing to get 700 megahertz rolled out in low-band spectrum, if we can get to a point this year, where all of our devices have our complete network, that's a real opportunity for us to continue to build network perception, take share and continue to improve in our churn trajectory. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: And related to that, how are you addressing retail expansion? You can presumably hit a lot more communities now, with a full marketing effort than \u2013 given the 700 and the full LTE coverage? John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: One thing that we're avoiding is waiting to see if any other really crappy retail stores go bankrupt and are offering us relabeling their store. We don't think that that's a highly effective strategy. But in general, Mike do you want to - G. Michael Sievert - Chief Operating Officer : Yeah, we are doing two kinds of expansion \u2013 three kinds of expansion here. Number one is we are continuing to roll out our MetroPCS format nationwide. And we've seen amazing success adding MetroPCS dealers in cities across the country, and that's really helping our prepaid performance. Secondly, in our T-Mobile flagship store format, we have two approaches. We have a company store approach, and we have an exclusive dealer approach that's almost like a franchise model, because we make no distinction. We take direct control of the training, of the people, et cetera. And we see an opportunity to continue to roll out additional T-Mobile doors into that new footprint. I mean, think of it, a million extra square miles of LTE coverage this year, thanks to low band and other initiatives that we have under way. That really does open up new areas, where there's marketable territory for us to go and plant a stake in the ground. And finally, it's about online. Let's not lose side of the fact that it's 2015, purchasing in wireless is getting simpler as there's less overall fragmentation of volume of smartphones. People have a good idea what they're looking for. So we have a great opportunity to continue to expand our distribution online and welcome more and more people to our family digitally as well. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. And, Simon, I'd just to wrap up your questions, because as you asked your first question about the iPhone I was actually just came back from vacation and I was sitting there, because three years ago right now is when I was contemplating, coming in in a month or two as the CEO of T-Mobile. And I sit back and I think that it was even then and after, we had no iPhone in our stores, and I've been thinking about what's happened since then and the impact on our business, where we are of the deployment of a full set of devices. And then as Mike said with the success we've had, it's hard to believe that we have such a significant upside in our base as each new product comes out. And what we announced last week was an attempt to remove that back-to-school fear that generally happens, which is, oh, I don't want to do something now, because I'm afraid something's going to come out right after it. And in effect, what we've done is created a way \u2013 if there was such a thing, you can technically buy it now. And I think that's part of this plan. Now on the retail presence, we've got a great footprint, and I think when you go across our channels, remember that we've got about 11,000 MetroPCS doors of some fashion. A very, very large presence, much bigger than our competitors, and a very good footprint of T-Mobile branded locations, where we have our deepest coverage now. And part of the opportunity for us, as we deploy our spectrum nationwide, there becomes more communities that are an opportunity for us. So there will be some expansion, especially in suburban areas as the coverage goes up. But I would also add over the next year or two years, we see the online and direct-to-consumer piece of our business as possibly one of the biggest upside opportunities of our business. And how to add very innovative Un-carrier ways with self-care and utilization of online tools for the next generation of customers that may or may not feel the need to go to stores. So all those together, I think we see a tremendous upside. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Next question on the phone, operator? Operator : We have Jonathan Chaplin with New Street Research. Please go ahead. Jonathan Chaplin - New Street Research LLP (US): Thanks very much. Just a quick question on the platform that Google has rolled out with you guys and Sprint. Two quick questions around that. First of all, I think the product has launched very recently. I'm wondering if you've seen any early trends that are worth commenting on? I'm wondering how you think about the risk of this sort of a project with Google? And then I'm wondering if you'd offer the same kind of platform, or offer Comcast the same opportunity to use a platform like that? John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, I mean, a few things. First of all, it's too \u2013 it's early. I mean it's a very early \u2013 the process is moving deliberately but slowly, the application time is slow, but it's moving out. And I would say the anecdotal feedback I've gotten from customers that are using it is, I thought this was something they're doing with both you and Sprint, because my phone never moved to the Sprint part, which is sort of what we expected, and you laugh, but I think that is happening. So a significant portion of the roaming is going to the best network capability, which is ours. Second is, this is very profitable for us. So this isn't a gift game. It's a profitable business we're excited about it. And third, in the combination of all of what you are talking about, I have been clear that the difference between us and dumb and dumber and the other carriers is, we don't see any of these industry evolutions, as a threat. We see them as a logical progression of that industry structure continuum that we outlined in a way they use our reach on the mobile side to other players that want to enter the space. And I think I have always thought and said that in several years, we will think back and think it was completely humorous that we believed that the \"wireless industry was four-carriers, and a structure that needs to be protected\", because ultimately both Google, Comcast other players are going to migrate into the space. My thought is, that if Google is moving into the space with the capability that they have, I want to partner with them and I want to do that similar to how we were the original Android partner with them and we're very pleased with what it does so far. And we're looking forward to seeing what they choose to do in the future and hope that they do it with us. Second, when you move over to Comcast, I've said all along, as the cable players try to create and use Wi-Fi as a capability to serve their subscribers, you know that a partnership of sorts between a cable player with Wi-Fi and broadband in the home and a player like T-Mobile is better, you just know that. So, you know who knows that the industry structure will migrate such that those come together. But it's just logical; if you step back and start from a consumer and then the consumer says hey, wait a minute. I have Comcast and I had T-Mobile why don't these guys do something together to provide a seamless set of capabilities to us and then certainly some of the evolution of what's happening in unlicensed and et cetera is going to provide something. So that's the way I think about it. And I think that will be in several years a big question of not if, but when, and I look forward to that as well, I think it provides great options for our customers. Jonathan Chaplin - New Street Research LLP (US): To my understanding is that there is some limit on how much Google can sell on that platform. Did you guys put that in place, just because you wanted to see how the product would evolve? Or are there risks that you want to protect against as well? John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Peter is turning his microphone on. Peter A. Ewens - Executive Vice President- Corporate Strategy : Hey, it's Peter there, we don't have any limits what Google can sell on their platform. Jonathan Chaplin - New Street Research LLP (US): Got it. Thank you. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: That was an emphatic screen from Peter Ewens, by the way. Just so you know. That was arms waving \u2013 that was after we woke him up. Thanks for your question. And I fear, operator that we need to go the next question and I think it's Walt Piecyk [BTIG LLC]. Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC : Can you hear me now? John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC : Are you guys there? John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, Walt. We're here. We've been waiting for this, Walt. Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC : Do not fear anything. Your ad budget, I mean obviously you guys doing good job on social media which is largely free. But the ad budget looks like it was up year-on-year. Can you give us a sense of kind of what's behind that in the quarter and how you think about it in the second half of the year as you're launching some of these 700 megahertz parts? And then also as you came, when you look at 2016, as you launch 700 megahertz in some of these additional markets, it kind of changes the types of customers that you can go after, as you're lighting up different types of neighborhoods. Does the ad strategy change at all in that regard? John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. As I toss the ball to Mike to talk about the ads rate, I want to tell you about it, in your lead-in question, you talked about how successful we are in social media, and I want you let you know that in order for the company to do that, I personally have to spend huge amounts of time experimenting with the new vehicles. And I will tell you that that includes hours of my life that I had to spend on Periscope, watching you and your children play Trivial Pursuit, or drive down the seat and have your children ask you, Dad, are we almost there. And I want to let you know that with those things that I do, it's very clear that the board and the compensation committee need to step up, and save me better, because it's taking years of my life, but \u2013 Mike do you want to talk about the ads? G. Michael Sievert - Chief Operating Officer : Well, yeah, I mean, every quarter is a little different. I can't give too much of the secret sauce here, but I will say that this is one area where we're proud and most quarters to be a solid number four. We are very efficient in how we go about acquiring customers, especially when you put the lens on it, that shows how our share of overall growth ads in the marketplace compares to our competitors. And how we're rolling up all of the net adds in the industry and yet, we're in most quarters of solid number four, when it comes to investing in marketing. Just so to the strength of our brand and to the premise of your question, the fact that we're using our community and the fact that we've created a consumer revolution and put our brand on the side of the customer, we're getting an amplification out of our dollars that are competitors, just simply can match. Now that being said, this is seasonal business. Every quarter is a little bit different. We do tend to take a few moments through the year and really investing get behind this business. And although, if you've noticed, but we tend to do that a little bit counter cyclically to our competitors. We don't necessarily invest in the times when it looks the most expensive to us, because we can fish during other times of the year. That's been the pattern the last year or two. I try not to be predictable. The last thing you asked about was about regional plays. And yeah, absolutely, we see real opportunity in certain markets where the network conditions show that we can beat anybody, and those are places where we're investing disproportionately, because we know that the network is really surpassing what our competitors can offer and we want to shine a light on that through advertising. So, there is certainly a regional overlay to this. That's greater now than it was a couple of years ago when we were more one-size-fits-all nationally. Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC : And Mike, do you respond to the porting ratio. I mean, can you give a little bit more kind of color on the ebb and flow of porting ratios and maybe what percentage of growth ads they actually are representing these days? G. Michael Sievert - Chief Operating Officer : Yeah, absolutely. The only color I'll give you is that the movements that we've been seeing, our best evidence as we look at switcher data and we have lots of ways of getting out real switching versus porting, which is just a subset. And what it looks like to us is that there hasn't been any real shift in switching. John, threw Verizon a little bone there and said, it looks like they've made a little bit of progress in porting in July. There is no evidence that they've actually made progress on us in switching overall. And what's happening is more of the switchers are port, and because they're bribing customers to port. But it's not actually to us looking like it's resulting in a significantly higher number of switchers. So that's really important. Again, several quarters in a row now, we've rolled up all of the net adds on postpaid phones and more than the other three combined. And we're confident that the strategy is working. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC : All right. Great. Thanks. G. Michael Sievert - Chief Operating Officer : You bet. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Real, just quickly. Just \u2013 I am reading all the Twitter questions, including the ones that are annoyed saying that I'm not taking any Twitter questions. And some of that is just so \u2013 you'll know that the Twitter questions so far are overlapping quite well with what the call-in questions are taking. But @TechSpot is annoyed that I'm barely taking Twitter questions. So I apologize. Although, I do like annoying people, but not somebody whose name is \"Tech.\" And @TechSpot, I would just say you had a couple of questions that I thought were covered and I'll just tick them for you right now, to prove that you are not being ignored. Neville did talk about how many bad 12 POPs will be covered, and we said, we will approach 190 million by the end of the year. I think we've \u2013 the update was that virtually everything we need to do that has been cleared or we have a pathway to do it. So, that's the deployment schedule. And there was a question that was harder to answer, because it's a long discussion about what are your plans for improving indoor signal in non 700 megahertz areas, including more 700 megahertz purchases in both thing. I mean, obviously, we've got a significant infill strategy and modernization strategy that's going on along with the deployment of 700 megahertz, which has a tremendous overlap with where our customers are so far. Obviously, more 700 megahertz purchases is something we've been very clear and deliberate about, which also leads into a longer discussion about the broadcast auctions, and the criticality for carriers like us and our commitment to be successful in purchasing the 600 in what would be the end of first quarter broadcast auction to take place. So are we cool now? I really do love you. Okay. Now that I've already proved I'm not ignoring you, I'm going to ignore you and go back to the next call in question which was \u2013 I think it's Phil Cusick [JPMorgan]. Operator : And your line is open. Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks, John. So the typical pushback we get on T-Mobile aside from David Barden's tome is that you're going to run out of capacity. So Neville, can you help us think about not this year necessarily when you are deploying 700, but the next couple of years when there's not a lot of spectrum at least for sale from the government and useable. How do you think about capacity and should we be thinking about CapEx ramping up? And sort as part of that what does the secondary spectrum market look like? Are any of the 700 holders getting a little more reasonable on selling what they have? Thanks. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And Phil, as I hand it over to Neville, wouldn't you ask that exact same question to all of the other carriers. And... Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC : I would, but you don't hear about them. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Right, that's right, because I think the media has been dominated in the last week around speculation about running out of spectrum by Verizon. So I think this is just to put out there, when you get to the medium to long-term, absolutely everybody needs new sources of supply. Not just us, and we've been clear about it. We all have different paths and we feel very comfortable and we are still in a superior position as it relates to supply per customer as defined by megahertz POP. Neville, why don't you through that? Neville R. Ray - Chief Technology Officer & Executive VP : Thanks, John. Hey, Phil I mean, we could talk on this for a while. But I'll be punchy and quick as I can on this. It's obviously an important topic and discussion for the industry, there is a lot of growth. But we are very well positioned for that growth. I'd tell you, we're in the midst of a great execution on a great plan for growth in this company. The isn't a surprise to us. But why are we different? Most spectrum per customers than Verizon and AT&T, right out of the gate. We have less than half of our spectrum that we own committed to LTE today. That number is about 40% right now. So we have a lot of LTE growth ahead of us. The MetroPCS execution that's been referenced to couple of times on the call. Just simply outstanding, it's delivered two things, one the most dense network in the U.S., and two of the best mid-band contiguous spectrum position. The compounding nature of those two things is the envy of all of our competitors. They're throwing small cells, host of different ideas and plans to try and come close to matching that Macro network density with a great macro mid-band spectrum position. Low band grids don't get there, poor mid-band grids don't get there. I'm throwing tens of thousands of small cells, the problem doesn't get you there either. So those things are very important and very meaningful. With the fastest LTE network, we have been for 18 months, so it's a great proxy for capacity that's available for customers in the U.S. We are neck deep in the rollout of the LTE features and especially LTE Advanced features and a bunch of Twitter questions on carrier aggregation. It is out there already between low and high bands. We've already advanced with 2X4 MIMO, we have that across many major cities in the U.S. and we will be completing that footprint as we move through 2015. So a 20% to 30% uplift in capacity in its own right. Whole host of new capabilities and features coming down the road for us. And we are already way out in front on leveraging un-licensed spectrum. So you've heard the story of using LTE in our licensed, License-Assisted Access and we're working furiously to bring products to the market in 2016 to leverage underused and unutilized spectrum out there today. So there's a whole host of things we're working on, we are in the midst of strong execution here. The growth in the industry is an industry challenge, but I think, we're executing very well. We have a very, very strong foundational position to start from following the execution on Metro. You mentioned 700, it's coming in as an additional layer of capacity. Yes, we want to add more low band. We have 119 million covered people with the licenses we have. I think what's important for us at this point in time is to complete that low band footprint across the U.S. The big auction as John reference coming in the New Year, which will be a great opportunity. And we need to ensure that the big duopolists out there don't sit and hog over the low band spectrum. They own almost 75% of it in the U.S. market to date. And we are hell bent on making sure that those ratios and numbers change as we move forward. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Listen, there's a couple of things coming in on Twitter before we go to next question which is going to be Craig Moffett which I want to prepare the team to speak to him. Interesting question, first a simple one, several people have asked \u2013 how is switching and porting different, and that's an interesting question because the porting is the same as switching except you are taking your number with you. See you're porting your number over and the reason this is an interesting question is because very clearly the switching dynamic in the industry consistently over the past two years has been people switching from AT&T and Verizon and Sprint to T-Mobile. And porting ratios are a leading indicator of what's happening in the broadening pool, unless you disproportionately do something to that indicator. So, for example, what's happening in the short-term where I noted a slight improvement in Verizon's postpaid porting, still negative. It's based upon a significant payment to their customers to port their number. So a porting amount of money that they are paying. It doesn't necessarily do anything to the underlying switching trend in and of itself. So that's a very good question. Second is there's been a number of questions about the broadcast options. Neville just commented on it, but let me \u2013 I'd just make a couple of statements, which is it's a long and winding road, there's tremendous amounts of things still to be done, but let's just give you a small update of the current events in that area. One is, it seems to be remaining on track that there will for the first time ever in an auction, be a reserve set aside for the smaller carriers that need the spectrum, which is a big success. There is a remaining question as to whether it's 30 megahertz or 40 megahertz. But I want to point out that those are both significant wins for T-Mobile, and I'm certainly pushing and hoping for the 40 megahertz, but the 30 megahertz it remains to be seen in the second part of this analysis which is all I know is in the past two weeks. Verizon continues to say, they're not sure they are going to play. They don't really need to play in the low-band space, which I'm really cool with. And then in the past week or so, I've seen analysis that suggests that potentially based upon rulings that could cost DISH some additional money on the AWS3, they might not be afford to play. So all I can say is at this point in time, the current events suggest that the spectrum auction is looking positive for T-Mobile. I want to reiterate our commitment that we are showing up, we are playing, and we will be successful, and we are counting on that. And so far things feel pretty good on that. Now, going to the next question, which I think is Craig Moffett. I don't want to sing the whole song, but I would ask my brethren here to yell the first few rounds of Happy Birthday because it is Craig's birthday. Okay, go ahead. Happy birthday to you. All right, that's enough, that's it, that's it right there. Go ahead, Craig. Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC : Thank you, gentlemen. I take that to be a sign of your highly developed targeted marketing capabilities. I'm going to see if I can slip in two questions as my birthday present. First, you've talked a lot about the 700 band, but not about other spectrum bands. There's been \u2013 obviously, there was a lot of talk during the quarter about DISH Network and their AWS4 band. I wonder if maybe Neville could comment on how you see the other spectrum band might be out there in the private market, relative to the 600 spectrum. And then, second, if you could just update us on your small medium business initiatives and what kind of traction you are seeing in the SMB segment? John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay, I'll attempt to have Neville give a short answer on that first one, running the risk that we could be here till tomorrow, and then Mike can give you an update on the small business. Neville R. Ray - Chief Technology Officer & Executive VP : No short answers from me, John, I can't help it. No, I'll keep this one brief. I mean, obviously there's a secondary market out there, and the DISH folks have a fair volume of spectrum that's yet to be brought to market. It has as to come to market at some point in time. And there's a good midband portfolio there. It faces obviously some risks and issues around standardization and timelines and equipment. And so when you look at how you're going handle and grow a very fast-paced business like ours today and in 2016 and 2017, those assets, they're further out for us. So hence my comments on all the things we're doing with the asset base that we have. And obviously, I think 700 is a perfect example of how T-Mobile, when it secures spectrum, it turns that spectrum into customer value, performance, and benefit very rapidly. I think Verizon sat on the A-Block for five years and never talked to a broadcaster, but we've cleared it and deployed it inside 12 months. So if the FCC wants to look at how to bring spectrum to market, you put more into T-Mobile's hands. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hear, hear. Neville R. Ray - Chief Technology Officer & Executive VP : Outside of that, I mean, I think I referenced on license, we're going to push very hard into that space. That's something that's very realizable compared to many of the secondary market opportunities in the near term. There are other pieces coming, 3.5, it's a bit messy. But we're looking at our spectrum position today and other opportunities that are right in front of us. And we're excited about what we can do in 2016 and 2017 with what we have and what's coming. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: As we go to Mike, I'll just say, obviously not just Neville, but we are interested in all forms of spectrum to help our customers, and in effect it's hard to look at DISH as \u2013 in fact, I heard a rumor that they changed their company name to Spectrum Pile, which I'm not sure is true. But it is, it's the motherlode of spectrum, and what makes the topic interesting is it's spectrum that has to find a utilization. So we find it to be something interesting to look at, and certainly, we could put it to use, but it is one of a number of ideas we have and one of a number of spectrum opportunities that we have. Mike, do you want to talk about the - G. Michael Sievert - Chief Operating Officer : Yeah, Craig, the story on small business is short and simple. It's going really well. As you know, we plunged ourselves into the space with Un-carrier 9 early this year. And I think we've said a couple of times we've seen our business at retail in particular, more than double in flow rate since then, and that's holding up. So we're really delighted with that. Overall, across all channels including sales channels, our flow rate's up about 50%. So the results are across the board. And financially, we're seeing good quality customers coming in. So while we made a big investment in pricing and in simplicity, in the value propositions that we rolled out with Simple Choice for Business, what we're seeing is that customers are coming in, they're attaching with high end phones, they are attaching data, our cost of sales is going down. And so we've really got a nice beginning to a long-term strategy here. The second thing I'll say is Un-carrier 9 was not the end of the strategy. It was a firing gun. It was a start. And each subsequent move now is designed to attract not just consumers, but small and medium businesses as well. And Mobile Without Borders is a great example of this. We've seen real business uptake from small and medium businesses, and in fact big enterprises that do businesses across the borders and want a different proposition for their employees. 10 gigs for All, our signature offer and promotion of the back-to-school season, amazingly appealing to small businesses who don't want to have to worry about whether or not they're parceling out the right amount of data to each employee, because the 10 gigs for each employee is so attractive. So a nice start, the team's done an amazing job, but a lot of late legs for this strategy over time. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Let's take the next \u2013 let's see. The messages coming in on text, the only other one that's come in is would you consider a partnership with various cable companies. And I think I've already covered that, which is obviously we look at everything from a customer standpoint, and if there's something that's beneficial to them, which I believe there ultimately is, we're interested on their behalf. So that kind of kills those questions, the Twitter messages I'm keeping an eye on, but let's go to another one on the phone. Operator : We have Joseph Mastrogiovanni with Credit Suisse. Joseph A. Mastrogiovanni - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi guys, thanks for taking my question. Two if I could, maybe first a follow up to Mike's earlier question related to the PCS synergies. Just what's left to do to achieve the full run rate there? And then switching gears if I could, you've had nationwide VoLTE available for roughly year now. Can you just talk about the consumer response to the VoLTE and maybe the differences that you've seen compared to traditional voice as it relates to quality of service? J. Braxton Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP : Sure, really quickly on the MetroPCS synergies, we have now as of July 1 shut down all the legacy CDMA networks. But the accounting rules tell you, you have to completely decommission those networks before you can start recognition of the synergy. And that's typically a four- to six-month time period. So it will take the balance of the year to get to full run rate. And, remember, some of our largest markets, Miami, New York, were shut down at the very tail end of June. Neville R. Ray - Chief Technology Officer & Executive VP : So real quick on VoLTE, tremendous progress, first to launch nationwide. This is an interesting step. If you look at the VoLTE core volume on our network, it's 2x what we have on GSM. So it's a huge piece of growth on voice calling for us. Everything pretty much we now sell on LTE is VoLTE capable. It's a big part of our future. VoLTE is not just about the customer experience on voice and fast setup times. It's about how do you really move into a complete and holistic kind of IP ramp up around your services. We've just recently launched advanced messaging, which is the first piece of the gate on rich communication services, highly integrated in with VoLTE. Next to come will be video over LTE, ViLTE. And so you're going to see all of those firsts coming from T-Mobile. They all come off and stem off the back of moving voice onto the IP layer. And a bunch of question today, too, coming through about Wi-Fi and why don't we do more about other OEMs bringing their devices, BYOD coming to T-Mobile, getting Wi-Fi, the great Wi-Fi service we have from T-Mobile onto those devices. Well, we need all the other carriers to wake up, smell the coffee on the future. And the future's about VoLTE, it's about Wi-Fi integration across their IP plane seamlessly to give mobility. And none of the carriers are where we are on Wi-Fi. None of them are where we are on VoLTE, and the OEMs have to deeply integrate that new IMS stack to support VoLTE and VoLTE mobility into Wi-Fi. So our competitors kind of have to wake up and move this thing. And then all of those BYOD devices that would come through the T-Mobile doors could support our service. But we're working to obviously drive the industry forward in this area and we have a leadership position right now, globally. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I just want to point out that I think that Neville just successfully merged multiple quotes into smell the coffee, I mean... Neville R. Ray - Chief Technology Officer & Executive VP : I need the coffee. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Smell the roses, get the coffee but it was pretty good, I mean, I'm sure it translates well. All right. So, here's what we are going to do? I'm going to have Mike rapid fire a few of the Twitter messages. But then I think we are pretty out of time. And what really caught my mind here is its very hard ignore a Twitter question. When it comes from the name of objectiviststoner @godless pothead, and I'm not \u2013 and there is no judgment here. Because I can tell by the question, it sounds like an employee but if your name is Godless Pothead you deserve to be spoken to. So, Mike, do you want to start with.. G. Michael Sievert - Chief Operating Officer : Yes, absolutely. Two or three quick ones. First on that one \u2013 that person asked when are the update to retail POS systems and other communications technology coming. I'd say this is an area where we're really, really excited about. We are rapidly rolling out tablet-based activation and care systems to our retail stores and in fact, redesigning our retail stores, so that we don't have those big counters separating our people from their customers. Our people want to be working collaboratively with customer side-by-side. They're actually doing a redesign of the entire retail format to enable Tablet-based selling and activation. The second thing we're doing is we're rolling out a breakthrough technology, developed by Neville's team called Grand Central. And this is an automated tech support solution that allows our people to go in and with single clicks, diagnose issues on people phones and instantly solve them. It is really exciting, we're using it in our care tech support. We're rolling that out to retail soon. And then next year, we've got a completely new system that's much faster and dramatically reduces the activation time. So lots of excitement there. Another questioner asked, what's going on with machine-to-machine. Because overall, you saw that we gained 2.1 million net ads this quarter. But one category if you saw in our disclosures was negative by a small number, negative 33,000 and that was machine-to-machine customers. And that one is pretty simple. We went out to our customer base this quarter and notified them that we are going to be putting more of our emphasis starting in 2016 on our LTE network and dedicating more spectrum to LTE and less to our 2G and edge networks. And that's caused some customers to have devices out there that they are looking at for next year \u2013 they might not have the network to support them by then. So they are moving those devices out. And I think that what we're going to see overtime is that most machine-to-machine deceives are going to be LTE devices. So we don't see this is a long-term issue for us. And our LTE customers are going to be very glad we're putting the emphasis on spectrum there. And another person asked, what about GoSmart and MetroPCS. Why do you have both brands? Shouldn't you simplify? And I say, they're actually quite different brands. GoSmart is a 3G brand and it's focused on multi-carrier distribution. So dealers and national retailers, where people can go and get a really great value on a very simple offer, and it's a 3G offer, and that helps us keep prices very low. MetroPCS on the other hand is our flagship prepaid offering. It's a high-value 4G LTE month-to-month offering at an incredible price. And it's focused mainly on dedicated distribution. T-Mobile store, I mean, MetroPCS store, so very different distribution, very different offers. So probably not merging those brands. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. I committed to go 90 minutes and I think we're just slightly over that. So I'm going to stop here, we have the lot about of forums to communicate with the number of you, will keep a eye on the questions coming in. And I want to thank everybody for listening. And we are very excited about the quarter and look forward to talking to you next quarter if not before. Thank you, very much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the T-Mobile U.S. second quarter 2015 conference call. If you have any further questions, you may contact the Investor Relations or Media Department. Thank you for your participation. And you may now disconnect. Have a pleasant day.",

Craig Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co. Michael McCormack - Jefferies LLC Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Michael Rollins - Citi Walt Piecyk - BTIG Operator : Good morning. Welcome to the T-Mobile U.S. Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. Following opening remarks, the earnings call will be opened for questions via the conference line, Twitter or text message. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Nils Paellmann, Head of Investor Relations for T-Mobile U.S. Please go ahead, sir. Nils Paellmann : Yes, good morning. Welcome to T-Mobile's third quarter 2015 earnings call. With me today are John Legere, our President and CEO; Braxton Carter, our CFO; and other members of the senior leadership team. Let me read the brief disclaimer. During this call, we will make projections and statements about the future performance of the Company, which are based on current expectations and assumptions on Forms 10-K and 10-Q include risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Reconciliations between GAAP and the non-GAAP results, we discuss on this call can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website. Let me now turn it over to John Legere. John Legere : Okay, good morning everyone, and thanks for joining us. Welcome to the T-Mobile Q3 2015 Uncarrier earnings call as well as Twitter conference that will be letting you use as well. We're live from the NASDAQ Headquarters here in New York City where we are again providing a live video stream, so you can watch all the action behind the scenes via Twitter or YouTube and I am glad I just reminded myself of that as I said it. It\u2019s already been a big morning here in New York. The T-Mobile team and I just ran the NASDAQ opening bell about 30 minutes ago and our stock began trading on the NASDAQ under our ticker symbol TMUS. We are a mobile internet company and we'd like to disrupt things. So I think we have a lot more in common with the tech companies of Silicon Valley that are traded here on the NASDAQ. Even more exciting though are our fantastic Q3 results, basically we continue and inflict pain on the duopoly by solving customer pinpoints. And just to double down on that, I hope some of you got to see the message we sent to Verizon yesterday and we planned to send to AT&T this morning. Sky lighting seems like a logical way to make sure they don't ignore the fact that consumers want them to abolish overages. Anyway, today we will generally go with the same Q&A approach as we did last quarter and to accommodate all your questions this call will last for up to if needed 90 minutes, taking questions via Twitter, text and on the phones. So, let\u2019s get onto it. It\u2019s been a pretty incredible quarter for T-Mobile and our Q3 results show that the business is firing on all cylinders. Let me jump to some of the highlights. We now have more than 61 million customers. Our 2.3 million total net ads in Q3 marked the 10th consecutive quarter of over 1 million. It was also the fifth time in seven quarters we added more than 2 million. We also added 1.1 million branded postpaid customers, the fifth consecutive quarter we gained more than a million. Yet again, we demonstrated our laser sharp focus on branded postpaid customers, the most valuable; the postpaid phone - the most valuable customer segment in the market. In Q3, we added 843,000 branded postpaid phone net customers. For those of you keeping score that seven quarters in a row that we've led the entire industry in postpaid phone additions. And in prepaid where we have the industry's biggest and best prepaid brands, we added 595,000 new customers. That's more than triple what we did in the second quarter and it was our best result since combining with MetroPCS. Now, we're not just winning customers, we're keeping them. Branded postpaid phone churn was down 18 basis points year-over-year to 1.46%. That's the best year-over-year churn [ph] reduction for us this year. It did increase a little sequentially which was expected given the normal seasonal patterns. Our momentum continues into the fourth quarter with positive postpaid porting against all of our competitors. We've had 10 quarters in a row with overall positive postpaid porting ratios and I don't intend to stop that trend now. Of course, our growth is largely fueled by America's fastest 4G LTE network. It isn't just the fastest, it's also the fastest growing and we have big news here today. You are the first to hear officially that we now cover 300 million LTE POPs. This was our goal for the end of 2015, and we achieved the milestone months ahead of schedule. Huge thanks to Neville Ray and the best network team in the industry. And we are on track to add 1 million square miles of 4G LTE coverage area this year. Today, we have 245 market areas with wide band LTE and we're on track to be at more than 260 market areas by the end of the year. We've had the fastest 4G LTE network now for seven quarters in a row and wide band is making our blazing fast 4G LTE data speeds even faster. Our deployment of extended range LTE on 700 megahertz A block spectrum is way ahead of schedule. 204 markets are live covering a 175 million people and we are on track to end this year with more than 350 markets including the cities of New York and Seattle. Further, we have reached four additional agreements in principle that add licenses covering another 20 million POPs of 700 megahertz spectrum to our portfolio, bringing the total now to 210 million and covering additional cities like Phoenix, San Diego, Las Vegas, Norfolk, New Orleans, Tucson, Baton Rouge, Pensacola, Macon, Fayetteville and many others. We expect we will have other 700 megahertz A block transaction at the broadcast incentive auction approaches and current holder\u2019s options to monetize significantly diminished. We're committed to participating vigorously in the incentive auction to fill out and bolster our nationwide low band spectrum. This new spectrum is a game changer for us, it travels twice as far and works four times better in building. And you can now use it with all the new invites that devices including the iPhone 6S and the 6S Plus. Americans continue to respond and switch to the Uncarrier. We remain completely focused on changing this industry and making it better for customers, our Q3 numbers show the huge effective moves. Now frankly I could talk about these results all day. But I'm going to hand it over to our CFO, Braxton Carter for key financial highlights after breaking one more piece of news that I've been waiting to share. In just two short weeks, Uncarrier 10, or Uncarrier X is coming. Yes, invites are probably going out to members of the media, right now, while I'm sitting here and I can't wait. Mark your calendars for November 10, 2015 with more details to come soon, and now onto Braxton. Braxton Carter : Hey, thank you John and good morning. Let me give a quick snapshot of our financial results. Our customer growth is translating into strong financial growth as we once again delivered industry-leading metrics. Service revenue grew by 11% and adjusted EBITDA came in at $1.9 billion, up 42% year-over-year. The adjusted EBITDA margin expanded from 24% in the third quarter of last year to 30% this year. I am particularly pleased that we generated meaningful positive free cash flow this quarter. Free cash flow was $411 million or $487 million adjusting for the one-time decommissioning cost of the MetroPCS CDMA network and that's up from a loss of $69 million last year and we expect to be free cash flow positive for the full year as well. Net income and earnings per share were also up year-over-year and we expect both to be positive in the fourth quarter and for the full year 2015. The reduction compared to Q2 was primarily due to a return to a normalized effective federal and state income tax rate and higher MetroPCS decommissioning expenses. Based on our great results, we are increasing our postpaid net ads guidance to a range of $3.8 million to $4.2 million. While maintaining once again our adjusted EBITDA guidance of $6.8 million to $7.2 billion and our cash CapEx guidance of $4.4 billion to $4.7 billion. I should point out that this is our third customer guidance raise this year, while maintaining our EBITDA guidance stable throughout the year. Just as a reminder, our financial guidance excludes any benefit from the impact of JUMP! On Demand and Data Stash. We will disclose the aggregate non-cash impact from JUMP! On Demand and Data Stash in future quarters. In the third quarter, the aggregate impact was immaterial as JUMP! On Demand is just beginning to scale. In summary, we've delivered very strong financial results in the third quarter and maintain a very aggressive outlook for 2015. Now, let's get on to your questions. You can ask questions via phone, text message or via Twitter. We will start with the question on the phone. Operator, first question please. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will talk our first question from Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Philip Cusick : Hi guys. Thanks. Couple of things, John, can you expand on the 700 megahertz you've already brought that 20 million POPs how much did you spend on that? And as well on the potential due major deals ahead of the auction and with the FCC change in anti-collision rules would you expect to be able to talk to other bidders to the process or should we still think of it as sort of full blackout period between bidders? And then Braxton, you've talked about spending as much as a turn of EBITDA on the auction coming up. How do you plan to raise that money? Should we think about any equity component like a convert or expect that to be just straight debt? Thanks. John Legere : Let me jump around and first just say that the additional agreements, we are not discussing the details on today because they are late breaking. So you can just rest assure that the same prudent way we've been very carefully and slowly looking at ways to add to our low band portfolio that certain players in their view saw that says the time that they should monetize and we've had a lot of success in - so we're not going to give the details of those at this particular point in time. The question associated with the anti-collision rules and certainly right now it's a wide open period from a standpoint of the anti-collision period. I believe that will start in January. But I don't see that impact and what we see taking place over the next quarter. If in fact something highly opportunistic that does come up. From a stand point of the initial portfolio of what we spent on the low band and Braxton if you want to talk about that. Braxton Carter : So I think that as the broadcast incentive auction approaches, the opportunity for existing 700 megahertz holders to monetize will be diminished because we'll get what we need in that option. We're very pleased that we've already added roughly 20 million POPs since our last public discussion and again due to confidentiality provisions, we're not messaging that. But we're very excited about that opportunity and if the holders of the spectrum don't participate in some transactions they are facing very aggressive build out schedules and again we think that there is a going to be opportunity. On the upcoming broadcast incentive auction this is going to be transformational for our company. We've talked about the benefits of low band spectrum. Customer retention, better in building penetration in the major geographical areas geographical expansion of the much more economical rate. And we are prepared to be as always disciplined but aggressive in the upcoming auction. Consistent with all of our prior disclosure sale, we believe that we have more than adequate cushion from a leverage ratio standpoint with no adverse consequence to our existing bondholders or corporate rating to fully fund whatever we need to do in the upcoming broadcast incentive auction. And we currently have no intend to access the market from in equity standpoint or any equity linked security. So we've met with all the major rating agencies, have confirmed that position and I'm really pleased to announce that we just put on Bloomberg yesterday we're kicking off a process to issue secured debt in T-Mobile US for the first time. And this was something that we have to have the ability to do before. We are not going to issue a great deal secured debt is going to be of course investment grade rated. But we're going to put a benchmark security out in the next week. And - we have roughly a $1 billion size. And given the recent success on 700 A Block continued rollups. We think it's prudent to take that initial step at this point maybe good to have a benchmark security out there in the term loan B market. So any other questions on that? Philip Cusick : That's great. Thanks Braxton. Braxton Carter : You're welcome. John Legere : Take more on the phone. Operator? Operator : And we will take our next question from Jennifer Fiche [ph] with Wells Fargo. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thank you. First and very nice free cash flow performance. I wanted to explore a little bit on the leasing plans. Can you talk that do you expect these are they already having an impact on the equipment revenues. And do we see kind a more year-over-year declines on that as people migrates to JUMP! On Demand. And then as an add on to that, Verizon indicated that are hinted toward that the rating agencies are having some questions about the leasing plans. Are you seeing that or can you talk about any dialogues you're hearing on that front. Thanks. Braxton Carter : Yeah Jennifer. Good morning. Yes first let's back up JUMP! On Demand is oriented towards our Hero devices in smartphones. We currently only have four devices, but essentially all we're doing with those 4 Hero devices is JUMP! On Demand. And we've try to be very thoughtful in our disclosures relating to the impact of leasing and all the ins and outs from a financial perspective. But you're absolutely right, under the leasing construct there are no revenues associated with the initial sale or at least for the handset and there is no cost of sales. And we're capitalizing the price of the handset and then depreciating that over the life of the handset. We believe that the right proxy for understanding the non-cash impact, which is the rating agencies are very focused on is the lease revenues that are recognized. And when you go through all the ins and outs that's the best way in contrast to EIP to understand the non-cash benefit to the EBITDA. For the third quarter, there was an immaterial amount of lease revenue significantly less than $15 million. And as promised, we are disclosing the net non-cash impact of leasing in Data Stash. Data Stash was also immaterial we have reversals or usage of the gift that was given at the beginning of the year but we also had new deferrals of customers taking advantage of Data Stash. So netting those two numbers together it's a very insignificant amount for the quarter. We will as promised disclosed as we do anticipated to be more of an EBITDA benefit in the fourth quarter and certainly we'll put a point estimate out. We have met with all the rating agencies, Moody's, S&P and Fitch. And as I mentioned, we are investment grade on the secured debt that we\u2019re putting out. We also understand completely our parameter with no adverse consequences to our corporate rating or to our bond rating which we are very, very committed to. In the course of that dialogue, the rating agencies are in fact looking at the differences between leasing and EIP and discounting the non-cash aspect of that in computing their leverage ratios. So this is something that we\u2019ve had very extensive discussions and have confirmed with the rating agencies. John Legere : I'm going to just to be fair and move around, we\u2019re going to go back to the phone call the second plus the Twitter and other questions are piling in and I\u2019ll just merge two of them one from Arthur Pielack and then from Zachary Child both have to do with the same topic associated with, can you give us an update on porting rates from other carriers as well as who are you taking the most from? I mean the simple answer who we\u2019re taking the most customers from is AT&T. The full answer is we\u2019re taking customers from everybody and just I\u2019ll give you an update on few of these things which is for the quarter for Q3, the overall postpaid porting rate was 1.8 and that is by the way the 10th quarter in a row that we were positive porting on the postpaid side against the whole industry combined. Then it was the seventh quarter in a row that our porting was positive against every individual carrier so we\u2019re clearly taking customers from everybody. I'll remind you that the postpaid porting I think I may have covered before but for Q3 it was 1.33 with Verizon, 2 or 1.98 with AT&T and 2.09 with Sprint. Now if you just want to get a latest view I can just tell you that the last seven days so you look at a week at a time in the last week the postpaid porting with the industry is 1.9 with Verizon its 1.44, with AT&T its 2.25 and with Sprint it\u2019s 2.07. And again I would expect Sprint to post some positive phone results this quarter I think they\u2019ve been doing a good job. But I\u2019ll just point out that this was nine quarters in a row that the postpaid porting against Sprint is 2 :1 or greater and that\u2019s the trend right now. And I think the important part is certainly as I've said many times if you look at the results that we\u2019ve just posted they are phenomenal across the board and it seems as if they require some digesting for everyone to understanding them in detail. But it\u2019s pretty clear that it\u2019s not important to ask what Sprint to fail as you can see here. And frankly if they do report strong results it\u2019s not in our expense which I think is good for the industry and good for the consumers. And why don\u2019t we go back to the questions on the phone? Operator : And we will go next to Kevin Smithen with Macquarie. Kevin Smithen : Yes when you think about purchasing additional 780 watt how should we think about the CapEx levels associated with that deployment and really start to think about \u201816 CapEx and how quickly can that spectrum be deployed in the market? Braxton Carter : Well I\u2019ll start and then hand it over to Neville. I think this is a very impressive thing that Neville and his team have accomplished. When we purchased the first 150 million tops in the Verizon transaction year and a half ago, roughly 50% of head channel 51 interference and in traditional duopoly practice we\u2019re helping spectrum to keep it away from the competitors when we started calling to broadcasters to clear it, they said wow, this is the first call that we\u2019ve ever gotten. And this team did an amazing job and clearing essentially all of that spectrum now which is being very aggressively rolled out and that is certainly our expectation on any additional spectrum that we are able to roll out from current A Block holders. From a CapEx standpoint we have already rolled out the vast majority of the spectrum that we owned all within the CapEx parameters that we disclosed and reiterated our guidance for the third time. Because essentially the vast majority is overlaying the existing network. Now that certainly we are doing some geographical expansion but that is also fully included in the guidance. So, I wouldn\u2019t look at that as being a catalyst for any significant debt function change using CapEx going forward and I would more look at it Kevin from a standpoint of tremendous opportunity for our company. It's the one asset that we've haven't had in the past. The improvements in customer retention from better in-building, the ability that's very cost effectively expand geographically. The team has done an amazing job populating 700 megahertz compatible handsets into our ecosystem and the recent iPhone launch was a big win for us in that regard. And there is going to be a lot of goodness that\u2019s going to come out of this both from tapping areas of the US where we have zero penetration and haven\u2019t been relevant before to better overall customer acquisition. I am going to turn it over to Neville to talk a little bit about where we stand and some of the phenomenal success that team has had in rolling this out. Neville Ray : Hey, thanks Braxton. Hey Kevin, how are you? So incredible momentum on the LTE front within the business couldn\u2019t be more excited about cresting 300 million POPs that\u2019s a lot of work over many years, but the change in the network over the last 12 months to 18 months with the advent of low band and the pace at which we've been able to both clear and then deploy that spectrum is a huge, huge lift for the business. So when I look at the next opportunities coming for us, we have already deployed 175 million of the 190 million license POPs of low band that we had in the stable as John referenced in the opening comments another 20 to come. The lion line share event is unencumbered, you can anticipate it will be rolled out at very fast pace as we have demonstrated this last year. The non-incumbency allows us to very rapidly hang the equipment we need on tenants on base station gear onto existing steel that\u2019s the model that we utilize which is very, very CapEx efficient as you have seen through 2013, 2014 and now 2015. So hugely excited about the momentum looking at our next 20 million. Hopefully there will be more opportunities coming prior to the auction in the 600 spectrum and we have got a great team that deploys the spectrum extremely fast and with great results for the business. John Legere : Okay. Next question. Operator : And we will take our next question from John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead. John Hodulik : Thanks. Couple of follow-ups from previous questions. First, can you give us what percentage of device sales in the quarter were from installments and then how should we think about modeling that going forward and then I think Braxton you are alluding to this you made a lot of progress on the postpaid churn side, there is still pretty big gap between within you guys and AT&T, Verizon but as you rollout the A block you get more penetration of devices that I can see the A block spectrum, do you expect that gap to close? Braxton Carter : Yeah, first of all the majority of what we are still doing is EIP financing. And I want to highlight something very significant for the first time in the last two and a half years, we actually have seen reaching an inflection point where the collections on EIP receivables have outstripped new EIP coming in, we actually saw a decrease of roughly 300 million in our overall EIP balances. JUMP! On Demand which is our leasing construct again as 4 Hero devices and those devices the vast majority of what we are doing is on leasing but EIP still is a very important part of the equation. Your question on closing the gap with the competition, I think it\u2019s very important to note that sequentially all the carriers that have reported have seen the normal seasonal uptick in churn and specifically AT&T. And what I want to highlight is a continued significant year-over-year improvement down 18 basis points for T-Mobile U.S. year-over-year which again is the best year-over-year decrease and churn that we are seeing and that's what really just getting to relevance on the 700 megahertz roll out and this is why this is so important to us. We believe that there is definitely upside and it will help us close the gap with a lot of the operational initiatives that Mike Sievert has in place and addressing customer pinpoints and reducing churn. Mike, do you want to add to that? Michael Sievert : Yes, John, I was just going to add. We don't have to guess about the answer to your question. The short answer is yes, we expect continued improvement. Every quarter this year we've had major improvement of 16, 17, now 18 basis points year-over-year improvement, our best churn quarter of the year. But what's interesting is we can already study what happens when somebody has a 700 megahertz phone and 700 megahertz market with extended range LTE and the answer is a lot lower churn. So we are not guessing, we've already got millions of customers in the situation now that we've rapidly rolled out. Thanks to Neville and team being ahead of the curve. So we're very confident about our ability in the medium churn to continue closing that gap because of the data we are seeing every day. John Hodulik : Just a quick follow up on the JUMP! On Demand. As we look into the fourth quarter now obviously the holiday sales, big quarter for handsets. Should we expect JUMP! On Demand and EIP sort of flip in terms of majority sales you have a full quarter of the iPhone success, those are some of the pretty attractive plan that you have out there in the market. Michael Sievert : In short yes. I think you know the curve is JUMP! On Demand is our most popular offer. As Braxton said in the third quarter was only available on a very limited number of handsets. We'll be modestly expanding that, but they are most popular handsets. So I would expect in the fourth quarter the majority of handsets in that category will be on JUMP! On Demand and that's by far the most popular offer right now. John Legere : Again just I think it's going to be important that we certainly love to take shots the competition and we'll continue to do so on a daily basis. Just the question you have is related to AT&T insurance. So let's just keep the data the way it is and see what's happening. A year ago their postpaid voucher was 0.99 and then this year went to 1.16. Ours was 1.64 and it went to 1.46. So you can draw the trajectory of those and I think importantly as well in the year of 2015 the year that we are in over three quarter our postpaid phone editions are 2.6 million, AT&T's are -1.5 million and that's including the 300,000 that they won't tell us where they really came from. So let's just assume they come from this year. That's a 4 million customer swing so far and this trend is not new. If you take 11 quarter so you start with the beginning of 13, we have added 8.6 million postpaid phones and AT&T has lost 900,000. So this is the trend. We are very comfortable with where it's heading and as I said the porting ratio is with the AT&T have only got in better. So I think this with the re-segmenting up their business there is a piece of the business that they are interested in or they can compete in and we can have a broader discussion about content and video et cetera. But in this part of the business there really is a trend that's very, very positive from our stand point and will continue. John Hodulik : Okay, thanks guys. John Legere : Operator? Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Ric Prentiss with Raymond James. Ric Prentiss : Thanks. Obviously some very strong success on the customer size you are pointing out. John, the EBITDA growth is also impressive. I want to probe a little bit deeper on the EBITDA side though and the revenues. Braxton, you mentioned Data Stash has started to reverse, but you've seen some new deferrals. Can you help us understand a little bit as we look into the rest of '15 and then '16, does Data Stash become still a negative somehow? Braxton Carter : Yeah, the way Data Stash works we have a gap in the first quarter that we pull a reverse throughout the year. But as customers use the gap and into the normal deferral of revenue if they don't use their full allowance of data, there are additional non-cash deferrals that happen we receive the cash up front, but we don't recognize the revenue to later. So yes this construct will continue to grow but our projections is that the non-cash benefit of leasing will exceed the Data Stash. So there is upside to report EBITDA and as it becomes material will certainly be fully transparent as to the net of the two which is the non-cash benefit to EBITDA. Ric Prentiss : Okay and then as far as other trends with postpaid ARPU, the family plans and part of the promotional plans you put out there. What are the thoughts about where the trend lines are and in total on the reported ARPU line for postpaid. Braxton Carter : Yeah it's a great question Ric. We have continued the message and reiterated today that we have general stabilization of ARPU. Unlike you're seeing with all the other national players at this point. The good news we're fully penetrated on the base on EIP and we're seeing a lot of strong data attached. But we have an emphasis on obtaining the highest value of postpaid phone customers which are family plans. And in the third quarter we were very focused with our four for 120 offering, the 10 gigabytes for all and attracting additional families from AT&T and Verizon. And when you look at the metrics that we give on the number of devices per customer, you saw very nice for account you saw very nice uptake in the third quarter relating to those family plan promotions. And the bottom line as you have much better retention and lower sack costs so the NPV of those family plan additions to our business is significantly positive and accretive. And we're more than willing to take a little bit of dilution on ARPU to achieve that. But repulsive promotion in and out of the market. So that's why we really have the general stabilization you will see some quarters up slightly you can see some quarters down slightly. But we're generally stabilization. Michael Sievert : And Braxton and I'll just add that and we've said this in past quarter. So this is underscoring. The metrics to look are these account level metrics. And that's why we started disclosing in three quarters for you. That's how we model our business it's how you should be modeling us, and those are AD POP and ARPA. They're at all-time record highs and what that means is that our customers are paying more for their services at T-Mobile now in at any point in the company's history. That's a really important for everybody to understand. Now that's not because we're jacking up our prices it's because our customers are more involved with our services buying more from us paying us more than at any point in our company's history. And if you're modeling our company you've really got to look at that. And that's because as Braxton said the number of lines per account is at an all-time record high. John Legere : That's good but there are follow up question coming in? Ric Prentiss : Yeah if I could just on the prepaid ARPU side and how much usage you're providing into the prepaid whether it's 2 gig 5 gig just trying to understand term line on the prepaid ARPU as well given your success having customers there looking at ARPU and usage. Michael Sievert : Yeah I think if you look back over the last four or five quarters what you see is a generally stable trend with prepaid ARPU. We really like how this business contributes to our EBITDA at these levels. As you know the financials of the prepaid business are a lot less sensitive to churn in ARPU because the investment products per customer at a customer level are a lot lower. So this business is contributing very nicely to our overall EBITDA performance. And what you're seeing as we're holding on to these ARPUs generally speaking over the last five quarters we're massively growing this business with the leading brand in the space MetroPCS. John Legere : I'm going to jump over to a couple of the Twitter questions and then come back. And I want to acknowledge that wireless is in a full all out typing mode. And you actually have a number of questions I'd like to get to but I'm going to do one from you and Walt Piecyk and then there is a second industry structure question that Pierce has and I think it's quite good, but just a real quick touch maybe Micah, Braxton. Why did T-Mobile combined results for its wholesale in Q3 and how did M2M business actually perform? Braxton Carter : Yeah so very simply we're just confirming to the industry practice on disclosure of wholesales of category. Breaking out more detail showing competitive information that nobody else was so we discontinue the process, but we're very excited about our M2M business that continues to grow. We think it's a very significant future opportunity. Michael Sievert : Yeah. And just to head straight on the question, Pierce was asking where we're doing this to mask any weakness in one side or the other of that wholesale business MVNO or M2M. And the answer is emphatic no? This is what we've noticed are these two businesses are not two businesses. They are one business and their dynamics are similar even some of their revenue dynamics are similar. So just makes no sense to draw a distinction and to be the only one in the industry drawing that distinction. John Legere : Right. Walt Piecyk had a question, can we get never read a comment on network expense, how will network expense trend with MetroPCS done in 700 megahertz deployment and there was a couple of questions Walt in other Pierce had about how many POPs can we expect now by the end of the year since you've cruised into 300 million already. Braxton Carter : Yeah. Let's take the POPs question first. So, I can tell you we filled 300 today but we can't keep up with the pace and momentum. I've already requested 301. I know that as of yesterday. So by the end of the year I mean we're estimating somewhere in the 305 range which to put that into perspective for you is kind of the same as AT&T and Verizon near as them. The cool piece for us is the geographic expansion. We've more than doubled our LTE footprint year-to-date by the end of the year we'll have added a million square miles of LTE coverage across the US. So the pace and the reach of our LTE network John referenced fastest growing as well as the fastest it was pretty remarkable. And of course we're doing it ourselves. We built this footprint as T-Mobile not true acquisition or a combination of rural carriers. So that's scheduled to control of all of that is very much in our hands and we're deploying very, very fast. We have the great model and a great team. So expect more news for the end of the year and we'll certainly be piling on more POPs. In terms of the Metro question real quick I think it's easy to forget how quickly we combined two great businesses in Metro and T-Mobile into the last of the CDMA network was turned off when in July of this year a little over two years from when the two companies came together and of course we've grown remarkably both companies both brands customer basis. But that spectrum is being put to great use with our wide band LTE 260 markets in our sites for the end of the year from 245 today and across the cost structure back to Walt's question full run rate synergies will be delivered a well over a year ahead of plan. We will hit those fully in 2016. That numbers well north of a billion. I think we were conservative in our overall synergy estimates when we looked and put this deal together several years ago now and our run rate there is in the 9 billion to 10 billion range for the year for the full deal. So tremendous progress with Metro and of course tremendous progress on the LTE roll out. John Legere : Okay. And I'm going to do one more Pierce question I'm going to go back to the calls. It sounds like we may need to have a separate Pierce phone call but it just I'll kind of open this and if there are follow-up questions and pieces of it I'd be glad to take them. One of the questions was do you expect companies like Google, Comcast, Charter et cetera to bid in the 600 auction? How will this effect T-Mobile in the industry? This is one of several industry structure question that I find fascinating things that are going to make the next 6 to 12 months just a really fascinating time period, I would add some of the things that Verizon and AT&T are attempting to do in video et cetera which I'll comment on. And I guess my answer is I do expect some dark horses to show up. And I think the dark horses showing up is nothing more than clarity for what we all are expecting is in industry that I've said many times that if the world believes that has all content will find its way to the internet and all internet will be viewed mobily. If we really believe that that structure will be managed by four wireless carriers vertically integrating and reverse and horizontally moving into the rest of these industry. It's crazy. So you think about what Verizon just did with Go90 launching a curated video service that nobody asked for coming out in week one number 220 app in the Apple Store and then shrinking after four weeks to 1,065 that\u2019s clearly not going to fly and it\u2019s not going to be their bridge to profitability in 2017. Serial TV sold in a cross-selling basis when your phone business is completely declining is not a strategy. And I think we saw Comcast discussed this morning tipping its toe in and using some optimality it may have to look at Wi-Fi on a MVNO basis and I think these are all just everybody looking at where they may go. The benefit that T-Mobile has right now is that we have the fastest growing brand and the fastest growing business with generating good cash flow we have a very strong business standalone but we are also a fascinating component in that continuum because we do control all the growth in the best brand in the mobile piece and as you look forward two to three years we will be far more thoughtful about how things move forward. So we are looking forward to being successful in the auction. We are also being - we are looking forward to that and other things that are going to shed some light as to where people are going and unlike dumb and dumber we don\u2019t see these at a threat we are waiting for this vibrant industry to consolidate itself around players like ourselves to have a significant presence. So thanks for that question. I am sure that opens quite a few others. Let\u2019s go back to the calls. Operator : And we will take our next question from Amir Rosledowski [ph] with Barclays. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you very much. John actually touching upon that last comment that you made. I would love to hear your thoughts on how you think MVNO strategy could impact the market, particularly one that leans on Wi-Fi as a primary means for data consumption. Obviously there has been some debates you folks have and willingness to work with other types of third-party providers in providing such types of services. I would love to hear your thoughts on that? John Legere : I think in general there is a few thoughts, right, one is certainly this quarter\u2019s earnings suggested that one of the bigger MVNOs and Track Bonus and doing too well. It\u2019s a tough model. There are owner economics and I certainly think that if anybody has significant scale they would want owner economics. I am pretty sure that in the long term strategy of a player like Comcast they didn\u2019t have a strategic board meeting and say hey, let us be an MVNO they are thinking of what\u2019s happening with their business and what\u2019s the natural evolution and they have a put option on the table, they have an old historical agreement that probably neither them but Verizon thought about using, why not use it. It\u2019s a nice next step - in the water but the question is could you ever see a long term future where being an MVNO through Verizon is the strategy that Comcast will use for mobility without owner economic et cetera. I find that hard to believe but by the way if they did than what I do quickly is I along with Washington realized we now have five carriers not four. And by the way if Google 5 doesn't say the same thing now we have six, then you have a different perspective of what the options are and then the question really starts to be on a Wi-Fi only model or an MVNO model which you find value proposition to your customers that by going even further and having owner economics and a retail brand known for wireless could that be a better way to create growth and vibrancy in the future of course. So I think that\u2019s a natural amongst the things that we will learn in the next year and of course they are not alone, Comcast is in a highly competitive market with other players who are now watching what they are doing and thinking about what their alternatives are in order to compete with their first MVNO what will they do? So I think it\u2019s going to be fascinating. It\u2019s part of what we have been predicting for a while. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you very much. And I could do one follow-up question. Obviously we saw a pretty strong milestone with respect to your cash flow generation this quarter, how should we think about the pace of sort of cash generation going forward. Particularly as you balance the need to continue to invest in the network, the need to raise additional capital in order to support your network expansion as well as for the competitive framework and dynamics that are taking place? Braxton Carter : Amir [ph], I mean I think it\u2019s a great question. We have a management team that is completely aligned around value creation for all of our shareholders and the management team that totally understands that the key to that valuation is generating on sustainable increasing cash flows. And quite frankly the future is bright, with the ramp of that we\u2019re getting from a growth standpoint translating to double-digit revenue increases on the service side translating into astronomical increases and the EBITDA 42% up year-over-year as the mid-point of our guidance at 25% for the full year versus 2014. The future is bright. If you also look at the fact that we\u2019ve been pivoting our capital dollars and you\u2019ve heard us say that we see no catalyst for a significant step function up in CapEx deployment nor do we see a catalyst based upon our success of any significant decreases in CapEx. We will continue to invest, strengthen our network, expand geographically and bring more value to this faster 4G LTE network in the country. But with that said you look at all the pieces, you look at what we\u2019re doing from a working capital standpoint and on a levered basis we\u2019re going to generate significant cash this year and that just gets better in the future. I will say that we\u2019ve been very transparent in our ND&A we do plan on executing an EIP securitization in the fourth quarter. The amount will be less than 1 billion but it\u2019s part of our whole working capital management and that\u2019ll be good enough when it comes from that all so. John Legere : Okay I'm going to jump to a quick Twitter messages coming in from Jim Patterson, so you may know Jim\u2019s got a weekly newsletter that he sent and it\u2019s usually great except what he can\u2019t forget that he used to work with Sprint and got a little carried away with that. Are you guys getting a lot of ads through Apple Stores what\u2019s your take on their lease strategy? Michael Sievert : Yeah I can start, as we said when Apple announced that strategy in Apple Stores, we really like it. We think anything that can simplify things for customers is a good thing. I personally I\u2019d love to see them really focus on Apple Stores. We were surprised that there was one of many options but it\u2019s really great that to have them. I think it levels the playing field in the Apple Store and as a result what we\u2019ve seen is that we believe we\u2019re the fastest growing by far through that channel. I will say it\u2019s a great quarter for us than the third quarter on iPhone. It\u2019s a great quarter overall, the - people are interested in iPhones with an all-time record high we don\u2019t disclose the specific numbers but we still have more iPhones in the third quarter than at any point in our history and the highest percentage of our sales where iPhones at any point in our history in the third quarter so that\u2019s fueled by mostly what happens in our own stores that\u2019s our number one channel but we had a really nice development in Apple Stores as well. John Legere : Okay back to the phone. Operator : And we will take our next question from Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson. Please proceed. Craig Moffett : Hi I want to return to this topic of your expansion in the LTE network how much of that is expanding in order to provide additional roaming coverage and how much of that is sufficiently been so you\u2019re now really opening up those markets and as you think about opening in new markets and footprint expansion can you talk about where we are with respect to starting to put some retail prices in those markets and some marketing prices in those markets to now try to normalize market share in the places where you haven\u2019t been before? John Legere : Perfect, Neville do you want to clarify the first part it\u2019s not roaming and then Mike can talk about the retail strategy? Neville Ray : Yeah I mean obviously the expansion in terms of Footprint has been very rapid and that\u2019s allowing our customers to experience great LTE in many-many more places they travel to. We constantly are working on roaming relationships to improving those and the quality and capability of those. What we\u2019re laying down in much of this geography is a low band spectrum that we talked about earlier on the call. The coverage is great. It\u2019s not just a roaming story thus far remember that the improvement in our existing markets with low band is also remarkable in terms of in building and capability. Where we sit today? I mean the team is working hard on one getting that coverage layer really robust, really strong and distribution to come in behind as we look at the best markets in \u201816, I'll hand back to Mike I think in terms of the distribution plans but we're laying the ground what for that for next year. Michael Sievert : And Craig just to your at your question about the roaming, let me take you something back to what John said, we're adding this year 1 million square miles of coverage. You think about that and this is a country with something like 3.2 million square miles in the entire country. This year alone, our network thanks to Neville and team is growing by million. And that's just placing some roaming agreements that we've got that we won't need, but it's mostly just Greenfield of new build and the effect of extended range of LTE trends make twice. John Legere : Part of the question was you using the word roaming the 300 million POPs of LTE do not include roaming. Braxton Carter : No roaming at all. John Legere : That's our native coverage. So if you think about from a distribution standpoint that's just tremendous opportunity for us to go into the edges of cities where we haven't have distribution or new cities entirely. Now don't expect hundreds of new stores from us all in one year. We're going to be really strategic about where is the best business opportunity so we need our great ROI on our capital investments and when we show you our capital numbers every year there is always a plan for a strategic retail expansion in the right areas which this year there are some great areas to go tackle as well as modernizing and updating our stores to make sure that we've got the very best ones in the industry. Okay? Craig Moffett : Thank you. Operator : And we will go next to Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Brett Feldman : Thanks for taking the question I want to go back to some of the comments earlier about the MetroPCS cost synergies and Neville's expectation that will be include the high year end. To what extent are some of those cost savings already in the run rate? Because based on the July shutdown of the CDMA network, it would see as we go into early next year there could potentially be a fairly meaningful step up in the savings or I guess maybe a step down in your spending. Braxton Carter : Yeah let me take that, first of all as Neville said, the OpEx synergies are roughly $1 billion the CapEx synergies are $0.5 billion. So the run-rate synergies that will hit in early '16 are over $1.5 billion. So very significant benefit. And Brett as we decommission these networks, it takes fitting were from 3 to 6 months and you can see from our disclosures, we still have a significant amount of decommissioning that happened in the fourth quarter. We have not quantified the exact amount because it's in ever changing metrics. And I think that same to focus on is that yes there is benefit that's being layered in there will be incremental benefit in the fourth quarter, but we're really going to not be at that run rate into 2016. But it is part of the equation what you're seeing happening with our cost-to-service. Our cost-to-service has been trending down and significantly down as a percent of revenue. And that's not only the MetroPCS synergies but that's the scale of a lot of fixed cost and the efficiency that Neville and his team have rolled out the modernization and the expansion opportunities that we have. And that's the great thing about that low band spectrum. Neville has told us they said few is [ph] doing from the expansion that we did this year. He'd be putting up five macro sites for every one site that we're having to put up with the 700 megahertz A block. So very excited about that. Brett Feldman : So just a follow up, I mean are you actually reinvesting in some of those synergies. You will just see that the potential for cost service maybe stepped down at some time next year would be there once you get to the full run rate, but I don't want to extrapolate something that's we're not thinking about it correctly. Braxton Carter : So I think what I would focus on is that we're also continuing to expand the geographical coverage of our network. Eliminating that historical disadvantage that we've had well over million square miles of coverage this year. And will go further next year we have Verizon's network is now let 308 million 4G LTE. Neville just said it were at 301. We want to eliminate that differential. And there is additional cost. So yes we are reinvesting part of those synergies and please do keep that in mind. Brett Feldman : Okay. And thanks for taking the question. John Legere : Operator? Operator : And we will take our next question from John Atkin [ph] with RBC Capital markets. Unidentified Analyst : Yes. I wonder if you can comment on your LTE network having reached on its full coverage with the priorities will be for next year and then more specifically on the AWS3 spectrum and what you've seen in terms of timeline as to when next to builds out? Thank you. Braxton Carter : Let's take the latter part first. So on AWS3 the timing for really infrastructure to come into the market place is mid to late next year. So potential deployment and the 16 timeframe probably like what we're seeing on the handset size is really a 17 story, so with 16 into 17 where activity will pick up and I think you'll see some of the other big too kind of playing on similar timeframes. Was there second part, what is the first part? Unidentified Analyst : Yeah, I mean with coverage now almost completed, what you're doing in terms of identification so was putting that type of things. Braxton Carter : Yeah. Well it's I mean next year is a combination of two things right? One we want to continue to advance the footprint and to enhance the footprint and some of these new areas where we're laying down - show 700 megahertz. So continued our delay we've got new POPs now coming through with new A block to run at. So you will continue to see us strengthen our coverage both in new areas and within the existing footprint. Everybody is doing very much the same. And then from a capacity perspective that's the other focus for us. Obviously we're in a great position. We have more spectrum per customer than the big two, we have a very, very efficient network, thankfully through the MetroPCS combination, a ton of LTE spectrum that we've applied to an extremely dense network that puts us in a very, very good place to leverage that capacity going forward. We also I'd tell you we have the most advanced LTE network in the US today categorically. We're driving key efficiencies are move into voice of our LTE into the RCS space with advanced messaging, video over LTE what we're doing on Wi-Fi, carrier aggregation, high rolled MiMO, and whole host of technique terms that throughout there. But there are all driven by performance improvements as well as driving greater capacity and capability on the network. We are the fastest today. We've been effectively for the best part of the last two years. We look to maintain that performance and speed as we look at 2016 but we will start to move on small sale strategy some of those pieces we've not been in the huge rush. The much of our competition has been some unsuccessfully I'd add because of the benefit of the spectrum and the density of the network that we have which to be quite frank in the NV of all of our competitors at this point in time. So busy year ahead on '16 always much to do but with a great '15 in the bag already with the 300 million POPs underway at completed. John Legere : Okay let me take one question, was there a... Unidentified Analyst : Yeah. Just for Braxton real quick if there is a way to quantify the extent savings that you're seeing on the run rate basis and then if there is a way to kind of characterize ensuring differential between your 700 and non-700 markets you've talked about at the substantial but anything way to put a little bit more clarity behind that. Braxton Carter : Yeah. So from a roaming standpoint we've never had end market roaming. So you have never seen a material roaming expense at T-Mobile unlike you know an entity like Sprint that has end market roaming. And I think at one point there are paying Verizon over a billion a year, about a half billion blast numbers I saw on that. Ours is significantly less than that. It is a benefit but I would not look at it as a material mover of the overall financial. There is lots of puts and takes but it is a benefit but we're reinvesting that benefit in geographical expansion. So that's the way that I take look at it. The churn profile on the 700 megahertz were just really starting to see improvements. Last that I saw we have over 15 million band 12 compatible handsets in the marketplace at this point and Neville and his team as you have seen are going like hell in rolling that out. But the benefit really is to come. We're just getting critical mass on this that will continue to develop and we believe that will be some very nice tailwinds when we're working at customer retention. John Legere : And a quick question on Twitter, I don't think we'd be able to do justice but we'll make a quick comment on it, from Lionel Barrow when OEMs create phones but sell them on online retailers both from their own website do you consider that a slight to you. Kind of I don't want to talk about that myopically as if there were somebody that just won't sell through T-Mobile, but we love remember we are ones that have transformed the business model away from OEMs hiding behind service contracts and artificially the high prices in contract. So we love the ability for all of sorts of cool devices to be sold in any different ways including our retail channels and used on our network. We certainly are the beneficiary of a much more open device selling process than the historical ones. On the other hand, we have as you all been a part of one of the best branded retail channels in any industry right now. And frankly I'll just take the flipside, I can't think of any good model where an OEM has for good reason created an exclusive sale on their own product and been successful and for the stand. So I won't tick down the list from Fire phone down, but certainly there is a lot more history that suggest that the retail channels work better. But we love if somebody wants to for example buy a Windows phone from the new Microsoft store and use that on T-Mobile what a great idea. Okay let's go back to the dial in questions. Operator : And we will take our next question from Mike McCormack with Jefferies. Michael McCormack : Hey guys thanks Braxton maybe to say a comment on the EBITDA guide for the full year. I guess a little surprising in raise that it looks like EBITDA could be flat sequentially and it would be at the high end been with the incremental synergies and obviously the - revenue coming in as well. And then just a second thing EIP versus the inventory fees. Should we be looking in those two sort of another dig in net based that's been in aggregate basis to really going to better view on cash headwinds. Braxton Carter : Yeah I think first of all on EBITDA I want to clarify that the EBITDA guidance we're giving is cash EBITDA before any benefits on a non-cash basis from leasing or Data Stash. There will definitely be goodness that we see for the year. But at this point we stuck with the original organic guidance that we've given. As to the non-cash we're fully penetrated from an EIP standpoint. And again I want to point out that our net receivables on EIP actually have decreased where collections on EIP have now outstripped road. So we're in a very different place than AT&T, Verizon and Sprint which are a still penetrating their bases and having goodness accrue to them from that. We're actually in the reverse situation that where our collections are outstripping. So we believe it's more than a fair disclosure on non-cash by just taking leasing and Data Stash. Michael Sievert : And Mike if you are asking about whether or not you can add the two and get a view if that's our working capital impact. The short answer is no really, so if you look at the EIP receivables base, that's net of the deposits that people make in cash and about half of our customers make a deposit of some sort give or take. So the EIP balances have always been a function of that that $822 million that we disclosed to you which moved from inventory to property and equipment and that's since the value of all the leased devices was the value of all those phones but a lot of those people paid cash deposits which is not in that line item. So you really can't sum the two and make it a proxy for what it would have been if there was all EIP is that make sense. Michael McCormack : No that does I guess just the follow up on that the $1 billion for securitization you guys are talking about in Q4. What was the rationale for the change in view there or is that just as things developed overtime. Braxton Carter : Yeah well it will actually be a less than billion. But we've been focused on just not something in the marketplace see what's in the low advanced rates and a higher cost to capital. And what we will be executing will be very efficient cost to capital given the tenure of what we are doing with a very high advanced rate, really leading the industry on how efficient we are utilizing as receivables that we are taking into secularization. So definitely more to come on that, but that execution will definitely happen in the fourth quarter and it makes a lot of funds given what we are at. Michael McCormack : Understood. Thanks guys. Operator : And we will go next to Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Simon Flannery : Thank you very much. Good morning. The FCC recently launched another investigation into special access looking at things like some of these multiyear contracts. I was wondering if you could just talk about that issue and what the potential opportunities are if the FCC does indeed kind of make some changes to that, thanks. Neville Ray : Yeah, I see the FCC starting to make noise about attacking some of the right structure this been out there on the fixed side for some time. For us, I mean to be quite frank we result our back old problem for our sales sides several years ago. We embossed on a fiber to the sales strategy. Its 5 years ago. And that's been a huge help for us with our LTE roll out, not only that we run fiber, I mean we run very scalable fiber and great deals behind that which have hugely helped us with the flat cost structure we have been delivering to the business. So it will be interesting to see what comes out of this FCC process, much of what we've been doing on expanding the footprint has driven us into obviously more rural parts of America and is tougher to find. So that's less of the special access issue I think. I think the fight is primarily with some of the big fix guys and one of the other wireless guys not so much on battle to fight on this one Simon and we are in a good place already. Simon Flannery : Okay. And just a quick follow up. If we continue to see you putting up some very good speed numbers and spends talking about getting the speeds up. But what's the right goal for your network over the next couple of years. What do you want to be delivering on average to the customer? Neville Ray : The fastest. John Legere : Neville's not competitive. Simon Flannery : Anytime soon or is this still going to be in the 18's 20's on average? Braxton Carter : Today we stayed around this 20 megabit per second, Mark has measured through UKLA for best part of two years and every quarter goes by I think we hear noise about competition is going to come close, the sprint guys will do something, I mean they are just over half of our average speed nationally right now. So they have the big, big hill to climb, AT&T too. Verizon has been close, but can't close that gap and so why want to maintain it. We have actually been improving our speeds quarter-on-quarter. So with a lot of capacity being carried by the network we continue with our wide band LTE roll out and a bunch of the LTE features that I referenced. Things like high roll to MiMO adding those self-performance and capacity to the network as this carry rag and they continue drive contiguous spectrum. So we want to stay in a leadership position on speed. It gives us some great bragging rights which we are very proud of, if you want the best LTE speeds and performance in the nation, come to T-Mobile. That's the great story that we look to maintain. Where does speeds go in '16 and '17, I think it's going to be a function of competitive intensity, load, how well we do with roll out of new capabilities, new features, new spectrum across. But we look to maintain the leadership position and great story for us to be increasing speed performance on an average basis with the tremendous growth that we have supported with our customer base expansion. John Legere : I think it's a very important to note. For example, it was 7 quarters ago that we announced the nation\u2019s fastest 4G LTE certainly I'm sure to the grin of very well endowed with lawyers companies who if they could prove anything different would have and try every day Neville is highly competitive. I think what you have so far the biggest issue that you see change in 2015 is a significant number of the geographies as we say over the year a million square miles of new LTE coverage. You got a lot of people that either going from no coverage at all to really fast coverage or slow coverage to very fast coverage and then obviously with leadership position that Neville announced it\u2019s one more quarter that I haven\u2019t seen me add yet but I think better equal slower is the commercial that would have to be run right now. Michael Sievert : And one last commercial on this which is we talk a lot of speeding, you asked about speed, at a certain point once you got have a speed in our range there are other things that matter just as much and think about something we don\u2019t talk about a lot which is how fast our network responds the latency. We\u2019re the fastest responding network and once you can stream let\u2019s say a 4K high res video which takes about 16 megabits per second, the marginal benefit of being faster is at least on par with other things were obsessed with and when you\u2019re browsing around the Internet and you touch things on your screen you want that network to respond immediately and Neville and team have built the fastest responding LTE network in the country as well so we\u2019re obsessed with the total customer experience. Braxton Carter : Just as I mentioned we\u2019re about, our latency is about 15% faster than the other three wireless competitors in the market place today so it\u2019s a material gap. John Legere : I think it\u2019s a good winner though a big winner is in the United States right now consumers are winning. And I think we\u2019ve caused a competition to invest in your network and get speed and let\u2019s this maybe the second time this call and history may be made that I give Sprint credit is the bottom of the pack is moving up. The pack is closing so on an improvement basis, certainly they\u2019ve done well as well so that\u2019s good for the overall country that all wireless carriers are investing heavily in their networks that is except by the way for their big wireless holder spectrum dish who has been given a lot of waver by the FCC on utilization of some of the spectrum for satellite so there could be used to create a competitive environment in the U.S. and so far it has put to work exactly no amount of that spectrum and I think that\u2019s an interesting variable to keep an eye on because I think with the four wireless carriers Washington certainly was expecting to create more competition with those wavers and so far I'm still waiting to see that as well. But that is, that\u2019s one I was trying to way in the beginning of this compliment to some of the progress we\u2019re just making. Simon Flannery : Thanks a lot. Operator : And we will take our next question from Jonathan Chaplin with New Street Research. Unidentified Analyst : Hi there this is Brett [ph] for Jonathan thanks for taking the question. Two if I could, what prove the disorientation and postpaid phone net adds in the sort of back half of September and what\u2019s driving the sequential ARPU decline with expected ARPU progress throughout the year so just wondering what the trends are on that front? Thanks. John Legere : Yeah I\u2019ll start and let Mike pop in. there\u2019s no, you can\u2019t - it\u2019s pretty hard to call our postpaid numbers a decline or a slowdown and the issue really is you probably looking at what September must have been because I made certain discussions and with 12 days left. The issue within September, the issue with August is our biggest month so August is a huge gigantic month so that\u2019s deceleration. We also had that certain promos that were ineffective went up in September and we had some new ones that came in October so that\u2019s really the issue. But as we say August gigantic the quarter was very strong, the momentum right now is very clear and if you\u2019re trying to look at that couple of weeks in September that\u2019s really the explanation. But I wouldn\u2019t call it a deceleration. And on the ARPU the most important thing as we said is ARPU is basically flat. But it\u2019s kind of in line with what we\u2019d expect for the expansion that\u2019s taking place. We moved up to an average number of customers on an account of just under 2.5 so we\u2019re closing the gap on Verizon and others and their family plan. And then if you look at the average billing current account, it\u2019s an all-time high for us. And I think that\u2019s the most important some of the way we\u2019ve run our business has caused an expansion in the family programs broader number of accounts, flatter ARPU but broader and stronger all-time high in the average billing per account. Michael Sievert : And Jonathan one thing to add to that it\u2019s kind of interesting, as you know we\u2019ve had we have the highest lines per account we\u2019ve ever had in those family plans are highly profitable and the marginal lines are highly profitable but of course there is suppressive to that ARPU metric which isn\u2019t indicative of our EBITDA development because our EBITDA was 42% year-over-year and so what I want you to know is our data attach which is one of the real markers of customer value that we look at on our activation flow in Q3 was at an all-time high. And so when we talk about our average billings per account being at an all-time high and our customers being more involved with our services. That's something to look at. When customers come and activate with us at retail they're getting data attached more often now than at any point in our company's historically. John Legere : Okay operator, I think we'll probably take one more we'll take one more question from the phone. Operator : Okay and we will take our next question from Michael Rollins with Citi. Michael Rollins : Hi, thanks for taking the questions. two if I could, first can you talk a bit more the higher looking at 4Q marketing strategy and your approach to the deep reality of this business given with your preference was the year ago where you instead of be more aggressive in 4Q you talk more aggressive of that being more aggressive in the first quarter. And the second thing I was curious guys do you track reporting ratios for smart phones and how to think about the share gains of more strategic customers within the postpaid segment. Thanks. John Legere : Mike the answer is no, not really I'm not going to give you a color on how we're going to unfold the next three months, because it's competitively sensitive. Couple of things John told you that in the last 7 days our porting was higher than Q3. So we've got nice momentum developing right now and we've got a great game plan for the rest of the quarter and we're going to leave it with surprise for our competitors if that's okay. So that's on that topic. We haven't very deliberate seasonality strategy so we bring about these moments on purpose like August this year where deliberately we drove what was so far the highest month of the year. Michael Sievert : Yeah the second question smartphone. John Legere : Yeah I think the second question may we can answer back it sounded almost as if a backend way to help us look into our porting and our customer migrations from a type of customers smartphone or and I want to amplify because I think some of that's get caused by I think when AT&T announced earnings they said they were focused on profitable customers and not chasing those other customers that are non-profitable. But I'm still trying to understand how you train a sales force in a store to profile somebody when they walk in to ask them if they're profitable. But I think Mike I asked that question. The short answer is there is no significant porting at non-smartphones. So almost our entire base smartphones almost our entire flow of smartphones and porting is skewed even more. So people with non-smartphones tend to let their number go at a higher rate than the smartphone customer. So it's a non-material impact at all. Michael Rollins : Thanks very much. John Legere : There is I can't help but noticed that the next question that I wasn't going to take there is only going to take one more but it does happened to be you Walt so let's take one last question from Walt Piecyk. Walt Piecyk : Are you sure you want to do that John? John Legere : Of course I do. Walt Piecyk : Okay. On Uncarrier 10 everything as you guys have talked about in the past is doubling - but this when I guess is in - is there something new you've already talked about pinpoints, but with there being in LA can you give us some hint whether this is going to be something on the mobile video front. John Legere : While we can give you a handset it's going to be warm, the weather will be nice. And I think the only obviously we're not going to give any input on it well the recent right now. You know what I will say Paul. Walt Piecyk : Is it at least something as appose to maybe what you're talking about the force part that not with the other stuff was in new, but I was more of a have you talked doubling down on past successful strategies. Is this more... John Legere : So couple of things, what we've been doing lately ramping up past one. This will not be an amp. We've been very protective of the Uncarrier being something that solves pinpoints and frankly we've been very protective because there is been at least one or two moves lately where people have said you guys running out of steam are there less pinpoints. I can tell you that this one is solidly in the zone of when we created the idea I even said this thing gigantic can we really do that and I can't wait to announce so it's not only one of those ones that I think our competitors are absolutely going to piss their pants on. I mean it's really going to if they're not worried, they should really worry, because they've got till November 10th to really be in trouble. And when we do it we're going to do it in the large way that such an uncarrier move commence. So Uncarrier X will be worth your time well. I would actually go out there now and get your front row seat. Walt Piecyk : I mean now that's getting cold here that's probably not a bad idea so. I'll see you there. Braxton Carter : Okay. John Legere : Well we appreciate everybody's dialing in. I think there is a lot of follow on discussion we should have. But two things that I like to do before we close the call. There in this last quarter as I'm also struck by the strength of the MetroPCS results, the incredible progress that our teams have made being here at the NASDAQ launching the business together. Sadly in the quarter the just past the founder of MetroPCS, Roger Linquist passed away. And I would just like to take some, a moment on this call to acknowledge one of the real pioneers in this industry and somebody that was well loved and respected who is no longer with us and have this call and the great results of Metro use it as a tribute to Roger and those that those of you that knew him. And with that we look forward to seeing you at Uncarrier 10 and then we look forward to coming back and talking about Q4 results soon after. All right, thank you operator. Operator : Thank you sir. And ladies and gentlemen this concludes the T-Mobile US third quarter 2015 conference call. If you have any further questions, you may contact Investor Relations or media departments. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect and have a pleasant day.",

Following opening remarks, the earnings call will be opened for questions via the conference line, Twitter or text message. Those interested in submitting questions during the earnings call through Twitter can do so by tweeting @TMobileIR using the hashtag TMUSearnings or send a text message to 313-131, enter the keyword TMUS followed by a space. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Nils Paellmann, Head of Investor Relations for T-Mobile US. Please go ahead, sir. Nils Paellmann - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you. Good morning. Welcome to T-Mobile's fourth quarter and full year 2015 earnings call. With me today are John Legere, our President and CEO; Braxton Carter, our CFO; and other members of the senior leadership team. Let me briefly read the disclaimer. During this call, we will make projections and statements about the future performance of the company, which are based on current expectation and assumptions. Our Form 10-K, which was also published today, includes risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Reconciliations between GAAP and the non-GAAP results we discuss on this call can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website. Let me now turn it over to John Legere. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Welcome to T-Mobile's fourth quarter and full year 2015 Un-carrier earnings call, as well as open Twitter conference. We're coming to you live from our new signature store, which is right here in the heart of Times Square at 46th and Broadway. So, if you are waiting to go to a T-Mobile store, you can't say you didn't know where to find one. We are again providing a live video stream, which I gently remind my colleagues here, so you can watch all the action behind the scenes on YouTube and because we're happy to add some light entertainment, even at our own expense, to earnings. So, we published our own version of the earnings drinking game yesterday, and it's all about T-Mobile. So, that's right. Get your favorite morning beverage and play along. If you can't laugh at yourself, then you might as well be Verizon. I mean, it's early. I've got my iced coffee here for every time one of us happens to slip and say, dumb and dumber. Today, we're going to go through the same Q&A approach as we have in the past. And to accommodate all your questions, this call would last up to 90 minutes, assuming you need the time. Taking questions via Twitter, text and on the phone. So, with that, let me get into some of the highlights. Q4 was another great quarter for T-Mobile, and our results show that the business is firing on all cylinders. We successfully balanced customer growth with profitability and our financial results speak for themselves. Our customer growth is very clearly translating to revenue growth, which has led to adjusted EBITDA growth and now yielding growth in free cash flow. Our model's working. And this success allows us to invest in things that will fuel more growth in the future, like our network, spectrum, additional Un-carrier moves and customer care. Let me take a quick step back and look at the results of the quarter. Our 2.1 million total net adds in Q4 mark 11 consecutive quarters of more than 1 million. And it also is in six of the last eight quarters we've added more than 2 million. We also added 1.3 million branded postpaid customers. By the way, this is the sixth consecutive quarter and seven of the last eight that we gained more than 1 million. In Q4, we added 917,000 branded postpaid phone net customers, more than twice our closest competitor. By the way, for those of you keeping score, that eight quarters in a row that we've led the entire industry in postpaid phone additions. We blew past the competition and captured all of the industry's postpaid phone growth again in 2015. And let me remind you that this was a very competitive quarter. Also in prepaid, where we have the industry's biggest and best prepaid brands, we added 469,000 new customers. And during the same quarter, Verizon lost 157,000 prepaid customers and Sprint lost 0.5 million prepaid customers. Now, big news is we're not just winning customers, we're keeping them too. Branded postpaid phone churn in Q4 was down 27 basis points to 1.46% and unchanged from Q3. Q4 was the best year-over-year churn reduction for us in 2015. Now, like I said, we're delivering very strong financial metrics too. In keeping with our promise to balance growth with profits, we were able to deliver year-over-year double-digit service revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth, again this quarter, of 11.7% and 30.2% respectively. How did the competition do? AT&T was the best in service revenue growth with 1.7%. Oh, sorry, that's negative 1.7%. And Verizon was minus 5.6%. And both of these guys appear to be harvesting cash and could not come close to matching our 30.2% growth in adjusted EBITDA. Q4 marked the 11 quarter in a row with overall positive postpaid porting ratios. Our momentum continues in the first quarter. We're seeing positive postpaid porting against all of our competitors again. Our incredible growth has been fueled by America's fastest 4G LTE network, which is also the fastest growing. Neville and his team have managed to more than double our geographic 4G LTE footprint in 2015. Now, we have 305 million 4G LTE POPs covered and we continue to close in on Verizon. Customers know it and Verizon knows it. Just take a look at their ads. Could you ever have imagined that Verizon would be running attack ads at T-Mobile just a few years ago? I would have to tell you we find it to be absolutely fantastic. We've now had, by the way, the fastest 4G LTE network for eight quarters in a row and Wideband is our making our blazing 4G LTE data speeds even faster and no one has or will dispute that. Our deployment of extended range LTE on 700 megahertz A-Block spectrum is way ahead of schedule. More than 300 markets are live, covering approximately 190 million people. And customers are seeing the benefit, but don't take our word for it. Go online and check out #BallBusterChallenge and see it for yourself and you could possibly, but unlikely make a little money. And of course, we're not stopping there. We've entered into agreements we announced with a number of companies for the acquisition of additional 700 megahertz A-Block spectrum licenses to add to our arsenal. These acquisitions, which total about 48 million POPs, will further improve our low-band spectrum holdings and will take our low-band portfolio from 210 million POPs to approximately 258 million POPs. Our track record, by the way, demonstrates that we will rapidly deploy this spectrum upon closing to get this in the hands of customers. By the way, it only took us 20 months to deploy the first 190 million POPs, and I can only imagine what the team can do with this new spectrum. These acquisitions, along with our strong financial position, will allow us to be prudent and pragmatic as we continue to build on our low-band spectrum position. We said a number of times that we plan to participate in the incentive auction, and we look forward to a successful outcome. Finally, we continue to be a leader in customer service. And proudly, we were just ranked number one again in the J.D. Power Wireless Customer Care Study. That makes it three of the last four award periods that T-Mobile has come out on top, and our team is killing it. Americans continue to respond and switch to the Un-carrier. We are still completely focused on making wireless better for customers. Our Q4 numbers show the huge effect our moves to having on the industry. In summary, 2015 was another great year for T-Mobile. We added customers in record numbers for the second year in a row and outperformed the industry in service revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth. We delivered on our 2015 guidance, demonstrating for a second straight year our ability to successfully balance strong growth and profitability. T-Mobile continues to deliver strong customer growth that is driving solid financials in a climate where the competition continues to struggle to match our results. Quarter-after-quarter, we continue to win the hearts and minds of customers, and they're staying with us because we're delivering. Our business model is resilient, it's working, and we aren't going to let up. Let me now hand it over to our CFO, Braxton Carter, for key financial highlights and full-year 2016 guidance. Braxton? J. Braxton Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Hey. Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. We're so excited to be here again telling you about the excellent execution of having a growth platform translating to double-digit increases in recurring EBITDA, which translates into significant ramping cash flows in the future. Let me give you a quick snapshot of our strong financial results and exciting full-year 2016 guidance. Let's start with the financial results for the fourth quarter and for the full year. Our customer growth is translating into strong financial growth as we once again delivered industry-leading metrics. Service revenues grew by 11.7% and adjusted EBITDA came in at $2.3 billion in the fourth quarter, up 30.2% year-over-year. The adjusted EBITDA margin expanded from 30% in the fourth quarter of last year to a strong 35% this year. For the full year, adjusted EBITDA amounted to $7.4 billion, up 31.2% year-over-year. This includes the impact from leasing and Data Stash of $158 million. Therefore, we exceeded our full-year guidance of $6.8 billion to $7.2 billion, which excluded the impact from leasing and Data Stash. Free cash flow, adjusted for non-reoccurring MetroPCS decommissioning payments, amounted to $897 million in the fourth quarter and more than $1 billion in the full year of 2015. Free cash flow in the fourth quarter benefited from the cash inflow of $795 million from the securitization of EIP receivables in Q4. Even excluding this cash inflow, adjusted free cash flow was positive for both the quarter and the year, indicating that we've reached an inflection point with regard to free cash flow even with the interest carry on the additional $4 billion of debt raised in the fourth quarter to fund the upcoming spectrum auction. Free cash flow in the quarter was impacted by higher cash CapEx, which amounted to $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter and $4.7 billion for the year, reflecting the continued investment in the expansion of our 4G LTE network. Note that cash CapEx included $246 million of capitalized interest. Excluding capitalized interest, cash CapEx amounted to $4.5 billion in 2015, towards the lower end of the guidance range of $4.4 billion to $4.7 billion. Net income and earnings per share were up strongly year-over-year. Let me now come to our 2016 guidance. Our target for branded postpaid net customer additions is 2.4 million to 3.4 million. In typical Un-carrier fashion, we're starting the year off conservatively and we will adjust the target in future quarters when appropriate. For adjusted EBITDA, our target is $9.1 billion to $9.7 billion, implying continued robust growth. Our EBITDA target includes an aggregate impact from leasing and Data Stash of $0.7 billion to $1 billion. The underlying assumption here is that in the first half of 2016, we intend to focus on EIP in our promotional activities rather than leasing. Finally, we target cash CapEx of $4.5 billion to $4.8 billion in 2016, slightly higher than our target range for 2015 as we continue a success-based investment strategy and continue to expand our footprint. Let me now say a word on our expectations for the first quarter of 2016. Please be aware that results in the first half in 2016 will be impacted by new revenue deferrals associated with Data Stash. Remember, with Data Stash cash is received upfront and deferred to future periods. For the first quarter 2016, we currently expect a negative impact from Data Stash of approximately $150 million. In subsequent quarters and especially in the second half of the year, the 20-gigabyte Data Stash cap we instituted in November should limit further deferrals. Additionally, net income will also be impacted by higher depreciation due to the impact of leasing and higher interest expenses due to the $4 billion fundraised in November. Regarding taxes, we anticipate an annual P&L effective tax rate of approximately 40% for future periods. Importantly, I am pleased to announce that the recent extension of bonus depreciation should result in no significant cash income taxes until 2020, three years later than previously expected. In summary, we've delivered very strong financial results in 2015 and expect continued strong growth in 2016. Now, let's get to your questions. You can ask questions. We have phone, text message or via Twitter. We'll start with the question on the phone. Operator, first question, please. Operator : Thank you. And our first question we'll hear from Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Brett Joseph Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks for taking the question. I'll just follow up with some of the points that Braxton was just making around Data Stash and leasing. You gave us the color on what you think the Data Stash impact is going to be in the first quarter of 2016. Could you maybe unpack for us what's assumed for the full year because you gave that expected impact of Data Stash and leasing combined? And then you mentioned you're going to maybe shift your emphasis back to EIP. I'm wondering why you decided to shift back and then what's inherently assumed about the adoption of leasing and the guidance you gave for this year. Thanks. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. Braxton, you start. And then, Mike, jump in. J. Braxton Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. Good morning. Yeah. The Data Stash impact estimated for the year is between $250 million and $350 million. And remember, that's cash received upfront that's deferred to future periods. That should be added to the $0.7 billion to $1 billion net impact of leasing and Data Stash to understand the true guidance that we're giving on leasing revenue for the year. Mike? G. Michael Sievert - Chief Operating Officer : Yeah. And as we also said, we're going to be using both tools this year. And we wanted to make sure that was clear in the guidance of $0.7 billion to $1 billion on combined leasing and Data Stash. We've got two great ways our customers acquire phones. They're both working out terrifically. And we wanted to make sure, since we're here giving guidance now, to give a number that lets you understand we're going to be employing both tools throughout the year. You can see our current promotion favors EIP. And as Braxton said, that's something you can expect to be favoring in the first half of the year. But when you pan back and look at the year, we wanted you to understand both EIP and JUMP! On Demand and leasing will be tools we'll be using throughout the year. And the $0.7 billion to $1 billion is the number to expect on the annual basis. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think, Brett, the reason this is prominent is that it was highly likely that as people were modeling our exit from Q4 into this year that they probably were assuming a much higher percent of leasing than we currently have. We're not expressing a strong negative opinion on leasing as it relates to EIP. We're just giving you the trend of what we're successfully pulsing into the market right now which, as you can see in the first half, especially, is much more emphasizing on our very successful EIP program, and we retain the right, as we will, to shift the news each tool. So it's more of a way for you to look at what I believe are a very strong set of results and a very strong guidance for the year that has us growing considerably. And the last one would be, just to be clear, because you asked straight ahead, is there anything we're seeing with leasing that would lead us to use both tools this year? And the answer is absolutely not. We're finding great success with both. In the fourth quarter, we tended to favor JUMP! On Demand with our super phone, and we killed it in the fourth quarter. So, both tools work out great for our customers and our company, and both will be in the plan going forward in 2016. Brett Joseph Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Is there a particular reason why one type of offer resonates a little better at certain points in time than others? John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, we like to be a little bit unpredictable competitively. Right now, we've got a great offer out on EIP, but there isn't any magic sauce to it under the covers. Brett Joseph Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay, great. Thanks for taking the question. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey, operator. Next one on the phone? Operator : We'll hear from Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Thanks, guys. I wonder, first, if you could detail the $138 million gain you saw from the sale of a license. Was that a swap or an absolute sale? And then, second, talk about some of the additional markets you bought in the 700 A band. Thanks. J. Braxton Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. The $138 million gain was a swap. So, that was a non-cash gain, Phil. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Neville? Neville R. Ray - Chief Technology Officer & Executive VP : Yeah. The 700 new megahertz license is a big excitement for us, so almost 50 million POPs on top of the 20 million license POPs we've secured in the fourth quarter. So, for me and my team, another 70 million POPs are running after we've already started, so very excited about that piece. The footprint is expansive, both geographically as well as the POPs numbers, and it's pretty much coast-to-coast. We've got stuff from Eastern Washington to Florida to Upstate New York to right through the Midwest. So it's a broad expansive set of licenses, and just delighted with the progress we've made on securing more A-band for the coming year. J. Braxton Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : And Phil, the... Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And this essentially... J. Braxton Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : ...total proceeds paid was roughly $700 million, and it's roughly $1.20 per megahertz POP. And there's going to be a lot of goodness as we roll that out during 2016. Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And that includes the spectrum that you traded? J. Braxton Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : That excludes it. Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Excludes. Okay. Thank you. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. I'm going to go into Twitter, and I think we should answer a question or two from Walt Piecyk. Otherwise, his face is going to take over the entire screen here. I count seven or eight from Walt; at least he's not Periscoping. By the way, if you ever follow Walt on Periscope, they have the most horrific, boring less-followed Periscopes in history like Charades, et cetera. So Walt, I'm following you, but certainly not anybody else. The depth of his questions range from the first one, which is, does Braxton need us to send over a fresh razor#beardgame, which we'll move right by. But I think this is an interesting question because I think its got a lot of pertinent aspects to it. What percent of smartphones in the base can use 700 megahertz A-Block? Neville? Neville R. Ray - Chief Technology Officer & Executive VP : Yeah, I'll take it. So we had a tremendous year last year with driving band 12 700-megahertz A block into our device portfolio and obviously into our customers' hands. We targeted to get to about 50% of our LTE customer base with band 12 and we're there or slightly above. So we're making great progress. Pretty much everything we sell now has band 12 within it. And so we're really starting to unleash the benefits of that great band 12 footprint. John referenced earlier on 190 million covered POPs now with band 12. So a great story and tremendous progress in a very short period of time both deploying the spectrum and getting the handsets into the marketplace where our customers can enjoy the benefits. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: The other thing to add, it's kind of obvious, but this is one of the things that's driving up satisfaction and driving down churn. As Neville said, substantially all of our sales now are 700 megahertz compatible. And what we're observing is that when someone has a 700-megahertz phone in a 700-megahertz market, their churn rates are better. Their satisfaction rates are higher. And that's to be expected. But you can see the benefit of that as it flows into our system and as we continue rolling out the spectrum. That original 190 million POPs that we acquired is now fully deployed and we're now working on the stuff that was deployed in the fourth quarter or purchased in the fourth quarter. And there's some great underlying stats and whether the question that this responds to comes up today or sometime this week, I will also point out to you that we're to the point now where 50% of our voice calls are being carried on VoLTE, so Voice over LTE, which is an amazing experience and adjunct for all of our customers, which is not one of the capabilities that our competitors have fully enabled. And we will keep a close eye on that step because it's a major benefit for our customers that may or may not be visible in some of the testing that's done on coverage. Jim Cramer writes TMUS numbers look very strong. Well, I don't know if you're on the phone, Jim, but we're going to have Jim here, by the way, I'll just say at about 10 :30 or so. I really appreciate him jumping off the desk after a short \u2013 long-weekend and coming up. So I'll answer the questions when you come here, Jim. Let's go back to the phone for one more. Operator : And we'll hear from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks a lot. I was wondering if you could revisit Binge On. Maybe, Neville, you can just talk about where we are on the traffic and how that has worked out in terms of the usage and in terms of the capacity. And then maybe Mike or John on what has it done to your churn in terms of making it stickier for customers? And particularly on the gross adds side, is this more of a retention device or you're really seeing improved porting trends as people see this as a differentiated factor or is that something where you think there's a greater opportunity to drive Binge On awareness? Thanks. Neville R. Ray - Chief Technology Officer & Executive VP : Yeah. Hey, Simon. So when we activated Binge On, we've seen, as we've talked through before, a material reduction in network traffic. So the benefit that Binge On brings with customers now being able to enjoy three times the amount of video approximately compared to prior, that's translating into a reduction in load on the network as they really enjoy a great video experience on their smartphones. That percentage is in the 10% to 12% range in terms of reduction of data that they're seeing on the network through Binge On, so a material shift. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Mike, do you want to pick up and throw it to me? G. Michael Sievert - Chief Operating Officer : Yeah. Just on the business side, it's kind of, Simon, yes to all of those. But one thing that's interesting you didn't mention is that we're also seeing that Binge On and the rate plans that came out with Un-carrier X are driving not only our brand value proposition, but also driving data attach. We're seeing these are accretive to MRC loading. That's a leading indicator of ARPU. You can see it in our results in the fourth quarter, ARPU was very strong. ABPU and ABPA hit all-time high. That means people now are paying more for T-Mobile services through their own choice of buying more from us than they ever have before in the history of our company. And Binge On, and the way we designed the rate plans and the way they attract people to use more data and buy more data, are a big piece of that. Of course, it helps make us more attractive. We killed it in the fourth quarter. And we think it's a reason to stay. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Let me just add a couple of things and you \u2013 at the tail of your question was something about the competitive environment in porting, which I'll touch on because a number of people have been having come in. I maintain my belief that Binge On will be one of the biggest things that we've ever done as a company. And reminding you that it is one of a series of Un-carrier moves that are designed to solve pain points for customers, and this big evolving pain point was overages and overbuying as it relates to the fastest-growing data stream of all, which is video. It's also a preemptive start to our move into video and capability and content for our customers, and one of a number of things that we can do from our very strong position of wireless. Now, Binge On's early results are astonishing. Certainly, our partners like Netflix are seeing gigantic increase in daily viewers. And even some of the people that aren't currently at this moment part of the zero-rated program, some of the bigger ones are seeing just a huge increase because of the savings that go along with Binge On. Now one of the things that I think we need to point out all the time, because somehow in the market as people's coverage seems to be getting somewhat at parity, certainly, us and Verizon, now speed is not at parity. But what people tend to forget that when you pick T-Mobile, you get Music Freedom, you get Binge On, you get international data freedom. These qualitative items along with the commitment that we will continue to add to this is a huge differentiation in our brand and why the competitive environment continues to play in our favor. Your questions about the porting, here's what I would say. Competitive environment, non-competitive environment, these are noises made by people that are kind of at the mercy of what's happening on a day-to-day basis. Here's a few numbers for you, and what I would tell you is that it's been 11 quarters now where we've been positive on a porting basis against the entire industry. It's been eight quarters since any carrier has positively ported against us on the postpaid side, and that continues into Q1 as well. So here's some numbers. Q3, the overall porting on the postpaid side was 1.76. Q4 was 1.67. And I'll just give you an idea, last week, the last seven days, 1.8. So that covers several different periods. If you want to pick on any of the guys, the stories \u2013 the underlying story kind of tells something similar. Verizon in Q3 was 1.33. In Q4, it was 1.44. Last week, it was 1.5. So we're comfortable with all of those. They can flex their muscles. They can run their balls commercials. They can give [profanity] (29:00) away. It doesn't matter. Now, you get AT&T which kind of matches what we're seeing with them. AT&T's strategy at this coming (29:07) point in time is to try to sell together something people want with something people don't want and lock them into both of them. And that's finally where they're starting to look at unlimited. But in Q3, the porting was 1.98. In Q4, it was 1.92, and last week it was 2.04. So keep swinging the bat, and I think that's probably what's got them attempting to wake up. But I think what they're going to realize is no one really cares. And Sprint, certainly \u2013 we've all been watching what they've been doing, they were certainly one of the big holiday gift periods, there was more 18-inch small TVs given away in the City of New York than even before. But Q3 was 2.09, Q4 1.56, so certainly progress but not worthy of a taskforce here at T-Mobile. And last week, they were 1.8. So we're feeling pretty damn good, thank you very much. And I think that's a combination of carefully pulsing in and out our actions, balancing profitability with growth as well as the Un-carrier moves that we've put in and more that we will have. So I hope that answers your question. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: That's great color. Thanks, John. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I wonder if \u2013 see if I can find \u2013 Bill Hall (30:22) had a question that kind of left my screen. I'll see if I can find it again, but it was, here it is, prepaid 2015 commentary, with the majority from MetroPCS, 2016 prepaid net add guidance, you expect a tougher environment with Cricket momentum? Mike, do you want to talk about that? G. Michael Sievert - Chief Operating Officer : Yeah. It's going fantastically well. It's one of the things that we probably should talk more about. We're killing it in prepaid and, of course, it's being led by MetroPCS. This is the best brand in the industry in prepaid bar none. Our team is killing it. They're firing on all cylinders. But also some of the macro trends are swinging our way. We've seen a shift in consumers from kind of low-end pay-as-you-go types of plans to these higher quality plans, like MetroPCS has, that are monthly, that are backed by one of the top networks. That favors Cricket to a certain extent as well because they fit that category. But MetroPCS is a much, much stronger brand with far better execution. You'd see it in the numbers. So we're really pleased with what's happening. Specifically to your question, yes, the majority of our growth is on MetroPCS as opposed to our other brands. And we expect the headwinds \u2013 rather tailwinds, strong trends in 2016 to continue. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. I'll just add a comment. I couldn't be happier or prouder of the MetroPCS team. As we came together with MetroPCS and we kept that brand intact, these guys are running at record pace. And by the way, right now, as we speak, this kind of a week, the volumes of business that these guys are doing are absolutely unbelievable as they have each time. So yes, a majority of our prepaid is coming from Metro, and we will continue to pivot in that direction. I'd actually kind of pose one interesting question. I was talking with the team last night about this. I think T-Mobile is the only company that has successfully run prepaid and postpaid businesses at the same time. If you go back over several quarters, you had this one period or so where I think Sprint thought that it was going to be fun to play in the prepaid game, had some big numbers, but we found out it was heavily to the detriment of their postpaid business. And then they backed off and kind of they're somewhere in between now. Cricket has had some success, but AT&T has been absolutely bleeding postpaid phone mix. You know that AT&T lost 1.5 million postpaid phone subscribers just this year. So contrary to the belief that most of the donation in the industry is coming from Sprint, it's actually coming from AT&T, and I think they're in for a bit of a rude awakening. So the prepaid business, very strong and an awful lot more that we can do. And by the way, we see MetroPCS' main target to not be Cricket per se, but to be Sprint. And I think you'll see a lot more about the competition between MetroPCS and Sprint. G. Michael Sievert - Chief Operating Officer : Just a quick fact to it on that, it's interesting, although we just violated the drinking game, so everybody can drink while I'm sharing the factoids (33:37). John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Mike. G. Michael Sievert - Chief Operating Officer : Yeah, you're welcome. What's interesting is, traditionally, MetroPCS and Sprint postpaid have \u2013 Sprint has been a significant contributor to MetroPCS. And you might have seen that we're targeting Sprint customers with the latest promotion. Well, porting from Sprint customers is up by about 50% since we began that promotion. So it shows that there's a lot of affinity for MetroPCS from that customer base with the same kind of focus on low prices and value. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Let us go back to the phone. Operator : And we'll hear from Michael Rollins with Citi. Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Two, if I could. First, I was curious if you could disclose how much synergy you recognized in 2015 from MetroPCS and then how much is left to recognize during 2016? And then secondly, almost a year ago, the company discussed the efforts to focus on the business segment and to take advantage of the expanding LTE coverage by expanding the marketing footprint. Can you give us an update on each of these initiatives and if there's a way to quantify the impact to results from those aspirations that you've had? Thanks. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Great. So we've got synergies on MetroPCS, we've got the at-work marketplace, and then I thought I heard more about the retail... J. Braxton Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Marketing footprint expansion. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: ...footprint expansion. Okay. Braxton? J. Braxton Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. So, on the synergies, Mike, the $1.5 billion plus of run rate synergy, we're there now in the first quarter of 2016 and it's fully embedded in our guidance. During 2015, roughly $0.5 billion of that was CapEx synergy, and that certainly was achieved with the shutdown of the CDMA networks on July 1st of last year. The balance of the $1 billion worth of OpEx, which was primarily driven by network expenses, continued to ramp throughout the year. And it's really interesting, when you look at cost of service and the cost of running our network, not only a significant decline as a percent of revenues, but absolutely down in dollars year-over-year and that was the recognition. Not 100% of the synergy was there, but by the end of the year we had reached a run rate that was the majority of the synergy. But you can definitely count on Q1 being at full run rate. What a success story after so many failed mergers and failed integrations in the history of wireless, very, very well executed. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Mike? G. Michael Sievert - Chief Operating Officer : Yeah. You asked two questions about starting with the business customers. Our business sales are going fantastically well, and it's one of the things we probably should talk more about. Just a couple of quick statistics. In the fourth quarter, our run rate was more than double what it was earlier in the year and more than double the prior year, so fantastic run rate, more than four times though at retail. So it shows that our focus on small and medium businesses really took off in 2015. But what's interesting is that it wasn't just limited to small and medium businesses. Even though we focused there and we said we were going to focus there, we saw a surprising influx from enterprise customers as well, who really appreciated the overall value proposition that we brought and that we continue to bring. So very pleased with what we're seeing on the business front. You asked about the marketing footprint. Right now, if you kind of think about where we have our full mix, our network is in full swing and our distribution is in full swing. That part of the country represents about 230 million POPs. Think about that. We're rolling up all the growth in the industry, more growth than AT&T, Verizon and Sprint combined. And yet, our full mix of marketing distribution and network are in about 230 million POPs. We see an opportunity to increase that this year and into, say, the middle of next year by 30 million or 40 million as we fill that distribution, conduct local marketing and, of course, finish the 700-megahertz roll-outs that we talked about. So there's a great opportunity to continue to expand where we have our full competitive suite, and we see it in about that range, 30 million or 40 million within the next year, year and a half, rolling out systematically. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. I want to acknowledge Jim Patterson who has sent in a bunch of questions. And, Jim, I'm not sure \u2013 why don't we do this. Since you're live and active here, rather than pick from one of your plethora of questions, send whichever one you want me to answer and I'll get that one next. And I want to point out I'm one of your weekly avid readers and I think you do a great job. You focus a little too much on that yellow company, but your thoughts are generally very good. Let's go on the phone one more time, while I wait for Jim's incoming. Operator : And next, we'll hear from Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays. Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you very much. I was wondering if we could chat a bit more about how you folks are looking at sort of tackling opportunities for gaining subscribers in 2016. Historically, you have been Un-carrier when it comes to how you promote through the course of the year. And I was wondering how we should think about sort of your seasonal marketing trends through the course of the year. And then also, if we think about sort of the bolstering effect of your low-band spectrum in the 700-megahertz arena, how does that provide you with additional opportunities for markets that perhaps didn't have as strong coverage before, but now have been sort of augmented with additional capacity and reach? John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. I'm going to start in dual acknowledgement on the first piece, and I'll turn to Mike to cover both of those along with Neville. But one of the things you said was that we have, in the past, been Un-carrier in our marketing approach. We know no other way. I mean it's the basic fabric of who we are and you'll continue to see the same things that we do. We don't have the same gigantic TV spend that the other guys have. We're very targeted. We use social extremely well, and you'll see that. Now, I did want to acknowledge the team of people at T-Mobile who I thought made a great set of commercials at the Super Bowl. I think we played way above our weight class. And if you probably saw on the YouTube AdBlitz summary, we were voted the number two and three top commercials at the Super Bowl. And Peter DeLuca and our whole team and the outside agencies I thought did a fantastic, fantastic job; something to be very proud of. And at the same time, our network was cleaning things up. And I think you'll continue to see that fun, innovative marketing approach. But Mike, do you want to comment on that? G. Michael Sievert - Chief Operating Officer : Yeah. I think just to build on it. One of the things, Amir, that you can expect from us is that we're \u2013 as John was saying a few minutes ago, we pulse in and out with promotions. But we only pulse in with Un-carrier moves, meaning, when we come up with these major changes in how the industry works, they're permanent. So, Binge On, for example, is a big move that we think addresses one of the most important needs customers have as Internet consumption switches to mobile. And as video consumption takes off, we wanted to solve a major problem. So, those are the kinds of things we do with our Un-carrier move. And yeah, we've got \u2013 we're far from being done. This hash tag we throw around, it isn't rhetoric. We won't stop. We've got a lot left to do on Un-carrier moves. Promotions are different. They pulse in. They pulse out. We're there to meet the need when the market's there. For example, February is a big month in this industry as people have tax refund checks, et cetera. We have an active promotion right now, and you can continue to expect that game plan going forward. And then, finally, you talked about rolling out our network and our commercial operation. I addressed that right before the question. But, yeah, we do see a big opportunity to continue to roll out our retail footprint and our network in a coordinated fashion and that's what you can expect from us. It's incredible that Neville and his team have that entire 190 million POPs swap already complete. Now we have 20 million POPs more on low band from fourth quarter, and 48 million POPs more we just announced today that we'll get to work on and simultaneously, we're working on the distribution to match. Together, we see another 30 million POPs or 40 million POPs of our full marketing opportunity growing from about 230 million POPs people with another 30 million POPs or 40 million POPs over the next year, year and a half. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So, let me just grab two or three of those things, because this is an earnings call. I know we're going to focus on the detailed financials because they're extremely impressive. However, the Un-carrier machine, I just want to remind you of, it's got a purpose. It's what we stand for. And it's solving customer pain points but also making institutional change to the United States wireless industry. And I would submit to you, therefore changing wireless around the world. That's something we're very, very proud of. I would point out that it almost seems as if our competitors have stopped trying until they need to, copying our moves. Newsflash: Un-carrier 11, Un-carrier 12, they are definitely coming. They are definitely as big or bigger than anything we've ever done and if I was Moe, Larry and Curly I would start [profanity] (43:22) myself right now. I mean, get a jump on it. Do it early. Don't wait. And I would also point out that little by little, the changes that we made two years ago, two-and-a-half years ago, they are ultimately all getting around to them even after the initial statements by the bigger competitors. Think back to Fran Shammo at Verizon's comments when we announced Wi-Fi Unleashed stating that our customers don't need that capability because we have a substantial network, et cetera, blah, blah, blah, up until last week when guess what? Voila, they moved around to Wi-Fi calling. So, ultimately they'll all get there and it is part of who we are, what we stand for and the brand attribution of the company, which I think outside of an earnings call, that brand attribution and who we stand for and what our people are, is one of the most significant parts of the momentum of this company and there is plenty, plenty more to do. Sorry to evangelize. Well, not really. Okay. Let's see. We can try this one, Neville. You can use it to a couple of them. I think this is an older one by Jim, but what percent of minutes go over voice over Wi-Fi. Maybe you can talk about VoLTE as well. How much has this grown in 2015? Is it a meaningful portion of total minutes? Neville R. Ray - Chief Technology Officer & Executive VP : Yes. Thanks for the question, Jim. So, it's around \u2013 it hovers around 5% of the minutes on the network, which is tremendous. You've got to laugh. As John just mentioned, you know, if you're a Verizon customer, you had to wait two years before you could enjoy Wi-Fi calling on your smartphone. So, it's been a long time coming for some folks. But we see regular \u2013 millions of customers use the service every day, so it's working extremely well. I think the other big piece that we've talked to already on this call this morning is VoLTE, so Voice over LTE. And I love to talk about fastest network, for sure. We've been there for two years now; fastest growing without doubt. We're the most advanced, too. And the key metric there is, and the key technology piece, is Voice over LTE. And we're about 50% now with all of our call volumes around VoLTE. So, you look at VoLTE, Wi-Fi calling, this movement of the calling base onto IP, we are so ahead of the game. I challenge any of our competitors to put up a stat that comes anything close to half of their call volume on VoLTE. And why is that important? It's critical because it allows us to commit more and more spectrum to LTE going forward, which allows us to maintain our pace on LTE performance, our speeds, our capacity, our growth, all of the great things we've talked about in this set of results. So, VoLTE is a big deal. I love to shame my competition into throwing out some numbers and see if any of them can match 5% or 10% of their calling volume at this point in time. One of them is at 0%. I won't mention them, otherwise I'd have to take a drink I think. But there, we are. So, VoLTE moving very, very well. And first to Rich Communication Services, first to Video over LTE, and the first and now the most dominant carrier on VoLTE, so great progress. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Let's go to the next question on the phone. Operator : And we'll hear from Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson. Cathy Yao - MoffettNathanson LLC : Hi. This is actually Cathy Yao calling in for Craig. I just had a question on bad debt expense, which includes the loss from sale receivables. That number increased. I think last time we had talked about it, you mentioned that bad debt expense rose earlier in the year because of increasing build size (47:11) rather than an actual increase in the frequency of defaults. It looks like the prime mix went down in the quarter, which you attributed due to the sale of receivables. Can you talk a little bit more about the moving pieces and what you're doing in terms of tightening up credit policies as you mentioned in your investor briefing? J. Braxton Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, sure, and good morning. Cathy Yao - MoffettNathanson LLC : Hi. J. Braxton Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : We, in the third quarter, definitely signaled that we'd see a slight uptick in bad debt expense in the fourth quarter and that's exactly what happened. I think more importantly, going forward, churn is definitely a forward indicator. We're highly confident that Q1 results will be sub-Q3 levels of bad debt expense. When you look at some of the details, there actually was a sequential decrease in bad debt expense, but we, on our securitization of receivables, did an extension to the facility that accounted for a slight uptick in that category relating to some accounting ramifications of that extension, so great news. We also talked about, in prior calls, the increase was a function of a shift to subprime during the cash-rich tax season of the prior year. And certainly... Cathy Yao - MoffettNathanson LLC : Right. J. Braxton Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : ...there is an impact due to higher amounts financed on smartphones. But to really counteract that for the upcoming year, we've taken several steps that have tightened credit for subprime during the first quarter of this year to counteract that phenomena that we saw in the prior year. So, yeah, we are very focused on this issue, and you'll see a lot of real positive developments in Q1. And thank you for pointing out the prime/subprime mix. When you look at our disclosures in the K, the face of it shows that there was more of a shift to subprime. That is solely a function of the EIP securitization. The facility that we put in place has a cost of capital of 2%, and we spent a great deal of time optimizing this throughout the year. We could have knocked the transaction out much earlier at a higher cost but we're looking at efficiency of the securitization and, of course, one of the very low cost of capital. And we did that through tranching off higher prime segments for the securitization. And since those went off balance sheet, there's a distortion in the mix. In our fact book, we do normalize that, and there has been no change whatsoever in the prime/subprime mix from Q3 to Q4. Cathy Yao - MoffettNathanson LLC : Okay. Got it. Thank you. That's very helpful. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Next question on the phone. Operator : And we'll move to John Hodulik with UBS. John Christopher Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks. Just a couple of questions on some of the metrics, first on churn. There's a lot of \u2013 you guys gave a lot of detail firstly around band 12 and Binge On, but you got tougher comps coming in the first quarter. Maybe for Braxton, do we have a sense that you're going to continue to see the same sort of year-over-year trends that we've seen up until this point as we look out to 2016? And similarly on ARPU, you saw some \u2013 actually some nice sequential improvement in ARPU on a year-over-year basis, and you talked about higher data, tax rate. Can we depart from sort of the flat ARPU outlook and potentially look for some improvements in ARPU going forward? Thanks. J. Braxton Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. Sure. So, I think Mike touched on this earlier. One of the real benefits of the rapid roll out of the 700 megahertz is higher customer retention and satisfaction and that's one of the underlying trends that we're seeing in churn. And as we continue to seed the base with 700 megahertz handsets and as we continue to roll out the spectrum that we acquired in the fourth quarter and the new spectrum that we just acquired, there should be goodness coming. Early indications for Q1, very favorable trends in the churn profile. From an ARPU standpoint, we continue to look at this as general stability. And John, I think one of the things that you have to do is you have to look at some of the impacts of Data Stash on ARPU. Data Stash is cash received that's deferred to future periods. There was about a 1.2% positive impact in the fourth quarter on Data Stash due to the expiration of the gift that we were given. But I was very clear in the guidance section on Q1, we expect about $150 million drag in the first quarter, and that's a function now that we don't have a gift, people are on full deferral mode and they're building up to that 20 gigabyte cap. So, we'll see that build for the first half of the year, and then, really normalize for the balance of the year and future periods and it'll only be a function of growth in the base versus the entire base being penetrated with Data Stash. But there are a lot other puts and takes. We're very focused on family plans. And you look at our customer per account metrics where we've shown constant significant progress in the pulsing of family plan promotions in and out of the marketplace. And while it provides a higher MPV to our business, that is somewhat of a drag on ARPU. Now, offsetting it on the plus side, the positive effects of Binge On that Mike talked about, positive effects on data attach, and we have an unlimited family plan promotion in the first quarter, that will have a positive impact. You take all the puts and takes together, we continue to message general stability from an ARPU standpoint. But I do want to point out, looking at average billings per user, average billings per account, you've seen consistent significant increases on a year-over-year basis of the total consideration being paid into T-Mobile, which is a testament to the value proposition that we're bringing our consumers. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I see Mike leaning forward trying to jump in and give additional detailed guidance. Are you, Mike (54:17)? G. Michael Sievert - Chief Operating Officer : Oh, yeah. You also asked about churn. It's going really well for the reasons we talked about a few minutes ago. Our customers are more satisfied than ever. Our churn levels have been falling throughout the year. Q4 was our best quarter of the year on churn when you look at it on a year-over-year basis with 27 basis points of improvement, which was just terrific. So, our team is really killing it when it comes to satisfying customers and keeping them at T-Mobile. Last year in Q1 was an all-time record on churn. So, that was our best quarter. And we see a real opportunity going forward to potentially establish a new all-time record. So, we're feeling good about the trend lines. John Christopher Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thanks, guys. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: What Mike means to say is he's highly confident that we will have better churn in Q1 than ever before. Listen, I just want to put one tiny \u2013 again, I know this is earnings and everything is going to be very quantitative \u2013 but there is something that's happening at T-Mobile that you can't ignore and I say this all the time since we started this journey, getting aggressive on the marketing, acquiring customers has two things that we needed to show. One is that it would lead to revenue growth, would lead to profitability, would lead to cash and we've talked about that today. Second thing, though, is that ultimately, the network would become the same breadth and reach and speed or better than anybody else, which it has and that's why we will continue to fight the perception issue because customer experience for us is improving. And that's why churn is at all-time low. But please don't jump past the fact that three out of the last four periods of six months each that our customer care organization was voted JDP number one, and I will tell you that in the latest period, they had the highest score ever by a wireless carrier ever in the United States. So, that experience and the culture of this company, which I would tell you, goes beyond just the customer care organization. Every employee in this company spends every waking moment either on social or directly taking care of customers and that's a big deal. You won't see us referring to our customer care organization as a unit cost that needs to be decreased. It's a significant value add of our business and it's part of why, altogether, we do see ourselves moving to churn levels that the company has never seen before. Okay, next question. Operator : We'll move to Jonathan Chaplin with New Street Research. Jonathan Chaplin - New Street Research LLP (US): Thanks. Couple of quick questions for Braxton on the guidance. So, Braxton, you humiliated your subscriber net add guidance for 2015. I'm wondering if you're taking the same sort of conservative approach to EBITDA guidance for 2016. And the guidance range is pretty wide. Given that subscriber growth doesn't have the same drag on EBITDA now with EIP and leasing that it used to, what determines where you come in within that range or maybe even above the high end of the range? And then finally on this topic, as I look at the midpoint of cash EBITDA guidance and CapEx guidance and what you're paying in interest expense, it seems like you're looking at sort of equity free cash flow of about $2.5 billion before you factor in the impact of working capital drag and factoring \u2013 what should the working capital drag in factoring be? What should we be sort of thinking of for those factors to get to get to equity free cash flow? Thanks. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Braxton, I think the first question was I know you just gave subscriber guidance five minutes ago but are you laying down \u2013 and this is the first tee on golf, and we think that you're lying about your handicap. So, I think your track record over the past couple of years of significantly outdoing your guidance has caught up with you. J. Braxton Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. The gig is up, Jonathan. No. We're playing exactly the same game plan that we played the last two years. We did actually increase the postpaid net add guidance range over where we started at 2015, which is a signal of our confidence and the momentum of Un-carrier. But from an EBITDA standpoint, you have it absolutely correct. Our internal aspirations are to be at the very high end, if not exceed and we feel we have adequate runway within the EBITDA guidance that we've given. The way I'd look at the EBITDA guidance is almost as a layer cake. Reported EBITDA includes the non-cash benefit from leasing and the non-cash drag from Data Stash, and you subtract layers of the cake, you derive a core EBITDA of between $8.4 billion and $8.7 billion. So I think you're looking at that absolutely correctly, and we do believe again that the growth is a variable on EBITDA, but that no matter what assumption you look at that will be probably within that range. From a free cash flow standpoint, I think that's one of the really exciting things that's occurring with the T-Mobile story, and it's the third leg of the stool on the financial strategy that we've been executing, having a significant growth platform, double-digit increases in revenue translating to double-digit increases in core operating EBITDA, which then translates into significantly ramping levered GAAP operating free cash flow after all the changes in working capital. We expect a significant increase in the cash flow. You can derive pieces of that from our guidance. We've not put a range around our cash flow this year, importantly due to two reasons. The first reason is the unknown amount of expenditures that will ultimately happen in regards to spectrum and what the debt carry would be associated with that. I'll point back to my prior comments which we stand behind going into this quiet period of the auction. The second unknown is what really transpires from a growth standpoint. Obviously, we're conservatively positioning our growth guidance. John's given the color. We got significant momentum going with the quarter. We're very happy with what we're seeing. But there is significant changes in working capital associated with how quick and how fast we're growing. So we're leaving the levered operating free cash flow guidance with all changes in working capital at the level of a significant ramp. Jonathan Chaplin - New Street Research LLP (US): Right. But you commented sort of the midpoint of expectations on EBITDA. Can we assume the same increase in free cash flow that you see in EBITDA for the year? J. Braxton Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Again, there's true variables, what is our true interest carry going to be and how much growth that we have. But I think, directionally, you're looking at it correctly. Jonathan Chaplin - New Street Research LLP (US): Awesome. Thanks, guys. J. Braxton Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : You're welcome. Nils Paellmann - Vice President- Investor Relations : Let me jump over and take one of the questions that's coming in from the IR site, Andrew Beal (1:02:16). SG&A grew 15% in 2015 versus 11% service revenue growth. Why is that? And can you get SG&A back below 40% of service revenues? Thanks. J. Braxton Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. So when you look at SG&A, really interesting story there. In true G&A, there was about $200 million year-over-year increase, and roughly half of that is bad debt expense. And again, we've talked a lot about bad debt expense on the call. The other half is the transformation that we're undergoing in our IT infrastructure. We're modernizing our back office systems. We're migrating from facilities-based apps to cloud-based apps. There's a different accounting construct when you go to cloud. And all of that's good news because at the completion of the modernization efforts we expect on significant efficiencies coming through the business. The balance of what we're doing is a function on the S part of SG&A. And the increases that we're seeing relate to the overall volume that we're seeing of gross adds increasing during the year. Very targeted. Our spend is certainly on at the level that you're seeing with AT&T and Verizon, or for the Drinking Game Dumb and Dumber. And the way to look at this, I think, appropriately is from a cost per gross adds standpoint. And when you take the total selling expenses divided by the gross add production, we're fairly flat on a year-over-year basis. So, really, no changes other than continuing scale of the business. Nils Paellmann - Vice President- Investor Relations : Okay. There's a question Jim Patterson sent in, which is how is the M2M or machine-to-machine business coming along? Is there a transition from 2G to 4G underway and timeline? John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: It's a real strong point for us. And one of the things you see within our wholesale business is that while there has been some softening of the low-end wireless subscriber, MVNO type of business that we see, in favor of big brands like MetroPCS that I already talked about. To counterbalance that, machine-to-machine is really taking off. And it's based on the trends that you've heard of a million times, the Internet of Things, and it's real and people want access to these wireless networks. One of the things that I think is going to favor T-Mobile in 2016 in this area is that we have made an announcement and the commitment to our machine-to-machine partner base that we will have a GSM layer up at least through 2020. And so, I'll get to your question about LTE coming on in a minute, but this is really important because there's a big legacy base out there whether it's alarm systems, all kinds of applications that are already on the GSM base. And we're the only carrier committing to have GSM in place through 2020, which is a huge strength. The other thing we're doing is working very closely with our partners to transition to LTE. And we're seeing the cost of modules coming way down, and we're helping with that. And it's also going to be a source of strength for us as we refresh these relationships and bring new relationships in. So, Jim, generally, speaking, it's going really well, and we're very optimistic about machine-to-machine growth in the next year and two years. G. Michael Sievert - Chief Operating Officer : If I could just add a couple of points on the tech side here. And so, you guys understand what's happening with GSM. It accounts for less than 5% of our core volume today. And so, back to the top of the discussion on capacity and growth, we're driving extremely hard into LTE for a voice experience. And what we're doing with GSM, as customers migrate away from all 2G voice experiences, is we're now able to commit this greater volume of spectrum to LTE and at the same time really thin out the GSM layer. And you've seen some of our competitors abandon GSM in a huge rush because they haven't figured out how to carry great services like many of the M2M services on a thin GSM layer. So we're going to do both. We'll maintain GSM. Keep it thin. And at the same time, migrate the lion share of our use on the network over to LTE. Nils Paellmann - Vice President- Investor Relations : Okay. Let's go back to the phone. We'll take one or two more. Operator : And we'll hear from Ric Prentiss with Raymond James. Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning, guys. J. Braxton Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good morning. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Ric. Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Seeing Braxton's previous hat, I think it might be worthy of a question about Mexico. How is the No Borders going along and then I'll come up with a follow-up question. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Go ahead, Mike. G. Michael Sievert - Chief Operating Officer : Yeah. This is a big source of strength for us. As you know, in the middle of the summer, we announced Mobile without Borders. It was an amp of one of our prior Un-carrier moves, Simple Global. And this is still one of the biggest reasons why people come to T-Mobile. We started down this path in the fall of 2013 and still today, over two years later, it's distinctive. It has not been copied. You can travel all over the world with T-Mobile and have completely unlimited and free data. You can have free texting. Your voice minutes are $0.20. And in Canada and Mexico, it's full speed LTE and minutes are included in your plan. And so, just removing borders is something that is particularly important for people that live near borders, but it's also important to business customers and many other segments. We've seen our business respond in places like Southern California, Texas \u2013 in Texas, in border cities like Seattle. So it's really nice to see the business responding. And, of course, we're investing in local advertising in these areas as well to make sure people know that when they cross that border, absolutely nothing changes. They just keep using their plan as normal. Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. That's great. And then maybe a question for Neville as well. You've done a great job on LTE, VoLTE, the low band stuff, the treadmill never stops. What are your thoughts on 5G? What the heck is it going to be? Is it low band? Is it high band, connected cars, virtual reality, augmented reality? But just kind of as we look out into the future give you a chance to wax on maybe about 5G. Neville R. Ray - Chief Technology Officer & Executive VP : Yeah, I think it's all of those things, Ric. So, it's interesting, right? We're starting to see a lot of news starting to form in and around the 5G space. One competitor has pushed out and talked about, I think in a somewhat misleading fashion, about consumer 5G in what I think the near term, inside the next couple of years. I think the Verizon guys, if they're under so much pressure from us from a network perspective, they're looking to change the story and move on to the next thing. They're losing the LTE game very, very quickly. So let's change the story and focus on 5G. The fact of the matter is there will be trials. We'll be running our own trials as we move through 2016 both in the lab and in the field on some of the early 5G use cases. The real consumer benefit, and when you think about 5G in a smartphone, you're talking a 2020 story. And nobody that understands the technical space and where we are with standardization would really tell you anything different. That doesn't mean there won't be trials and use cases that form and storm ahead of that. But we are right there in the middle of the 5G game. We're very active both with CTIA, with now 5G Americas here in the U.S. And, of course, we have an incredible partnership with Deutsche Telekom. And DT is probably the leading player in the European market in the 5G space. So, we have access to all of that knowledge, all of that information. I think folks have seen some of the early announcements and Verizon trying to move and say that they're going to be the first to 5G, well, it's kind of BS to be honest. We're there in the race. We'll make sure that there's nothing in the 5G space that we don't deliver to our customers on or before our competition does. And just one last thought, the spectrum you mentioned it, Ric, there's going to be a lot of new bands of spectrum that get worked through and identified for 5G. And ironically, T-Mobile here, we've already got significant spectrum holdings in what we believe will be declared 5G spectrum allocations. That doesn't mean anybody has the spectrum that they need for a full 5G vision, but we're out in front and the other guys for their trials are filing STAs, they're having to get test licenses. We already have a big swath of spectrum across many parts of the country that we can use for 5G tests and trials. So, we're in a good spot. I think we want to manage consumer expectations carefully here and make sure folks understand that, yeah, there is going to be great 5G stuff, high speeds, really low latencies, but it's going to be a while yet. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So let me filter out some of what Neville said in a more aggressive way. A couple of things. The piece that we do here is that there is an appetite out there for the world to understand what is 5G, when is it coming, what does it mean to me, and is there an inherent advantage if anybody has it. So we take that. Secondly, though, what Neville said I believe is extremely visible right now, which is Verizon has spent so much of their existence just leaning back on having, in their minds, the best network and that's significantly under attack. So now they're trying to change the definition to having some inherent advantage of this next-generation capability, and I will tell you that up to and including a couple of weeks ago when Lowell McAdam sat on TV with Jim Cramer and tried to describe a Super Bowl of the next Super Bowl with a 50x speed on a consumer device in the audience, that is pure [profanity] (01:12:50); it's not going to happen. Either he doesn't know or what they're attempting to do is what they've done several times, is to connect the current to a long-term strategy for 5G, but call it 5G way before the standards and/or the handsets and capabilities are available. What I think what we will do is point out, as Neville said, our testing, our own laboratory environment, DT's capabilities, the spectrum we already have, I think what we'll do is just factually come out and help you understand when it's coming and why we are not even not at a disadvantage, but we are kind of in an inherent advantaged situation. But it's not going to be 2017 or 2018 where consumer applications are going to be changing the way you watch the Super Bowl. So, sorry to point that out. So, you can just do what you do at most Super Bowls, which is watch our commercials and point out how great they are. Okay. Let's go to one more question on the phone. Operator : And we'll move to Walter Piecyk with BTIG. Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC : First of all, John, my Periscope game has definitely stepped up. If you were watching yesterday, I had a great one with some wolves out in South Salem, in New York. So, everyone should... John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And (1:14:04) Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC : ...everyone should subscribe to @Walt. No, there was 100 concurrent streamers. I think I had like 300 total. The game has stepped up there, @WaltBTIG. Please subscribe. John, can you just, A), go back to the A block question, which is are you adding distribution points in these areas where you're lighting up A block? Because if you look up in Westchester and Connecticut, you put 700 megahertz there, so now we're getting coverage, but are you going to start to add more T-Mobile stores in some of these areas that you're lighting up? John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. And I think, Walt, I think Mike attempted to answer this a couple of times. But I think what we've said is we currently cover about 230 million or so POPs with retail distribution. And we see an immediate possibility of covering another 30 million to 40 million more POPs with retail distribution. And we're already underway, mostly through TPR, to add 300 to 400 more retail stores immediately, but more following beyond that. But, Mike, is there any...? G. Michael Sievert - Chief Operating Officer : Nope. That's it. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So, yes, Walt, that's a big, big part. And I \u2013 as I'm going through all of the Twitter feeds, there's quite a few customers, and it happens mostly on My Social, and I know it would be hard for you to understand, but My Social is one of those where a lot of people actually come in and speak to me. But quite a bit of it is, hey, we love what you're doing, when are you coming to Arkansas, or when are you coming here or when are you coming? And I think that is a big part of what we do. So, we immediately think there's a 30 million to 40 million more POPs of coverage that we can build retail distribution on. G. Michael Sievert - Chief Operating Officer : TPR stands for T-Mobile Premium Retailer for people listening in. That's a partnership strategy. We've rolled out stores with partners. We'll also be doing some corporate stores, and we're coming today to you from our first signature store here in Times Square, as John said a few minutes ago. And we expect to do more of this as well, not a lot more, I mean these are signature stores, but there are some more of these coming your way as well, big format, experiential stores where you can really see the full power of wireless and what it can do for you. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And, Walt, I promise that I'll come in to one of your Periscope and share with my followers, and you may have a record... Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC : John, I don't need your \u2013 John, I do not need your help. The quality of my Periscopes were going to attract plenty of users. But I do have one follow-up. I do have one follow-up which is, can you talk about any thoughts that you may have in 2016 about launching your own over-the-top video service? Something to add another service, maybe, for your customers? Obviously, you're getting a lot of experience with Binge On. It's something you can integrate on the wireless side. Just talk to us about, is this something you're looking at, and what's the possibility of getting something done in 2016? G. Michael Sievert - Chief Operating Officer : Yeah. I'll start. I mean, it's what we said from the stage when we were doing Binge On. It's going to depend on what our customers want. That's what always guides the Un-carrier strategy. We listen and we figure out what they want, what can change the industry, and then we go and do that. It's a pretty simple formula on Un-carrier. What we said then was the jury is out. What we had to go on at that time was go90 from Verizon. It was extremely unpopular. And so, we were looking at it saying, hey, that's obviously not something that customers' want, which is to hire Verizon, to curate their content for them. But we have our ear down, we're listening, and if it's something our customers want, then we'll look at it. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. And, Walt, I haven't used this analogy in this call, so I'm going to put it out there one more time because it's really a good reminder and we said at past quarters in a row. We maintained the belief that all content is going to the Internet and all Internet is being consumed mobile. What we've done now is we've made it very clear in the recent past that in that continuum there's one thing we do really well and we're going to focus on it. But things like Binge On where the (1:18:00) expressing how we can use our position to migrate on that continuum in ways that people hadn't thought about. So, what I think we've done is we served notice that either through partnership, merger and acquisition, and/or investment, we are going to use that position in this brand to migrate what's happening on that continuum, and we rule out no aspect of it. But I think it's also got much broader implication for the larger players in the cable industry and the content industry. And I think we're very pleased and proud to be really good in growing in brand and prominence in one of the pieces of that very important and growing continuum. Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC : Well, got it. Thank you. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Let's take our last question before Walt speaks anymore. Operator : And we'll hear from Colby Synesael with Cowen & Company. Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks for fitting me in. I wanted to go back to, I think it was Jonathan Chaplin's question regarding free cash flow and EIPs. So, you guys sold $795 million of EIP receivables in the fourth quarter. I was wondering if there was a comparable number we could think about for 2016 that you think you could ultimately sell or at least give us an idea of what the capacity is of what you could sell? And then another question that we get quite often is the potential impact of leasing on upgrades. So, if you think about it, with leasing I think that you guys allow customers to potentially trade in their device ultimately three times I think per year. Not that I think that that's going to happen, but if you do start to see customers trading their device more frequently than they do on EIP, one could argue that there could be a greater cash outlay responsibility by T-Mobile that could potentially be negative at least in the short-term to free cash flow. What do you think that the impact of leasing is going to be on the upgrade velocity as we go forward? Thank you. J. Braxton Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. Sure. Yeah, we'll continue to look for opportunities and securitization. Leasing creates some different challenges because you basically have a cash stream flow versus an asset on your balance sheet. And you have to look at the construct a little differently. It is something that we're taking a look at. We have zero interest in doing a transaction that the yellow guys did that has a high single-digit cost of capital associated with it. We have some ideas. We'll take a look at it. But I think from a guidance standpoint, I would assume if we do anything, it would be at levels consistent with what we've done for 2015. And from a upgrade standpoint, we've had to jump on the JUMP! construct for several years. That was one of our very early Un-carrier moves. We understand the upgrade patterns very well. And I think the way I would look at upgrades is that it's going to be episodic. When there's launches of new generation of iconic handsets, you'll see upticks and upgrades either under EIP or under JUMP! On Demand. And when there's a lack of that type of catalyst, it will be more normalized. But the one thing I want to point out is when there is an iconic phone launch, that's a tremendous opportunity for T-Mobile. We create a lot of pent-up switching demand where we're going to definitely over index on growth into our company given our relative market share in the marketplace. So, we look at it as a real opportunity when those episodic signature launches come. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: So, I guess, the point there being is that you guys... John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Go ahead. Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: I guess, the point there's that you guys aren't expecting to see any meaningful increase in upgrades as a result of bringing on leasing? John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: One of the things, Colby, that Braxton I think pointed out was that, remember, EIP has had JUMP! attached north of 80% ever since the beginning. So, almost everybody has had these upgrade rights through almost the entire Un-carrier journey. So, JUMP! On Demand doesn't really change the equation vary materially. And there's sort of a natural \u2013 and I think your question got to this. There's sort of a natural inhibitor as well. People don't exercise the rights they have because it's a big project to change out your phone. So, there's a certain impedance to it, anyway. And when it does happen, it tends to happen about around big phone launches as Braxton said, and we're able to look at it and say, actually, that's a positive development for satisfaction and retention. Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. I think we're going to cut it there. I appreciate everybody's patience and time and sending questions in under many formats. And I appreciate everybody listening, and we look forward to speaking to you again next quarter, if not before. Thank you very much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the T-Mobile US fourth quarter and full year 2015 conference call. If you have further questions, you may contact the Investor Relations or media departments. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect and have a pleasant day.",

Nils Paellmann - Vice President- Investor Relations : Good morning. Welcome to T-Mobile's first quarter 2016 earnings call. With me today are John Legere, our President and CEO; Braxton Carter, our CFO; and other members of the senior leadership team. Let me just read the disclaimer. During this call, we will make projections and statements about the future performance of the company which are based on current expectations and assumptions. Our Form 10-K includes risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Reconciliations between GAAP and the non-GAAP results we discuss on this call can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website. Let me now turn it over to John Legere. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for that exciting introduction Nils, and thanks for joining us. Welcome to T-Mobile's first quarter 2016 Un-carrier earnings call and open Twitter conference and we're coming to you live from New York City. We'd like to keep this interactive. So we'll have up to, as I've said before, 90 minutes for this call to cover as much Q&A as possible. We'll take questions via Twitter and on the phone. We're again providing a live video stream, so Braxton, be sure you smile. So you can watch all the action Behind-the-Scenes on YouTube. For fun, we are also filming today's event with a 360-degree camera and we'll share highlights from that exciting item later in the day. Few weeks ago, we celebrated the third anniversary of Un-carrier, three years since we started our consumer revolution in the wireless industry. Our approach from the beginning has been to put the customer first by listening and then solving their pain points. While we still have a lot of work to do to keep fixing this broken industry, the results show that the strategy is working. We started the year with a strong Q1. We continue to lead the industry in net customer additions, but we're also likely to come in way ahead of the pack in service revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth. Let me share a few highlights from the quarter. Our 2.2 million total net adds in Q1 marked the 12 consecutive quarter with over 1 million net adds and six of the last seven with over 2 million. We added more than 1 million branded postpaid customers. That is the seventh consecutive quarter over 1 million. In Q1, we added 877,000 branded postpaid phone net customers. For those of you that maybe keeping score, that's nine quarters in a row that we've led the entire industry in postpaid phone additions. Now, while not all competitors have reported yet, it sure looks like we will capture all of the industry's postpaid phone growth, again in the first quarter. And in prepaid, where we have the industry's biggest and best prepaid brand with MetroPCS, we added 807,000 new customers, setting a new record for T-Mobile since our combination with MetroPCS. This by the way represents an 11-fold increase in branded prepaid nets year-over-year. It's not easy to grow both sides of the business, that being prepaid and postpaid phones, but we've been able to do that just that for nearly three years in a row. That's right. T-Mobile is the only wireless provider to deliver positive growth in both postpaid phones and prepaid for the last 11 quarters. By the way, no one else has been able to do that for more than a year. Porting ratios tell the same story. Q1 marked the 12 quarter in a row, that's three years running, with overall positive postpaid porting ratios, and we've now had over nine quarters in a row where T-Mobile has been positive against every major carrier. Think about that for a minute, every major carrier. You may have noticed this was the quarter where the competition got more aggressive with bounties targeted at T-Mobile customers, from ETF offers of up to $650 to $350 EIP buyouts, anything to try and slow us down. Clearly, we have them rattled and it's a beautiful thing to watch. It's definitely an interesting time to be in wireless. Verizon is on a spending spree to try and buy access to Millennials, buy a 1990s internet companies, and they're spending tens of millions in ads directed at us including their Balls campaign and their Ricky Gervais commercials. When the schoolyard bully starts calling you out, you know you've arrived. Unlike Verizon, AT&T's strategy is really clear, bundle everything. But read the fine print, and surprise, their bundles require a two-year contract and prices go up in year two. Oh, and one of AT&T's first big moves in a really long time was to offer unlimited data plan to DirecTV subscribers. They even bragged at an investor conference about signing up 2 million of their existing customers, well done. And Sprint, did they really do focus groups and package it up as a listening tour? We saw how that went. Well, I think I'm just going to leave that one totally alone. With all this happening across the industry, we're staying focused on our core business and seeing our momentum continue into the second quarter. We're seeing positive postpaid porting against all of our competitors, trending in line to slightly better than Q1 with both AT&T and Verizon. And, we don't just win them, we keep them. Our customers continue to stay with T-Mobile in near record levels. Branded postpaid phone churn in Q1 was down 13 basis points quarter-over-quarter to 1.33%, and generally maintaining itself at the record low from last year's first quarter. And like I said, we're delivering rock solid financial metrics too. The numbers speak for themselves. We are rapidly translating customer growth into revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth. In Q1, we delivered year-over-year service revenue growth of 13% and year-over-year adjusted EBITDA growth of 98.1%. Even excluding the spectrum gain, adjusted EBITDA grew at an impressive 52%. Our continued success and momentum means we will keep investing to fuel growth, with particular focus on the network build out, growing our retail distribution and more uncarriables. Our aggressive network growth continues. We now have 308 million 4G LTE POPs covered and we are virtually on par with Verizon. We've had the fastest 4G LTE network for nine quarters in a row that produced speeds averaging 22 megs in Q1. Our deployment of extended range LTE in the 700 megahertz A-Block spectrum band is way ahead of schedule. More than 340 markets are live covering approximately 194 million and customers are seeing the benefits. Now, we are far from done here. As I already mentioned in the last earnings call, we've entered into agreements to acquire a low-band A-Block spectrum covering another 48 million POPs. With these acquisitions, our low-band spectrum footprint will extend to 258 million POPs, or about 80% of the U.S. population. The spectrum is in cities like Nashville, Salt Lake City, Columbus and Jacksonville. We intend to build out these additional areas as rapidly as we built out the first 194 million POPs. Also, the upcoming incentive auction is a historic opportunity as we've said before and we plan to participate with a successful outcome. Our network expansion creates an opportunity to grow our retail footprint as well. Today, we have 230 million people close to our brand of postpaid stores and we plan to grow that footprint to 260 million to 270 million, especially in suburban areas. And you didn't think we would stop our Un-carrier moves, did you? An Un-carrier move always makes me stumble. It's been three years since we launched our first Un-carrier move. And by the way, we have no plans to stop. Stay tuned, because Un-carrier 11 is coming soon. In summary, the first quarter was another great one for T-Mobile. 2016 is rapidly delivering great customer growth, outstanding financial results and creating value for our shareholders. Our customer momentum continues and it appears that we delivered the best service revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth in the industry. Three years in, the Un-carrier continues to be a disruptive and innovative force in wireless and that's a good thing for American consumers. Now, I'll hand it over to our CFO, Braxton Carter for key financial highlights and an update to our full year 2016 guidance. J. Braxton Carter - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : Well, thanks, John, and once again, I am so excited to share our strong financial results and once again update our guidance, which we did every quarter of last year. Let's start with the financial results for the first quarter. Our customer growth is translating into strong financial growth as we once again delivered industry-leading metrics. Service revenues grew by 13% and adjusted EBITDA came in at $2.7 billion in the first quarter, up 98% year-over-year. EBITDA, as already mentioned by John, benefited from a spectrum gain of $636 million. Excluding this gain, adjusted EBITDA increased by 52% year-over-year and the adjusted EBITDA margin expanded from 24% to 32%. Adjusted free cash flow improved year-over-year from minus $422 million to minus $247 million. Net cash from operating activities almost doubled and was partially offset by higher cash CapEx. Cash CapEx was approximately $350 million more front-end loaded this year due to our aggressive 700 megahertz A-Block rollout. This is just a timing issue, which we will normalize in the course of the year. From a working capital perspective, compared to Q1 last year, we saw higher outflows due to inventories in connection with leasing and a decrease in accounts payable partially offset by a reduction in EIP receivables. We continue to expect in significant improvement in free cash flow this year. Net income and earnings per share were up strongly year-over-year. EPS came in at $0.56 per share compared to a loss of $0.09 per share in the first quarter of 2015. The after-tax impact of the spectrum gain on EPS in the first quarter of 2016 was $0.46. Branded postpaid phone ARPU declined sequentially due to the impact of Data Stash. However, if you correct for Data Stash, ARPU was generally stable both sequentially and year-over-year, which is a significant achievement if you compare our ARPU development to that of our competitors. Let me also say a word on bad debt expense. As predicted, bad debt expenses and losses from the sale of receivables came in lower in the third quarter of 2015, and generally in line with Q1 of last year even with rapidly ramping total customers. Relative to total revenues, bad debt expense and losses from the sale of receivables declined both sequentially and year-over-year. Also, as already said on the last earnings call, we were prudent with our credit policies during the first quarter of 2016 in order to limit exposure to higher sub-prime receivables. Let me now come to our 2016 guidance. In light of the strong customer growth we experienced in Q1, we are taking up our target for branded postpaid net additions to 3.2 million to 3.6 million, up from the original target of 2.4 million to 3.4 million. For adjusted EBITDA, our new target is $9.7 billion to $10.2 billion, up from the original of $9.1 billion to $9.7 billion. This increase is due to the spectrum gain of approximately $600 million. Our EBITDA target includes the aggregate impact from leasing and Data Stash of $700 million to $1 billion, which is unchanged. Finally, we target cash CapEx of $4.5 billion to $4.8 billion in 2016, which is unchanged from the prior guidance, as already mentioned. Let me also say a word on our expectations for the second quarter of 2016. Please be aware that results in the first half of 2016 will be impacted by new revenue deferrals associated with Data Stash. Remember, Data Stash, we received the cash consideration upfront, but the recognition of that is deferred to future periods. For the first quarter 2016, the actual impact amounted to $138 million. For the second quarter, the impact is expected to be approximately $70 million to $90 million. For the full year, the impact is still expected to be in the range from $250 million to $350 million. Additionally, as in the first quarter net income, we'll also be impacted by higher depreciation due to the impact of leasing and higher interest expense due to the $4 billion fundraise in November and the $1 billion fundraise just completed on April 1 at the beginning of this quarter. When looking at the shaping of quarters for 2016, please refer to historical trends over the past two years. We are executing on a countercyclical game plan of loading growth in the beginning of the year, which results in increasingly ramping cash flow throughout the year. I am also pleased to announce, we've reached agreement with Deutsche Telekom and issued an 8-K this morning for $1.35 billion add-on to our recent eight-year 6% unsecured notes priced at an effective yield of 5.14%. This is essentially a fully committed bridge that could be drawn at our option with terms and conditions pari-passu with our existing unsecured notes. We are also in discussions with Deutsche Telekom for an additional $650 million bridge, which will end are current fundraising efforts for an amount totaling $9 billion. In summary, we delivered very strong financial results in the first quarter and expect continued strong growth in 2016. Now, let's get on to your questions. You can ask questions via phone, text message or via Twitter. We will start with a question on the phone. Operator, first question please? Operator : Thank you. And we'll take our first question today from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you very much. Good morning. Some very good results on the prepaid side. I mean, John can you just provide a little bit more color about are we seeing prepaid, as a segment, really start to rebound and become more relevant for different customers? Is this mostly share gain? Perhaps some insight into how sustainable this is for the rest of the year. Thank you. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, Mike. Why don't you start that one? G. Michael Sievert - Chief Operating Officer : Yeah. I think the premise of the question is that there's a segment phenomenon going here and that's exactly what we're seeing. Two things are happening. One, we're seeing high quality monthly prepaid of the kind that we offer with MetroPCS really growing. It's growing at the expense we think of postpaid offerings like those at Sprint and it's growing at the expense of lower quality pay-as-you-go prepaid. And so that high quality network-led monthly prepaid segment is growing; that's the first phenomenon. The second phenomenon is within that segment, MetroPCS is kicking ass. Now we had a record quarter on MetroPCS, the best we've ever done, and it really shows that we've got the right combination of a great value proposition, well marketed, and really taking advantage of leading with the T-Mobile network as a key differentiator in the prepaid segment. So the team is really firing on all cylinders. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, I appreciate the question, Simon. This is a number of things. One of them is record \u2013 and I amplify that results for MetroPCS, and MetroPCS is showing us the value of a couple of things, which is we've expanded their business from the time that we came together into 40 additional markets, a total of 55 markets now. And we've grown in both the original markets as well as in the expanded markets. And we're up to \u2013 you know, we have 7,500 dedicated doors with MetroPCS and we're adding 1,000 doors this year and very strong solid ARPU on the prepaid side and very good churn on the prepaid side for prepaid business. So, we are thrilled with what's taking place on Metro. And I actually think that our competitors have yet to figure out a way to successfully and simultaneously run a prepaid and a postpaid phone business. Sprint has had one quarter, a year-and-a-half ago or so, about prepaid and then all of a sudden thought nobody cared and they dropped it like a hot potato and ran over to postpaid, and lost quite a bit of business. AT&T has been doing some business with Cricket, but I don't know if anybody is keeping track, AT&T has not added a postpaid phone customer since Q3 of 2014. So, 11 quarters in a row of both businesses with the brands simultaneously performing very well I think this is a very big deal and I think it even gave Verizon pause to try to make up some answer of, hey, we do that with TracFone. So, very excited about this and I met with the dealers of Metro last week in Dallas and they're an equally excited and highly motivated group. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: And how much of...? J. Braxton Carter - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : Not to forget, the Metro model has been historically contra-cyclical to general trends in the postpaid business. The first quarter is also the golden quarter for that type of model, given the liquidity from tax refund standpoint in the market. But we do see a lot of continued momentum, both in legacy markets and expansion markets with MetroPCS. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks a lot. G. Michael Sievert - Chief Operating Officer : Yeah. And, Simon, I think one of the things \u2013 I'll use this moment to talk about because this is one of the little golden nuggets in this set of earnings. Remember that the ARPU at MetroPCS is it's $38, $39 each. So this is a very steady, very good ARPU. And I think as we start talking about customer adds and then you go through the portfolio of T-Mobile's 2.2 mobile adds and you look at 877,000 postpaid phones, and we know those are the highest ARPU, and then over 800,000 prepaid net add a really strong and then you compare that to the other guys, I think what we need people to start understanding is that some of these adds, a lot of these adds, these connected cars, these are cents, not dollars. And now I understand that, Hum, which is that little device to make sure your kids don't drive out at night and get drunk somewhere, is going to be less than $10. So what I'm most excited about is these numbers and the qualitative components of what the underlying financials are are very, very strong. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We'll take the next question, Operator? Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays. Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you very much and good morning, folks. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning. Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I wanted to touch upon the churn metrics and how you folks are thinking about that going forward. While they still remain low relative to where they had been in the past, we did see a slight uptick on a year-over-year basis. I was wondering if you could talk through that and then I have a quick follow-up question. G. Michael Sievert - Chief Operating Officer : Yeah. I'll start that. See if guys want to add in. I think this is \u2013 when you look at a set of results that are so perfect you try to find something. The way I would describe this is sequentially we were down 13 basis points and the year-over-year postpaid churn is basically flat, 1.33% to 1.3%, and it's basically flat year-over-year to our record performance. So you should color us very happy and enthusiastic about that level of postpaid churn being tied with our record results being down sequentially in a highly competitive time. But certainly don't read into that that we don't think it can get better. The moral of the story is all of what's in this set of metrics; we are very comfortable and happy and can perform extremely well. So we would look at these as year-over-year flat with record performance and possibly an ability to go down from here putting aside normal seasonality trends. J. Braxton Carter - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : And Amir, I think one thing to focus on is the 700 megahertz A-Block rollout, which we now own 258 million POPs. And the benefit of having low band starts in (23:58) our portfolio and this trend is really just starting with the 194 million total POPs rolled out of low band and a little over half of our customers having a band 12 capable handset. We are going to see a lot of future goodness developed from that 700 megahertz A-Block and the development of the ecosystem and that provides us with quite a bit of optimism for the future. Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And that's a great transition to my follow-up question. I'm thinking about your net add performance for the quarter. Is there a way to delineate whether or not you folks are seeing benefits from the rollout of 700 megahertz to areas where perhaps you didn't have a stronger reach before or is that sort of forthcoming and how we should think about sort of the opportunity set for further net add gains? G. Michael Sievert - Chief Operating Officer : Yeah, it's Mike, Amir. Yeah, definitely started, you know, what's interesting is as you've seen the network stats how rapidly we've rolled out extended range LTE. One of the things we've pointed out is that the distribution lags that. So we've got a formula here, let's get the network great and then follow it in with distribution and marketing. And, right now, if you look at all these results, and how we're rolling up all of the growth in the industry, really we're playing with that full formula of a completed network footprint plus full distribution at our normal distribution densities in about 230 million of those national POPs. So that means we've still got a-third of the country left to go. Now we've been growing. Already, this quarter, we've built dozens of stores, we plan to do about 400 stores on the postpaid side with the T-Mobile brand this year, about 1,000, as John said, with the MetroPCS side. So we have a lot of expansion in front of us. We see an opportunity by the middle of next year to add 30 million or 40 million POPs to where we have that full, I'll call it, marketing footprint with the distribution in place, the network substantially complete, and marketing on top to emphasize our differences. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And I think obviously the piece that we'll find ways to point out clearer is the actual turn benefit that we're getting because of this broader coverage and superior coverage. You remember that this 700 megahertz that we've deployed, 8 of the 10 top cities in the U.S. and 28 of the top 30, this is an enhancement to where we've had pretty good coverage already, just significantly changing what you get with as we've called it 4 times better coverage. It's better in-building penetration, better rural coverage around those areas as well. So, the two things. One is, churn benefit, which I think we can quantify, and then, of course, as Mike said, we're getting \u2013 we have tremendous incoming demand from where we now have really good coverage but call it within 10 square miles or so there is no T-Mobile retail presence and I think that's something that we're ramping up very quickly. Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you very much for the additional color. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Do you want to \u2013 guys you want to take one on Twitter or... let's see. Well, let's try, pull down \u2013 the other way, please, okay. We are going to take \u2013 why don't we take these two from Kyle and from Andrew. We know Kyle. He is our young future superstar journalist, who is written into us, but it's an interesting opportunity to talk about a couple of things. Has T-Mobiles go with recent Un-carrier moves such as Binge On and Music Freedom been to eliminate the data package? Now, obviously the answer is no. But we will use this to remind people that a tremendous part of what's happening in T-Mobile are because of these underlying Un-carrier moves and the transformation of the industry. So, when you go through periods that are somewhat promotional, which we certainly just finished a quarter that was like that. The guys I think the competitors are starting to figure out, okay, so you put out your promo, you put out your price change but it's not apples-to-apples anymore. Because, as an example, 225 million songs are streamed free now by customers at T-Mobile on Music Freedom. There are a 100 different providers on Binge On and Music Freedom that are now providing free streaming of music and video and Binge On has already allowed our customers to be streaming over 70% of their video zero rated and two times the amount of video being watched. I think we've also gone out of our way to explain that the kind of utilization of our network providing these benefits to our customers has been a positive enhancement. So this is in no way an attempt to move away from data package or data utilization. It's a highly effective positive way for the financials of our shareholders but also for our customers. And I believe Binge On especially has been a very differentiating offer and continues to be so. Let's go back to the phone for one more and then we'll look back and get a little clearer here on the Twitter questions. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks. And I will ask a follow-up question on Binge On. Now that you had that capability available to your base for a while, have you noticed anything interesting about the behavior of customers who are heavy Binge On users so, for example, as someone who is a heavy Binge On user less likely to churn and is there any evidence that Binge On is a key reason that customers are switching to T-Mobile? John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Do you want to start, Mike? G. Michael Sievert - Chief Operating Officer : Yeah. The short answer, Brett, is yes and yes. We haven't broken it out. But what's interesting is if you think about an Un-carrier move, in order for what John said to be true, what he just said was that people on rated data plans at T-Mobile have literally doubled their consumption when it comes to hours of what they consumed on our network before Binge On. I mean, think about for that for a minute. In order for that to be true, literally millions and millions of people needed to take this Un-carrier move and substantially change their behavior in a way that allows them to get way more value out of their wireless relationship. That means two things are going to happen. One, they're going to be happier with that wireless experience and stay longer and we're seeing that. And secondly, they're going to tell people about it. If you're able to do something like this, you're going to tell people about it, because it's massively differentiated. And you see two great quarters, Q4 and Q1, as examples of how Binge On is contributing to our results. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. There's two things, Brett, that's going that both bode very, very well for the future of T-Mobile. One of the things that's interesting, not only have we already talked about expanding our retail footprint, but the Un-carrier moves, which are great ways to solve customer pain points, our study suggest that the awareness level around the United States of potential customers of these various Un-carrier moves is in some cases well below 50%. So we've now been training our teams for that moment when we get customers that are coming in considering T-Mobile. This portfolio of Un-carrier move is a great selling point to a very unaware at times audience. Those that do use it are clearly our most dedicated customers : a), because they feel like we're changing things for them and b), because they now see the depth of what the capabilities are. Now the other interesting thing that's happened is when Binge On first came out, there was a lot of fear, uncertainty and doubt on a couple of fronts. One was, oh yeah, but you know, Google hates it and we can't use YouTube. Well, we've solved that and that was a big enhancement. But then there was this crazy notion and this lack of belief that are \u2013 we understand and our network team understands that 480p, for example, to watch Netflix video is a very perfect quality experience and we're not trying to trick anybody. Now what customers ultimately found out is not only the 480p for Netflix is it a great experience and it's zero-rated, but it's 133% of what's being given to the other groups by AT&T and Verizon. And I think that just caused a big thud on the floor as to what's going on. I won't even bother going back in trying to pick up the question of who knew what, when, but I do hope at some point in time that direct questions get answered. But the people that don't really care are the customers now. And if you're a Verizon customer and you realize for five years you've been watching Netflix at 360p and you've been paying significantly in data buckets, I think what you call that is a highly interested future T-Mobile customer. Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks for the color. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Operator? Operator : Yes, sir. We'll take our next question from Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi, guys. Thanks. Two things. One, you've tightened credit some this quarter versus last year, what was the result on incoming customer credit quality? And now that we're past the 1Q tax window, do you expect to open that up again? J. Braxton Carter - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. Phil, good morning, and a very good question. When you look at the disclosures we have in our Factbook, adjusted for the EIP securitization, the mix of prime and subprime is unchanged. So the credit policies that we put in place in the first quarter particularly oriented towards what happens during the \u2013 particularly in the month of February, which is the peak tax refund season were highly successful. And the changes that we put in place did not affect our flow one bit as you can see from these results. And they are permanent changes going forward. Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. So we shouldn't expect that to open back up? J. Braxton Carter - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : That's correct. Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And then second, can you talk about free cash flow for the year excluding spectrum and whatever spectrum interest expense comes through, how should we think about cash flow generation for the company. J. Braxton Carter - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, significantly ramping, Phil. When you look at the core EBITDA guidance sans any spectrum transactions and adjusting for very transparent disclosures on the impact of leasing and Data Stash, the cash generation of this business organically from operations is rapidly ramping. And we just reiterated our cash CapEx guidance. One of the benefits of what we did essentially having $4 billion worth of bridge with Deutsche Telekom is avoidance of any interest carry on that part of our fundraise. We executed $5 billion that went on to balance sheet at very attractive rates and what we've done with the bridge locking in rates now and avoiding any future exposure is another very significant development. But it's very easy to do the math and see that organically there is going to be a very substantial ramp in the true cash generation on a fully levered basis plus/minus all changes in working capital for 2016. Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Just to follow-up there. Including the $650 million that you're talking about with DT and the $1.35 billion this morning, what's your total liquidity and what do you need to run the business? J. Braxton Carter - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : Well, we ended the first quarter with about $6.5 billion; that included $5 billion that we had previously raised for purposes of spectrum acquisitions. We got a $4 billion bridge on top of it, so that takes it to $10.5 billion. In the first quarter, we did pay the first transaction we executed in the third quarter for 700 A-Block, so that's already out of that number. And the minimum liquidity for the business is roughly $1.5 billion to $2 billion. Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks, Braxton. J. Braxton Carter - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : You're welcome. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Let's go to a couple of Twitter and Facebook questions. David Freeman (37:05) wrote in, what's the expected POPs to be covered by band 12 by the end of 2016? Neville, why don't you talk about that and maybe even how many band 12 handsets we've seen deployed, et cetera? Neville R. Ray - Chief Technology Officer & Executive VP : Yeah, sure. Thanks, John. So band 12 has been \u2013 we made incredible progress over the last 12, 18 months. And, at the top of the call, you heard we're at 194 million covered POPs to-date, well ahead of the plan and schedule that we put in place originally on this. As we look at 2016 and into 2017 with almost 260 million POPs \u2013 licensed POPs now available for us to run at, obviously, we're going to run at everything. We haven't finalized all of the details yet. But if you look at our track record on how quickly we're rolling out the 700 MHz spectrum, I don't think you're going to see anything different in 2016. And hopefully, there's more opportunity in the secondary market. Obviously, we're in the auction, but there's still a 700 MHz market out there and we'll look to add to our holdings if those opportunities arise. Braxton mentioned the handset growth and it's a tremendous piece. We've almost got \u2013 it's about 55% now of our LTE handset has band 12 capability, and that's incredible progress in a very short period of time, and that number continues to grow and drive north every week. So, a great portfolio of band 12 handsets. Everything we sell now is effectively band 12. And the network benefits that you heard Mike and John talk about earlier on, this is a very different network from T-Mobile compared to where we were three years ago. Low-band has made an incredible difference for the performance of the network and what's reaching our customers and we will continue that drive this year and next. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. I'm going to take one more Twitter and then we'll go back to the long and growing list on the phone. Andrew Beal (39:06), we answered half of this question, but I think we can do some work on. Can you talk about the growth in your marketing footprint and explain how that is driving increase in selling expenses? Mike, why don't you talk about that because I think it's \u2013 or Braxton as well \u2013 the question to doing with an assumption that selling or SG&A? G. Michael Sievert - Chief Operating Officer : We kind of hit the first part. Obviously, we're expanding our footprint. But the other piece, keep in mind, and this is really interesting. I mean, the overall growth in our branded nets this quarter in Q1 from last quarter in Q1 was 54%. So when you look across postpaid and prepaid, obviously, the branded side of our business is growing incredibly quickly, and that is great for us in the marketplace, it allows us to set the foundation for us. It also drives the SG&A expenses in the period. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Operator? Operator : We'll take our next question from Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank. Matthew Niknam - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, guys. Thank you for taking the questions. Just two, if I could. One on leasing versus EIP. So, in the past, you talked about 1Q having a greater shift back to EIP-centric promotions, any takeaways you can share regarding the customer response and how you are thinking about that mix looking forward? And then secondly, just on the EBITDA guidance, excluding the spectrum gain in the quarter, it looks like you've tightened the high end of EBITDA guidance by about $100 million. Just want to make sure that was entirely tied to the better growth expectations for the year. Thanks. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Mike and then Braxton? J. Braxton Carter - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. What was the first part? John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Why don't you do the second part? J. Braxton Carter - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, Matt, good question. We did narrow the range on our EBITDA guidance. That is solely a function of the increase in postpaid production that we've guided to this quarter. Nothing else was behind that. As you can see, the low end of the range is fully intact the way the guidance is built. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And Mike, for those of you at 5 AM Seattle time, the question was on leasing and EIP. G. Michael Sievert - Chief Operating Officer : Yeah. Got caught up on the second. Yeah, it's really pretty straightforward. I mean, we have two great approaches to bringing financing to the marketplace. One is EIP and one is leasing, which our first version of last year was JUMP! On Demand. And right now, we're much more focused, as you can see in the marketplace, on EIP. You saw in our results from Q1 that leasing as a percent of total devices fell to about 14% and that really is not a statement on our future; it's a statement on our present. And what we found is that of the products that we have in place right now, the one thing, our team is much better at selling our EIP solutions. We've got great systems behind that, it's a faster transaction, it's an easier transaction, but that's not a statement of EIP versus leasing. That's a statement of the products we have in the marketplace right now. So we have a couple of great approaches. What I can tell you is that the guidance that we've given for the year contemplates generally what we expect to do through the balance of the year. It's not to tell you a quarter-by-quarter view on where we'll be emphasized, though, and part of it is to protect some ability to have competitive surprises out there as we continue to evolve our offerings. Matthew Niknam - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. So as it stands now, though, I think it's fair to assume EIP remains the bulk of growth relative to leasing, just based on what's implied by lease revenues for the year? G. Michael Sievert - Chief Operating Officer : When you look at the guidance that we've given and you do the math on the current leasing revenues, it implies that we'll be continuing to do an awful lot of EIPs, and you see our emphasis there right now. But I can't make you any statement quarter-on-quarter about what the mix will be. Matthew Niknam - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: No worries. Thank you. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Operator, next one? Operator : We'll go next to Mike McCormack with Jefferies. Mike L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC : Hey, guys. Thanks. Braxton, maybe just a quick comment. I'm looking at handset phone ARPU ex-Data Stash impacts throughout the year and maybe just give us a sense on the puts and the takes as you think about that. And then secondly, from a subscriber standpoint, obviously, a great job on getting handset outs coming in. Did the unlimited discount plan have significant impact there or was that not as popular? J. Braxton Carter - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : Let me start with the first. I'll hand the second over to Mike. When we look at ARPU adjusted for Data Stash, which, remember, is cash consideration received upfront, just deferred recognition, the first part of the year is disproportionately impacted. Last year, we gave a gift. There was no gift this year. So you essentially have the whole base deferring up to the 20 gigabyte cap, which we anticipate will predominantly happen in the first two quarters of 2016. With that said, there will absolutely be a ramp in ARPUs over the next several quarters as we're getting past that disproportionate upfront impact. When you look at everything sans or excluding the impact of Data Stash, what we saw in the first quarter was actually a 0.3% sequential increase in our postpaid ARPUs, which shows that there is underlying strength from Data Stash, from other things that we're doing in the marketplace and the construct of our promos, and that's even with a very aggressive promotion environment oriented towards family plans. Remember, the vast majority of our flow is coming from AT&T and Verizon, and the percentage of those two incumbents' bases on family plans is well over 80%. So the family plan construct is very favorable for us in taking share and the MPV of those families and the CLV is really much higher than a single line. So it puts a little drag on ARPU, but you can see the way we're executing everything else, we actually increased 0.3% sequentially. Our outlook for the year is general stability of ARPU ex-Data Stash, and that has been our position for the last several quarters and nothing has changed there. G. Michael Sievert - Chief Operating Officer : And for the other part of the question on unlimited. Yes, promotion was a contributor. We had a great lineup of promotions throughout the first quarter. I would say the differentiation around ongoing network improvement and Binge On were the biggest contributors to Q1 performance, but so are our sporadic promotions that we pulsed into the marketplace. In Q1, it was based on our unlimited offer, where we had a four-line offer out there with the fourth line free on unlimited. Couple of comments. One, we said at the time that unlimited isn't really our focus. And I'll tell you why; because Binge On is our focus. And so that was a promotion that we had in place for a time. But overall, if you look at our value proposition, we're focused on letting people have unlimited video and unlimited music at much better price points than they can achieve with unlimited plans overall. That said, we're really proud to be able to offer unlimited. We've got the network that has the capacity and we don't have any plans to change the fact that we offer unlimited. And by the way, keep in mind that offering unlimited has become much more network efficient since the launch of Binge On because the vast majority of our unlimited customers keep their Binge On control activated for a number of reasons, including the speed and reliability of the rest of their data. So that makes delivery of unlimited to those customers much more network efficient for us than it's ever been before. Mike L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC : Mike, as a follow-up on the unlimited stuff, did you see as you expected sort of more people being brought up in ARPU into the plan as opposed to those pricing down? G. Michael Sievert - Chief Operating Officer : Of course, but it was also a promoted plan. So unlimited is our most expensive offer, which helps to draw ARPU up. But on the other hand, for those that would have bought unlimited anyway, it was a promoted offer and it had an effect of bringing ARPU down. Net-net, I'm sure it was a small contributor. Mike L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC : Great. Thank you, guys. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. I want to go into Twitter here and I have to give the persistence award across all platforms and multiple questions to Bill Ho. So Bill, you wore me down. I'm going to take a couple of your questions. One of them is kind of a softball to me, so I thank you. That's probably the one that got my attention, and then we'll go into your second question. But first question that Bill had asked is, is follow-up in postpaid customers, what are the main reasons for porting or specifically value price Binge On, et cetera. And I think, Bill, you're leading the witness with that answer. Why customers are coming or porting away from Verizon and AT&T to T-Mobile has as much to do with what they're not doing and how they've been treating them with the stated long-term now three-years intent of T-Mobile to fix the industry on behalf of all wireless consumers. And the list goes on and it still exists : contracts, overages, fees, bundles, international data charges, not even to mention some of the positives that you've gone on to, which are music streaming, video streaming with Binge On. And then quietly, we have consistently now been for three over the last four quarters in rising JDP's number one, so we have a differentiated customer service experience, a differentiated in-store experience, because we've got highly engaged people that believe in our brand and believe in our company. And all of that together has created an environment where I would say we have as many fans who are sitting inside AT&T and Verizon thanking us for the changes that we're causing their carriers to make as we do with those that have come. So I'm very excited about how long this can take place. Now, the next piece of your question, I'm going to ask Mike to comment. It's about T-Mobile At Work and about \u2013 well, you used the word enterprise space, which for us is much more focused on small and medium business. But any traction in the enterprise base wins from competitors expand to complex solutions, et cetera. So you want to talk about At Work, Mike? G. Michael Sievert - Chief Operating Officer : Yeah. It's been a little bit surprising on At Work. We said very clearly when we launched Un-carrier 9 about a year ago that our focus was on small and medium business. And we updated you once or twice since then and said our run rate with that group had doubled. Well, now it's significantly more than doubled. So progress continues with small and medium business. The thing that we're surprised about, though, is the ongoing performance in our enterprise business. And I think what's happening is the network results that we've been able to post and the rapid improvement in the network over the last year has caused a major reassessment of our business by enterprise customers who may be a couple of years ago just didn't put us in the considered set because enterprises customers have a known set of needs around where their employees need to be able to travel. And there's two ways we're winning with enterprises. One is we're managing to wedge in and take a share at a number of \u2013 a large and increasing number of the Fortune 500 where we don't become the incumbent leader in that enterprise but we go and take some significant share. From where we're starting that's really great. If we can help enterprises to re-price their AT&T and Verizon deal, we're very happy to do that and we considered a service to the industry. If they give us some share along the way that's great. But the other thing is we are actually getting some signature wins while we're taking all of the business from AT&T and Verizon and that's nice to see as well. So, overall, the progress since we began our strategy about a year ago has been terrific and more to come. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Thank you, Bill. We look forward to your next 10 questions across all platform. The next one on the phone, please? Operator : We'll take our next question from Michael Rollins with Citi. Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi, thanks for taking the questions. Just a couple, if I could. Just given some of the comments you made on spectrum, is there an update on your spectrum budget for 2016 and within that context, how are you thinking about the FirstNet RFP opportunity? Thanks. J. Braxton Carter - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. I'll take the first one. Hey, good morning, Mike. Yeah. We are in the quiet period on the auction and really not in a position where we can discuss anything other than prior comments. But we were very clear in our public disclosure leading up to this quiet period about what our total envelope was. And I did comment in the prepared remarks section that we have raised the total of $9 billion and then also discussed the minimum liquidity requirements of the company. So I will leave it at that. Neville R. Ray - Chief Technology Officer & Executive VP : I can pick up the second piece on Mike on FirstNet. Obviously, we are very supportive of the objectives of the FirstNet team and what they're trying to get done for the good of public safety, it's a big goal. I think, for us, at this point in time, we've talked a lot about where we are with the low band push and that's the primary focus for us at this point in time both in terms of rolling out and continuing this rapid rollout of 700 megahertz and in addition back to the first part of your question is this focus on the auction. So timing is not great for us in terms of that opportunity and maybe the complexity it could bring to our business at a point in time when we're driving so hard on low band rollouts. So, at this point in time, nothing to really update. The RFP I think is closing somewhere inside this quarter and it's probably doubtful that it will be a significant player in that. Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks very much. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Operator? Operator : We will take our next question from Walter Piecyk with BTIG. Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC : Thanks. As of yesterday, Verizon was talking about basically going after home broadband connections. I'm just curious if you have any plans for this segment? It sounds like it would take a different type of customer premise equipment than just expecting the end user to have their smartphone or tablet or whatever. So do you have any plans to go after this segment over the next couple years either with or without 5G? John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I'll lead into that Mike and then you pick it up. While following you around I would strongly suggest that that crappy coverage you're getting on your Verizon and your Sprint handsets while you're doing those lame Periscopes would suggest that you should worry less about your home broadband than more about getting some good T-Mobile connectivity. Secondly is, I think it's interesting to hear some of what Verizon is focused on today consistent or inconsistent with a couple months ago when Lowell McAdam was on TV describing in gory detail the impact on consumer wireless at next year's Super Bowl on a 5G implication, but I think that's kind of been walked back to maybe some fixed wireless application and allowing the rest of the world somewhere out to 2020. So let's probe into what they may be talking about on home broadband and, Mike, maybe you can talk about some... G. Michael Sievert - Chief Operating Officer : I'm glad that Verizon finally cop to the fact that a lot of that 5G bluster they've been putting into the market place is actually really about home broadband because they've been running around saying that 5G is about to launch any second now and getting people fired up when really what they're talking about are fixed station modems at fixed locations and it's going to be a little bit more time before they're able to get it to mobile as the industry matures. So the fact they're starting to clarify some of their earlier rhetoric is I think nice to see. Look, this is an opportunity, but let's not discount the opportunity that it already represents for our customers. Yes, there is an opportunity down the road particularly with 5G as we get some increasing breakthroughs in bits per hertz that the wireless technology can deliver. There is some potential for wireline displacement and we're interested in that as much as anybody. But remember, right now, we probably have the largest proportion of customers who rely on their wireless carrier as their only Internet connection, as their only one and its growing. At MetroPCS, it's significant double-digits and at T-Mobile slightly less but still we probably have the highest proportion customer base that is now using their mobile connection as their only mobile connection and an even larger number using it as their primary connection to the Internet. And so strategically mobile is becoming more important in people's digital lives and that positions a company like us who is really great at delivering high-capacity mobile solutions very well. Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC : So in the 5G though, when they were asked about that, you're right, I think that they went more to the fixed but they were also saying that look, we are more aggressive than everyone else and everyone is going to follow us. And frankly, on the Crown Castle call they were showing some fiber links in some cities where there were multiple carriers on their fiber. So it sounds like the small cell stuff is something that you guys are also embracing now. And, I guess, Verizon's point is that you're ultimately going to do a lot more aggressively like they are in the future once you start hitting some of your capacity limits? Neville R. Ray - Chief Technology Officer & Executive VP : Let me pick up, Walt, I mean, I think on the fix piece rate, it's interesting, right. I think the industry is trying to understand what's going to be the best application in the 5G space with this high banded spectrum rate and you see the U.S. plan it's got stuff up to 70 gigahertz and we all know the physics and engineering challenges in getting that type of spectrum to propagate effectively. Now, that said, there's a lot of advancements coming through LTE which will be bolted into and built on in 5G that has the or have the potential to increase propagation and capability of high banded spectrum. Now on the fixed side, I mean, the one thing that Verizon and I think others are talking about, I think in the first part of your question you talked about some form of customer premise equipment which is very different that something set inside your house today. It's some form of structure or installation maybe on the rooftop of your house and that maybe what's required to secure the home broadband experience with the high banded spectrum. So there's a lot of folks looking at this trying to understand what the cost would be, the deployment challenges, there's a whole host of things to work through here. Verizon is looking at that. I think we're all looking at that. We are running our own 5G trials. We've got our lab work underway. We'll do our field trials this year. There's nothing there really doing which is way out in front of anybody else. I think they backed away from some of their earlier statements they're talking now about fixed wireless in the 5G space in 2018. So that's moved back right now a year or 18 months from some of the early statements they made not even a couple of quarters ago. So I think they're starting to understand as they get into this the complexity and challenges involved. Now to your second question in terms of what happens with small cells? Obviously, we are busy on small sales. We can come back to 1001 other things we're doing to continue to deliver the fastest network in the U.S. and the great capacity experience. And that workhorse for this industry is LTE and LTE Advanced really over the next 5 to 10 years because it's the macro layer of LTE that is going to deliver the great broadband experience. Now we are going to be supplementing capacity as will many others in hotspot environments be that in LTE and/or in with 5G capabilities when that comes to bear and that's the best place for 5G to play. Right. It's going to be in hotspot locations where the propagation and physics of high banded spectrum are less of a concern. And so, everybody, you know, us particularly that's our primary interest. You look at the large volumes of spectrum, how do you apply that best in a mobile environment in areas of capacity concern that will come at us into 2020, 2021 type timeframe. And we're there. Obviously, we're pushing hard on small cell capabilities, we're building our fiber out, not building our own fiber but leveraging fiber that's there from others. And you'll see us start to densify this network. What is the most dense network in the U.S. today, right, coming from T-Mobile, you will see us continue those efforts and stay ahead of the competition. I always talk about the best proxy for the capacity offered in the U.S. today is the fastest network. And here we are nine quarters in a row and approaching two-and-a-half years, we're the fastest network in the U.S. And if I'm Verizon, one, I'm pretty frustrated about that. Two, I'm looking over my shoulder because T-Mobile may match my breadth if not exceed it with the largest network in the U.S. before too long. So what do I do? I change the nature of the game. I try and change it anyway and change the discussion to something which is as loose and amorphous as 5G is today in the hope that enables me to maintain some form of view of a superior network experience to come. Good game. But the next two to three years, you will see us push and be the fastest growing, the fastest network and the most advanced network with what we're doing on LTE. J. Braxton Carter - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : You know, Walt, what's was really interesting is Verizon spent billions of dollars on their brand saying that they're the leaders in network but the facts of the matter don't support that. Neville, why don't you to talk a little bit about VoLTE. Neville R. Ray - Chief Technology Officer & Executive VP : Yeah. I think on \u2013 if we look at capacity right and folks ask this question about where are we heading with capacity growth on our network. And there's a number of things that we're working through. Obviously, the deployment of 700 MHz is great. We have AWS-3 spectrum which we'll get to customers in the early part of 2017. But probably, the biggest thing to think about is, I'll do rough math for you. Half our network, just over half our network today is LTE in terms of the spectrum that we own. So half our spectrum is on the LTE technology and that covers almost 90% of our data and today and this is the really interesting stat, 53% of our call volumes are on LTE with Voice over LTE. So, when you look at the other half of the spectrum of what it's doing, it's not doing that much. And so our biggest opportunity and what we're working through very hard this year and we will continue next is how we reform and bring the benefits of the other half of our spectrum towards LTE and all the inherent multiplying efficiencies that LTE brings as contrasted to legacy networks. When I look at our competitive set, some of them without even one VoLTE capable handset in the marketplace today are struggling to drive VoLTE at the pace we have, nobody coming anywhere close to the level of VoLTE calling. You have to look hard at their spectrum positions and say how do they make it through the next two to three years. What are they going to go do? Because 5G is not going to solve anything for anybody in terms of capacity on these networks for some time to come. So LTE is the workhorse and I think we've been very loud and proud about having an all-LTE network, first to stability, first to ICS, first to EBS now. I mean, we have the leading LTE network in the U.S. There is no doubt hands-down, we are pushing the LTE technology faster and harder than anybody else and we will be the first to deliver on all LTE network product across the U.S. marketplace. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So, thank you for giving us a few seconds to vent about Verizon. I would like to preliminarily announce that it's highly likely over the next two quarters that Verizon will take over the dumber spot of Dumb And Dumber from AT&T. We still have a soft spot for AT&T because they are by far the biggest contributor of postpaid ports into our company. By the way, 80% of the postpaid porting come from AT&T and Verizon. So if you ever wonder why we focus so much on them and the pride factor for Neville and for the employees at T-Mobile is this 5G shenanigans is nothing other than a scream for help to try to capture a brand to have something to say in your Better Matters campaign when T-Mobile now has 308 million POPs, virtually the same coverage, 194 million POPs of 700 MHz deployed and T-Mobile is showing up for the low band options in a way that could set us up for the future. And in effect, you may have even seen it, Walt, I know you are a big follower of rap, I even wrote a rap song for Verizon because their earnings were so easy that I hope the Millennials could follow this. And it really is our revenue declined, we lost postpaid phones, we walked back on 5G and we still hope to get some Millennials. I mean, that in effect is all you need to know about Verizon's earnings and what they're doing on 5G. Okay. Operator, next one? Operator : We will take our next question from John Hodulik with UBS. John Christopher Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks. Maybe another one for Neville. I mean, given the usage you're seeing from Binge On and the unlimited offering and the use of mobile for fixed, are there any data usage stats that you could share with us on a per device basis? And maybe talk about some of the growth you're seeing in traffic over on your network? And then actually a question back on prepaid, the prepaid share number really stood out and I take it that was likely driven by the improvements in the network. Is this sort of sub four level? Is it more seasonal or is it more secular and do you think you can keep it below 4% going forward? Thanks. Neville R. Ray - Chief Technology Officer & Executive VP : Hey. John, let me take the first piece. So, the way we look at the network loading, I mean, it's effectively doubling year on year, right? I mean that's been our historical run rate for the last two to three years. I see nothing that would say it will be any different in 2016 and into 2017. Mike actually talked about the offset with Binge On and the efficiencies it brings back into the network that's north of 10% now with a large number of customers congesting video on 480p compared to 1080p or 720p. So those things actually help. But I touched on some of these. Obviously, we're working very hard to build a more efficient network product and that's everything from deploying the new spectrum assets that we have in the house, redeploying the old spectrum assets that we've had in 1900 PCS for some time, the VoLTE push, MIMO is coming this year for us. So this is another maybe a tone competitively for the other folks out there. I mean, we're predominantly 2x4 today on MIMO, we'll be 4x4 this year. I love to see where the competitive set will be on that. Three-way carrier aggregation is coming; allowing us to force and push our speeds up, the three-way carrier ag, which we'll have live in some areas in some markets, certainly mid-year. That's a 300 Mps type peak speed. We're going to continue pushing every which way on capacity. We're also pushing on on license. So there's a couple of Twitter questions floating around on what's happening with LTE-U and LAA. I'll tell you there we're frustrated and we're not seeing the progress that we would like to see. We still have an ambition to push solutions into the marketplace inside 2016. But based on where we are from a regulatory perspective at this point in time, the light is dimming there a little. But that said, we are making good progress. We have an SDA under review with the FCC which would allow us to advance testing. Pieces like that, us leveraging unlicensed spectrum when you think about it in 2017 and 2018, there's a lot of different options for us to expand not just the reach but the capacity and capability of the network. So, a lot of growth around us, but that's the game and the fascinating piece for me is if our competition is going to make the big bet on 5G then let's watch the networks implode in 2017 and 2018 and 2019 before there's any cavalry coming with 5G and capacity and benefit from that in the 2020, 2021 timeframe. So, game on. The next two to three years it's critical and LTE Advance is going to be the workhorse and, as I said earlier on, we will lead. John Christopher Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC : What about monthly usage for smartphone. Can you give us that and maybe how quickly that's grown? Neville R. Ray - Chief Technology Officer & Executive VP : It will be on par with what I've said on kind of a year-on-year basis. You can back into those numbers, John. We don't normally disclose a monthly number. John Christopher Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. G. Michael Sievert - Chief Operating Officer : And John on prepaid churn, yeah, thanks for the comment. We're delighted with where things are. We don't guide on churn specifically, but there are some tailwinds to our business that are generated by a couple of things here. Number one, the fact that MetroPCS continues to grow as a proportion of our total prepaid subs. Metro traditionally has a much lower churn rate than other prepaid brands, and including our T-Mobile brand, and that's because its business model is different. At Metro, we have \u2013 it's predominated by exclusive distribution, which is relationship based and we are able to more tightly manage those relationships with customers. It has much higher device attach. And device is really important for a longitudinal relationship with the customer and we do some amount of device subsidies there. And, of course, Metro, as opposed to some of the competitors out there, is attached to the T-Mobile network, which has been rapidly expanding and improving, as Neville said. So all those things generate lower churn than a typical prepaid business has, and as Metro grows as a percentage of our total base, we see some potential for improvement there. And you saw in the results this quarter as Metro predominanted an all-time record 800,000-plus net adds in the quarter. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. I want to go to Twitter. A question came in, I think, Walt Piecyk moved over to this forum since we got him on his call. Can you provide an update on porting ratios by carrier? Yeah, this is another area that we are very pleased and very comfortable with and very consistent on. As we said, overall porting against the industry has been positive for 12 quarters. It's been over nine quarters where each one has been positive. The overall postpaid porting ratio in Q1 was 1.5, so 1.5 times, which is something we're very comfortable with. That's down from 1.67 times last quarter. The way it breaks down by carrier is AT&T was 1.75; last quarter it was 1.92. Verizon was 1.34; last quarter it was 1.44. And Sprint was 1.35; and last quarter it was 1.56. Two comments. One is that we don't want to start switching the data that we look at. But we're looking, as you may have noticed, our way to compete with Sprint is via MetroPCS. So we are very much targeting Sprint users with MetroPCS offers. So when you look at the porting between Sprint and MetroPCS and T-Mobile, that's in the 1.6 to 1.7 range over the last quarter. I think that's a strong way for us to look at it and we will continue to. Second thing is, in the short part that we've had in Q2, as we said, very important trends we're looking at is AT&T has gone back up last week towards 1.8 from 1.75 and Verizon has gone back up towards 1.5. So, as I said, in the long term, these are all porting rates that we are \u2013 if everybody's happy with this, we're really happy and we can just keep going on this way and we'll be twice as big as them in a specific period of time. Let's go to the phone for another question. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Jonathan Chaplin with New Street Research. Jonathan Chaplin - New Street Research LLP (US): Thanks. One quick one for Braxton and then one for Neville. Braxton, just to sort of add more specificity around some of the comments you made on free cash flow. I think given the ramp in EBITDA, you're looking at flat CapEx. And your prior comments on the sort of working capital drag being down, it looked like free cash flow sort of $1.5 billion to $2 billion should be easily achievable. I'm just wondering if there's anything that would have changed that view in the quarter. And if that's the case, it looks like you've got more resources than you need going into the auction just from sort of cash on hand and free cash flow that you generate. With the extra $1.35 billion you're raising from DT, just the sort of putting in place an incremental cautious cushion or are there other uses of free cash flow that we're not thinking about? And then for Neville, I realize you guys are still making progress on using LTE and unlicensed spectrum, but it looks like that's been pushed back by at least sort of 18 months in terms of being something that could come to market. Has that changed your network plans at all? When do you think you will be able to get all of your spectrum moved over to LTE? Thanks. J. Braxton Carter - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : Yes, Jonathan. Hey, by the way, great title on your piece this morning. Jonathan Chaplin - New Street Research LLP (US): Thanks, Braxton. You guys deserve it. J. Braxton Carter - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : Ghetto Superstar, that's pretty impressive. Love it. Okay. To answer your questions, you are directionally correct on all of the comments that you made. You really go through the piece parts on your views on cash flow generation are spot on. There are no other uses of cash other than for the spectrum; we're generating significant cash flow on the business. The only reason that we've raised any additional funds to which I commented a total of $9 billion, $5 billion on balance sheet, $4 billion committed bridges from DT, is for spectrum opportunities that are in the marketplace. And there had been no changes in the quarter that would change our view at all as to total cash generation for the business. Neville R. Ray - Chief Technology Officer & Executive VP : Let me pick up, Jonathan, morning, on your two questions in there for me. On leveraging LTE-U, LAA and the 18-month statement, we're not buying into an 18-month delay on that. I think I referenced this just in the prior dialogue. We are still pushing very hard. We've made progress with the Wi-Fi Alliance and all of its constituent members on the test spec. As I said, we've applied for an FDA, which I believe will be favorably reviewed and approved by the FCC shortly. And testing will move through the next two to three months at a fairly quick pace. We actually have commercial kind of small cell product ready to roll, that's LTE-U capable. And the handsets being the long pole in the tent, we're still pushing with our OEMs for 2016 capability. That piece may slide into early 2017, but that's kind of the timeframe for us at this point in time. It's a 4Q kind of 1Q 2017 story and we're going to keep pushing very, very hard. A lot of consumer benefits in there. That said, have we rolled this in and included this as a key element of our capacity growth and the answer is no, not yet. I think all of the measures that I talked through earlier on that's our plan A. We want to clearly move into leveraging LTE-U, ton of consumer benefits, speed and capacity on so many dimensions there. And that will become something more formative really in the 2017 and 2018 timeframe. And then finally, the kind of all-LTE story, I mean, what you'll see us do this year is, our GSM network, it carries very, very little traffic today. By the end of the year, that will be down to a very, very thin kind of skinny GSM layer, small number of channels to support kind of nomadic and non-mobile GSM products and services, which there is a demand for and we'll leave that be for some period of time. We're not retiring GSM; we don't need to go there. We've figured out how to put a thin layer of GSM in and amongst us our other technology assets. And then the main push is how fast can we continue to drive VoLTE into our base and retire UMTS and HSPA voice services. That won't complete in 2017; that'll probably be a tale in 2018. But we're driving that as fast as we can. And with 53% of all of our core volumes on VoLTE today, that number year ago was about 9%. So we're moving at a tremendous pace. Our VoLTE performance is, I believe, second to none globally in terms of adoption and the performance of the VoLTE layer, and so our ability to move to an all-LTE product is way out in front of any of our competitors at this point in time. And I'm hopeful we'll come in long before 2020. Jonathan Chaplin - New Street Research LLP (US): So, Neville, just to wrap some specificity around that quickly. On GSM is a very thin layer, sort of 5x5 or even less than that. And what would you need sort of at the end of this year for UMTS voice in terms of spectrum allocation? Neville R. Ray - Chief Technology Officer & Executive VP : Yeah. It's definitely less than 5x5. And that's the purpose. I'm talking of maybe half a dozen channels of GSM, right. J. Braxton Carter - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : For machine-to-machine purposes. Neville R. Ray - Chief Technology Officer & Executive VP : So for machine-to-machine, nomadic services really non-mobility GSM and there's a lot of customers that want that. And it's more beneficial and cost-effective to actually run that service for a period of time until we move into thinner LTE products, the IoT space, et cetera. You don't have to wait for 5G for those things to come through. But the thin GSM will be there for a period of time. On UMTS, I mean, we have \u2013 you can run the math on our spectrum assets today and it varies by market. But I'd love to get down to kind of a 5x5 carrier on UMTS in the 2017 timeframe, 2017 in probably some markets, a little more than that in 2018, but that's the goal and objective in front of the team. Jonathan Chaplin - New Street Research LLP (US): Got it. Thanks, guys. G. Michael Sievert - Chief Operating Officer : Hey, Jonathan, your question brings an opportunity to raise an interesting point to amplify something that Braxton said, which is \u2013 and we've been foreshadowing this for a while. But we've reached a point in the last quarter where device financing wasn't really a material cash \u2013 didn't really have a material working capital impact on our cash. And that's a big milestone we've been talking about for a long time. It's kind of a good guy hidden in the numbers. In our Factbook, we tell investors how to make the calculations because we have both have EIP and leasing now. But in the quarter, overall net-net handset financing consumed about $104 million, which is a great place for us to be now as that overall working capital account across leasing and across EIP, even though geography is very different, is not materially growing in the last quarter. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey, operator? Operator : We'll take our next question from Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson. Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC : Hi. I guess, I'll return to the free flow question one last time, Braxton. And given your comment about the ramp that you expect in free cash flow, as do we, the obvious question is, how do you think about your priorities for capital allocation over the next couple of years with respect to delevering? And if it turns out that Deutsche Telekom isn't interested in reducing their stake then how do you think about share repurchases in the open market? J. Braxton Carter - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. Let me make one comment, Craig. And we did file an update to our shelf registration statements yesterday and those were purely administrative. As per the original shareholders' agreement, we had a requirement to register DT shares and debt, and we are approaching the three-year mark on that initial registration. So it's just purely an administrative item. Obviously, the best use of cash is to invest in the operations, but now that we've reached a significant inflection point of rapidly growing cash with the only potential use for that cash, excess cash, opportunistic spectrum transactions. It gets really exciting in the not short term, but the midterm, given what we're seeing with the business. It is a potential that we can start returning cash to our shareholders, which really changes the whole makeup of our company. But that's not to be expected in the short term. We are taking our leverage up; we'll have to see what happens with the auction. We'll organically delever rapidly as we've continued to delever over the last couple of years. But the possibility of shareholder returns is viable when you look at in the medium term. So, very, very good question. Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC : Thanks, Braxton. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. We're going to take one last question from the phone. And I am warning you, depending upon the length of this, I've got to leave to get down to the Exchange to talk to CNBC. So operator, go to the next one and if Braxton gives you the thank you and you don't hear my voice, it all depends upon the volume of the answer to this one. Operator : Thank you. And we'll take our next question from Ric Prentiss with Raymond James. Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hi, guys. Thanks for slipping me in there. One quick one and then one broader one. The quick one is, taking the low band spectrum up to 258 million POPs rapidly, have you already closed on that spectrum and is that baked into the 260 million POPs to 270 million POPs marketed stores by mid-2017? John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. We own that spectrum and we're planning to rapidly build against that. Neville can give you a little bit on the timelines. I think he addressed that a little while ago. Neville R. Ray - Chief Technology Officer & Executive VP : Let's clarify it. The transactions that were entered into the first quarter of this year have not closed. We have executed transactions, we have to go through the FCC approval, so we have not paid and closed on those. We did close the fourth quarter transaction and pay for that in the first quarter. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Let's continue to point out that the footprint that we cover now is 308 million POPs. We've got amplified coverage in the 258 million POPs and growing. So from a standpoint of retail presence, it's driven by the former. But Neville, why don't you continue? Neville R. Ray - Chief Technology Officer & Executive VP : Yeah. So we are waiting on approval on some of those licenses, Ric, but that doesn't prevent us from doing the work we need to do ahead of time from a site perspective, there's de minimis risk on approval on those deals. The other piece we haven't talked to you today is where will we end up the year in terms of covered box. I'm kind of laying down the gauntlet with my team. We're not going to rest until we have a network as big as Verizon's, if not bigger. I would like to get as close to that number as I can by the end of this year, which means we'll be north of 310 million POPs. That's going to be primarily driven by what we can achieve on additional 700 MHz rollout. Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And the broader question is back to the fixed wireless broadband comments earlier, Google Fiber came out \u2013 was talking about interesting going beyond fiber to a fixed wireless aspect. Can you update us just kind on where you are with technology companies and kind of supporting maybe people that want to get in and further shake up the industry? You guys have done a good job shaking out. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Say more about what you mean by the question, Ric? Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Yeah, sure. So Google Fiber came out in an interview about a week-and-a-half ago talking about how they really want to push beyond where fiber is economic and go into areas where possibly fixed wireless broadband would be more important. You guys also have some other relationships with Google. So I'm just trying to understand they are obviously not coming to the broadcast auction, but if you had any update for us in kind of your dealings with nontraditional companies and telecom? John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Got it. Not a lot that we can get into other than the fact that a lot of us share the same goals. I mean, one of the things we've said before is that all content and consumption is rapidly transferring to the Internet, and the Internet itself is rapidly transferring to mobile. That positions us in a pretty good spot. So, as you know and as we've talked about, we have deep partnerships with some of these companies, we're working with them collaboratively. Google is an interesting company. They really want to see great broadband Internet reach every person. And, obviously, wireless is a really important tool on how to do that. They've made investments in fiber because they want to see great unfettered access in urban and suburban communities, but there's also an opportunity for wireless to reach people. And as I said earlier, we have the biggest base of customers in a proportion who rely solely or mostly on wireless for their Internet connection in the first place. And that positions us as a company and as a brand really well as wireless becomes a more and more important part of the overall Internet story for typical consumers. I mean, think about your own behavior. We all spend way more time on our wireless device accessing the Internet than any of us would have guessed a couple of years ago. So that opens up lots of partnership opportunities for us. I mean, I don't have announcements for you today about those partnerships, but the premise of your question is spot on. Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. Thanks. And that'll help a lot with the periscopes, too, I guess. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Right on. J. Braxton Carter - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : Well, we want to thank everyone today for tuning in and definitely looking forward to speaking to you again in the second quarter earnings call. And have a great day. Thanks for your interest. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes the T-Mobile US first quarter 2016 conference call. If you have any further questions, you may contact the Investor Relations or media departments. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. And have a wonderful day.",

Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC James M. Ratcliffe - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc. Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the T-Mobile US Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. Following opening remarks, the earnings call will be open for questions via the conference line, Tweeter, Facebook, or text message. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Nils Paellmann, Head of Investor Relations for T-Mobile US. Please go ahead, sir. Nils Paellmann - Vice President IR and Head of Investor Relations : Thank you. Good morning. Welcome to our second quarter 2016 earnings call. With me today are John Legere, our President and CEO; Braxton Carter, our CFO; and other members of the senior leadership team. Just read the disclaimer. During this call, we will make projections and statements about the future performance of the company, which are based on current expectations and assumptions. Our Form 10-K includes risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Reconciliations between GAAP and the non-GAAP results we discuss on this call can be found on the Investor Relations page of our Website. With this, let me now turn it over to John Legere. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Good morning. I know that I'm happy to see that the warning and disclaimer has yet to be updated (1:35 \u2013 1:39). I wanted to say good morning to everybody and thank you for joining us. T-Mobile second quarter 2016 Un-carrier earnings call is an open Twitter conference as well and we're coming to you live from Bellevue. And you know, I'd like to make this more about answering your questions rather than scripts. So, after a few opening comments, we're going to keep it open for up to 90 minutes and take as many questions from Twitter, Facebook and the phone as we can. As usual, there's a live stream up right now on YouTube. So, if you want to watch how the soup is made in the kitchen as fascinating as that may be, (02:11 \u2013 02:16). So, let's talk about Q2. And obviously, we're in a good mood and I'm very proud of our team who delivered an outstanding quarter on all metrics and turned in another quarter of really blockbuster growth. Even while our competitors struggled with a quarter, that was seasonally low. Now, T-Mobile's delivered the best results in the industry again, beating the competition in key metrics, a few, such as net postpaid phone additions, prepaid phone addition, service revenue, and adjusted EBITDA growth. And in particular, service revenue growth is certainly an anomaly that is attributable only to T-Mobile. So, let me share a few highlights that are pertinent. With 1.9 million total net adds in Q2, marked our 13th consecutive quarter over 1 million net adds. We added 890,000 branded postpaid customers. We also added 646,000 branded postpaid phone customers, which are getting such discussion in the industry. That's 10 quarters in a row, by the way, that we've lead the entire industry on postpaid phone additions. Clearly, our winning streak continues this quarter. We captured all, actually, more than all of the industry's postpaid phone growth in Q2 once again. Now, that's not the end of our story because in prepaid, where we have the industry's top prepaid brand in MetroPCS, we added 476,000 new customers. Our Metro team continues to dominate with a growth rate of 167% over last year. Now, that also, by the way, that's 3 years, 12 quarters where T-Mobile is the only wireless company with positive growth in both prepaid and postpaid net. Now, let's talk about porting and let's look at the whole picture. There are share givers and there are share takers and T-Mobile has been a share taker now for 13 quarters in a row, for 3 years running including Q2. We delivered positive overall postpaid porting ratios versus the entire industry. Also, we've now had 10 quarters in a row where T-Mobile has been positive against every major carrier contrary to what you may have heard on Monday. I will acknowledge that Sprint made some progress after going all in with a heavy discount strategy, but we are seeing positive postpaid porting ratios now for the 13 quarters in a row versus Sprint including Q2, and we're off to an even stronger start versus them and everyone else in Q3, and I'll be glad to talk more about that in detail. So, really, I'm actually very happy to sit back and take share like we did this quarter from here to the end of times if everybody else is. And our net additions show the math and they show it all. It's also worth noting, by the way, and I'm going to add this to what we discussed above, our porting ratios that we talk about, none of these include our incredible MetroPCS prepaid business, and we're the only wireless carrier who actually has two number pools. So, people aren't tracking this. But what we're doing now is we track when we look competitive, we look at both the postpaid porting ratios, we also look at T-Mobile plus Metro porting against the other carriers. And this is particularly important because MetroPCS has been our primary attack dog against Sprint and others. That's working incredibly well. And when you combine our two flagship brands, the story gets even better. We showed improvements versus Dumb and Dumber in that in Q1 with AT&T by the way continuing to be the biggest donor by far and with the net ports on the postpaid side, they generally donate 50% or so, and that's a point that I've been making all in all. When you look at this ratio, our strength versus all three carriers including Sprint is even stronger. So, the carriers, by the way, have been busy this quarter, but I think we just sort of saw the same old bag of tricks. And I think Verizon must be feeling the pressure, because when they were not distracted with their Yahoo! Purchase, which clearly we can discuss its prominence in providing them the term Dumber now, they decided to give away 50-inch TVs, always a bad sign by the way in the wireless industry. They also agreed to rejigger their prices to start the quarter. More importantly, did anyone besides me notice that a number of their new plan features are straight out of the Un-carrier playbook? There's no overages attempted and free LTE roaming in Mexico and Canada sound familiar. And they didn't do it well, but they certainly tried to copy our moves. The crucial difference here is that Verizon is still nickel and diming their customers for these features, which are free to any Simple Choice customers. They just don't get it, and I love that about them. Now, it's hard to tell what's going on over at AT&T. I know it's hard for all of you that are trying to track them to understand it as well. They seem to be on an extended vacation. I guess their focus is on prepaid since they don't seem to be putting up much of a fight on the postpaid side. Maybe they're buying time while they wait and see what the long promised OTT bundles will be or they're hoping their connected cars will hide some of the losses. Your guess is as good as mine. But I also love every time we talk about a carrier, it is always about we think they're going to do in the future. Finally, we have Sprint. They reported on Monday to some fanfare and I congratulated them on a good quarter. Now, T-Mobile just happened to deliver a great quarter with five times their total nets, five times their postpaid nets, and nearly four times their postpaid phone nets. And that's before we talked about our prepaid net addition of nearly a half a million. This is where our brand segmentation plays itself out beautifully. And by the way, one last comment going through and I could take this in Q&A as well. By the way, we're early in July, and I can tell you already that if you look at last quarter at the postpaid phone nets, which were a big negative for AT&T at minus 266,000; 86,000 for Verizon; and a whopping 173,000 for Sprint. I can tell you that already in July, we have 25% more postpaid phone nets than Sprint did all of last quarter. So, that'll give you an idea of the momentum. Congratulations, it took us till about July 17 to do what you did last quarter. So, yes, we win customers from our competition. But they also stay with T-Mobile. We had our lowest churn rate ever this quarter. Branded postpaid phone churn in Q2 was down 6 basis points quarter-over-quarter, 5 basis points year-over-year to 1.27%. So, on top of all the customer momentum and success, we delivered as you'll hear rock solid financial results. And we remain the only growth company in the space. Now, think about that. In wireless, we're the only growth company. Our company growth is \u2013 our customer growth is rapidly translating into double-digit revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth as we said it would. In Q2, we delivered year-over-year service revenue growth of 12% and year-over-year adjusted EBITDA growth of 36%. Incredible. Now, our ARPU story is also great, 1.9% increase in branded postpaid phone ARPU over the last quarter to $47.11 and prepaid ARPU has hit an all-time high at $37.86. Now, that's an important number to think about, $37.86 at all-time high is our prepaid ARPU. And you can compare and contrast that with the connected car or various other wholesale options that make up the top net growth of the other companies. These are big powerful profitable customers that we're adding. Our investments in network, retail, customer care and more on carrier moves continue to pay off. And, by the way, we have not stumbled upon a way to build a world-class wireless network without investing in it. We're still open minded to how that's done, but in this case, we think we do it the old fashion way. And there's some things that we know. Q2's continued success simply means we will keep investing and fueling even more growth. Let's talk about the network. Verizon's network is no longer in a class of its own. Our coverage is near parity. And, by the way, our network is still the fastest in the industry. We now cover 311 million 4G LTE POPs. 311 million, and, again, had the fastest 4G LTE network in Q2. And that is from crowdsource studies against all carriers, not some sampling of application speed in a 100 small cities, et cetera. This is serious result consistently applied, and Neville have a lot more to say about that. Now, 311 million POPs. Our deployment of extended range LTE on the 700 megahertz A-Block spectrum band is way ahead of schedule. 350 markets are now live, covering more than 200 million people and customers are experiencing the benefit first hand. And we are far from done. In the second quarter, we've entered into an agreement to acquire the crucial Chicago A-Block spectrum license, bringing our total low-band spectrum footprint to 269 million once we closed the transaction later this year. We will already have low-band spectrum in top 10 metro areas in 29 of the top 30. And finally, we are a qualified bidder for the incentive auction and we look forward to the start of the forward auction in August. Now as our network grows so does our retail presence. In terms of distribution footprint, we're on track with our plans for 400 additional T-Mobile retail doors in 2016 and are still targeting 30 million to 40 million additional marketing POPs by the middle of next year. Now, let's not forget about customer care. Our care organization continues to be recognized for taking care of customers. It's part of our DNA and what we do best. Just yesterday, we found out that we were ranked highest by JDP, J.D. Power for Total Ownership Experience. So, I wanted to say congratulations to the best care team in the business. Keep up the great work. And of course, we are not finished with our Un-carrier moves. With the launch of Un-carrier 11, we gave thanks in a big way to our customers without any tricks or tradeoffs. The response has been phenomenal. Nearly, 5 million T-Mobile Tuesdays apps have been installed and customers have hit the redeem in the app 8 million times to receive their epic gifts just to say thank you. And may I remind you, there is a Tuesday every week. So, the second quarter is in the books. It was a fantastic quarter for T-Mobile. 2016 is delivering great customer growth, outstanding financial results, and creating great value for our shareholders. Our strong performance means we're raising the customer outlook and narrowing the adjusted EBITDA target for 2016. Now, let me hand it over to our CFO, Braxton Carter, for an overview of our key financial highlights. And he'll tell you about the updates for our full year 2016 guidance. Braxton? J. Braxton Carter - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. Thanks, John. And it's so exciting to be here for another quarter of solid execution. Let me give a quick snapshot of our strong financial results and an update of our 2016 guidance. Let's start with the financial results for the second quarter. Our customer growth is translating into a very strong financial growth as we once again deliver the industry leading metrics. Service revenues grew by 12%, and adjusted EBITDA came in at $2.5 billion in the second quarter, up 36% year-over-year. The adjusted EBITDA margin expanded from 30% to 36% year-over-year. This compares with 32% in the first quarter, if you exclude the large spectrum of gain that we recorded in the first quarter. Adjusted free cash flow improved year-over-year from $73 million to $485 million. Net cash from operating activities increased by 52% and benefited from a cash inflow of $0.4 billion in connection with the sale of EIP receivables. The increase in net cash from operating activities was partially offset by higher cash CapEx, which increased by 13% year-over-year. Cash CapEx was more front-end-loaded this year due to our very aggressive rollout of the 700 megahertz A-Block, which is bringing a lot of goodness as you're seeing in our customer retention or churn metrics. This is just the timing issue which we will normalize in the course of the year. Compared to the first quarter, working capital benefited even further from a reduced take rates for leasing, which amounted to just 3% of total devices sold or leased in the second quarter as we told you at the beginning of the year. We continue to expect a significant improvement in free cash flow for this year especially with the front-end loading of cash CapEx, the free cash flow story is going to get very exciting in the second half of 2016. Earnings per share came in at $0.25 per share in the second quarter, compared to $0.56 in the first quarter. Recall that the first quarter EPS included an after-tax impact of $0.46 related to the spectrum gain. So, underlying EPS was up strongly. When comparing EPS to last year, recall that net income in the second quarter of the prior year benefited from an unusually low tax rate due to several discrete income tax items whereas this quarter the effective tax rate was essentially normal at 39.5%. Branded postpaid ARPU grew by 1.9% sequentially. Excluding Data Stash, the sequential growth rate amounted to 0.8%, which represents the second quarter of sequential underlying growth. Overall, we are very pleased that ARPU continues to be generally stable. In terms of customer quality, we saw continued improvements in the quarter. Total bad debt expense and losses from sale of receivables was $165 million, or 1.79% of total revenues. Compared to 2.10% in the first quarter of 2016 and 1.91% in the second quarter of 2015. EIP receivables classified as Prime was 53% at the end of the second quarter, including the EIP receivable sold, compared to 52% at the end of the first quarter. Let met update you on our recent transaction. In June 2016, we entered into an agreement under which we agreed to sell our marketing and distribution rights to certain existing T-Mobile co-branded customers to a current MVNO partner. The transaction expected to close late third quarter of 2016 and subject to regulatory approval and other closing conditions. Assuming closing, approximately $1.4 million branded postpaid phone customers and approximately 0.3 million branded prepaid customers would transition to being reported as wholesale customers. The customer transition is expected to have a significant impact on reported branded postpaid phone churn following closing. For example, on a pro forma basis as of the transaction close at the beginning of the second quarter of 2016, reported branded postpaid phone churn would have been 18 basis points lower at 1.09%. Yes, 1.09%. Identical to the consumer mobility postpaid churn reported by AT&T in Q2. Now, let me give you an update on our 2016 guidance. In light of the continued strong customer momentum, we are taking up our target for branded postpaid net customer additions to 3.4 million to 3.8 million, up from the prior target of 3.2 million to 3.6 million. For adjusted EBITDA, our new target range is $9.8 billion to $10.1 billion, narrowing the prior target range of $9.7 billion to $10.2 billion. This target range includes the spectrum gain of approximately $0.6 billion recorded in the first quarter. Our EBITDA target also includes the aggregate impact from leasing and Data Stash of $0.8 billion to $1.0 billion, again narrowing the prior range of $0.7 billion to $1 billion. For Data Stash, we now expect $300 million to $350 million, compared to the prior expectation of $250 million to $350 million. Finally, we target cash CapEx of $4.5 billion to $4.8 billion in 2016, which is unchanged from prior guidance. In summary, we delivered very strong financial results in the second quarter and expect continued strong growth in 2016. We won't stop. Now, let's get to your questions. You can ask questions via phone, text message or via Twitter or Facebook. We will start with the questions on the phone. Operator? Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from John Hodulik with UBS. John Christopher Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks. Two quick ones if I could. First of all, you gave us some good stats around for T-Mobile Tuesdays. Is there any way you can tease out the benefits you might have seen in terms of churn and the cost that may have gone along with that initiative? And then, Braxton, in the past, you've talked about a margin target of 34% to 36%. You're at, call it, 36% or so now. Obviously, there's some leasing in there. But, I mean, as you guys see leverage in the business, can you \u2013 do you have sort of line of sight to sort of 40%-plus margin sort of longer term? Is that something we could expect? Thanks. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Let's move around. Mike, make sure your mic's on. I'll let Mike talk about the phenomenon where we learned that Americans love their pizza much to the detriment of those that don't have enough dough on Tuesday. But maybe you can talk about this ongoing phenomenon with the \u2013 and by the way, I'll just say coming in, you never know when you launched these things which thing is going to strike the nerve of a whole nation. And I would say we've had 6.6 billion social media impressions associated with this and a phenomenal amount of media stories and reach that actually matches or exceeds most Un-carrier moves or Super Bowl advertising. So, when you think of some of those statistics, not only is the phenomenon so far as Mike will describe critical to our relationship with our customers, but it's got legs in a very, very big way. So, Mike, do you want to talk? And then we'll go to Braxton. G. Michael Sievert - Chief Operating Officer : Yeah, John. It's kind of amazing what's happened here. I mean, some people were asking whether or not we were running out of ideas on Un-carrier moves. And I think the results around Un-carrier 11 show that that's an emphatic no. As John said, this has just been \u2013 this has captured the imagination of Americans. This was the most talked about Un-carrier move we've ever done and also the most covered in the media with 56 million broadcast impressions. As John said, 6.6 billion social impressions from conversations, 3,600 new stories. That app hit number one in the App Store multiple days over a two-week period, and number one in the App Store isn't like a categorical thing, number one in our category. That means like number five is Facebook, number four is Instagram, number two is Snapchat. The number one app in America for many days of the launch sequence over two weeks was T-Mobile Tuesdays. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: But don't remember number 793 was Go90. G. Michael Sievert - Chief Operating Officer : That's true. Yeah. Over the last week, the number one app was Pokemon, the number two app was Pokemon related, and the number three app was T-Mobile Tuesdays in America. So, it continues. We're not going to be able to unpack for you the business results sort of line-by-line. But remember, we had a record low churn in Q2. And as John said, we're off to an amazing start in Q3 with more postpaid phone nets than anyone in the industry did in the entire quarter of Q2. And what we've tapped in here, what we like to do with Un-carrier moves is tap into a sentiment, tap into a pain point, a preexisting belief. And in this case, it's the idea that there's a big difference between a loyalty program and a thank you program. Loyalty programs are something that companies do to say you the customer should comply with what we as a company want. You should do things for us. And what we'll do as a company is we'll track you. We'll keep track of how compliant you are in the form of points or something and one day someday, we'll give you something. Whereas a thank you program just says thank you. Not once. Not down the road, but every single week. And people love it. They love the phenomenon. So stay tuned for even more results down the road. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And let's switch to Braxton, but a footnote. This is where \u2013 there's a couple of things that are important to me when we announce earnings. There's a lot of focus on short-term metrics, but also, not enough on the real qualitative investments that are going on into creating the business in a sustainable way. There's also a weird comparison all the time still about what are the price of the four carriers. And I think what you've got to do now is you have to realize that the things that come with being a T-Mobile customer, whether it's Music Freedom and free music streaming or BingeOn that now has a hundred providers participating. T-Mobile Tuesday, every Tuesday having value that's delivered contact-free international data roaming, including high-speed data in Europe for the summer, the things like we just did for our customers going to the Olympic Games. These are embedded in the basic pricing for T-Mobile, so it makes the comparison very, very important, that's why we spent so much time on this. Braxton, do you want to talk about the margin? J. Braxton Carter - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. Good morning, John, and really good questions. I'll put one final answer on your cost question on Un-carrier 11. Of all the Un-carrier moves, this was actually very, very ranked at the bottom of total cost investment, fully embedded in our actual results and fully embedded in the guidance that we put out. And you got to remember, there's a lot of innovation, and we're partnering with other companies to the benefit of other companies in what we're doing with Un-carrier 11. So it's actually quite affordable. On your margin question, I think you very accurately pointed out we're already at the top end of our EBITDA margin guidance that we have reiterated multiple times, which definitely tells you, as we continue to scale, the opportunity is to significantly grow our margins past the 36% range. And the other thing that we need to take into account is, remember, we had over 100% of the growth in postpaid voice phone in the second quarter, almost 200% in the first quarter. We're growing significantly, and that has significantly impacted our margins. We have a lot of momentum. We have a lot of growth ahead of us, but we're achieving this margin expansion, while being the fastest-growing and truly in certain categories, the only growing wireless carrier in America. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. I think I'm going to jump \u2013 John, are you done? John Christopher Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC : Yes, all set. Thank you. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. J. Braxton Carter - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, John. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Let's take the next question on the phone, and then I'm going to \u2013 if it's not this topic, I'm going to jump back because there's a tremendous amount questions, Roger and Walt and a number of others, about porting. And I'd be glad to hit that and make sure that we're setting the right tone on that. But let's take the question from \u2013 the next one from Simon. Operator : And we'll next hear from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks a lot. I think you said Neville was there. It'd be great to get an update on the network. In particular, talk about the CapEx trending through the year and how that relates to rolling out the 700 megahertz, getting Chicago deployed. And then I think, John, you touched on small cells and get \u2013 adding capacity to the network. It'd be great to get Neville's perspective on how you see the sort of economics of small cells and the ability to add capacity at an effective \u2013 cost-effective manner. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Neville? Neville R. Ray - Chief Technology Officer & Executive VP : Yes. Thanks, Simon. Thanks for the question. So, obviously, we're delighted with the progress that we're making on our LTE rollout. John touched on key stats there. The 311 million covered POPs with LTE is pretty remarkable when you look back at where we were a year or two years ago, so continued tremendous progress on that front. The low-band rollout is also well ahead of our schedule. Braxton referenced in his comments at the beginning of the call that, that count somewhat front-loaded our CapEx in the first half of the year. We're at over 200 million people now covered with our low-band spectrum. And it's very clear when you look at our customer results, record-breaking churn levels now, our lowest levels ever in the company's history, that the impact of that low-band spectrum is truly starting to take effect for the company. So great progress on many, many fronts on the LTE rollout. Couldn't be happier with the progress we're making. We have a lot more to run at as we go through the balance of this year. We have almost 270 million licensed POPs now with low-band, so another 70 million to go after or just under. We will take down a big chunk of that in 2016 in the second half of this year. There isn't a team that works faster and harder in this industry than the team I have here at T-Mobile in terms of deploying LTE networks. So there are many areas that will benefit from low-band through the end of this year. You referenced Chicago, which is a new spectrum addition for us. We're starting to work very hard on that. Obviously, the deal still has to go through final approvals, et cetera, with the FCC, should be no issues at all on that front. But Chicago is a fairly recent acquisition, so I would expect Chicago will be more of a 2017 turnout than much to see in 2016. But you can take it to the bank that we will have a much bigger number than 200 million covered POPs on low band by the end of this year. So coverage piece, tremendous progress. You referenced small cells and capacity. I think as we've talked many times before, we benefit from the strongest mid-band spectrum position in the industry. We have a tremendous macro network, which is delivering the fastest LTE across the U.S. today. That's a great proxy for the offered capacity that's available on the network. It's truly broad-based coverage. We are starting to densify our network, as you hear from many others, but we don't have to move at the same pace that they are. We are working small cell opportunities, which you specifically asked about, Simon. We have several thousand that we're working on. Not all of those will come up this year. But because of the strong spectrum position we have and the very dense macro network that we have and the types of spectrum that we're deploying, we don't have to rush headlong after the densification that you hear from some of our competition. We're re-farming our spectrum very rapidly. I often talk about having not just the fastest and fastest-growing LTE network in the U.S., but the most advanced. We have now over \u2013 almost, actually, 90% of our data traffic is on our LTE network, 58% of our voice traffic; 58%, nobody can match anything like that, of our voice traffic is now on LTE. Why is that important? It allows us to free up legacy technology-bound spectrum. Much of our competitive set is wrapped up in old legacy technology, so they can't free themselves up for several years to come. So more and more LTE from us, more re-farming, allows us to really strengthen that capacity position that we've done so well with over the last year or two years. So coverage, capacity, all coming together, lots more to talk about, we'll see other questions that come on the call. And obviously, we're in the midst of a very, very exciting auction, one that I think will forever change the competitive landscape in the U.S. to the benefit of T-Mobile. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Just a quick follow up; what's the 700 megahertz handset penetration at this point? Neville R. Ray - Chief Technology Officer & Executive VP : It's very strong, Simon. It's well more than half of the base. Pretty much everything we sell now is 700 megahertz banded. North of 70% of our customers have LTE-banded handsets. And the lion's share of those have band 12, so tremendous progress, not just rolling out the network, but getting the benefit of the network into our customers' hands. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And I think it should be evident that as news unfolds, we need time to be able to factor them into our future-looking results for the business. I really just want to say, it's too early for us to have figured out the impacts of our company on the fact that we now learn that $300 million of CapEx is sufficient for investing in a growing network or that you can drive at high speeds down the road with a truck and just throw poles out to densify your network. But we're also \u2013 interesting to learn that now in the future, you can just open your desk and push a button and increase the capacity. All of these things could have potential significant upside to our business, but we haven't had time to factor them in to our future-looking view. Let's go \u2013 let's take \u2013 in a lot of fashions, I saw Walt, I saw Roger, I think I saw (34:47), a number of people asking for details around porting. And I want to do that respectfully because I know that was an item of confusion this week. So I'm just going to give you some data, and then I'll just explain why I'm not here to call Sprint a liar. And Roger, I know you've already got the battle gear on it. And give me a second and let me go through this. But I'll go through the data the way I always have. This is the Magenta. This is the postpaid porting ratios which we previously announced for Q1 when the industry was 1.50. In Q2, that same number was 1.43, right? And that 1.43 broken out by the three carriers was, AT&T, 1.64; Verizon, 1.43; and Sprint, 1.15, okay? Now sticking with this data, I'll just tell you that Q3 quarter-to-date is 1.51, so it's back up to where Q1 was. And this current week, the most recent information is 1.77. So I'll tell you in that same vein, the three carriers this week were just short so far; AT&T is 2, Verizon is 2 and Sprint is 1.3. So that's the data, and I have that with complete net ports, percentage of net port, port-ins. And as I said, what's always been important that I've been signaling all along, I know you love the little back and forth with Sprint and us, but 50% of these adds come from AT&T and a greater position now come from Verizon. Now importantly, when you take \u2013 remember, we are the only ones who have two number pools. So we have two groups with MetroPCS and T-Mobile. So if you take Magenta postpaid and MetroPCS together, then Q1 was 1.73, Q2 was 1.66. Broken out by the three carriers, 1.91 for AT&T, 1.95 for Verizon and 1.37 \u2013 or call it, 1.4 with Sprint. And the latest week of that data is 1.92. Broken out, 2.2 for AT&T, 2.3 for Verizon and 1.51 for Sprint. So that's the business as we look at it. We look competitively far greater at that second piece of information, and the net adds that go with this clearly are why we captured all of the growth in the industry and a very healthy prepaid. Now, so you can stop your conspiracy theories, porting is not all of the adds, and I will just throw a bone here, Roger, and say, theoretically, there is a way that if you're Sprint and you're sitting there and you're looking at numbers, you're looking at Sprint postpaid customers going out to T-Mobile, and then you look at postpaid customers coming in from T-Mobile, which may or may not have been postpaid at T-Mobile, it could be postpaid T-Mobile plus some of what were the Magenta prepaid customers going to Sprint. And since Sprint was already in the overall data at 1.15, it is theoretically possible that when you're sitting in their spot that they see a balance coming into them as postpaid. So, I would just say, our data is consistent. We continue to drive growth against all three. But I'm just throwing a professorial theoretical bone that there is some possibility that the way they're looking at their data, that they could be in a good position. I would also reiterate, the mother lode from the duopoly seems to be what's driving both our gains and clearly theirs because we are netting customers from Sprint, as well as the other carriers. So if they gained 173,000 postpaid phones, they pretty much went to the bank and the duopoly as well. So I hope that answers those questions, and I'll take follow-ups as we go through. Okay. Anybody have a favorite on this plethora of screens or should we go to Phil? Okay, let's go to the next question on the phone. Operator : And our next question comes from Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC : So, with nothing better to do, let's go to Phil. Thank you. Thanks, John. I wonder \u2013 no, that's a win. I wonder, John, if you can talk about your competitors' vertical integration strategy. It seems like T and Verizon are doing more and more outside of just wireless. Is this increasingly necessary for you over the next few years? And what about the guys sitting in the cable footprint, do you think they need to do more in wireless as well? Thanks. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Well, let's bounce around with that, right? I think amongst the things that are important to note is Verizon has now spent over $10 billion in their fussing around. And there's a couple of pieces to this strategy and I think both of their strategies. Pretty clearly, they are trying to create new revenue streams and new businesses, and they're not successfully migrating their way from the bank of their business, which is their wireless business. The facet of buying content and having preferential access to content as a way to solidify a relationship with a group of customers, I just don't \u2013 I don't think that's the strategy. It's clearly not the strategy for us. What we try to do is we try to partner with innovative players that have established bases of customers who want to view their content and provide the capability through our various offers to allow those to coexist. And the benefit of that is as those players emerge and fall, so do our relationships and our ability to drive that. So I think at the surface level, it's an old school, and each of the endeavors that both AT&T and Verizon have tried in these areas have failed miserably. I mean, we're not looking back yet at all the money they spent. We're looking at the shiny new toy, which is Yahoo!, who's mysteriously gone from $128 billion worth of market value to $4 billion. But I'm sure with their polishing up strategy they can do something miraculous with that. Underneath this, though, is a pretty clear strategy by Verizon to compete with Facebook and Google in the advertising space. And that is a very risky, longer-term strategy against two of the very powerful self-endowed players. And for us, we will clearly not self-invest to go into those. But that's a broader game. That's a game of looking at your customers as a unit cost \u2013 a unit opportunity of advertising load, and that's very different from where the Un-carrier is. And segueing over, I think you mentioned the cable players. These \u2013 this is the battle that's going on. And I did listen to Comcast earnings today. I think you can anticipate nothing other from the heads of the cable players right now, except to put forth the belief that they're going to stick Wi-Fi nodes out at the same rate that Sprint is going to stick out poles and that everything is going to be beautiful and they're going to launch an MVNO with Verizon, while Verizon is ready to attack and fight back. That's all just to grow up and learn that you need a deeper ownership economics. And yes, I firmly believe that there will be a dramatic coming together of everybody that want to serve customers across multiple devices with content. And we will play aggressively in that space from our own point, but we are going to be very open-minded to who we play with our brand in the future. So I may have touched on a number of your points in there, but my opinion on those topics has been consistent, I think. Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC : If I can follow up. Neville, there's been the FCC approved the cable \u2013 or excuse me, the 5G spectrum bands. How does that make you think about the world in terms of densification and maybe working with cable? Neville R. Ray - Chief Technology Officer & Executive VP : Yes. I mean, obviously, we're \u2013 we applaud the FCC's efforts to move forward on 5G spectrum sources for the industry. It's key. And Chairman Wheeler and the team have done a great job of pushing forward here at a great pace and well ahead many other places in the world. So that's good to see. And clearly for us, I mean, one of the bands that they've \u2013 they're slating for 5G users is a spectrum band where we already own spectrum unlike most of our competitors who are begging, stealing or borrowing. We actually do own a chunk of \u2013 and a sizable chunk of 28 gigahertz. So, some good alignment pieces there. But to your question, Phil, I mean, I think for me, jury is still out on what's going to happen on the 5G story. We could talk about this for the next 30 minutes, but I'll avoid it. I'll try and do it in a couple. It's clear that Verizon has attempted to take a leadership position on 5G and got way out in front of their feet (44:45) if you go back six, nine months ago. It's very, very clear that we aren't going to be at the Super Bowl next year with 5G phones doing wonderful things that Lowell talked about a couple of quarters back. We are going to have to be patient for mobility solutions in the 5G space. And by patient, I mean, it's 19 and 20. I'm just back from European visits, and it's very clear talking to the folks we're really \u2013 with a heart at driving these technologies that we have to be patient. That doesn't mean there isn't a lot of work to do, and we're extremely engaged with our vendors. We have trials and testing and work all underway at T-Mobile. More news will come on that as we work through the balance of the year, and I'm excited. Don't get me wrong. I'm very excited about the 5G opportunity. What I'm not hugely excited about is the optimization of delivery of broadband to the home. And that's what Verizon has gone out and trumped us. This is 5G. You want to have the first 5G network. Really talking about optimizing the economics of last-mile delivery for home broadband. Not even a mobility story. So is that exciting, is that exciting for the cable guys? Bit of a threat to the cable guys to your question, I think, right? So the cable folks have to think about what's going to happen in that space pretty long and hard. For Verizon, and for Verizon's customers, am I hugely excited about watching Netflix on a link that's wireless compared to fixed, fiber compared to a 5G wireless service? Not really. I think my Netflix is going to look pretty much the same. That's not a hugely exciting 5G use case, especially if you have concerns about will the economic benefits be passed down to the customers on the end of it. So we are far more focused and excited about will happen in the 5G space with mobility. It's very, very clear from Verizon and everybody else that the base layer of technology over the next 10 years, 15 years is going to be 4G LTE and 5G will come in, it will offer better speeds, better latencies, a whole host of opportunities in mobility with virtual and/or bended reality, a whole host of things that we're starting to work on and explore. As I said, we'll have to be patient for those, but it's going to take some time and the networks will have to densify and the range and capability of the spectrum that's being targeted for 5G at this point in time is going to be very limited. The physics of ensuring a 28 gigahertz or a higher banded signal can actually match what you can do with 600 megahertz or 700 megahertz spectrum. Every engineer that's ever looked to wireless understands how big a challenge that will be. So there's a lot to come, Phil. Obviously, we're \u2013 back to your question, we're very positive, we won't be seeing (47:29) in terms of the 5G movement. We will push very hard to make sure that it comes into the mobility space as soon as possible and we'll be a leader in that, but a lot of work to happen. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay and I'm going to use this moment. One push button to say that \u2013 this is another part. I'm sorry if I'm cranky today, but this is part of these earnings call every quarter, where the [explicit language] (47:53) factor that goes around annoys me the day after. Neville Ray and his team have done things in the last three to four years, building this network that are going to be written about in the history of wireless. And it's expensive, and it's hard and it takes a long time and there's no trick-plays and we've invested considerably in this network. And the churn rate in the future of this company now that we've got this network growing 311 million POPs, the work that went into very quietly acquiring license for 269 million POPs of 700 megahertz and getting ourselves ready and funded to be eligible for this auction, that kind of stuff is extremely important. And the two things that annoy me are the flip answer about building network when your capital investment is purely backed into based upon how much cash you can really say that you've got to stay alive. And then secondly, it's pretty clear that we scare Verizon from a standpoint of what our network is doing. 5G was put out of the chute very, very quickly. As a brand they were trying to capture so that they could be the different network. And it was less than six months ago where their CEO sat on TV and spewed such pabulum about one year out consumer wireless applications and then they, together, and Fran Shammo have walked it week after week after week to where we have been, wherein previously we sounded boring with our views about standards in 2019 and 2020 and the spectrum that we have and the great work of the FCC is doing. But now that we are all caught up, we see it as an opportunity that makes sense, that we are equally or better positioned in than anybody. So congratulations at all you do, Neville. Neville R. Ray - Chief Technology Officer & Executive VP : Thanks very much guys. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I won't let those pick on you anymore. Okay. Next question on the phone. Operator : Next, we'll hear from Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks for taking the question. And I want to talk a bit about some of the network expansion or the distribution expansion that you're planning. How do you decide which markets makes sense to bring the T-Mobile brand into? I would imagine these are obviously markets where you've deployed 700 megahertz A-Block. Do you also deploy any mid-bands in order to make sure you have sufficient spectrum in that market or do you spend it afterwards? How do we think about SG&A levels as you prepared to build out and enter these markets? And then just your historical experience when you put up the T-Mobile sign in a place you haven't been before, how quickly can you ramp penetration? John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I'll let Mike cover these. But the footnote going in is the exciting possibility of how much extra expansion in our retail that we can have based upon the networks. So, we've already talked about the 30 million to 40 million extra people that we can reach with the 400 stores that we will deploy. And this is Magenta. We're not talking about Metro which is an entirely different reach story. And we're also \u2013 I'm going to ask Mike, when he gives his answer to it, double-click not just on the 30 million to 40 million new people we're going to get by 2017, but what we're doing to increase the penetration where we already are and what that kind of looks like in the opportunity spectrum. Mike? G. Michael Sievert - Chief Operating Officer : Yeah. Brett, it's kind of an interesting question when you think about all this expansion potential that we have. In the context of the fact that we, for 10 quarters in a row, have been leading the industry in postpaid phone growth while only competing in about two-thirds of the country and in about two-thirds of the segment. So, think about it this way. As John said, we've been \u2013 we have our full mix with distribution and full network in about 230 million POPs. And as we've been saying, we see an opportunity to add 30 million to 40 million to that by the middle of next year and we're well on track for that. Secondly, from a segment standpoint, we're underpenetrated both with prime consumer suburban families as well as with businesses, including large enterprises and small businesses. And these are areas where again we've been kicking everybody's ass on growth without normative penetrations in those segments. And so, those are big growth areas for us as well. We pick the markets pretty simply. I mean we're \u2013 as you know, we're rapidly rolling out network and we go into the places where our network is newly strong and where distribution needs to be there to take advantage of it. And as John was saying, that's not just new cities and greenfield areas, that's also dense of places where we have densified or extended out into the suburbs and in the hinterland. So, it could be areas where we've added infill, it could be areas out in the suburbs or it could be greenfield markets. So, that's a mix of those in our distribution expansion. About 400 stores this year, and we're on track for that. Above 1,000 MetroPCS stores, something we don't talk about as much as we should, because that's a big part of our expansion. As we finished this year, we're looking at more than 4,000 T-Mobile branded doors, 9,000 MetroPCS branded doors, a huge source of strength for us. In terms of the ramp time, it does take a little bit of time. So, when we come in, there's a buildup time both for our team to get productive and for the local market to really understand the T-Mobile value proposition. So, it doesn't all roll in right away. But what we see is a path towards our normal SoGA levels over a period of time. And we make the investment together with our distribution partners with that success in mind. Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thanks for that color. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And we're going to put one within a mile of your house, Brett, (53:32). Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: I need a new phone. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: All right. I'm with you. There's a new one coming out soon. Okay. Next question. Wait, we'll let's take. I don't want to do the same thing to Ric. Let's go to Ric, the next question on the phone, and then you guys pick from this plethora. I'm tempted to go to Walt Piecyk but he keeps spewing facts as opposed to questions. By the way, I just want to say this, Walt Piecyk is posting on social a fact that's fascinating. I hadn't seen it this way. Looking at the wireless capital investment in Q2 and look at the absolute numbers of Verizon, T-Mobile and Sprint, but then breaking it down per subscriber. And what it shows is that Verizon invested $25 per subscriber. T-Mobile invested $26 per subscriber. And Sprint invested $8 per subscriber, which I \u2013 again, as soon as we can figure out that trick, we're all on that. So, let's go to next question from Ric. Operator : And, Ric Prentiss, with Raymond James, your line has been opened. Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks. Morning, guys. J. Braxton Carter - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : Morning, Ric. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Morning, Ric. Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey. A question. You mentioned distribution partners. I want to circle back to Braxton, something you talked about where you're going to sell some of your customers to a current MVNO partner. Walk us through a little bit about what triggered this. Why are you selling them? What do you guys get? And I would expect there's some changes not just on churn but how revenue and EBITDA may be play out on as well. So, it seems like an interesting item that you're doing. J. Braxton Carter - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. Let's have Mike start with that and then I'll be happy to finish off. G. Michael Sievert - Chief Operating Officer : Yeah, Ric, as most people are aware for a long time now, for many years, our postpaid business has been comprised of our branded T-Mobile business as well as a co-brand called Walmart Family Mobile. And we have taken a decision to transact with one of our wholesale partners to have them takeover the sales and distribution of Walmart Family Mobile for a variety of reasons. To help us streamline our operation, and we think they're in a great position to be able to more effectively grow that business and we retain the network side of the value chain on that. It's a great transaction. It's not closed. And so, there's work still left to be done. But we felt like it was important enough we needed to go ahead and disclose it to you today since we've signed the agreement with that partner. And what it does, and one thing that it does with that disclosure is it causes us to show you how the underlying T-Mobile business, which is the vast majority of our postpaid business, all but 1.4 million of our subscribers, is performing. And what's interesting is this last quarter, had that been the postpaid business as it would be prospectively, our postpaid churn on the T-Mobile brand was 1.09% completely flat with AT&T consumer churn, just for a point of comparison. That really shows the amazing progress that this business has made with its brand, with its customer service, but most importantly with its network. Going forward, presuming that the business closes, as we expect, we would be reporting our postpaid business with only the T-Mobile brand that you would see comparisons going forward that build off of this quarter. Now, that 1.4 million subscribers is generally stable. It has not been a contributor to our growth in a long time. It's not declining substantially. It's a stable business that's been out there that's been contributing to our results and that we think we can get better financials out of going forward in the hands \u2013 with marketing and distribution point at least in the hands of one of our wholesale partners. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Anything else to add, Braxton? J. Braxton Carter - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. No, I think that was a great recap. And I think \u2013 the only thing I would add is that is our only co-branded partner that was embedded or currently embedded in our postpaid number. So, this is completely a one-off. From a EBITDA standpoint, it's fairly neutral, but certainly the ARPUs on Walmart Family and the underlying demographics are very differ from the rest of the T-Mobile base. And I think that one thing that's going to be exciting to seeing true T-Mobile branded postpaid results going forward. And it is best-in-class. Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. Yeah, we've been hearing that Walmart might reduce the number of people they were carrying in the store. So, probably it also locks you in that way you have a better shot at keeping the shelf space. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Let's jump around. I did want to note, I love the social interaction here. And I'm going to read the tweet from Aaron Pressman that says he's impressed that I'm reading Walt's tweet. I'm going to point out, Aaron, because I'm a fan of your writing as well. There is a Walt Piecyk question here coming here in Twitter that I am going to take. And it says, have you talked to Comcast about selling prepaid TV at MetroPCS stores? And what I'm going to tell you, Walt, is we have absolutely no interest in using our MetroPCS store in that fashion and I'm sure it's a roundabout way of \u2013 I guess the Boost stores had to do something. But, in general, again, my feelings about where the industry are going on a substantive basis stand. And, from a standpoint of dating or showing any leg, I'm not interested. And in my case, unlike Verizon, I would say the last two letters in MVNO are no. So, just, the answer \u2013 there were some people that wrote and said, it's interesting that the people talking about consolidation the most, and T-Mobile are the only ones that haven't been invited to the party. And if you think that's true, then I have some land to sell you. T-Mobile is an extremely powerful brand, and coveted highly. But opening up our stores to sell some unproven prepaid TV product, that's not integrated at all, is not part of what we plan to do with our brand or with our stores. But all the power to you over there if you got excess capacity. Okay. Let's go back to the phones. Operator : And our next question comes from Jonathan Chaplin with New Street Research. Jonathan Chaplin - New Street Research LLP (US): Thanks. Two quick ones for Braxton. So, Braxton, there's been quite a meaningful working capital drag in the first half of the year, it's \u2013 you said that the trends in the second half of the year would look a lot better, just want to sort of make sure we're still on track for what we were expecting previously. So, if I look at the midpoint of EBITDA and CapEx guidance and takeout where you are in interest expense, it looks like we're at about sort of $2 billion to $2.5 billion in free cash flow, but for whatever the drag is in working capital, should working capital be more or less neutral for the full year this year? And then my second question is, I know you don't really want to talk about this now, but as we sort of look ahead to 2017, you'll end the year below your leverage threshold. And it seems like we're getting into the zone where capital returns should come on to the table, I know that capital returns or decisions that have to be taken by the board. But is there any reason why you wouldn't keep this business level at three times or more, given the operating trends that you have? Thanks. J. Braxton Carter - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. Sure. Thanks, Jonathan. Great questions. Yeah, I think the whole free cash flow story is one the things that we actually get the most excited about here at T-Mobile when we look at future projections. And I think it's informative to look at the differences in the first half of this year versus the first half of the prior year. And even though we're showing very substantial growth in our free cash flow, that's in the context for the first six months of this year, that we've spent $500 million more in CapEx on a fairly flat CapEx budget from 2015 to 2016. So, it's a much more front-loaded in 2016 than it was in 2015. And we're doing that because the goodness of rapidly rolling out the 700 megahertz and it all it does for us from a lift, from an expansion, and from a retention standpoint is key. The second thing if you really teased the numbers out, when you look at the net payables for the first six months of 2016 versus the first six months of 2015, there was an incremental $300 million-plus reduction in payables over the prior year. And that's coming out of a strategy of really trying to optimize every part of the financial equation. And we're in a position where we have entered into new agreements with early pay discounts and trying to take full advantage of those early pay discounts. It falls right to the bottom line. And that's a really shift in strategy that we've had over the last year. Those two items alone are organically $800 million more in working capital generation in 2016 versus what we did in 2015. We're investing it in those types of initiatives. But I think what gets really exciting is, yeah, the thesis is fully intact. You look at the midpoints of the guidance, you look at the front ending of CapEx during the year, you're going to see some very nice working capital increases the balance of the year, and just wait for 2017. This story really with the leverage we're getting, with the scale we're getting, we're extremely excited about it. Your final question, we do have a capitalization policy that has been keeping our net leverage between three times and four times. And we do think that leverage is healthy to the equity component if it's reasonable and prudent. We're certainly going to be increasing the leverage based upon everything that we've announced on debt we've raised and the commitments we have from DT which again was better than anything we could've gotten in the open market. But the way that this model is performing and the way we're executing, we very rapidly delever. So, when you look a year out, what we'll have at our disposal is a decision to make on are there opportunities to invest in our business that will create a higher return versus returning capital to shareholders. And, ultimately, that's the right way to look at it from a fiduciary standpoint. And, we'll see what develops, we'll see what opportunities develop. I think we're very uniquely positioned to capitalize on several opportunities in the future. And, certainly, with the way this model is working and the way that we're executing on return of equity or cash to shareholders in the future, it will certainly happen. I would position it more as mid-term being two years to three years out before we'll probably be looking at that type of scenario. But, hey, let's see what develops. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Just double-click here as well because the work that Braxton has done in this company on so many fronts preparing us, for example, for where we sit in this historic auction, these are things that don't get covered on quarterly earnings calls. And I know early this morning, there was at least one or two analysts that were confused about our cash generation for the quarter. And so I think what Braxton just covered where in this type of environment that we're in he was even aggressively paying down payables. That's just a qualitative phenomenon when you hear the other earnings that have taken place to be prepared for an auction, making the down payments, generating cash, and bringing payables down qualitatively is something that Braxton has done an incredible job on and doesn't get enough focus on here. So, I'd hope that bridge with the payables also answers your questions that we're running around this morning. And, Braxton, great job by your team on all this. I also saw a couple of things go by. I'm going do a two-second commercial. There's been a number of comments and questions about how much of information is flowing here at Twitter. And I actually saw one joking comment as Jack call you to thank you for the Twitter flow. I wanted to be clear. I and we are big fans of Twitter. The product is extremely powerful in how we run our business. We're running our earnings calls on it. At the tip our fingers, how much information we have. I use Periscope extensively along with other social media. So, I just wanted to make sure that, from a business standpoint, this company and me personally, we're all in on Twitter. So, I know there's a lot of negativity or question not for us. We find it to be an extremely useful and growing platform for us and we continue to focus on it. So, that's my shout out to Jack. Okay. Let's go to the next question on the phone. Operator : Next, we'll hear from Mike McCormack with Jefferies. Mike L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC : Hey, guys, thanks. Braxton, maybe just a quick comment on ARPU. It seems like obviously Simple Choice penetration has gotten very high. Can we anticipate \u2013 as we progress to the back half of the year that we could see year-over-year growth in ARPU and what would be the drivers there? And then, secondly, I guess on the promos targeting families. Can you just dig a little bit deeper on what you're doing there and whether or not the 700 megahertz deployment is a big help there? J. Braxton Carter - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. Let me start with that and we'll have Mike address the family plan component. For the second quarter in a row, adjusted for Data Stash, you've seen sequential growth in our ARPUs. Again, adjusted for Data Stash, it was up 0.8%. If you look at the balance of the industry and you look at the trajectory of ARPU, it's another way that where I think we're really differentiating. The strength comes with data attach as well as penetration of insurance on higher end iconic devices. Those are two of the strengths that we have and data attach being the most significant. And that's even in the context of Binge On, but remember to really participate in Binge On, you have to be at least on a 3-gig plan. So, a lot of what we do is very well thought through from an Un-carrier standpoint that encourages placement of the consumer in the appropriate bucket for their usage. But as data usage has gone up, you're seeing that progression in data attach. And that's been the strength and the underlying driver of what's causing the two quarters in a row in the sequential improvement in ARPU. Offsetting that are family plan promos. And the interesting thing about family plan promos, you're doing discounts on your additional lines in the family unit. But when you look at the overall NPV, you're sacrificing some ARPU but you're creating more value for your company, it has a better retention, lower overall SAC costs, so it's a trade-off well worth making. And you can look at our per subscriber metrics, consistent quarter-over-quarter on the number of lines per account has been significantly increasing which is showing the results of this emphasis on family plans, and that absolutely will continue. And that's when we talk about ARPU as we talk about general stability, certainly there's underlying strength there. But the family penetration especially when you look at the AT&T and Verizon base where over 80% of their customers are family plan units, that's very, very important for us. Let me hand it over to Mike to... Mike L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC : Hey, Braxton, I'm sorry. Before you jump, just on the churn data point there, if it's normalized this quarter for 1.09% presuming next quarter there's some seasonality, but 1.09% should be the jumping off point as we look at the forecasting? J. Braxton Carter - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : Well, remember that this transaction will not close and it has not closed now, and it will not close towards the later part of the third quarter. And it's not a retroactive. It will be a prospective. So, no, you would not get the full benefit of that transaction when it closes in the third quarter. You'll see run rate in the fourth quarter. Mike L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC : Okay. G. Michael Sievert - Chief Operating Officer : And the other thing on churn is that \u2013 and by the way, we're just \u2013 we're so delighted with what's going on on churn. 1.27% is an all-time record driven by the health of our brand, the progress of our network and certainly seasonality. In this case, there was no iconic phone launch in the quarter, and that brought everybody's churn down a little bit. But year-over-year, it was about 5 bps. And if you just look in the past years, we don't guide on churn, but if you look in the past year's churn, it has been a lot higher in the second half than in the first half. And so you got to keep that in mind as you look at the full picture. But we're seeing nice year-over-year progress here, and that's the important point. As Braxton said on these family plans, 2.64 lines per account is an all-time record for T-Mobile. So, we've been after families now for about two years. We really launched in at the beginning of 2014, so 2.5 years of progress. And we continue to update and change the way we're bringing value propositions to families. Our latest promotion is one we're really excited about, which is being able to provide the entire family with a smartphone included with your plan at no extra charge and smartphones are getting affordable enough that we can do this in a very cost-effective way and we found a way to provide that. And obviously the market is very excited about it. So \u2013 and we will stay focused on this market. And as Braxton said, data attach is growing and family plans are hitting an all-time high. Those generally offset each other to provide ARPU stability of the kind we've been talking about and telling you to expect. Mike L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC : And, Mike, just as it relates to the 700 megahertz, does that sort of driving the message home on network quality? G. Michael Sievert - Chief Operating Officer : Absolutely. And because at the end of the day, what people care about is coverage. We are the fastest network in the country. We have been for well over two years. But what they really care about is coverage. We've more than doubled our coverage in the last year and 700 megahertz is mostly gets the credit for that. And as you know, I mean that's something that is just an epic achievement of the company, now having 269 million POPs of licenses for extended range LTE and we're rapidly rolling out against that. So, still some potential... John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And, Mike, this is still \u2013 for us, not just the retail expansion, but for us the challenge and the opportunity is the same. We have a relatively small share player and our network is wildly ahead of the ingrain perceptions for the outdated experiences of customers. So, it's a very much still a game where we've got to get people to update their experiences including you. I mean, that's \u2013 you're next on the list. Mike L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC : John, you know I'm already there. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. (1:14:41). Mike L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC : Thank you, guys. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay, Mike. Thanks. Let's go to the next question. I think it's Craig Moffett who'll be fun. I've been sitting here reading stories about Craig and his assessment of everything that's happened and who's buying us and who's not buying us. So, let's open the mic to Craig and maybe we'll ask him some questions. Operator : Next, we'll hear from Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson, your line is open. Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC : I'm game here. Go ahead and ask whatever you want. I was actually going to ask a network densification question if I could sort of take the bait on some of the things you've been talking about capital budgets across the sector. So, there's sort of two levels of network densification, I guess. There is network densification in the context of LTE that you and everybody else are sort of doing at a steady pace. But then there is a completely different order of magnitude of network densification for millimeter wave that others are talking about for fixed wireless broadband, you were pretty dismissive of that opportunity. But how do we think about that? Maybe for Neville first, how do we think about the kind of network densification that's going to be required for those kind of cell radii in 5G? And then maybe Braxton's perspective on the same question of how you would fund something like that. Neville R. Ray - Chief Technology Officer & Executive VP : Yeah. Let me run it, Craig. I mean I think the \u2013 if you look at densification today and what's being talked about, you have to come back to the spectrum that you own and the assets that you have. And unfortunately, for the Sprint folks, they are still trying to figure out how to deploy effectively 2.5 gig spectrum. It's a challenge of physics. It doesn't propagate that well. And so, they are having to adopt mass densification strategies. The rest of the competitive set, quite frankly, don't at this point in time. That's a big challenge for them. It's an even bigger challenge if you have no money to fund it. And so, they are in a tough spot. I give the network team credit. I mean they're working hard to solve the problem, but I think they're on Version 352 with their network plan to fix this thing. And it seems to be pretty damn stalled at this point in time, be that capital, be that permitting, be that vendor equipment or a combination of all of those things. So, when you hear Verizon and us and AT&T talk about densification, it's a much more measured story. And it's because of the spectrum assets that we have. Verizon and AT&T have to do more because, today, they have a bigger customer base than us, and they don't have the wealth of mid-band spectrum that we have following the combination with Metro. And so, we're in a very strong position with a very powerful macro network that allows us to look at densification where our customer loading or payload on the network is at its most intense. And so, that's just an offload strategy more than how do I deliver my core LTE product to my base strategy which Sprint is still struggling through. Now, when you come to 5G, I mean it's the current debate on steroids, right? 28-gig and with everything that will happen with massive MIMO and beam forming, sure the physics will help. But it's going to be very, very difficult to match 28-gig to even 2.5-gig spectrum performance. And so, the industry is working very hard on those things, but I think early 5G rollouts will be pretty much capacity-type offloads. You'll see them in small dense areas of network, maybe core areas in big cities. That's why you'll see this stuff happen in urban footprints to begin with. But it's going to be years, decades, maybe even never when you're going to see 28-gig deployed on a broad scale basis. The physics just don't work and the costs to make it work across that type of range. If Sprint can't make it work in 2.5-gig, how is the industry going to break the back of it in 28 gigahertz or 70 gigahertz? And so, I think your question about what does that all cost from a 5G vision perspective? Right now, this game, right, in the next three years to four years in this industry, it's all about what you do on LTE, and LTE Advanced. That's the game. And as I mentioned at the beginning of my comments, we're the most advanced LTE network in the U.S. We have delivered the functionality and capability on LTE features be it MIMO, carrier agg, whatever the situation or feature may be ahead of our competition. And we're moving very, very quickly to ensure that LTE capacity and coverage is delivered to meet the requirements of our customer base. That's the game in the next two years to three years. 5G will come on and the densification strategies will evolve as we resolve the physics on propagation. But it's going to take some time. It's going to take several years for the whole economics here to work through. Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC : Okay. That's really helpful. And, John, by the way, since what I said is a little different than what's been reported with what I said. All I said is I wish people would stop focusing so much on M&A and start focusing on how well you guys are actually doing. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And I read it that way as well. And so you know what we're talking about, there's a number of headlines. And I think what Craig said is, these guys were executing on the business and there's value and headlines were \u2013 M&A might will be off the table because there's so much momentum as opposed to we've had an incredible standalone strategy that's going extremely well. The world of consolidation is inevitable but it's not the path forward. I got it, Craig. I appreciate it very much. Okay. We got about eight or nine minutes but we got a pretty big queue here. So, let's click down some of these questions and let's try to be one quarter as voluminous as that great answer that Neville just gave on network. Operator? Operator : Next in queue, we have Michael Rollins with Citi. Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Two, if I could. First one is, I'm wondering if you could talk about the ongoing proceeding from the FTC on special access which they're now calling business data services. In terms of your exposure to that, how do you think it might play out and the impacts to your financials over time? And then secondly, could you just talk a little bit about device leasing and your latest thoughts on leasing devices to your customers versus the installment plans. Thanks. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good. Neville, can you do a quick shot at the first one and then perhaps to Mike. Neville R. Ray - Chief Technology Officer & Executive VP : So, special access to all business (1:21:29) data services as it's now called, we're supportive. I mean, Mike, for us \u2013 we were the first carrier. Sounds crazy, but to deliver five band \u2013 fiber to the cell. And we've resolved the economics on that core strategies long ago when we continue to scale and do that very, very economically for us. So, I'm hopeful that the new regulation will help us as we push into more rural and tough areas to fiber across the U.S. So, we're supportive, but we don't need it to resolve our economic \u2013 the economics of our backhaul. G. Michael Sievert - Chief Operating Officer : (1:22:09). Leasing versus EIP. As you know, we've been focused on EIP this quarter. We've said that's going to be generally the focus for the short-term. But we're really pleased that we've got two great products that our customers love. And so we like to maintain some elements of surprise here competitively. We focused on EIP, largely because we found our team is better at it, based on the state of the IT systems. And as Braxton's mentioned, we're making big investments right now in IT transformation, and our systems are more mature on the EIP side. Now, that makes the transaction times faster and that allows us to be more productive at retail. But that's not a static state. With each passing month, we're making big strides in IT, which may cause us to change the strategy or may cause us to do something completely new and unexpected. So, stay tuned to this space. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think just to your credit, Mike, you and Braxton, we did in leasing in Q2 exactly what we said we were going to do. And so, stay tuned. I think we're very pleased with the trend of what we're doing with EIP, but it's a weapon in our arsenal that we can pull. Okay. Operator, next question. Operator : Next, we'll hear from Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays. Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you very much. Just a network question for Neville. Recognizing a lot of the initiatives that you folks have put into place in order to enhance capacity and speed on the network side, one of the questions that we tend to get from investors is with the success of initiatives, such as Binge On and the growth in data usage across your network, is there a point in time where you would need to consider augmenting your spectrum portfolio in the mid-band range? I recognize that you're in the midst of a low-band spectrum auction at the current moment, but thinking about sort of the longer term pieces in order to further accelerate network improvement? Neville R. Ray - Chief Technology Officer & Executive VP : I mean, Amir, you never say never, but obviously we have a rich spectrum of portfolio today and our LTE is about just north of 60% of the spectrum assets that we own. So, we have a long way to go in terms of driving LTE into the balance of the spectrum assets. I'm excited about new capabilities like Unlicensed-LTE. That's something that we need to break the back of, not just for the industry, it's a great technology, it's a foundational story for 4G, we really need to make progress within the U.S. environment on technologies like that. The low-band stuff, obviously, that's great spectrum. We're in the middle of an auction, great spectrum. I mean, so there are a lot of options and opportunities to go and attack before you have to go whole scale at massive densification of your network with steel and concrete. Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: That's very helpful. And then just a quick follow up to some of the comments, Mike, that you had made on some of the new market opportunities and some of the greenfield builds. Any color you can give us in terms of the trajectory of your subscriber trends in some of those markets? I think one of the questions that we tend to receive from investors is how much longer can the momentum with subscriber trajectory, as it stands right now, go going forward given sort of where you've been in terms of share in metro markets versus some of these newer markets? G. Michael Sievert - Chief Operating Officer : Yeah, Amir, of course. So, there's a couple of things here. One is we have seen places where we have built out network and then followed it with distribution. And what we've seen is that we can achieve our normative SoGA, share of gross add, rates when we come into the market late like that. And one of the reasons \u2013 it's kind of obvious, I mean, we do most of our marketing nationally. And so there are places where \u2013 actually, there is some pent-up demand where people have been for years seeing commercials about T-Mobile and they can only get in that market, maybe in that small town or mid-size \u2013 maybe Verizon and a rural carrier. And now, there's exciting new choice, and so there is an opportunity for us to achieve our normative SoGA levels. It takes a little time. And so, when we tell you that we're going to achieve 30 million to 40 million more in POPs and distribution by the middle of the next year, you can't do straight line math, but the end point is normative SOGA levels. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you very much for the incredible color. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Operator, I think we have time for one or two more. Who's next in the queue? Operator : Next, we have Walter Piecyk with BTIG. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: He's everywhere. Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC : I am everywhere. Thanks, John, for increasing my Twitter followers and a couple of trolls along with it. Appreciate that. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Are you up to 10 now? Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC : Yes. Now, I'm verified. So, I'm all good. On the cash flow statement, there's obviously a very big payment which I don't think you close on $2 billion worth of spectrum this quarter. So, I'm assuming that that was an early upfront payment for the auction. Based on my math, that can buy you a pretty big chunk of spectrum. So, I know you can't really talk about the auction, but maybe Braxton can talk about past comments about the type of \u2013 the amount of money that you would spend and whether is this just kind of an indication that, look, if the numbers are really low and you can't pick up, that amount of spectrum that that down payment implies that you will. Or is there a possibility that some of the numbers that you've talked about in the past might actually go higher? J. Braxton Carter - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. Walt, again, you're very astute when it comes to looking at all aspects of our financials. But the one thing I would say is we really cannot comment anything related to the auction. But I can tell you that we fully stand behind all the public comments that we've made in the past. And I'll have to leave it at that. Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC : Okay. I think that does answer the question. If I can do a follow up then for Neville. In the past, you've talked about kind of partnering with fiber companies and putting and embracing small cells as long as you can put them along those lines as opposed to maybe making some of these extensions. I'm just curious where you are on your own small cell rollout, and have you seen any delays in being able to do that based on what some of the guys, like Crown Castle or maybe Mobility have been doing in the market? And have you seen any reaction by local municipalities pushing back on those types of rollouts? Or has it been pretty much at the same pace or your ability to rollout small cells as it's been in the past? Neville R. Ray - Chief Technology Officer & Executive VP : You seem to know more in the space than I do, Walt. So, maybe you could share what you know. But I think obviously our small cell strategy is moving. I reference earlier, we're not in the massive rush that you will see from big yellow at this point in time. But we have thousands of opportunities we're pursuing this year. And a big chunk of them, we hope, to come online and that's for capacity needs in 2017, 2018 and beyond. I think to the heart of your question, we've been very carefully making sure we have the right economics and right deployment models for small cells. And back to John's earlier comment, if you just kind of run crazy around the country, trying to drop poles in every right of way that you can find, there is going to be some community pushback and backlash. And I think there are some signs of that. I think that's clearly driving some delays for some of the competitive set, but not for us. I mean we've been very thoughtful about how we've engineered these solutions. The partners that we've selected and we're fully on track with what we're doing. But I'm not trying to do something at the massive scale that some of the other folks are. And we're having more success than they are, I think, at this point in time. Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC : Okay. Can I just have one follow-on, which is where do you \u2013 how many. Yeah. Just one more, John. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: You and Neville going to have your bromance after the call. Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC : Can I just have one more. Just five years from now, how many small cells will you have in the ground? 10,000? 50,000? Neville R. Ray - Chief Technology Officer & Executive VP : That's tough to predict, Walt. At least... John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Walt, do a Twitter poll and let's see what comes up. Neville R. Ray - Chief Technology Officer & Executive VP : Let's do one. Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC : Okay. Neville R. Ray - Chief Technology Officer & Executive VP : At least 10,000. Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC : Sounds good. All right, great. Thank you. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Let's make a note to allocate up to 15 minutes for Walt's multiple questions. We're going to take one last question, operator, and then we'll going to wrap up. Operator : Our final question comes from James Ratcliffe with Buckingham Research. James M. Ratcliffe - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Morning. Thanks for taking the question. I'm just looking at the strength on prepaid on the gross add side, do you have any read on where \u2013 I know you know where the customers are porting from, but what sorts of services they're coming from or are these people moving from postpaid offerings or are these people moving from postpaid feature phones to prepaid smartphones? I know you don't get that specific data, but any color on that would be helpful. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Mike, why don't you take that, and including launching into the fact that we're now selling the iPhone in Metro. G. Michael Sievert - Chief Operating Officer : Yeah. Everything we can tell, Metro is not only the biggest prepaid business, the fastest-growing prepaid business, but the most effective at taking postpaid subscribers from competitors. It competes very well in a group we measure carefully which is people who port their numbers, who've had their phone number for at least a couple of years, who have a proven ability to pay, MetroPCS is highly effective at winning those kinds of customers. And that's why, as John said, we have an all-time high prepaid ARPU this quarter. And so, it's really important to start to dig in to the fundamentals of this prepaid business because it's a fantastic business. As John said, we now carry the iPhone at our MetroPCS stores. We're adding 1,000 stores this year to roughly 9,000 stores nationwide. We're covering 200 million POPs with MetroPCS in 65 markets in 100 cities. So, this is a powerhouse, the biggest, the fastest-growing and the most effective at competing for postpaid style customers. James M. Ratcliffe - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Braxton? J. Braxton Carter - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. Thank you, everyone, for tuning in. We very much look forward to speaking to you again on next quarter and thanks for your participation. John J. Legere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And tune in to Power Lunch on CNBC and Bloomberg and you can watch Braxton Carter telling more of the story. All right, thanks, everybody. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the T-Mobile U.S. second quarter 2016 conference call. If you have any further questions, you may contact the Investor Relations or Media departments. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect and have a pleasant day.",

(Broker) Operator : Good morning. Welcome to the T-Mobile US Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. Following opener months, the earnings call will be open for questions via the conference line, Twitter, Facebook or text message. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Nils Paellmann, Head of Investor Relations for T-Mobile U.S. Please go ahead, sir. Nils Paellmann - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Yeah, good morning, and welcome to T-Mobile Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. With me today are John Legere, our President and CEO; and Braxton Carter, our CFO; and other members of senior leadership team. Let me briefly read the disclaimer. During this call, we will make projections and statements about the future performance of the company, which are based on current expectations and assumptions. Our Form 10-K includes risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP results we discuss on this call can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website. With that, let me turn it over to John. John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Okay. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us directly from the last call that you were on for the last hour and a half. I want to welcome everybody to T-Mobile's third quarter 2016 Un-carrier earnings call and open Twitter conference. We're live in Bellevue, Washington. Now, I like answering questions way more than reading numbers off of a page so after a few comments, we're going to spend up to 90 minutes taking as many questions as possible from Twitter, Facebook and the phone. And as always, we are live streaming on YouTube so you can watch all the behind-the-scenes action including Braxton and his famous, now infamous magenta cowboy hat. Now okay. Let's talk about Q3. And let me tell it to you. We delivered the best results in the industry again and we beat the competition in key metrics such as net postpaid phone customer additions, prepaid additions, service revenue percentage growth and adjusted EBITDA percentage growth, just to name a few. And I'm going to share those Q3 highlights in a second. But first, I've got just a couple of things on my mind. I just had my fourth anniversary at T-Mobile, so I stepped back and I really looked at where we are and what we've accomplished. When we started, we set crazy high goals for this business. Much to our competitors' surprise and our shareholders' delight, the way we've delivered has been exceptional. Step by step, we're forcing the industry to change and T-Mobile is making wireless better for all consumers. We've more than doubled our customer base and we're translating that amazing customer growth into financial growth and shareholder value. Sure, you've heard some good spinning from our competitors last week, and I think you're going to hear some more tomorrow. But I've got to be honest. I love the industry dynamics right now. Any gains by the number four are not coming at our expense, period. And anything that weakens number one or number two, or loses their focus is great for us. Now meanwhile, we are not the player in this game making questionable economic choices or under investing in the network. You may be easily able to guess who that is. We're comfortable with the competitive climate and we're definitely comfortable taking share from the big guys. Here's the thing. The carriers suddenly to think this is a \u2013 they suddenly think this is a competitive environment. Well, guess what? We are the competitive environment. Competitive quarters, by the way, like the last 14 quarters, are when we grow and deliver financial results. We know how to navigate it because three years ago when we began this change in the environment with the launch of the Un-carrier and we are not even close to done yet. What might feel competitively painful to the carriers is just them being forced to adapt to our moves in their struggle. For T-Mobile, it's just another quarter and again, we delivered big. So the current dynamic works hugely in T-Mobile's favor. We can do this all day every quarter. In fact, that seems exactly to be what we're doing. Okay. So you all have the fact book and the Q3 financials speak for themselves but I want to highlight just a few. Now, in a little bit of a reverse order this time, we're delivering rock solid financial results and we actually remain the only growth company in our space. Year-over-year, we delivered 18% total revenue growth, 13% service revenue growth and 38% adjusted EBITDA growth. No doubt our customer growth numbers will lead the category again with 2 million net adds in Q3, the 14th consecutive quarter with over 1 million net adds. By the way, averaging 1.9 million net adds per quarter, that brings us to 69.4 million customers. We added 851,000 postpaid phone customers. That's 11 quarters in a row we've led the entire industry in postpaid phone net. And looking back over 14 quarters, you know that we took 100% of the growth, adding over 12 million new customers while the net total of the other three is less than zero, if you're wondering why they are interested in new business. We win customers, and they stay with T-Mobile. Branded postpaid phone churn in Q3 was down 14 basis point year-over-year to 1.32%, continuing the positive trend from prior quarters. Churn this quarter was the best ever for a third quarter. Now, prepaid. It's a huge driver of our business where we have the number one prepaid brand with MetroPCS. We added 684,000 new customers. That's more than double our closest competitor. The past three years, we've added 4.6 million prepaid customers. That's over 97% of the industry. And by the way, it bears mentioning and reminding these are high-value customers with ARPUs at record levels above $38 and churn dropping 27 basis points year-over-year. So a prepaid customer addition simultaneous with a postpaid is very key to the revenue growth in this industry. So here's what makes us different from others. We're winning big in both postpaid and prepaid, which is translating service revenue. If you look closely at the others, it's pretty clear that it's hard for them to create sustainable service revenue growth without winning in both. And of course, you have to couple this with stable and improving ARPU and ABPU, which we are. And I'll have more to say about that when we get to Q&A. Bottom line, T-Mobile continues to take all. That's 100% of the phone growth. It has dominated the industry over the last 14 quarters. Now let's just touch slightly on porting ratios. We've now had 11 quarters in a row where T-Mobile has been positive against every major carrier, and in fact our postpaid porting ratios improved against every carrier further in Q3. I have to mention network. Our 4G LTE coverage is now at 312 million POPs, so we match Verizon, reaching 99.7% of the customers that they do. And don't forget, our network is still the fastest in America. We've been the fastest in both download and upload for 11 quarters in a row. By the way, our upload speeds are becoming increasingly important with the rise of social sharing, and our upload speeds are almost 50% faster than Verizon, who happens to be our closest competitor. Our deployment of Extended Range LTE on the 700 MHz A-Block spectrum band is way ahead of schedule, 366 markets are live covering more than 225 million people. Our A-Block spectrum portfolio includes pending transactions that now cover 272 million people, or over 84% of U.S. population. We also launched Un-carrier 12 in Q3, proven very successful already. Approximately 80% of new postpaid phone accounts are activating on T-Mobile ONE, which is well ahead of our expectations. T-Mobile ONE is all about simplicity, which drives cost reduction and margin expansion in our business. And of course, we're not yet done. There's still a ton to fix in the industry. And a quick note. In fact, we'll announce the next Un-carrier move before the next time we get together for our earnings. Our brand is stronger than ever. We're the only pure play wireless company with sustained momentum. Flat out, we're the only company in wireless consistently winning. The only company taking all, more than 100% of the phone growth over the past 14 quarters, including all, more than 100% of the postpaid phone growth at 16.6 million total phones, and 12.1 million postpaid customers added to T-Mobile and none for the others. The only company growing both sides of the business, postpaid and prepaid for 13 quarters. The only one with any service revenue growth this year over year, actually double-digit service revenue growth. And the only company with the fastest 4G LTE speeds in the country for over 11 quarters. So, on the heels of these great results, we're raising our customer outlook and increasing and narrowing the adjusted EBITDA, our target range for 2016. Let me hand it over to our CFO, Braxton Carter, for more financial highlights, and to share updates to our full year 2016 guidance. Braxton? J. Braxton Carter - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Hey. Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I'm so excited to give a quick snapshot of our very strong financial results and an update on our 2016 guidance. Let's start with the financial results for the third quarter. Our customer growth is translating into strong financial growth as we once again deliver industry-leading metrics. Service revenues grew by 13% and adjusted EBITDA came in at $2.6 billion in the third quarter, up 38% year-over-year. This includes a spectrum gain of approximately $200 million. Including the spectrum gain, adjusted EBITDA grew by 27% year-over-year while the margin expanded to 34%, up from 30% a year ago. EBITDA benefited from strong cost discipline, with cost of service now equivalent to 20% of service revenues, down approximately 180 basis point year-over-year, and SG&A expenses stay down approximately 100 basis points year-over-year as a percentage of service revenue. Adjusted free cash flow grew by 28% year-over-year to $624 million. Net cash from operating activities increased by 14%. The increase in net cash from operating activities was partially offset by higher cash CapEx, which increased by 3% year-over-year. As said before, cash CapEx was much more front-ended this year due to our aggressive 700 MHz A-Block rollout. This is just a timing issue which will normalize in the remainder of the year. We continue to expect a significant improvement in free cash flow this year compared to 2015. Earnings per share came in at $0.42 per share in the third quarter compared to $0.15 in the third quarter of 2015. Note that this includes the after-tax gain from our spectrum transaction of $0.15 per share. Branded postpaid ARPU was another key highlight of the quarter. It grew 2.2% sequentially. Excluding Data Stash, the sequential growth rate amounted to 1.6%. This has been driven by the very strong popularity of our new T-Mobile ONE service plans introduced recently. In terms of customer quality, we continue to see continued improvements in the quarter. Total bad debt expense and losses from the sales of receivables were $177 million or 1.91% of total revenues, a slight seasonal increase from Q2, as expected. Importantly, this is down year-over-year both in absolute dollars and in percent of service revenue. In fact, the percentage improved by 61 basis points from 2.52% in the third quarter of 2015. EIP receivables classified as Prime adjusted for securitization was 53% at the end of the third quarter, in line with the prior quarter. Let me now come to the update of our 2016 guidance. In light of the continued strong customer momentum, we are taking up our target for branded postpaid net customer additions to 3.7 million to 3.9 million, up from the prior target of 3.4 million to 3.8 million. For adjusted EBITDA our new target range is $10.2 billion to $10.4 billion, increasing and narrowing the prior target range of $9.8 billion to $10.1 billion. This target range includes the spectrum gains of approximately $800 million in the first quarter and third quarter of which $200 million was in the third quarter. Our EBITDA target also includes the aggregate net impact from leasing and Data Stash of $1 billion to $1.1 billion. Again, increasing and narrowing the prior range of $800 million to $1 billion. For Data Stash, we now expect $250 million to $300 million compared to the prior expectation of $300 million to $350 million due to the impact of T-Mobile ONE. Finally, we target cash FX of $4.5 billion to $4.7 billion in 2016, narrowing the prior range of $4.5 billion to $4.8 billion. In summary, we've delivered very strong financial results in the third quarter and expect continued strong growth in 2016. We won't stop. Now let's get to your questions. You can ask questions via phone, text message or via Twitter or Facebook. We'll start with a question on the phone. Operator? First question, please. Operator : Simon Flannery, Morgan Stanley. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you. John, you touched briefly on porting numbers. I wonder if you could give us an update in anything for October? And then, Braxton, can you just talk a little bit about the operating margin leverage model as we go into 2017? You are past the synergies now. How should we think about if you still have a double-digit top line, what's the incremental drop down to the EBITDA line? Thanks. John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: So, as I said, overall porting ratios in Q3 were about 1.55, up from 1.43 area for the industry. And they were up in Q3, improved versus every carrier. And they're pretty much flat on the industry into Q4 in October, except we have seen an improvement specifically against Sprint. So we've moved up more towards 1.3 with Sprint. One of the things that we track very closely especially with Sprint porting of MetroPCS and T-Mobile and together the MetroPCS, which was 1.92 for the whole industry in Q3 has moved up to about 2.11 with Sprint. So, we're off to \u2013 pretty stable with the other guys and further improvement versus Sprint. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. J. Braxton Carter - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Okay. on your second question. The thesis here has always been to have a significant growth plan translating into significant increases in the top line profit down to true sustainable free cash and we are certainly proving that active vision (17:57). We'll give full 2017 guidance on our yearend earnings call, but suffice it to say we do still expect to grow our top line double-digit going into the next year. We have incredible momentum behind us, we have incredible growth momentum behind us, and then the conversion of that the EBITDA and the truly levered free cash flow gets very exciting when we look at the future. But we'll provide a full update for 2017 on our year-end call. But suffice it to say you can certainly expect on continued strong financial performance and margin expansion as we go into 2017. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks, Braxton. Operator : John Hodulik, UBS. John Christopher Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC : Good. Thanks. John, you mentioned that we were all on another call before this. Could you talk a little bit about how you think that the wireless industry changed, if at all, by this AT&T, Time Warner transaction? Did it change the need for wireless companies to get into content or cable companies to get into wireless? Just your view on the industry would be helpful. Thanks. John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: I mean, it's clearly a very exciting, and I spent most of the weekend looking at it, as you have. It's a bold move and certainly a long road to go before it's completed. But a couple of things. They also announced their earnings for Q3, and if you look and you compare and contrast their earnings and what's happening, for example, with ours, you'll understand why they are trying to do a vertical integration, which is in effect investing in new businesses and revenue streams as opposed to something with synergies. What yelled loudly in their results was, when you normalize, they lost 354,000 postpaid customers at a time when we're certainly adding many, many. I would point out a couple of things on that, by the way. You did notice as well that U-verse was way down, DIRECTV was barely growing. So, they're migrating with significant amounts of capital to try to grow revenue streams. An interesting factoid for you, which is when they announced in Q2 of 2014 the DIRECTV acquisition, they have not added a postpaid phone customer ever since. So one of the things pertinent to T-Mobile is, I would say, the great news is that they're going to be further defocused than they are now, and the upside opportunity to continue to acquire businesses in this space for us is tremendous. Second thing is that there is a piece of an industry of the future that they are attempting to define. And I think Randall's short version of something I've been saying for quite a while, he used something along the lines that mobile is going video and video is going mobile, which is kind of \u2013 I might have gotten it backwards. What we've been saying all along is all content is going to the Internet, and all Internet is going mobile. And the future of getting the now 70 million and growing people who have mobile devices with T-Mobile complete ubiquitous access to all the content they want in an easy and convenient way, we have many paths forward to that. Binge On and T-Mobile ONE are at start, could potentially over time, even with ourselves becoming an aggregator of aggregators, an aggregator of content and indexing of what's there. AT&T may end up being a provider to us of content, as opposed to anybody thinking that there is any possibility that they will exclusively use that content. I think that will be sorted out in Washington. I also would promote to Washington that they should significantly consider making AT&T divest Batman. I think there's no way that AT&T should own Batman. And then lastly, I've been a big proponent again, customers are going to drive everybody's desire to have ubiquitous access on all devices, including the phone, which I think is going to cause all sorts of consolidation between cable providers, broadband providers, wireless providers and content. And I would have to suggest that they certainly are not calls going on inside Charter and Comcast right now where the theme is, hey, how's everybody feeling about that MVNO strategy right now. So, yeah, it's going to cause some acceleration. It's a very fast move. It's very good for T-Mobile in the short and medium term, and it highlights the key opportunities we have as a company in the medium to long term. John Christopher Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thanks, John. Operator : Craig Moffett, MoffettNathanson. Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC : Hi. Thanks. John, I wonder if I could stay with that theme for a second and ask two longer-term strategic questions maybe from the other direction. As you think about network densification and what's going to come in the next five years of your wireless network, what do you think you need in terms of a wired network to support it? And then a related question is \u2013 and I apologize, I didn't hear if Neville was there in the room or not \u2013 but if you could talk about your spectrum position and how comfortable you feel now that you've been doing unlimited for a while with your capacity and your ability to handle the kind of demand that you're seeing on the network not just in the next year or so but a bit longer term? John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Yeah. And Neville is here, and for those of you who don't have a video, he is sitting in his underwear because a couple of years ago, he promised that if the stock ever approached or pass $50 even for a moment, he would join us in his underwear, which he did shortly today. Yeah, you can tune in. I think I'm going to start that, and then I'm going to move to Neville. And I think there's a couple of things. An entry point of what I'd like to say is, as you know, the investments required to create the kind of infrastructure which we have with 312 million POPs now deploying so far 225 million POPs on 700 MHz, and then to prepare for a world of 5G and also participate aggressively in the spectrum auction, this is a significant amount of money, time and focus which also raises an interesting point to me, with the Mexican entry and the DIRECTV acquisition and now Time Warner, how does this position AT&T to make the investment that it's going to require to continue to have competitive carriage and network associated with us. From a standpoint of what we need for a wired network or what the densification plans are, why don't I just have Neville to give an update on the network as well as some of how we think about that (24:38). Neville R. Ray - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Yeah, thanks, John. I promise not to stand up during this televised conference. Hold your breath for later. Craig, I'll try and answer both questions in one really. Let's start with the fact that we have a T-Mobile, the most dense wireless network in the U.S. today, hands down. The combination of Metro seems a long time ago, but it put us in a very enviable position and the other three players have been desperately trying to build out the density and capability that we have on our network. An extremely strong mid-band spectrum position, great, great, growth on low band spectrum with the 700 MHz A-Block. Now as John referenced on the call, 225 million covered POPs. That's another 25 million Americans we've covered this quarter on low band. So we're in a very, very strong position that continue to support great growth on this network. Your question talks and thinks about longer term and what happens. So I look at the major steps that we're making. The first thing is you've got to make sure you maximize every ounce of goodness that you can from the spectrum that you want. And clearly, we're leader in the U.S. I often talk about us having the most advanced LTE network and we clearly do. The first to do so many network enhancements and bring new features, most recently 4x4 MIMO, 256 QAM on the downlink, 64 QAM on the uplink, on the back of VoLTE, ViLTE, RCS, EVS. What's that all about? It's all about making sure you make the most and best use of the spectrum assets we have. The VoLTE for us in the near future as we look to \u2013 start to move away from legacy technologies and re-farming at a furious rate. We have 61% of our calls on the network now on VoLTE. That based on all the information I have is a global leading VoLTE penetration. So we have approaching the fastest, most efficient LTE network on a global basis. So tremendous progress on that front. As we look to more spectrum assets, first, we announced just recently, AWS-3, we've started to light up AWS-3 spectrum. I look into 2017 and the fact that we will start to use, through LTE-U and LAA, we will start to use and leverage unlicensed spectrum. More building blocks coming with 3.5 GHz spectrum. And then ultimately you look towards a 5G world where we'll start to move into millimeter wave spectrum. As we've often said, that's kind of a 2020 timeframe in the mobile environment. The huge loss of spectrum coming down the pike in the outer years as we look to move into the next decade. So, ton of efficiency, ton of capability on a very dense network. We continue to densify our network as well, adding both sector splits in the cell sites, as well as our first batch of small cells, we have several thousand going into the ground this year, and that work will continue on. And I think your question about how do you deal with that densification, clearly you look to maximize the spectrum assets that you have. You look to find very, very efficient modes for the backhaul. We have a tremendous history on driving fiber to our cell sites and we have the same strategy on our small cell, so that not only can we support the great 4G and LTE experience but a great 5G one, when it comes down to that. So we're in a very strong position. The team is executing better than any team in the industry today. We deliver the fastest network, and that's a great proxy for speed and capacity. And we've highlighted in the investor material today that's not just on the downlink but on the uplink. So read those stats and see how fast we are on the uplink. It's tremendous. A lot happening, a lot in the question, a lot in my answer, but very good position. John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Should we try to take a question on one of these feeds? Mike, you want to pick one? G. Michael Sievert - T-Mobile US, Inc.: They're kind of still flowing in, aren't they? John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Let's take the next one on the phone, and then let's pick one on the feed to keep it moving. Operator : Hello. Philip Cusick, JPMorgan. Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, guys. Thanks. John, you mentioned sustain growth in ARPU. Maybe Braxton, can you explain that? What's going on in postpaid on an apples-to-apples basis, correcting for all the Data Stash ins and outs? How is T-Mobile ONE uptake doing that? And then also, Neville, quickly on an iPhone backlog update, and what are you seeing from the Samsung recall so far? Thanks, guys. J. Braxton Carter - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Yeah, Phil, I think again it's one of the highlights of this quarter. We definitely did disclosures normalizing for the Data Stash impact. And ARPU minus the impact of Data Stash was up a very strong 1.6%. And I think that's very, very significant but the driver there is T-Mobile ONE. Over 80% of our flow coming in is on this new unlimited paradigm which was enabled by our foundational work on Binge On. And this is underlying strength that quite frankly is a bit better than what the original business case has shown. Certainly we're a competitive environment. I'm not saying that we're going to see sustained substantial increases in ARPU, but this is a very, very good sign and we're very pleased with it. John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: And I think there's so much in that topic before we go over to Neville. We're just going to double-click for one second because in our industry in the past few years, people have done portions of these things well. Certainly there's been times where AT&T and Verizon have tried very hard to keep their ARPUs high and then had eroding customer bases but drove it for margin. You have situations now where giving prices of 50% off, Sprint is eking out some gains on the postpaid side but clearly not anything that will drive revenue growth, or both at the same time. So I would just say when you do, we have raised ARPU to $48.15 and ABPU of $63.38 and it's very important for people to remember that the ARPU on a postpaid add now is over $38 a customer. So too often we hear companies in their math add a connected car or add a wholesale net. But when you have 851,000 postpaid and 684,000 prepaid, both phone customers at high ARPUs and your ARPUs are going up. That is really with low churn, and I would just ask you to do the math. Before we get too excited about Sprint, if Sprint does 347,000 postpaid nets at 50% off prices but then loses 427,000 prepaid customers at the same time, that will not equate to profitability or revenue growth. So very good item to deep dive on. Neville? J. Braxton Carter - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Well, let me handle the recall situation real quickly and then we'll give it to Neville. A very, very unfortunate situation. This recalled handset was probably one of the best, most popular handsets that we've launched in some time. And they were absolutely flying off the shelf. It's such a shame that we've seen those types of issues. But what we had to do because of the recall is 100% reversal of all revenue and all cost of sales associated with it. And then impairing the handsets down to its fair market value. But I got to tell you, the OEMs stepped up, did absolutely the right thing for reimbursement, but it was hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue, and I believe that we were leading the country in sales of it. And had that not have happened, all that would've been, again, reflected in our results. But we'll move on, it's a great company, a great brand, and there's definitely a huge future. J. Braxton Carter - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Is that \u2013 Mike, do you want to just comment on T-Mobile ONE? G. Michael Sievert - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Yeah, absolutely. It's going fantastically well. As John mentioned, it's about 80% of our sales to new customers right now, which is better than what we were expecting. But more importantly, our existing base is rapidly moving to it and adopting it as well. And as Braxton said, what's happening, is we're seeing a benefit relative to what our expectations were on ARPU. But as Neville said, what we're not seeing is any negative impact on the network. Because remember, Binge On and the foundation of Binge On from over a year ago gave most of our customers functionally unlimited service in the first place in the form of setting their video free which is by far the most consumptive thing on the network. So after the launch of T-Mobile ONE which has been accretive so far to ARPU and we expect in the long haul to be neutral to accretive, the network is actually faster, performing faster than it was before. So it's a win-win on all sides. And with that, do you want to take one or two from the... J. Braxton Carter - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Pick one. G. Michael Sievert - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Yeah. So, Jan Dawson, @jandawson says can you tell us a little bit, you have to scroll up, you made it disappear. Could you talk us through what the post Walmart postpaid metrics look like going forward ARPU, churn et cetera? For those of you not tracking along, remember we announced an MVNO deal that was effective September 1. And what it did was move some of our postpaid customers under our brand called Walmart Family Mobile, less than 1.4 million of them, over to an MVNO. And moves them out of our postpaid base where they could be better managed as an MVNO. Over the long haul, we expect this to have a modest but slightly positive impact to both churn and to postpaid ARPU going forward, because Walmart Family Mobile inside of our base, while small, had higher churn and lower ARPU than the rest of our base. @telnetport (35:35) says why not let OEMs do device financing so they can sell devices more directly instead of T-Mobile doing the financing? That's a fascinating idea. We think it's really great. It does remind me to point out one thing, that was sort of buried in our numbers today, but you should really take note, which is device financing, which we've been providing now for years is no longer a cash consumer in our working capital. And we've been saying for many years that this would be normalized at some point. And we've had a couple of quarters now of general stability where the incoming flows of people paying for their financing is generally matched by the outflowing flows of us writing new financings for new customers. And that's really terrific. John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Okay. You have a great idea on that one, by the way. As Braxton talked about, what happened with the Galaxy Note 7, and by the way, they'll be back and they'll be stronger than ever. I have no doubt about it. But it kind of raised the awareness of people of a lot of other devices that are going around. There's been a lot of interest in the LGB-20. There has been a lot of talk about the Google Pixel. And I just want to make it clear, there's been a lot of confusion, especially driven by some of the commercials, that you can only have that device on Verizon. Google is smarter than that. They did an exclusive distribution, but it's unlocked, you can buy it from Google and you can bring it to the T-Mobile network and it actually works beautiful, if not better. So, I mean to your question, I think it would be fabulous if Google did device financing and then people could run over and buy it there, bring it over. I might even try to bridge that gap for you. But there's a lot of great devices right now, it's kind of an exciting time. And I think a lot of people's eyes have been opened to various alternatives. Let's go back to the phone for one more. Operator : Brett Feldman, Goldman Sachs. Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks for taking my question. A couple of cash flow questions for Braxton. You guys have moved kind of back towards EIP from leasing, but you do have a number of leased devices in the base and a lot of them are going to be coming off lease next year, and I do think that there's some residual value in those devices. I was hoping you can just give us some color on how to think about that in our cash flow modeling. And then just at a higher level, after this auction whatever the outcome, how do you think about your capital allocation priorities from there? Is it mostly going to be focused on de-levering, or there are other areas that you'd be looking to invest in the business? J. Braxton Carter - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Yeah, so a really good question on the residual value. And obviously we do a tremendous amount of work on accounting for an estimate in the future residual value. But the thing to keep in mind, even with third-party market sale, residual value, valuations, which is of course the standard that you have to utilize in looking at this issue from an accounting standpoint, the highest value realization is organically within our own business. And it's really an opportunity cost avoidance. What we do is we take these handsets back into our ecosystem. We refurbish them like new and then we utilized those in our insurance claim fulfillment and warranty exchange program. And the opportunity there, Brett, is you're not breaking a brand-new box of A stock, a brand-new phone, on to utilize fulfilling those customer needs. And what it does is creates a significant step up in value for us over and above what we could get from a third-party market sales. So this is all opportunity and then once we've satisfied all of the demand for the warranty and the insurance claim fulfillment is we saw certified refurbished products in a lot of our distribution, very effective, gives the customers the ability to step into an iconic phone platform, maybe a generation or two old, at a much more affordable price point. So this is a very good opportunity for us and thanks for pointing it out. John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Brett, if I could just interject, after the next commercial break, I'm going to be on CNBC, so I'm going to sneak out and do that, and then I'll be back. So you guys. Keep going on (40:25). J. Braxton Carter - T-Mobile US, Inc.: On the capital allocation issue, certainly we'll see what the outcome of the auction is and what our leverage is. It's amazing. You look at all the deals in the industry, you look at all the financial profiles, you'll earn that leverage and we pry out the strongest balance sheet in the entire industry now plus the ability to de-lever organically, very rapidly. We are taking our leverage up without any doubts, as we talked about in the past, up to a $10 billion cumulative spend for all sources of spectrum and the auctions. We'll see where things end up. So immediately we'll need to de-lever a little bit. And again, we'll do that both organically and with true cash generation. And then once we get there, then we're in the classic paradigm of what are our alternatives. And the trick there is to realize the highest return on invested capital and if we can do that organically or inorganically, looking at strategic opportunities, looking at future spectrum deals that could possibly come up and ultimately if you don't have those opportunities then you start exploring return of capital to the shareholders, but my expectation for that type of evaluation is we're still two or three years off. That's more of a midterm question. Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And just to make sure I understood the answer to the first question, in terms of the residual value of the devices to the extent they come back to you, you're basically saying you'll either be able to avoid buying a refurb device in the second market to satisfy a claim for insurance or you might just have some devices you could sell but either way, it sounds like all those things flow through the EBITDA. So is that the right way to think about it that if there is value in that residual value those devices we'll see it in your EBITDA performance next year? J. Braxton Carter - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Yeah. And it's not buying refurb handsets in the marketplace, because often you can't. There's not enough supply out there. So where the true opportunity comes from an EBITDA less (42:47) standpoint, Brett, is we're not taking brand new, A-stock, cracking the boxes open for that purposes. We're taking lower cost, refurb like-new handsets and utilizing those for the warranty and insurance claims fulfillment, and that puts a significant opportunity on the books for us so as we have adequate refurbed stock. G. Michael Sievert - T-Mobile US, Inc.: And, Brett, just a small caution, which should be obvious, but a lot of those phones if you've been calculating how big the base might be, have already made their way back to us in the form of people who take leasing are people who like to change out their phones more often. We just had an iconic phone launch, two iconic phone launches, and so some of those people have already taken advantage of their ability to swap out. Hey. Should we keep moving? How about one from Twitter? John @JTL2000 (43:45) says Q3 2016 was the first Verizon lost postpaid subscribers. Are they responding? What's the competitive environment look like? This is kind of interesting. It's one of those things that probably hasn't gotten noticed by a lot of people outside the inner circle, but this was a big moment that Verizon is going backwards. But I think what's more important is everybody is going backwards. We always get asked how was this quarter? Was it competitively more intense than usual? And the answer is no. Look, it was a normal and normally competitive quarter. It happened to have an iconic phone launch. But what's interesting is in an environment where we have real competitive intensity, and we have had for some time, T-Mobile is the only company in the space posting double-digit service revenue growth. And in fact, we're the only company in the space posting any service revenue growth at all. John said it's been since the middle of 2014 since AT&T has added a postpaid phone. Verizon has fared a little bit better than that but began moving negative this quarter. So the big guys are obviously distracted with other things, but also, they're facing a competitive intensity that's being brought by T-Mobile that's making it difficult for them to be able to deliver real revenue success in their core wireless businesses. We'll take one on the phone? J. Braxton Carter - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Yeah, let's take one on the phone. Operator : Matthew Niknam, Deutsche Bank. Matthew Niknam - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, guys. Thank you for taking the questions. Just two, if I could. One on the T-Mobile ONE. If you can talk about \u2013 I'm assuming customer inbounds trended higher, but whether the higher entry price point at around $40 may have limited some growth from customers not necessarily needing unlimited? And then secondly on the EBITDA guidance, I get that the adjusted EBITDA number is moving higher, though, there's $200 million in spectrum gains this quarter and some changes to the Data Stash and leasing. So my question is, is cash EBITDA, is that fair to assume that cash EBITDA guidance is effectively unchanged? Thanks. J. Braxton Carter - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Yeah. I'll take the last one. Yes, that is correct. When you look at the layer cake of all the EBITDA guidance, there's no changes to core EBITDA, which is really exciting given the fact that we continue to up our growth guidance quarter after quarter. And it's the same playbook we played in prior years, delivering on our EBITDA cash flow commitments while overachieving on a growth standpoint. G. Michael Sievert - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Yeah, and, Matthew, on T-Mobile ONE, not only is it not limiting our sales, it's supporting and helping our sales. It's a highly differentiated offer in the marketplace and it's driving the right kind of customers to our business, principally prime suburban families. So we're delighted with it. Now to your point, there are some people that want a lower price point than $40 a line for a family of four or $70 for a single line and we've not yet withdrawn Simple Choice and our 2 gigabyte offers from the marketplace. As John said, about 80% of our sales are on T-Mobile ONE. That leaves a residual 20% on Simple Choice, some of which at lower price points. And we will be phasing out Simple Choice, but we won't be doing so until we've delivered on the solution that allows T-Mobile ONE to reach all of the competitively important price points and that's still in. Matthew Niknam - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. Thank you. John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Okay. Let's do another question on the phone. Operator : Mike McCormack, Jefferies. Mike L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC : Hey, guys. Thanks. Braxton, I guess looking at the implied 4Q net addition expectation, it seems like the bar is kind of low there. Maybe some thoughts around that. And then also I think a lot of people are sort of thinking into the next year, the 10th anniversary iPhone, what it might mean for upgrade rates and translating that into what is \u2013 what free cash flow pressures you might feel on working capital? And, I guess, lastly, I was just thinking the EIP that you sort of shifted into and away from leasing, does that protect you against higher upgrade rates next year? Thanks. J. Braxton Carter - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Yeah, sure. So, let's start with, is our earnings guidance for Q4 conservative and is the bar too low? I mean, it still implies a very strong growth quarter for us on a postpaid standpoint. And certainly the other part of the equation is we have tremendous momentum going from a prepaid standpoint. And certainly that is going to continue in Q4 and we don't guide to the prepaid growth for the business. But if \u2013 you look at the numbers, you look at the trajectory, it's hard to imagine that we're not in the 8 million net addition range again for the third year in a row. And remember, our issue has always been subscale, and the whole translation of this growth to reoccurring sustainable free cash flow is the fact that we're a highly fixed cost business and we're getting tremendous organic leverage on it. The other thing I'll point out, Mike, is we have never missed or not exceeded the guidance that we put into the marketplace. And the strategy that we're deploying is one of balance. Could we grow faster? Absolutely, we could grow faster. And over the last three-and-a-half years, there's been many times where we've made a conscious decision to have balance and to meet the commitments that we're making to the marketplace. And I think we can all see the credibility and the sustained value creation that comes out of that strategy. We have no intentions of not hitting our guidance. We could easily post higher growth numbers and have a slight miss on EBITDA, but we're planning a long-term, very mapped out financial strategy here with one ultimate purpose in mind, to take care of our customers and to create value for our shareholders. If you'll let me turn it over to Mike to talk a little bit about \u2013 well, I think it's going to be a very exciting year next year on the upgrades standpoint, the iPhone 8, there certainly will be a Note 8 that comes out which was a phenomenal phone. And the opportunity for T-Mobile with those iconic launches last year. G. Michael Sievert - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Yeah, I mean, it's kind of obvious but switching moments like that are great moments for T-Mobile. We had a big switching moment this quarter. You saw the results and how significantly we grew at the expense of our competitors with a switching moment like iPhone 7. And I want to point there's huge opportunity for that in next year as well. Overall, it's a good thing financially that customers are holding on to their phones a little bit longer. And EIP, the construct that we innovated and brought to the market is certainly helping with that. The only thing I would probably watch for next year is whether or not there would be the kinds of promotional intensity around next year's devices that we saw this year. T-Mobile led the way with an offer for a free iPhone 7 that we were very excited about, it was quickly matched by everybody. And I think in the end, that doesn't really change the competitive equation much when everybody is offering the exact same device. So, that's something that I'd be surprised if it happened again. But neat year is an exciting opportunity. And remember, switching moments that cause people to ask do I have the right device is a great time for them to ask do I have the right carrier. So, overall, it's an opportunity. J. Braxton Carter - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Hey, we have some good questions here from Walt. Neville, you want to try to take those? Neville R. Ray - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Which ones do you want to go for (51:53)? J. Braxton Carter - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Let's go for the top two. Neville R. Ray - T-Mobile US, Inc.: So, the first one is, are you still expecting a Q4 close of the Chicago spectrum purchase? So, Walt is referencing there the 700 MHz A-Block spectrum deal that we shook hands on earlier this year. So, we should see approvals from the regulatory authorities in Q4. We're already busy with pre-deployment activities, so looking to light that spectrum up in 2017. I talked earlier on just to fill out that 700 MHz story, we're at 225 million, covered 700 MHz low-band POPs today. And as we all know, that provides significant improvements in building coverage about four times better. Really enhances suburban fringe and rural coverage, so it's a great story for the company. We now have over 270 million licensed POPs to go after. So, we'll close the 225 million to 270 million gap materially between now and the end of 2016, and that's also a key focus for us as we move into 2017. So, tremendous story. And this quarter, we also closed the transaction, we still need to get approvals, et cetera, for a deal in Montana. The second question from Walt, any evidence of higher gross adds in markets where 700 MHz deployed or has been deployed, providing new coverage? And I'll throw this to Mike, clearly which \u2013 clearly, we are seeing a ton of benefits come through where we've deployed 700 MHz. It really adds a quality and capability to our coverage that we've been looking for for some time. We'd often build material density in markets to overcome some coverage deficiency with just a mid-band spectrum position. But the addition of low band has really enabled us to compete on an equivalent basis with AT&Ts and Verizons of the world. As you heard from John at the beginning of the call, with 312 million covered POPs on LTE net, we're now effectively matching the Verizon coverage. But I'll toss this to Mike because I know we've got good reference on sales and what's happening in the 700 MHz markets where we're materially deployed. G. Michael Sievert - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Yeah, the short answer is, as Neville said, is yes and \u2013 but only where we have distribution present. And that's what's interesting. I want everybody to just bear in mind about these results. Remember, we're doing all of this growth asking, while historically only competing in a little over two-thirds of the U.S. with our full suite of both network and marketing and distribution, think about that. We have a huge opportunity to move to three-thirds of the market, and that's what we're doing. You know about our plans to not only expand the network, which has now hit 312 million of the U.S. population, parity with Verizon, but also our plans to expand distribution in behind that. And we've talked about our aspiration from the beginning of 2016 through the middle of 2017 to add 30 million to 40 million population to our distribution. And when you have both things in place, that's when you see the potential for upside after a period of ramp-ups. So, we're very excited about the potential ahead, and it is mostly driven by that network expansion as the foundation. J. Braxton Carter - T-Mobile US, Inc.: And one final thing, Walt, we're just delighted to have you and your family as new customers on the T-Mobile One. Thank you very much for your business. Let's go to Ric Prentiss next on the phone. Operator : Ric Prentiss of Raymond James. Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Yes, thanks. A couple of questions, guys. Let me follow up on Walt's question there. Can you update us as far as how you are doing as far as opening up the stores for that extra 30 million, 40 million POPs of the low-band frequency, where are you at as far as marketable POPs and where you think you could be by mid-2017 and end 2017? G. Michael Sievert - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Yeah, absolutely. The only outlook we'd given is for mid-2017, which is to add, as I said, 30 million to 40 million from the beginning of 2016 to what we call marketable POPs. And we're tracking really nicely for that. It is a back-end-loaded plan, but we're tracking for the pieces that we've said. One of the pieces we said is that we would add 400 stores on postpaid this year, and that's tracking along very nicely to be wrapped up by the end of the year or certainly by the next time we talk. The other piece is we're rapidly expanding distribution for MetroPCS, which you've seen the phenomenal numbers that we're posting. A lot of that is due to the distribution expansion. A thousand new stores inside of this year and more aspiration for next year. So, basically it's a very simple formula, put the network there, fill it in behind it with marketing and distribution, and then after a ramp-up period, you see the performance. And we've been able to experience this in some places to test the thesis and it certainly holds. Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: And then, Neville... J. Braxton Carter - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Go ahead, Ric. Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Yeah, Neville, you touched briefly on the 3.5 gigahertz as well. What are your thoughts as far as could you use that for small cells? Would you use that for backhaul? I think it's, what, 150 megahertz of unlicensed shared spectrum that would be out there, but what are your thoughts to what 3.5 gigahertz could be used for? And when could it make it into the ecosystem of handsets and infrastructure? Neville R. Ray - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Yeah, that's a good question, Ric. I mean, obviously, the old phrase is never seen a megahertz we don't like, right? And we've been a strong proponent of looking to drive LTE into the unlicensed space and ahead of 3.5 gigahertz, almost guaranteed you will see deployments of LTE-U and LAA in the 5 gigahertz bands in 2017. And there's a lot of that spectrum, Ric, in many areas, especially in outdoor environments, which is very heavily underused. LAA opens up I think north of 500 megahertz of unlicensed spectrum. Not all immediately usable and not all immediately necessary to use. The 3.5 gigahertz process is kind of underway. I mean, I think everything we see would point to probably an 2018 timeframe. There's several building blocks that have to be put in place in terms of sharing mechanism, shared access system, SAS is the acronym you will see thrown around in the industry. So, that's kind of a shared approach to using the 3.5 gigahertz. And you're right, there's 150 megahertz of that, but there is military use in a chunk of it. So, it's kind of a sharing mechanism, which is dependent on new infrastructure being built. That all said, we love all these spectrum opportunities. And clearly, in terms of propagation and capability, we're now in this space where everybody talks about the 2.5 gigahertz over at Sprint, but there can be a lot of spectrum in that 2.5, 3.5, 5 gigahertz range, which can do a lot on small cells. And then ultimately then, you look at millimeter wave spectrum coming, 28 gig, 39 gig in the U.S. There will be auctions inside the next two to three years for sure. That's a pretty conservative statement from me, I think. And again, we'll start to see spectrum in millimeter wave that can be used on small cells in the early running. So, there's going to be a lot of different highly competitive spectrum sources coming at that kind of traditional high-band space which create pretty interesting environment and opportunity for everybody I think that is looking to continue to deliver great service and expand their offering. So, we continue to work all dimensions of spectrum : low, mid, and high, and ultra-high coming with millimeter wave. John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: And, Ric, I just like to point out what a thoughtful and serious answer Neville just gave you for a guy that's not wearing pants. J. Braxton Carter - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Here's a good one on Twitter. You guide a $4.5 billion to $4.7 billion CapEx for 2016. This implies $757 million for Q4, 47% below last year. Any reasons for this? John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Benjie Arnaud (01:00:24). J. Braxton Carter - T-Mobile US, Inc.: And, yeah, Benjamin (01:00:26). Good question. And I think the way you need to look at this is we've had a very upfronted and disproportionate CapEx spend during 2016. And it also has implications for the true cash flow trajectory that you're seeing. If you look at year-to-date this year versus year-to-date last year, a very significant upfront spending on investment in our network. And what's been driving that is the rollout of the 700 megahertz. Neville and his team have been flat out building this as quickly as they can, and the majority of what could have been accomplished during the year has now been accomplished. So, this is real normal CapEx without overlays of LTE expansion that we've seen in the past or what we're doing right now with 700 megahertz. And it does not imply any slowdown to our overall capital intensity. We're deploying a success-based capital investment program, and we again will give guidance on our year-end call for next year's investment. It isn't going to go down, I guarantee you that, but nor do we see the necessity as we pivot dollars for other uses of it having a significant step function increase. But very good question, Benjamin (01:02:07). John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Go back to the phone? Operator, we'll take the next question on the phone. Operator : Michael Bowen, Pacific Crest. Michael Bowen - Pacific Crest Securities : Okay. Thanks for taking the question. I just want to get your thoughts on margins. Obviously, strong here and kind of where you think the throttle points are for margins and how you're viewing that versus subscriber adds. Thanks. John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: I'll let Braxton handle that as long as he doesn't use the word throttle. J. Braxton Carter - T-Mobile US, Inc.: You got it, John. Yeah, it's a great question. The number one sensitivity that we will be dealing with and looking at projecting margins is how quickly we continue to grow from a subscriber standpoint. What you've seen I think is incredible leverage from a cost to sales standpoint on the operating of our network. Neville and his team have worked for years being ahead of the competition, laying in a fiber backbone. We've been doing a major expansion, and you're seeing massive leverage from a network standpoint, which, of course, goes straight to margin expansion, 180 basis points year-over-year. The other part of the equation is the SG&A piece. And there's always variable costs associated with acquiring subscribers. And what we've been doing is balancing growth against all of the progression that we see in our financial metrics, and we certainly will continue to do that, but we also feel very strong about the momentum of the business and about our sustained opportunity to grow. And as long as we're growing to the tune that we have been growing, roughly 8 million subscribers a year, you're not going to see as much leverage coming off the SG&A versus if our growth moderated where you see an explosion in EBITDA and an explosion in margins. But the fact that we continue this growth rate and still expand margins, which we have consistently shown, really provides the context that we're building a lot of terminal value in the future and that's important to us. Again, we're here to create value for all of the shareholders and create value for our customers. Michael Bowen - Pacific Crest Securities : Braxton, just a quick follow-up on that. You typically have been aggressive early in the year. So, that being said, does the AT&T transaction maybe perhaps make you more aggressive given perhaps they take their eye off the ball a little bit? J. Braxton Carter - T-Mobile US, Inc.: You're right. We have very effectively deployed a countercyclical strategy. All of the big guns and the big dollars come out in the fourth quarter. And the incremental cost of bringing that incremental add are much higher than if you do it in other parts of the year. And based on that strategy, while everybody else is pivoting off, starting to talk about margin recovery as they go into the first quarter, we tend to be very, very aggressive. And you just heard John say earlier today, we've got another Un-carrier move coming before the next time we have an earnings call, and believe me, it's something we're excited about, and it's something that we think is going to create a lot of value and momentum going into 2017. John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Yeah. And, Braxton, let's face it. AT&T can't take their eye off the ball because it hasn't been on the ball for so long. It has been way over two years that they've added a customer. They're just not interested in this business or in participating. And that's why they're vertically integrating their business into other businesses, and they're going to attach them on. It's almost like a \u2013 and you can see this in many companies. If you look at their results announcement, you can almost see the stage of when they were excited in investing in something and then they drop it off the bus. Wireless was shrinking. U-verse was shrinking. DIRECTV is already slightly anemic. And this is not going to \u2013 this movement is just assuring that it's going to be another year or two of really thankful donations from AT&T to our further growth. I think that's the most exciting part about the deal. Michael Bowen - Pacific Crest Securities : Thanks, guys. And thanks for that mental picture from Neville. Neville R. Ray - T-Mobile US, Inc.: You're very welcome. John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: If you could just add here's one, Neville. Did you take any of Sasha's (01:07:10) questions? Neville R. Ray - T-Mobile US, Inc.: No. John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Just had a ton of them. They are really good ones. I would just say, Sasha (01:07:15) that your Twitter photo scares me. But we can \u2013 do you want to take a couple of those? Neville R. Ray - T-Mobile US, Inc.: I'll do them quick. Yeah. John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Yeah, emphasis on quick. Neville R. Ray - T-Mobile US, Inc.: So, a couple from Sasha Sagan (01:07:27) here. What carrier aggregation layout will band 66 rollout enable and what speeds? And then when will we see more 4x4 MIMO devices? So, just on 4x4, do that one first. So, that's a global first from T-Mobile in the smartphone space to launch 4x4 MIMO, first company in the world to have 4x4 moving out in the network for smartphone capability. And we'll launch multiple devices as we move into 2017 in addition to the devices we already have on 4x4. We've just recently launched and we have over 1 million customers now enjoying 4x4, so there'll be great traction on 4x4 capability in 2017. On band 66, this is AWS-3 extension to the AWS band. So, depending it is a \u2013 can't do this one quick, Sasha (01:08:24). It depends on your holdings and where you sit. Your AWS-3 addition may be contiguous with your existing AWS assets. So, actually, it doesn't require carrier agg in its kind of traditional sense. But long story short, you're going to see that spectrum come to market and become a valuable tool for us in 2017. We've already turned the radio up in some markets in Southern Texas. And we'll have our first device launched with again a first for T-Mobile, the first device launch later this month. And then in terms of speeds, if you think about a world where you have three-way carrier agg and you can do 4x4 and you can do both together which is the story of 2017, then you're approaching gigabit LTE speeds, which is really exciting for 2017. We can do about 400 megabits per second on 4x4 and/or three-way carrier agg. And then the two coming together, you can start to double down and as you expand your carrier agg reach, you can move towards gigabits. John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Okay. Before we go back to the question just so that I can insert him into the dialogue. There's a question here, it says, a question for today's earnings call. T-Mobile announced a partnership with Twilio for Internet of Things a while back. Is it working? And I bring this up so that I can introduce and let at least say hello, Peter Ewens, who is our Head of Corporate Strategy and Development and is behind the scenes working on a lot of very unique and creative partnerships and relationships so this was one of them. Thanks for asking. And, Peter, maybe you want to comment real quickly? Peter A. Ewens - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Yeah, sure. So, I'll take that. So, we did announce a partnership with Twilio earlier this year. The products are just rolling out now, but we have great hopes. What the partnership with Twilio does is it marries our great network with their software development environment and software development tools. IoT is a very fragmented space and we're going to see tons and tons of innovation over the next few years. And what this enables us to do is really go after all the innovators and developers out there. We're going to build great IoT applications on our network. So, we have great hopes for it, and we think it's really going to start to deliver in 2017. John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: And I used that to say there are significant ways to create partnerships, alliances, and then eventually, potentially investment-related and/or merger relationships without trying to do the earthquake move all at once. And we do have a vision and a strategy how to migrate ourselves to the future environment. And what happens \u2013 I've said this before, what happens when mega monoliths get together and think that they have locked the market down in a certain space, it frees up all of the other creativity to align itself behind the more nimble creative players like T-Mobile. So, any one thing that AT&T does, for example, that could prohibit anything for us just creates a plethora of others that now become very capable and willing partners of ours (01:11:40). Let's go back to the phones. Operator : Amir Rozwadowski, Barclays. Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you very much. Thank you for the color on how to think about sort of growth versus the earnings capability of the company. I was wondering if we could translate that a bit in terms of cash flow and cash generation. In the past, Braxton, I believe you've sort of endorsed or taken a look at sort of where the expectations were for cash flow for the company in the near term albeit 2016. I was wondering if you could give some color on that? And then as sort of follow-up, how should we think about balancing that going forward? It does seem as though you're at an inflection point when it comes to the capabilities of the company to drive additional cash generation, but would love to hear sort of the puts and takes about how you plan on managing that while balancing the opportunity set for growth going forward? J. Braxton Carter - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Yeah, absolutely. So, on 2016, we still are dialing in to exactly what we've talked about in the past. From a core or cash EBITDA standpoint, you've seen our guidance being unchanged while yet once again taking up our growth projections for the quarter and thus, the year. And you saw a slight narrowing of the range on our cash CapEx. I mean, quite frankly, what did we have, a little over two months left in the year, so we have really good visibility how we're going to land the year. So, with the reaffirmance and narrowing of that guidance then the other part of the equation is working capital burn. And again, we have haven't specifically guided to a true lever of free cash flow number, but from a working capital burn standpoint, we're comfortable with the general consensus of $500 million to $1 billion. And when you get a chance to dig into our cash flow statement, you will certainly see the upfront investment we've done from a cash CapEx standpoint this year as well as a fairly significant year-over-year paydown in our accounts payable. So, with that intact, the other part of the equation that gets a true levered GAAP-free cash flow is the interest expense. And quite frankly, that is still an unknown. We can certainly dial in fairly close towards 2016, but ultimately, it's going to be a function of where we end up with this upcoming auction which we can't really talk about at this point. We do have a lot of flexibility with the agreements that were put in place with Deutsche Telekom, which we never could have received in the open marketplace. marketplace. We have the full optionality whether to draw or not. We got significant refinancing capability if we do draw higher cost, high yield notes that are out in the marketplace that would be highly NPV positive. So we're really focused on, number one, getting through this auction, understanding what our spends are going to be. And I think there's going to be a lot of things we can do with our capital structure to manage increased leverage yet optimize interest expense going forward. So that's really the picture on 2016. When you get to 2017, we'll have a full year run rate of whatever debt is going to be in place associated with ultimately what happens with this auction. So that will be a little bit of drag on truly levered free cash flow. But the other part of the equation, the growth in EBITDA, again, will be very significant. Certainly, double digit, like we've seen in the past, and again, we'll give very specific guidance at yearend. But that's just a function of what we're seeing with the fundamentals of the business. You put on 8 million subs in a year and then you get the reoccurring margin and the counter-cyclical strategy trying to grow growth in the first part of the year, the EBITDA development will be significant in 2017. And then you have the cash CapEx paradigm, not going to go down, but you're not going to see any significant step function increase in the cash CapEx. So all that points to with a fully embedded financing structure in our base, remember, we pioneered this, very high ramping cash flow going into 2017 and beyond. John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Operator, I'm pretty sure that the next caller is one of T-Mobile's most recent customer additions, and in anticipation of him becoming a customer, we've had to significantly add force for the many questions that he's going to continue to ask us on how to use these capabilities we never had before (01:17:12). Can we take the next caller. Operator : Walter Piecyk, BTIG. John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: This is where you press the mute button, Walter. Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC : Can you hear me now? John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Yeah. Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC : Am I there? No, that wasn't on purpose. My headset died. So I know you're looking forward to my speed test on Twitter. So I think my phone is to arrive in about a week, and thank you for the $400 for my iPhone 5 \u2013 or, yeah, iPhone 5C, I think, you paid me. That was nice. Can we just go back to Sasha's (01:17:52) question on the band 66? Can you give us a sense of how many of those phones you're going to have in the base by the end of next year, maybe the end of 2018 because I know when Massa (01:18:01) was asked about 2.5 gigahertz spectrum, he made a big deal about saying band 66 is not in the ecosystem. So just curious how quickly you think that's going to ramp into the base. Neville R. Ray - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Yeah, I think it's a 2017 story. As I said, we've got our first \u2013 it is the first device in the U.S. which is launching this month. Funny, it's from us, but I suppose we're always the company that drives spectrum to use before all the other guys. I think the big two paid $28 billion for spectrum there and no devices and no news on network from them. But anyway, so we're pushing forward. I know first half of the year we have a slew of devices coming with band 66 AWS-3 capability. So we're pushing it into every device as fast as we can. As you guys know, some OEMs move quicker than others on new banding, but there will be a large number of devices available in 2017 with AWS-3 capability. I don't know when and how. I can't speak to what AT&T and Verizon will do in terms of turning up that spectrum world, but I would imagine it will be a slow process as usual, but not from us. Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC : Okay. And then for Braxton, I think you talked a little bit about the upgrade, I think you said that the Samsung returns were not processed in the upgrade rates. So assuming that people weren't returning their phones, do you have a sense of where the upgrade rate is? And then more importantly, your smartphone sales are growing yet your upgrade rate's down, obviously because of the gross adds. Can you give us a sense though in the fourth quarter, has there been follow-through on that very strong order flow that you saw for the iPhone? So is it possible that the upgrade rate could be flat or even up? That would obviously be further levered to the gross add, so that could kind of make for a relatively sizable smartphone sales quarter. If you could just talk about those dynamics and what you're thinking about as far as the December quarter. J. Braxton Carter - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Yeah, so on the recall of the Note 7, every one of those sales both from a revenue and cost of sales and unit standpoint was reversed. So when you're looking at the upgrade rate, it does not include anything for the Note 7. It was as if that handset had never been launched. Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC : So what would it have been if you didn't reverse those? How much higher would the upgrade rate have been? J. Braxton Carter - T-Mobile US, Inc.: It would have been higher but not significantly higher. Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC : Okay. J. Braxton Carter - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Definitely would not have moved to more than 50 bps. But it would have been slightly higher. On the iPhone 7, the really interesting thing is \u2013 you're hitting on something really important \u2013 is extreme supply constraints, once again with an iPhone launch. It's not going to be as bad as we saw with the iPhone 6, but it's going to be pretty much in line with the success. We still do not have adequate inventory. There's still backlog of people wanting to upgrade or new adds coming in on that platform. We currently anticipate it's going to be sometime in November when we have complete health from an inventory standpoint, and then can start stocking in all of our retail fleets this great handset. I just activated mine, it's fantastic. So that will imply additional upgrades flowing into Q4. But again, it's not going to significantly move the needle. There's always puts and takes in upgrade rates. You saw a little bit of elevation in the third quarter. You'll see a little bit of iPhone 7 impact in the fourth quarter, but it's not going to materially move the needle from any financial aspect of the company. Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC : Well, that's because of the phone payment plans, obviously, you can take that through and not have a big impact. But... J. Braxton Carter - T-Mobile US, Inc.: True. Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC : ...I mean if it's the same as last year and your upgrade rates are the same, that's a change from it being down a couple hundred basis points year-on-year this quarter, right? J. Braxton Carter - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Yeah, but again, precisely forecasting exactly what happens, there's a lot of other puts and takes during the (01:22:45). G. Michael Sievert - T-Mobile US, Inc.: I mean, the broad trend seems to be people are keeping their phones a little longer. J. Braxton Carter - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Absolutely. G. Michael Sievert - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Yeah, so that's the broad trend. You should see that when you squint in the general direction of our year over year. But sequentially, for all the reasons Braxton talked about, we see more upgrades in Q4 than in Q3. Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC : Got it. All right. Thanks. John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: (01:23:05). Operator, if we can take at least one more? Operator : Colby Synesael, Cowen. Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company : Great. Thank you. Two questions, if I may. Just for modeling purposes, I was wondering if you can give us some of the historical churn or ARPU numbers that's tied to the Walmart base that moved from postpaid, just so we have an understanding there. And then secondly, I was wondering if I could coax out any hints around what the next on carrier might be, any areas where you're seeing pain points that are obviously you can be addressing. Thanks. J. Braxton Carter - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Yeah, I think if you look in the Factbook, Colby, what we did is we disclosed the pro forma churn with the transaction with Walmart, had it closed on July 1, and our churn for the quarter would have been 1.20%, which reflected in our actual results. The deal closed on September 1. So the month of September, the impact was there. And you had 1.32% reported postpaid churn. So I would use that as a proxy for the churn impact going forward. And I think, suffice it to say, even normalizing \u2013 and we're providing full transparency on this \u2013 you have very nice year-over-year improvements in the churn trajectory of the business, which you would expect, given our Un-carrier moves, the investments that we're making in the network and all the other things that we talked about. From an ARPU standpoint, it does have some small impact, but quite frankly, it's really not material. It's a little more material for prepaid. It's very immaterial for postpaid. So it's just kind of noise in the system. And I think that's the right way to take a look at it. John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: And on Un-carrier 13, which we haven't decided we're going to call 13 yet, I have no input at this time but if you want a preview, I refer you to WikiLeaks. Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company : I'll start digging through now. John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Okay. One last question, operator. Operator : Tim Horan, Oppenheimer. Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thanks, guys. Two questions. Braxton, could you maybe talk about the pricing of your base? Are there any moves that you can do to kind of help out that ARPU growth? I know you had some unlimited pricing that you were going to keep steady for two years? And then, Neville, can you just maybe give us your thoughts about Wi-Fi/LTE integration, and maybe the ability for cable companies to do that as an MVNO or maybe, conversely, if they owned a cellular network, can they really accomplish that seamlessly? Thank you. J. Braxton Carter - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Yeah, I think from a pricing standpoint, the way that we should all continue looking at our business is stable to flat ARPU. And I think to do anything more aggressive would really be a disservice. We're more than holding our own. We're showing a lot of momentum with the business, but there still are promotions, there's still competition in the marketplace. We certainly have a pricing umbrella compared to AT&T and Verizon, which we're very, very comfortable with and is performing quite well for us. But to really sit here and say that we're going to significantly accrete ARPU in the future, given the history of this industry and the saturation, I think, is overly aggressive. We will make other moves in the future and we are really focused on a stable ARPU picture. I'll pass it over to Neville. Neville R. Ray - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Yeah, I'll be quick, Tim. I mean, clearly, if you want to talk to a company that understands how to make Wi-Fi calling work seamlessly with mobility, it's T-Mobile. We're the global leader. We were the first to launch integrated LTE, voice with Wi-Fi. We understand the space better than anybody. We have the strongest smartphone lineup. We're just a clear leader in the space. And when it comes down to connecting various networks, be they Wi-Fi-based, cellular-based, et cetera, the art is you've got to connect through the cores right? So you need to join the intelligence behind the radio together, in a way to build seamless mobility. And that's coming. There's a whole host of features with A&D assessment (01:27:54), HotSpot 2.0, that are coming in 2017 and 2018, that will make that technically achievable. But again, you've got to really share the core architecture across the respective companies. You want to know who does that well and who does it best? You ask T-Mobile. John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: I think the vision picture, though, is pretty clear. We say all the time, customers don't really care what you use. They want you to use whatever you need to use for them to seamlessly be able to have capabilities on their devices in the home or mobile. And if one player could control and use, simultaneously, Wi-Fi, unlicensed in cellular, in an appropriate integrated manner, it would clearly have a superior capability and, tangentially, people trying to coexist with each other and do hand on. So in a future world, I think ultimately, they will be seamlessly integrated under individual players that have all three. I think that's the vision. I don't know if it's two years, five years, I don't know who gets there, but somebody will get there, and then have the owner's economics of having and controlling that, and they'll be in a superior position. Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thank you. John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Okay. Braxton, do you want to summarize? J.

Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Okay. Good morning, everyone and happy Valentine \u2013 my mic on there Mike. Thank you. I'll start over, good morning, everyone and Happy Valentine's Day. Welcome to T-Mobile's fourth quarter and full-year 2016 Un-carrier earnings call and open Twitter conference. We're coming to you live today from San Francisco. I've got a few comments and then we're going to get right to your questions. We'll spend up to 90 minutes taking as many questions as possible from Twitter, Facebook, and on the phone. You know the drill. We're live streaming on YouTube, so stay tuned and tune in any time that you want. Okay, let's talk about T-Mobile's absolutely fantastic Q4 and full-year 2006 (sic) [2016] guidance. Guess what? We did it again. Our 2016 results continued to trend setting T-Mobile even further apart from everyone in the wireless industry and now frankly, we're in a class of our own. We're not just doing what they try to do better and faster, we're doing it different. We're the only wireless provider growing both our postpaid and prepaid businesses for 14 quarters in a row. And for the third year in a row, T-Mobile is beating the competition in postpaid phone growth and total net additions. Our financials are just as strong and we've led the industry again for the third straight year in service revenue growth and total revenue growth. In addition, we more than doubled our earnings per share and free cash flow for the full-year of 2016. On top of that, T-Mobile had three years of speed leadership so far with the fastest 4G LTE network in the nation. Skeptics spent years doubting that our performance would be sustainable. Clearly, they got it wrong. Our consistent results over many years prove that putting customers first is also good for shareholders. Now you have the release, and you have the Factbook, but I want to cover a few highlights for the quarter. Our financial results were fantastic. We remain the only growth company in this industry. In Q4, we delivered 23% total revenue growth year-over-year, 11% in service revenue, and 12% in adjusted EBITDA. Excluding the spectrum gain in the fourth quarter of 2015, the year-over-year adjusted EBITDA growth was 19%. Our customer growth numbers led the category again with 2.1 million total net adds in Q4; by the way, the 15th consecutive quarter with over 1 million net adds. Maybe even more impressive, for full year 2016, we added 8.2 million customers making 2016 the third year in a row with over 8 million net adds. That brings us by the way to 71.5 million total customers at the close of the year. We added 933,000 branded postpaid phone customers. By the way, that's 12 quarters in a row that we've led the entire industry in postpaid phone nets. For the full year, we added 3.3 million postpaid phone customers and in case you're keeping score, that's 103% of the industry growth in full year 2016, and 109% of the growth for the last three years. Yes, that does mean that the other three combined lost customers. Now, I've got to touch on porting ratios. We've now had 15 quarters with positive postpaid porting ratios overall and 12 quarters in a row positive against every individual major carrier. Our overall postpaid porting ratios in Q4 were consistent with our very strong Q3. By the way, after the launch of Un-carrier Next last month, we've seen a massive improvement quarter-to-date in Q1, with improvements against all carriers, especially the duopoly, formerly known as Dumb and Dumber. We also expect Un-carrier Next to result in even lower churn, increased gross adds and cost reductions over time. Now, we can't forget prepaid, although some seem to have. It's a huge driver of our business, where we have the number one prepaid brand with MetroPCS. We added 541,000 new customers, again leading the industry. For the full year, we added 2.5 million prepaid customers, nearly double what we did in 2015. Now churn, branded postpaid churn in Q4 was down 18 basis points year-over-year to 1.28%. This marks the best Q4 postpaid churn we've ever reported. Prepaid churn was down 26 basis points year-over-year and also the best Q4 reported to date for prepaid since the merger with MetroPCS. Now, these results were due to investments we made in our network. Our 4G LTE coverage is at 314 million POPs today, and we're targeting 320 million by year-end 2017. We are reaping huge benefits from this. Multiple sources recently confirmed what we already know that T-Mobile's network is now at parity with Verizon, their back is against the wall and after fighting it for a long time, they just reluctantly announced an unlimited plan. This is what the Un-carrier does. We drag the carriers kicking and screaming into the future. And of course, we have a great offer in the market already with T-Mobile and we just made it even better. Look, they don't do any of this well. It's easy to one-up Verizon and yesterday, we did just that. And don't forget, our network is still the fastest in America. We've been the fastest in both download and upload LTE speeds for 12 quarters in a row. That's three years of speed leadership with T-Mobile. By the way, upload speeds are increasingly important with the giant rise in social sharing and T-Mobile's upload speeds are at least 40% faster than Verizon, the next closest competitor and more than 150% higher than Sprint speeds. Now, that doesn't sound like the 1% difference that Sprint keeps blabbing about, does it? Our deployment of Extended Range LTE on the 700 megahertz A-Block spectrum band is way ahead of schedule. 500 markets are live covering more than 252 million people. True to form, we are rolling up the remaining 700 megahertz A-Block spectrum, which includes Chicago as we speak, and you know how fast Neville and his team can get this done. This network expansion also provides us with the unique ability to grow our distribution footprint by 30 million to 40 million POPs by the middle of this year. We plan to open an additional 2,500 stores this year, roughly 1,000 T-Mobile stores and 1,500 MetroPCS stores. That's on top of about 1,400 stores we added last year and almost 400 T-Mobile stores and 1,000 MetroPCS stores in that 1,400. Now, I've never been more confident about the future of T-Mobile as we look into 2017. Braxton will go through the 2017 guidance in detail, but let me just highlight the big picture. Our guidance for branded postpaid net customer additions is the same as what we started with for 2016. We expect adjusted EBITDA will be up significantly, double-digits over last year, excluding spectrum gains and the net impact of leasing and Data Stash. In terms of cash CapEx, we continue to invest to support our growth and will not starve our network. This contrasts with one of our competitors who has said they can do it on the cheap, and that is now showing up in the form of higher churn. And I'm most excited about our expected three-year CAGR on free cash flow. For the first time ever, we are guiding on free cash flow, demonstrating our confidence and our ability to deliver strong growth over the next few years. Let me now hand it over to CFO, Braxton Carter for more financial highlights and the details on the 2017 guidance. Braxton? J. Braxton Carter - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Hey. Thanks, John, and Happy Valentine's everyone. Let me give a quick snapshot of our very strong financial results and the details on our 2017 guidance. Let's start with the financial results for the fourth quarter. Our customer growth continues to translate into strong financial growth as we delivered industry-leading metrics for the third year in a row. Service revenues grew by 11% year-over-year and adjusted EBITDA grew by 19%, excluding the spectrum gain recorded last year. Adjusted EBITDA margin excluding the spectrum gains expanded to 35%, up from 33% a year ago. EBITDA benefited from strong cost discipline as both cost of service and SG&A showed operating leverage even as T-Mobile captured all of the industry postpaid growth in 2016. As a percentage of service revenues, cost of services and SG&A, each declined by 120 basis points year-over-year. The postpaid upgrade rate was 10% in the fourth quarter, up from 7% in the third quarter and flat year-over-year, given very strong customer demand for the iPhone 7. Free cash flow, including approximately $200 million of MetroPCS network decommissioning payments more than doubled to $1.4 billion in 2016 from $690 million in 2015. Net cash from operating activities increased by 13%. Cash CapEx was flat year-over-year at $4.7 billion. CapEx excludes capitalized interests, which increased slightly year-over-year including capitalized interests from $4.5 billion in 2015 to $4.6 billion in 2016. The improvements in free cash flow occurred despite two headwinds; the sequential $400 million increase in EIP receivable balance in the fourth quarter due to the sequentially higher upgrade rate; and a very significant cash outflow in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $1.2 billion for the year, which represents a swing of $1.9 billion from 2015. When looking at free cash flow in the fourth quarter, also recall that free cash flow in the fourth quarter of 2015 benefited from a cash inflow of $900 million from securitization compared to just $170 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. For 2016 as a whole, the cash inflow from securitization amounted to approximately $540 million compared to $900 million in 2015. Earnings per share came in at $0.45 per share in the fourth quarter compared to $0.34 in the fourth quarter of 2015. Note that EPS in the prior year included an after-tax spectrum gain of $0.10 per share. Branded postpaid phone ARPU of $48.37 in the fourth quarter grew by 0.7% year-over-year. Excluding Data Stash, the year-over-year growth rate was 2%. We expect ARPU will continue to be generally stable from 2016 to 2017 with some quarterly variation, driven primarily by the actual migration ramps at T-Mobile ONE, including taxes and fees. In terms of customer quality, we saw continued improvement in the quarter. Total bad debt expense and losses from sale of receivables were $190 million or 1.87% of total revenues. Importantly, this is down year-over-year in both absolute dollars and in percent of total revenues, even giving a much higher customer base. Let me now come to 2017 guidance. Our target for branded postpaid net customer additions is 2.4 million to 3.4 million, which is the same guidance we started off with last year. You guys know the playbook. We will update guidance as the actual quarterly results warrant throughout the course of the year. On a side note, while not providing guidance here, we expect wholesale net additions to be significantly lower in 2017, as our MVNO partners de-emphasize Lifeline in favor of higher ARPU customer categories. For adjusted EBITDA, our target range is $10.4 billion to $10.8 billion compared to $9.6 billion last year, excluding spectrum gains. Our EBITDA target includes expected leasing revenues of $0.8 billion to $0.9 billion, while Data Stash is expected to have an immaterial impact in 2017. In comparison, in 2016, leasing revenues amounted to $1.4 billion and Data Stash to $0.3 billion for a combined net impact of $1.1 billion. We're also making one accounting change in 2017. In line with our big four competitors, we will include imputed interest associated with EIP receivables in Other revenues, which will be included in adjusted EBITDA, but not included in ARPU. Up until now imputed interest, which reflects cash received from customers was included below the line in interest income. The impact from this accounting change is expected to be approximately $0.2 billion to $0.3 billion in 2017. Net-net, we expect continued double-digit growth in adjusted EBITDA excluding spectrum gains and the net impact of leasing and Data Stash. We target cash CapEx of $4.8 billion to $5.1 billion in 2017 excluding capitalized interest compared to $4.6 billion in 2016 on a like-for-like basis. Cash CapEx spend will again be front-end loaded this year due to the completion of the 700 megahertz A-Block build, specifically Chicago, which is going very, very well in the early part of the year. We expect free cash flow defined as net cash provided by operating activities minus cash CapEx to increase at a three-year CAGR of 45% to 48% from 2016 to 2019. This guidance underscores our expectation of strong free cash flow growth while also giving us room to continue our Un-carrier momentum. During the same period, we expect the underlying net cash provided by operating activities to increase at a CAGR of 15% to 18%. Now, let's get on to your questions. You can ask questions via phone, text message, or via Twitter or Facebook. We'll start with a question on the phone. Operator, first question. Operator : Thank you. We'll go first to John Hodulik with UBS. John Christopher Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Good morning. Thanks. Maybe one for John and one for Braxton. First, for John, there's obviously been a lot of competitive pricing changes thus far this year, Sprint had an aggressive one and now Verizon going to unlimited, is there anything that you're seeing out there now that could potentially change the trends you're talking about in terms of the strong porting in the first quarter, gross adds or churn, and just some comments on the competitive environment would be good? And then, number two, for Braxton, guidance suggests you're going to generate about $10 billion in free cash flow over the next three years. How should we think of sort of uses of that cash over that time? Thanks. John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Thanks, John. Couple of comments upfront. Let's remember that what we're announcing today is Q4, the quarter where everybody else in our industry kind of laid themselves on the table and complained about the competitive environment and the craziness of the holiday period. That is the period here where we culminated the year of taking more than 100% of all the prepaid and postpaid phone growth, 11% service revenue growth. And I just want to remind everybody, the service revenue growth of our three competitors in 2016 were as follows : minus 5%, minus 5%, and minus 1%. They lost customers, they shrunk revenue growth, so that thing that they call the competitive environment, it's us. And we thrive in that and we've done so for three years. Now, going into this year too, you've now clearly seen some moves that can only be deemed desperation. Sprint, remember these are exploding prices, these are prices that canalize you and then they explode. So what's happening at Sprint is, last year's tantalizing appetizer is exploding, so their churn is going up so they're bringing in a whole new group of people who need to be educated as to what that is. It's a fake price, on a network that doesn't work with CapEx that is not being put into it. So, kind of, there's certainly a \u2013 there's a level at which people ignore you and they're pretty solidly in it. And let me just pinpoint for those who weren't paying attention, Sprint had 368,000 postpaid nets. Now, most of those were given away, but still that's what everybody seems to be hurraying. They lost 501,000 prepaid nets, and wrote-off another 1.2 million prepaid nets, which means they lost, took off the books about 1.4 million customers in the quarter and burned cash. The stock is trading like an option, because somebody is praying somebody is going to help them out of their misery, so that's not the competitive environment, that's them. Verizon, everybody knows, Yahoo! is driving them nuts, they're damned if they do it, they're damned if they don't, go90 has become let go 155, they're about to potentially do some other big transaction; and in the middle of that, within a month's period, they went from, \"Hell will freeze over before we do unlimited. Nobody needs unlimited. Everybody is stupid. Here's our 5 gigs.\" to \"Hey, we're going to do unlimited.\" Now they called it an introductory offer, and by the way, the thing that you can learn from that is, they finally agree their network advantage is over. Welcome to the game, Verizon. Let's compete on price, let's compete on network, and remember that is kind of the scenario where we are. We immediately made sure that the terms that are important to customers were matched. But if they want to step up the next pieces, taxes and fees; taxes and fees are included in their prices, which is another form of trickery. So I would say that the competitive environment so far is based upon moves that others are making out of desperation. We're playing from a position of strength. Unlimited is who we are. And I just want to remind you on Verizon that in Q4 or in Q1 when we announced All-In Unlimited, quote that I said was \"we will drag the rest of the industry kicking and screaming into unlimited because it's the future.\" So just picture as Verizon announced this kicking and screaming because that's what took place. Braxton? J. Braxton Carter - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Yeah, John. What a journey that we've been on over the last four years to the point where we're giving this type of future free cash flow guidance with a great deal of confidence. So couple additional points to make. First of all, this embraces expectation for very significant growth of T-Mobile over the next three years. It also includes all anticipated debt issuances associated with anything that's on the horizon that we're planning on in connection with the business. And that's very, very strong and like all guidance we've put out, we've not missed or exceeded guidance since we started this journey four years ago. And we have no intention of not beating or meeting guidance in the future. But with that said, what do we do with this cash generation? The first thing that we'll do is continue to maintain the strongest balance sheet in the industry, even the duopoly given the serial acquisitions and what they're doing, are at extreme levels of historic leverage and the Sprint comparison isn't even a comparison, but having a strong balance sheet and the financial flexibility to look at strategic options in the future is extremely important to us. So that will be the first use. The second use, we'll have to wait and see what inorganic opportunities are ahead of us. 5G spectrum is reality, we already own a lot, Neville will talk about that. But there will be other important government auctions in the future and potentially some private party transactions. And finally, we would absolutely prefer to reinvest in our business for the highest IRR and return to shareholders, but at some point with this type of cash flow generation, albeit medium term, we would look at returning cash to shareholders. Nils Paellmann - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Okay. Operator, next question? John Christopher Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thanks, guys. John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : We'll go next to Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, guys. Thanks. I guess two follow-ups, if I can. One, Braxton, what is the leverage that you would sort of target? We chalked this (25:18) about three times to four times in the past, if you got back down to three turns, is that where you start to think about returning cash, and I know that's a long way away. And then, John, since you brought up someone taking Sprint out, how you think is the potential for industry consolidation these days? Thanks. J. Braxton Carter - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Yeah. I think that the capitalization policy of three times to four times we think is more of an optimal range, because some leverage is absolutely good for the equity. However, there'll be times when we flex to the higher end of the range for a short time period and there'll be times when we are below that range, potentially anticipating other things that happen in the future. The great thing about T-Mobile is with the significant momentum that we have and expect to continue with our network and our strong innovation, will definitely provide a significant growth platform and the organic deleveraging we have will be significant and rapid as compared to the competitors. John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: And on the second part of the question, I have to color myself highly amused by the conversation that's been taking place at the top of most people's list over the past month or two. I'd preface by saying we're in an anti-collusion period during the low-band spectrum auction. So one thing I can assure you is, nobody is talking to anybody. So there's an air of thinking driven by a couple of things. One is, I'll take the positive side, which is that customers with smartphones no longer are interested in our artificial barriers that we as industries have put on segmenting how they use their devices. They don't care about the cable industry or the wireless industry or the internet industry or the content industry. They want to pick up their device and do whatever they want to do with it, watch whatever they want, and preferably for free. But that's the demand, that's causing industries to look at each other as better ways to serve customers. So that brings to mind obviously a brand like T-Mobile with tremendous growth prospects and an organization of employees that is unparalleled, and 72 million people, who use their devices and growing faster than anyone else in the world. Then there's the second part, which is obviously there are always industry consolidations or changes that are driven in the worst way for some people, which is, hey, look at me, I need help. And right now, you know that going into this year, you know that DISH needs to do something. Regulatory wise, they have to do something with their spectrum. Sprint is clearly playing the game for next quarter. And that they've got good spectrum, but they don't have a franchise and they are candidate for being a part of a greater organization either through scale or something else. Verizon, clearly, with what they did yesterday, needs to do multiple things. And then an interesting angle on what has happened in the unlimited world, it only significantly enhances the reason that cable industry needs to understand how are they going to get to those that are viewing the mobile Internet. And if you think about what happened, the cable industry has been hoping to use MVNOs on Verizon to get economics to do something in the wireless entry point. However, there's no possible way they'll get economics to do unlimited, which has now become the industry standard, and that will compel them. And don't rule out that part of what Verizon did with their unlimited offer is send a message to the cable industry that you're not going to ride us to what's going to happen on your entry into wireless. So it's a fascinating time. I would say if you listened to Sprint the other week talking about all their options, T-Mobile has all those options plus one that Sprint doesn't have, which is, we are a very healthy growing franchise and if we choose to, we can continue to drive tremendous shareholder value on our own or participate in various forms of significantly growing the industry through consolidation; and I've got news for you, I couldn't be more excited about the period that's going to come up when this auction is over, while we continue to do what we just announced and then engage in understanding what the future of this industry is going to be, which is fascinating. Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Understood. Thanks, John. Nils Paellmann - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Operator? Operator : We'll go next to Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you very much. Good morning. John, I wonder if you could just elaborate a little bit on your comments about the massive increase in porting since Un-carrier Next came out. And then Neville, you did add HD video to your Un-carrier standard offering last night, can you just help us understand the impact on the network and how you're positioned to handle that? Thanks. John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks, Simon. So what's been going on in porting is, and again, it's important to note and I apologize for dragging this through, but this has been going on for three years, up, down, sideways, whatever Moe, Larry and Curly decide to do, we continue to port positively for 15 quarters against the industry, 12 quarters against each individual carrier in a row. Q4's postpaid porting rate was about flat to what was a great Q3, call it 1.53%, 1.55%. In Q1 thus far several comments to make. Overall porting spiked over 1.9%, and if you can think about that, that's 2.0% or so with AT&T, 2.28% with Verizon. Hello, okay, if you want continued information as to why Verizon is waking up, 2.28%, that's the customer's response to hey, you guys, you don't need unlimited. And we moved with Sprint to about 1.5%. So if you think about what's happened with Sprint. They've gone over Q3, Q4, Q1, from about 1.2% to 1.33% to 1.5%, which is a good comfortable range especially when somebody is giving things away and mortgaging the tires on the car that they rent. Now, the only comment I will make is, that Q1 thus far is going to be an interesting quarter to keep an eye on. We all know that tax season is somewhat delayed, and this is going to be a very rear-end loaded quarter. Not something that's going to impact the year, but the porting that we're showing, shows our competitive thrust. But thus far, 2017 has \u2013 they always start slow, but there is a tax season question and so far there's an awful lot to see in Q1. And I would assume that the rest of the industry sees that as well. Braxton? Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you. Neville R. Ray - T-Mobile US, Inc.: I think it was to me. Hey, Simon. So yeah, we had a tremendous year of execution across the network in 2016. John touched on a bunch of the coverage highlights. Your question refers to what have we done to really expand the capacity and LTE performance on the network. And obviously, we're in a great place, the speed test results that we discussed earlier, three years of leadership there. I always talk about how that's a great proxy for offered capacity on a competitive basis across the U.S. And we lead and have led and everybody has been chasing our tail and we'll continue to do so, especially when you look at combined uplink and downlink performance on LTE. But what do we do in 2016, it was a big year of re-farming for us whereby we're repurposing legacy spectrum that was committed prior to 3G or 2G technologies, and lighting that up for LTE. And we did a lot of that in 2016 primarily driven by our ability to really lead on the conversion of voice traffic to voice over LTE. We have two thirds of our customers now on VoLTE. That's a global leading industry stat. Nobody is close to us in the U.S., nowhere near. One of our competitors is actually on 0% VoLTE. And that's super important when you look at the spectrum assets you own and your ability to commit those to LTE rather than legacy voice services. So we moved a lot of spectrum over to LTE, and we'll do a lot more. Right now, 70% of our spectrum asset is committed to LTE. That number will move north of probably 80% as we move through 2017. So that's added a lot of spectrum and capacity on LTE for us. We clearly added leading features and capabilities on carrier aggregation. 4x4 MIMO, 256 QAM, all of those things are adding capacity and capability to the network not just today, but over the next two to three years as handsets start to really ramp with those capabilities on the network. So all three of those features really helping us. Densification, we've been adding small cells. We're just about a thousand small cells now. And we've been moving very quietly, but very strongly and thousands more will be ready this year. Not because we desperately need to densify, but because we're getting ready for two important things. One, 5G, but more importantly and in the near-term, the use of 5 gigahertz spectrum for LTE. And so everybody talks about this LTE in unlicensed or LIA. That's a fact that that will happen in 2017. And we'll open up new spectrum opportunities in the unlicensed bands for T-Mobile to leverage in 2017, 2018 and on into the 5G space. So overall, Simon, ton of things happening. We're in a very, very strong position from a capacity perspective. We've been adding, obviously 700 MHz, we're AWS-3 ready. The first carrier in the U.S. to actually deploy handsets and capability on AWS-3. And of course, as John referenced earlier, we're in and about to close out another major auction. So very strong position, very confident in our performance, and I think, the benchmarking that's out there today, very delighted to see the results from OpenSignal last week, show how much we've done and the strong position we're in. John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Mike, do you want to add something to that? G. Michael Sievert - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Yeah. Sure. Simon, I just want to underscore one thing that Neville said, which is, everything in our announcement yesterday around high-definition, there's nothing unprecedented about it. This is the way unlimited plans have always worked at T-Mobile up until T-Mobile ONE, where customers have the choice of high-definition or not. As you know, when we launched Binge On, we gave customers a new choice, including unlimited customers of streaming at standard definition to make sure that they get a much better bang for their buck on total data streaming, better network capacity, better overall performance for all of their other applications and when we did that, very few unlimited customers actually chose to stream in high-def, which underscores why we did T-Mobile ONE in the first place. Our customers really like the overall performance of the network, including when it streams at standard-def. So with T-Mobile ONE, what people will do is raise their hand in the app and select high-def if they want it and that's something that we have very good mathematical experience from our past on how many people do and that gives us confidence in our ability to forecast network capacity as we make this move. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Nils Paellmann - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Operator? Operator : We go next to Michael Rollins with Citi. Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi, thanks for taking the question. Just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about, Braxton, the double-digit revenue growth aspiration that you described earlier in the year and maybe if you can give us some sense of the bridge of the postpaid net add guidance to that revenue number. And then secondly, just in terms of the category, it seems like one of the significant changes over the last few years is that customers are taking longer to make decisions, they're holding their devices longer. Can you talk about the implications of that and what you're trying to do to accelerate that decision making for customers? Thanks. J. Braxton Carter - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Yeah, sure. Yeah, I think, first and foremost, you know our playbook on the guidance, we think it is not prudent to get out there too aggressive for the year. And as we demonstrate growth as a quarter-to-quarter basis, as warranted we adjust our growth guidance. Obviously, our business has tremendous momentum, we're the innovator driving all change in the industry, and we won't stop with that. We have some very, very interesting innovation and plans for the future. And with the value proposition that we have in place, we're highly confident of significant continued growth, all at the same time where you're seeing significant drops in the ARPU and service revenues with all the other major carriers in the industry. And we talk quite a bit with Un-carrier Next that our view on ARPU is generally stable on a year-over-year basis, which is really important with all the fears of irrational pricing, again you look at the macro environment and it's really not conducive to complete your rationality, and you look closely at a lot of these promotions or temporary offers in the market, that's just what they are. But this ARPU stability as well as our customer growth gives us a great deal of confidence that service revenues are going to continue to expand significantly. And let me just start a little bit on the device lifecycle, and I'll turn it over to Mike Sievert. We believe that the churn equation definitely is somewhat correlated to the launch of new iconic generations. And in periods where you don't have that, you're certainly going to see lower overall switching in the category. In periods where you do see that, you've historically seen more switching, which is a net-net opportunity for T-Mobile. But more importantly, we are the innovator in the industry and the more we innovate, the more we'll drive switching. And with that, I'll hand it over to Mike. John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Mike, let me \u2013 while we're passing the ball, let's just remind two things. One is, the fact that customers are able to move between carriers started with the first Un-carrier move that we had moving to no contract. Secondly is, before Mike talks about how we accelerate things, one of the ways that you thrive in an environment where there is limited switching is you take 110% of all the growth. So, in the last three years, where there were 10 million incremental postpaid phone nets in the industry, we got almost 11 million. So, that shows that no matter what the pool is in the environment we can thrive. But Mike, do you want to comment actions? G. Michael Sievert - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Yeah. Three quick things. First of all, we do have the best upgrade rates in the industry. Let's just make sure, we underscore that. It was 10% in Q4, Verizon's was 8%, AT&T's was 6%, Sprint's was 9%. So, our customers continue to recommit in the form of a new device to our network at a greater rate than anybody else's. And that's a great vote of confidence and it certainly, as Braxton pointed out, contributes to a record low Q4 churn that we had in Q4. But two other quick points. One is, we're seeing a trend towards affordable phones. And this is something that's very interesting, as people keep their phones longer, an offsetting trend is that they are in some cases spending less on phones, and that's potentially a very good thing for the industry. Because as you know, we provide interest-free financing, it's very good for our overall cash profile if people start to be more attracted to more affordable phones. And lastly, and perhaps, most importantly, we're seeing something that's really changed in the industry and doesn't get discussed enough. And that is a broad compatibility of phones across all four major carriers. Wasn't true even two years ago. But today, virtually, every super phone out there in the hands of competitive customers is 100% completely compatible with T-Mobile. And that opens up a brand new opportunity to attract people to come over and switch and keep their phone, which means this idea that people keeping their phones longer should inhibit switching is a historical assumption that's decreasingly true as time goes on. Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks very much. John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Yeah. Nils Paellmann - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Operator? John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Thanks, Mike. Operator : We'll go next to Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson. Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC : Hi, good morning. Two quick things if I could. First, Braxton, if you could just give us a little bit of color on the guidance for free cash flow to what that assumes with respect to working capital, and also handset financing going forward? And then, John, if I could just return to your comments before to make sure I'm clear on what you meant, when you were describing the tax season. I think you said it was a slow start. Did you mean a slow start for T-Mobile or a slow start for your competitors, as you run into tax season for the year? And are you referring just to prepaid or also to postpaid? John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: I'll kind of switch that back to Braxton, but start by \u2013 I am always intimidated by answering questions of somebody who wrote the novel about the industry's nuclear meltdown yesterday. You certainly caught my attention on that headline. So what I'm referring to nothing more than what is written in the media that the season associated with tax refunds seems to be somewhat slower. So I'm not pointing to any significant trends. The Q1 is usually a slow starting quarter and I am anticipating that if what's written in the media is, so it significantly impacts prepaid in the timing, which you know is highly lumpy. So it was more an observation of what's written in the media than a real identification of anything or forecast associated with our numbers. Braxton? J. Braxton Carter - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Okay. Yeah, Craig, when you look at the free cash flow guidance, I think, the first thing I'll comment on is handset financing. And we were the first carrier to innovate with financing in the U.S. marketplace, and we're the first carrier to truly reach the ultimate penetration there. And while there will be some build assumed in EIP receivables during this period that we're giving our free cash flow CAGR, the build is not significant in relation to what we've experienced in the past. And it's just the simple fact that collections on these receivables from the embedded base will approximate new financings done in a very high growth environment. Net-net, again our internal views are very aggressive continued growth, which has been fully embedded in this guidance, which would imply some sequential growth, but at a very low rate compared to historic. Working capital I think is basically the same issue as we continue to scale. And remember, one of the, I think, extremely exciting things about our story is that we've done everything that we've done in the last four years in two-thirds of the U.S. marketplace. And what the team is executing now is a massive distribution expansion. And with that distribution expansion to the other third of the U.S., there will certainly be some working capital associated with that. Now you have a significant upstart and swing up in the number of retail locations we've already guided towards in 2017, it's just the start of it. We will continue just like we've done with Metro, significant geographical distribution expansion over the next several years. And all that working capital associated with that expansion is fully embedded in the guidance that we've given. Nils Paellmann - T-Mobile US, Inc.: And as we go to the next question, operator, I'm going to grab one on the way in, and it jumps on what Neville was saying. On the coming in on Twitter, Walt Piecyk had a question associated, will the store growth be linear across the year? And I just want to amplify what Braxton was talking about. We added 1,400 stores last year. 1,000 on the Metro side, 400 on Magenta side. We're going to add 2,500 this year, a 1,000 Magenta, 1,500 and they are very first six-month loaded. And so they're not linear, they're very aggressively in the first half of the year, especially on the Magenta side. So with that, operator, we'll take the next question, which may even be from the same person. Operator : We'll go to Walter Piecyk, BTIG. Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC : Hey, John. Right when you guys were offering free taxes and all that stuff I was actually revising my pay-TV bill and realized how much I'm getting gouged as far as extra boxes and what have you. Just curious whether that will be a service that you would look to add as far as your services going forward? You've done pretty well in getting to free cash flow here. And if not that, are there other acquisitions or types of things that you would buy in addition to just being a wireless service provider? John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Which group was gouging you at that moment, Walter, if we can just clear that out (48:10)? Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC : In my case it was DIRECTV, but the group of us here all did, and we realized how much we're paying for these incremental box fees, HD fees, DVR fees, it's crazy. John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: (48:23) but I was exchanging tweets with Walt on this, as you know, he is a prolific tweeter even though nobody follows him except me and Nils. And if I remember Walt the question, which is really at a very high level, a fantastic one, which was about whether or not the cable and the pay-TV and the box industry is ripe for Un-carriering. And we'd have to change it from carrier, but talk about a poster child for an industry that has really kind of ignored customers and ignored customer cares and gouged at every quarter. The answer is clearly, I salivate when I think about the possibilities of changing some of those industries. And frankly, I'm fascinated with how little AT&T has done since they spent the mother load buying DIRECTV, and pretty much have let it sit on the side, and still be an old crappy linear TV that they bundle weekly with their unlimited offer, so maybe more to come. But, Mike, do you want to comment on? G. Michael Sievert - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Well, I just can't believe they advertised one price to you, and then ended-up charging you another price, I'm appalled. But look... John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Well, I actually tried to switch to FiOS. Hey, Mike, I tried to switch to FiOS, but I realized that even then, I already have FiOS on broadband, I tried that on the pay-TV side, but the charges were so high on a per box and an HD fee that it didn't even make sense to switch at that point. So I'm just curious why this would not be an area that you guys would go after, or anything else, I mean why not offer fixed broadband, if you're so happy with where your network is as another incremental revenue opportunity? John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: By the way, as we go back to Mike, alert the media that Walt Piecyk lives in one of the 10 homes that FiOS passes. Mike? G. Michael Sievert - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Yeah. The data on this is really clear. The cable industry is statistically one of the most unloved industries in the history of the consumer economy. So, obviously, it's ripe for innovation in this area. Look, we're not going to make any predictions today, but if you think about, you've heard John say over and over that the broad trends are crystal clear, which is all content of all kinds is landing on the Internet and moving away from linear formats. And the Internet itself is moving to mobile, and within this broad convergence, we do something in there really, really well, which is deliver an incredible mobile experience to consumers. And we'll have to see how it all unfolds as that content transforms and viewing habits change. I'll tell you one thing, in 2017 we will reach the point where people have more screen time on mobile devices than on any other kind of screen, and that's really something incredible when it comes to watching their video. So we'll see how this convergence unfolds, but in it we're where the industry is going, not where it's coming from, and we've got a brand that really resonates with people and possibly could resonate in an industry that's even more maligned than we found ours four years ago when we got here. Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC : Can I just have one quick follow-up for Braxton, which is a related question. Braxton, you talked about the optimal range of the debt leverage being three to four times, but if there was a highly strategic acquisition available to you, would it make sense for the company to take on debt leverage that was above that optimal range, even if it was for a brief period of time? John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Walt, as we go to the last of your 10-part question here and I hand to Braxton, I do need to acknowledge on the Twitter feed Travis Swientek who has the best tweet so far of the day where he says, \"Braxton's voice makes me sleepy, but I like his hat.\" J. Braxton Carter - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Yeah. John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Go ahead, Braxton. J. Braxton Carter - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Yeah. So, Walt, when you look at the leverage, you always have to look at, if you're doing something inorganically the actual situation you're in. What is the deleveraging profile of NewCo? Is it rapid? Is it slow? What is the unique opportunity? What's the relative capitalization structure and certainly in specific situations, purely theoretical, you could flex higher if you had a great deal of confidence in the rapid deleveraging. But you wouldn't flex significantly higher because a strong healthy company and the flexibility to invest in whatever the cost of achieving the synergies are would be an important consideration. So again very theoretical but there is the answer. Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC : Thank you. John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Yeah, Walt, thank you. Operator : Next is Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks for taking the question. When we look at the loading of your postpaid net adds over the course of the year, you tend to be a little bit more even than, say, what we see across the industry, which has tended to be more back-end loaded. But if I listen to some of the things you've said on the call, particularly front-end loading, the deployment of new stores, you'll have a lot more doors open for the duration of the second half and maybe a new iPhone coming that could create a lot of activity. I'm just wondering how you're thinking about this year and whether it may end up being a year where you actually do see acceleration and growth on your subscriber base more towards the back-end? John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Yeah, it could unfold that way. It's a good observation. We are rolling out stores on both of our brands at a rapid pace in a way that is front-end loaded. We've been signaling this to you for a long time that we have really been competing in two-thirds of the market and have an opportunity to add $20 million, $30 million, $40 million additional marketable POPs from the beginning of 2016 to the middle of 2017. And we're on track for that, so that does bode well. Now there is a ramp time associated with distribution. So just because you open the door doesn't mean it contributes its fair share right away. So you have to factor that as well. So, yeah, I think your observation that the shaping could be a little different than in prior years could pan out. We don't give quarter-by-quarter guidance, but the industrial logic of what you're saying is sound. J. Braxton Carter - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Hey, Brett, let me put a little finer point on that. John very importantly talked about what we're seeing with a very significant way in the tax season in Q1, and the backdrop of our porting ratios is before any of that impact really materializes. Back in November, a law was passed relating to tax fraud avoidance that delayed any refunds for two categories; earned income credit and childcare credits to the February 15, and the tax season really isn't going to ramp-up until the end of February, which is a delayed impact. The other thing that I wanted to be really clear on the stores is there are very few incremental stores opened at this point. We're executing towards the second half of the year into the second \u2013 to the first half of the year, i.e., which implies a very significant ramp during the second quarter. And I think it's really important to pivot off Mike's statements that all distribution does in fact have a ramp associated with it. And a lot of what we're doing here with this expansion is third-party retailers, which is really an efficient methodology, but it does take time to get this stuff up and running. Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And just a quick follow-up. John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Okay. Go ahead. Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Well, I was just going to ask, as an extension of this, your churn rate, particularly, postpaid churn rate has just trended very nicely year-over-year. Do you think that's sustainable? Is that embedded in your guidance? J. Braxton Carter - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Yeah. I actually think it's one of the things that we're most excited about, for four years in a row we've continued to show significant progress and year-over-year, there is always seasonality in churn, but importantly, year-over-year on a quarterly basis, we continue to show goodness there. And how could we not? The investments that we're making in the network, the expansion that we're doing, the leading technology, the upload speeds, all that accrues to very, very happy customers. And you overlay on that foundation extreme innovation. And as we say, we won't stop. That innovation is going to continue, and that just more accretes to the brand and to customer satisfaction. Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. G. Michael Sievert - T-Mobile US, Inc.: And we're not going to make a specific forecast about it. But just to put a fine point on that, we see no reason why our churn can't be at industry best benchmarks compared to any competitor in our industry over time because one of the core things behind it is network. And as we've been crystal clear, we intend to have a network in this industry that's second to none, and on many of the attributes, we're arriving there already. So we see nothing to prevent continued progress on this metric. Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: And let's take \u2013 coming in on Twitter, Jan Dawson has a question to Braxton and Mike. Given your guidance around wholesale in 2017, can you tell us what the trend was in 2016 across MVNO and M2M? G. Michael Sievert - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Yeah. I can start. Yeah, just to give you a specific, we started out 2016 with about 14 million wholesale customers and ended with a little over 17 million, 17.2 million customers in the area. So it was a big growth year for us. And one of other things going on is our customers are \u2013 our big wholesale customers were focused on high-velocity transactions. There was a movement towards Lifeline in 2016, which tend to be low revenue per connection \u2013 profitable customers, but lower revenue per connection. And what we're seeing right now is they are shifting their strategy in a different direction. They're focusing now on higher-value connections, and part of that is due to the changes in regulations around Lifeline and so on, but higher revenue per customer connections, which means, as we view it, our revenue plan for this area of our business looks intact. We're very confident in it. We have great partners in the space. But how it will unfold when it comes to customer accounts will be different than 2016, and we were just signaling to you that that was a different kind of a year with those kinds of unit growths, even though our revenue plans for 2017 look quite good. John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Hey, operator. Operator : Next to Jonathan Chaplin with New Street Research. Jonathan Chaplin - New Street Research LLP (US): Thanks. One for Braxton quickly. So I just wanted to sort of dissect some of the impacts for 2017 free cash flow from the three-year guide. So I guess, what I'm hearing from you is that there'll be a working capital drag as you roll out stores. I'm assuming that's for this year. What's the thought process over the course of the next three years with working capital and EIP? And I guess what I'm trying to get to is the 15% to 18% guidance that you've given for OCF more or less of what we should be looking for, for EBITDA? J. Braxton Carter - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Yeah. So, again, let me unpack this to the extent that I can. And, Jonathan, one of the reasons that we gave a three-year CAGR, again, is our philosophy of having guidance out there that we have a great deal of confidence that we're going to meet or exceed. And the retail expansion that we're talking about actually will occur over all three years of this period. I go back to the points that were made about our distributions in two-thirds of the country and we have expansion into all of the United States of America. And what's really cool about that is, it's major tailwind from a growth perspective if you essentially have no base that you're churning off of when you go into these new areas. So all of the customer flow actually goes into growth and margin growth and cash flows for the company, but it will take a while to expand distribution across the full U.S. So we are definitely assuming that this is not just a 2017 issue. Secondly, when it comes to investments and receivables, I did make the comment that we are at penetration of the base. So any incremental EIP is associated with growth of the business, and our external expectations of growth over the next three years are very strong. And as a result, there will be net investment in EIP and a world of lower growth. Not only would you see maximum leverage of the scale of the business and an explosion in cash, you also wouldn't be making these future investments in working capital. But we're positioning I think very appropriately with a great deal of confidence in the continued momentum of the business. And other than that, that's about as much as I can unpack it for you. I hope that was helpful. Jonathan Chaplin - New Street Research LLP (US): Thanks, Braxton. John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Okay. Operator? Operator : Next to Jonathan Atkin, RBC Capital Markets. Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Yeah. Two quick questions. I wondered if you can give some thoughts on how you see the regulatory environment unfolding. So M&A aside, just what regulation and how that might affect the business differently going forward. And then secondly, on the B2B channel, wonder what kind of milestones you are planning, if any, as you sort of target that segment? Thank you. John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Okay. On the first, we certainly don't know more than everybody else, but there certainly is an expectation and an air of less regulation, less impediment to kind of innovation, a process of looking at change in a more aggressive way without government intervention, as well as an expectation of a more favorable corporate tax environment. And I think there's been some reports released as early as this morning listing some of the top beneficiaries potentially of some of the possible tax change, and I think T-Mobile was one of the top three. So, we don't have specifics, but certainly, we feel a positive environment. And as you say, in addition, we do feel that there will be a more positive environment to consider structural change to the industry, all of which I think is positive for our company and more will unfold. And we look forward to working with Chairman Pai, who we know well and have great respect for, as well as the Trump administration in anything that's important in the telecom space. G. Michael Sievert - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Yeah. Jonathan, on your question about the B2B segment. Our business we call @Work is just doing fantastic. I can't give you a lot of forecasts on things that are coming up. We'd like to keep our cards a little close to the vest on that. But just a couple factoids, we had the highest ever percentage of our net adds in Q4 in the business channel this Q4. So you saw the highest ever performance of our business channel in the quarter we just announced as a percentage of our total net adds. That means it's outperforming every other part of our business on growth. So we're really proud of our team in this space. And what we're finding is that there's been a big change in the last year and that is that our network is now meeting all the threshold requirements that big enterprises have, and that just wasn't the case a couple of years ago. We weren't really in the discussion with medium and larger enterprises because they have facts and data to back up their choices and they're very thoughtful about this, and they weren't choosing us back then. Well, now that those same facts and data are pointing that we have a network that is second to none and they're choosing us on purpose because of our network and I think this is a leading indicator for consumers who have less data at their disposal than enterprises have. So we're delighted to see that progress. It's mostly driven by network. A secondary point and the final point is that, we're the only one of the major wireless companies serving them who are unconfused about the future. The future is mobile communications. Every other company out there is trying to serve them legacy technology as well and over-monetize that. And I think our customers appreciate us for that because the industry is shifting towards mobile when it comes to enterprise communications. John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Okay. Operator, as we go to the next question, I'm going to answer one in the way over that I know people have passionately been wanting to ask, but it hasn't come up yet. And the answer to that question is, yes, we are giving away Valentine's Day socks on T-Mobile Tuesdays as well as pizza today. J. Braxton Carter - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Pizza... John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: So, at the end of this call, you can all login to the app and get your socks and your pizza. Operator, we'll take the next question after that. Operator : Next to Ric Prentiss, Raymond James. Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thanks, guys. Love to get some of that pizza delivery down here to Tampa. The first question pretty easy, Braxton, there's been some spectrum-backed debt issued in the marketplace recently. What are your thoughts about approaching that market and what it might mean to your free cash flow? J. Braxton Carter - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Excuse me, Ric. Yeah, I think importantly, that is not something that we would entertain at all, using our lifeblood of the business to collateralize any borrowings out there. And quite frankly, we don't need to do that. I'm sure that you've recently saw the significant Term Loan B that we put in place, that's the total amount that we will do on that because we're very focused on not layering too much secured debt against the unsecureds. That could do anything to jeopardize the rating, so it's very important to us to protect the unsecured market. But when you look at the free cash flow guidance that we just gave, there is a very significant amount of cash generation and our business has been fully funded for all investments that we're doing for really the second year in a row. And the outlook is very, very positive. So, no, it's not anything that we would consider going forward (1:08:14)... John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Yeah, Braxton, I would point out that in some sections of even the city we're in, there are loan sharks still in business and pawn shops that are other ways to get money that we won't be using either. And I'm not sure which of our competitors you're referring to, but I would assume that they didn't go to that move because it was one of their top two or three options. Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: And, hey, I've got one for Neville as well. Not wanting to put you in a box with the broadcast auction still underway, although obviously winding down into the assignment phase. But from a fundamental theoretical standpoint, how soon could broadcast spectrum be deployed if someone were to buy some? And as we look at your 2019 guidance and the reconciliation about $5 billion to $5.4 billion in 2019, should we think that broadcast spectrum could have some impact on that. John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Well, we're out of time, Neville. Sorry about that. No, go ahead. J. Braxton Carter - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Yeah, let me just start by saying we have had significant projects every year. First rolling out 4G LTE, then the 700-megahertz roll out, the geographical expansion. And as we complete these projects, we certainly do roll those dollars and make them available for other uses in the run rate. The guidance that we provided has all of our known issues fully embedded in it for this three-year period. So just to frame it overall and I'll turn it over to Neville. Neville R. Ray - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Yeah. So, Ric, the focus this year is to continue the incredible pace we've achieved on rolling out our current low-band spectrum asset 700 megahertz. So we're 252 million deployed, much of that has happened in the last 18 months. And we have 272 million licensed POPs to run out, the big delta between the two is Chicago, and as Braxton referenced earlier, we're pushing very, very hard to bring large pieces of that market on air with 700 megahertz in the first half of the year. So 700 megahertz is key focus for us, it's driven massive footprint expansion for us on low-band and puts us in a great place, for all the dimensions of new competition, still is B2B, et cetera, that Mike talked about earlier on. When it comes to 600 megahertz, obviously, we can't say anything really in terms of the auction. What I can tell you though is that the ecosystem around 600 megahertz radios for the handset, for the actual cell site equipment, that marketplace is starting to buzz. And so equipment will come through, the standardization work that has to happen for the 600 megahertz band. We do now know the band plan, so that's a material shift, and change, and progress from the last time we talked on a call like this, and so equipment is coming. And there's a lot of work to happen with broadcast clearance and so on, but it's going to be an exciting time on 600 megahertz. And I'm encouraged by the new administration's statements on a robust and timely clearance of broadcasters as we work through the coming months and years. So lot of positives to come on 600 megahertz. John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Just to amplify that Neville, nothing to do with the auction that we could speak about, but you've always been one person different from all the others that believes that whoever does get spectrum in the low-band auction could put it to use as early as this year. Neville R. Ray - T-Mobile US, Inc.: It's certainly feasible. Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Yeah. John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Okay. Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thanks, guys. That's what I was looking for. John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Yup. Operator? Operator : Next to Mike McCormack, Jefferies. Mike L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC : Hey, guys, thanks. John, maybe just a thought on mobile video, your thoughts on where T-Mobile can go with that, whether or not you have any interest in OTT partnerships, any interest in ownership of content itself? And then, maybe for Braxton, just looking into 2017 upgrade rates, as we move more into EIP as opposed to leasing, shouldn't that dampen the overall upgrade rate even in the face of this 10th anniversary iPhone? John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Okay. Let's swing through here, I'm going to, Mike Sievert is quite passionate about that topic, he's going to introduce it by saying, if you go back even a year, year-and-a-half, we've said all along that you can understand most of what's going to happen by the header of all content is going to the Internet, all Internet is going mobile. Because of the trends, of what have happened in the last year, we've now shortened that to all content is going to the mobile Internet. So in fact, clearly, by default, anybody that's in the business of content or on smartphones and eyeballs will be going into the mobile video business in some way. And Mike, why don't you talk about some of the vision on that? G. Michael Sievert - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, well, I think one of the things our customers really appreciate about us is that our tendency to put them first and listen to what they're looking for. So we'll be guided by them on this. And so far, we don't hear customers crying out for their wireless company to erect walled gardens and curate their content for them and pick and choose for them. We saw how badly that failed when Verizon tried it with go90, it's just not something that that customers are asking for yet. That being said, as we talked about a few minutes ago, our brand is really strong, and as things start to change it's possible that customers might expect us to do that for them. And if they do we will. But I think, we've been clear since Binge On, that if we can make it easier for customers to access without penalties, without fear of data overages, the way we changed the industry with Binge On and with T-Mobile ONE, if we could make it easier to buy, if we could make it easier to consume there are plenty of things we could do besides, erecting our own plan, which is a walled garden and curate all their Internet content for them. When the magic of the Internet is that you can have all of the content. So we'll be guided by our customers on this. But right now, what they're telling us is they love our neutrality in this space. J. Braxton Carter - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Yeah, the second part of your question relates to our view on upgrades. And net, net we're actually excited about the handset innovations that are coming in the upcoming year. Mike talked a little bit about more affordables and the differentiation between smartphones is becoming increasingly difficult. But in 2017, we have a couple of very significant things coming. The 10th anniversary of the iPhone, which again Apple is very tightlipped about innovations they're bringing to the market, but I think all expectation is that that's going to be a very significant step up in functionality and form that will certainly drive switching or reinvestment in your certain carrier during the upcoming year. And then we also have Samsung coming out with another iteration of the Note, and I think, by all accounts that was one of the most exciting true smartphones with that type of screen size out there and it's a shame what happened, but they will certainly be back and be back very, very strong in the upcoming year, as well as all the other things from a handset standpoint. So net-net, our expectation is probably the same overall rate of upgrades as a percent of the base for 2017. Mike L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC : So, Braxton, just as a follow-up on that, there's no \u2013 the EIP versus leasing shouldn't impact that, I mean, in the dip on demand issue? J. Braxton Carter - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Yeah, not necessarily. During 2016, we were pretty much all new customers on EIP flow. You can tell by the guidance that we've given for leasing, that's more run rate with existing people on leasing and not assuming a lot of additional lease for new customer flow coming in. But it's still a tool in our toolbox, and we can obviously pivot as we see necessary in the marketplace. But that's definitely not the assumption in the guidance. John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Okay, we're going to take one more question operator. And then we're going to run over to CMBC and go from there. Operator : Next to Matthew Niknam, Deutsche Bank. Matthew Niknam - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, guys. Thank you for getting me on. Just two real quickly. Number one, on network payload, you've talked in the past about after launching Binge On throttling video at 480p, there was a net payload reduction. Just wondering how that's been trending in recent months? And then just on prepaid, maybe for John or Mike becoming an increasingly competitive space more subsidies on phones, ARPUs we see are great plans, promotions, continuing to get more aggressive. How do you win profitably there in the current environment? Thanks. John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Let's go backwards. I guess, Mike and I commented upfront, the prepaid environment becoming competitive, I think what you mean by that is some of our competitors have realized that there's nothing that they can do enough on the postpaid side to grow their revenue stream when they're declining significantly. I mean if you had 368,000 postpaid nets with a declining ARPU, but you lose 1.3 million to 1.4 million customers, 501,000 in the same quarter on the prepaid side versus a player like ourselves, who we've gained 5.1 million prepaid nets over the last three years and 2.5 million this year, and had a stable to increasing ARPU. This is an extremely profitable business. And by getting highly competitive, you mean quarter-after-quarter we hear the same, we're going to come back in this business by the same group that two years ago said they were going to have the number one or two network by now. So, we don't see it or hear it. And in the meantime, if you do the store count, by the end of this year, MetroPCS will have 10,000 doors. So it's kind of a hard thing to catch-up to, but I don't know if you want to comment on it? J. Braxton Carter - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Well, I mean, right, it's pretty simple. In order to win in this space, you have high ARPUs, low churn, reasonable acquisition cost, and if you look at our business, we fit the bill to the T. And it's fascinating, it's sort of an underappreciated part of our business. We look at some of the unit economic measures, things like what kind of performance do we get on investments in sales and marketing, we call it return on CPGA. We look at how much margin is created for our company and contribution per unit of network capacity taken up. And on those two important measures, which are perhaps the most important comparators, our prepaid business performs as well as our postpaid business. And it's \u2013 so it's very fascinating. CLVs are less on a per customer basis, so it takes more customers to get there and we have more customers. The last point is that we are simultaneously the largest and the fastest growing in the space, that's very difficult to achieve. And it's a testament to the team, to the model. We're very, very proud of that business and how it contributes. John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: For three years, we have separately and simultaneously grown both. And I think what you've seen is companies that slipped one way or the other, so AT&T had a reasonable prepaid growth of subscribers last quarter, but they haven't added a postpaid subscriber since Q2 of 2014. And then you have Sprint who over heavy focuses on thinking that if they post some postpaid numbers that the world will come to a stop and love them is really bleeding on the prepaid side, and now figuring out how to pivot. It's difficult, but proven that you can do both at the same time and remember the ARPUs, especially at MetroPCS are very profitable and very strong and very consistent. So did you have \u2013 was there a second part? J. Braxton Carter - T-Mobile US, Inc.: There was \u2013 there was a second part just on the 480p optimization and the benefits that's delivered to the network and we said day one when we activated Binge On, it was about 10%. It's probably in the 12% to 14% range today. I don't have the precise math in my head, but somewhere in that range. So, that's great. And I think obviously that experience has been a tremendous one, as Mike outlined for our customers, a 480p delivery to their phones is appropriate and delivers a great viewing experience, but obviously, the video optimization is a great benefit to the network. But as I talked at the beginning on one of the earlier questions, we've been adding a very large volume of capacity to the network through all the different means I outlined over the last 12 months to 18 months. So, a good place to be and video optimization is there, and as Mike outlined, we're going to have an HD option there for customers too. Matthew Niknam - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. Thank you very much. Nils Paellmann - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Well, thanks everyone for tuning in. We look forward to speaking to you again next quarter. And again, a happy Valentine's Day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the T-Mobile U.S. fourth quarter and full year 2016 conference call. If you have any further questions, you may contact the Investor Relations and media departments. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect, and have a pleasant day.",

Operator : Good afternoon, and welcome to the T-Mobile US first quarter 2017 earnings call. Following opening remarks, the earnings call will be open for questions via the conference line, Twitter, Facebook, or text message. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Nils Paellmann, Head of Investor Relations for T-Mobile US. Please go ahead, sir. Nils Paellmann - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Yes. Thank you. Welcome to T-Mobile's first quarter 2017 earnings call. With me today are John Legere, our President and CEO; Braxton Carter, our CFO; and other members of the senior leadership team. Let me read the disclaimer. During this call, we'll make projections and statements about the future performance of the company, which are based on current expectations and assumptions. Our Form 10-K includes risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Reconciliations between GAAP and the non-GAAP results we discuss on this call can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website. With that, let me turn it over to John Legere, please. John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Okay. Good afternoon, everyone. This is John Legere, who forgot to put his mic on. Welcome to T-Mobile's first quarter 2017 Un-carrier earnings call and open Twitter conference. We're coming to you live from beautiful sunny Bellevue, Washington. We are just about to mark our four-year birthday and anniversary as TMUS as a public company. And as many of you recall, we closed our deal with MetroPCS on May 1, 2013. This is just a few months after we declared war on the status quo and launched the Un-carrier. We spent the last four-plus years fighting for consumers and forcing a stupid broken arrogant industry to change. Customers have responded and this has yielded results beyond even our own expectations. I'm very proud of the success that the T-Mobile and MetroPCS teams have been able to achieve. It's nothing short of incredible. Now that trend continues with our first quarter results. You have the release and the Factbook, but I want to quickly cover a few highlights for the quarter. In a quarter where we forced everyone to follow our move to unlimited, T-Mobile kicked ass. We delivered industry-leading customer growth and financial results that the competition can only dream of. Our customer growth numbers remain strong with 1.1 million total net adds in Q1. By the way that marks four straight years or 16 quarters of adding more than 1 million every single quarter. 914,000 of those nets were branded postpaid customer additions and it looks like it will be the fifth quarter in a row that T-Mobile comes in at the head of the pack, now that the other guys they have possibly figured out, the tablets aren't the answer. We added 798,000 branded postpaid phone customers. That's 13 quarters in a row that we've led the entire industry in postpaid phone nets. We estimate that we captured over 250% of the industry's postpaid phone growth this quarter. And, as you've seen, Verizon reported a disaster of a quarter with nearly 300,000 postpaid phone losses, despite all the hype around the launch of their unlimited plan. Ouch, that's really got to be embarrassing after all that mic-dropping. Well, we'll get to their network in a minute. But back on competitive share, T-Mobile took home an estimated 29% of the industry's share of postpaid gross adds in Q1, our best result in three years. And when we look at the share of port-ins or SOPI for customers with a 24-month tenure, T-Mobile combined with MetroPCS was averaging around 35% for the quarter and even had a week where we were north of 40%. Okay. I've got to touch on porting ratios. We've now had four years in a row, every quarter with positive postpaid porting ratios overall, and more than three years positive against every major carrier. In the first quarter, we killed it with improvements in postpaid porting ratios against every carrier, both year over year and sequentially. On the prepaid front, we added 386,000 new customers driven by a continued strong performance at MetroPCS. I should note that prepaid ARPU reached a record of $38.53, up 2.5% year over year. Now churn. We're seeing record lows here. Branded postpaid phone churn in Q1 was down 15 basis points year over year and 10 basis points sequentially to a new record low of 1.18%. Our financial results are fantastic too. In Q1, we delivered 11% year-over-year growth in total and service revenues and 21% in adjusted EBITDA, excluding the spectrum gains this quarter and last year. These results are due to investments we've made and will continue to make in our network, which brings me to the auction. Just two weeks ago, the FCC announced the results of the groundbreaking 600-MHz incentive auction. This auction was the first of its kind and generated billions for broadcasters and U.S. taxpayers. It was a massive undertaking, so I want to offer my congratulations and thanks to the folks over at the FCC. The auction outcome is a huge win for consumers and for T-Mobile. We secured a nationwide footprint that will enable us to bring low-band spectrum to consumers across every single inch of the country. This is a game changer for T-Mobile and sets the stage for us to continue our momentum moving forward. As I'm sure many of you read, T-Mobile acquired a nationwide average of 31 MHz of 600-MHz low-band spectrum covering 325 million POPs for $7.99 billion. Why is this important? For several reasons. First, we quadrupled our low-band holdings and now have an average of 41 MHz nationwide. This covers 100% of the U.S. and Puerto Rico. This gives T-Mobile significantly more low-band per customer than any of our peers and nearly TRIPLE the low-band spectrum per postpaid customer versus Verizon. This new low-band is going to allow us to compete in every single corner of the country while improving the overall network and in-building coverage for all of our customers. Second, this historic auction was so significant to our overall holdings that we increased our total nationwide spectrum by 39%. T-Mobile now has more spectrum per customer than the duopoly and over 50% more than Verizon. This means more uncongested wide-opened wireless freeway lanes for T-Mobile customers. Third, contrary to what you may be hearing, we will start to put this new spectrum into use this year. We expect spectrum covering 1 million square miles to be clear in 2017, enabling Neville Ray and his team to commence service before year-end. We kick started the ecosystem more than a year ago, and as a result, Ericsson and Nokia have already announced radio equipment availability and Qualcomm has announced chipsets on the handsets, we will have Samsung devices by the holiday season and other OEMs are making plans. Clearly, by year-end it will be a differentiated experience for our customers. Now, let give you an update on our LTE build and 700 MHz deployment. Our 4G LTE network covers 314 million people today and we have 321 million in our sights for year-end 2017. Our network remains the fastest in America, with download speeds of 25.6 megabits and upload speeds of 12.2 megabits. We've been the fastest for 13 quarters in a row, and by the way, the gap between us and our competitors increased last quarter. And something we'll talk about is that interestingly, since launching unlimited, the Verizon network has gotten noticeably slower, slower than even AT&T in recent weeks, which shows once again we have the only network built for unlimited. I guess we now know why Fran was saying Verizon customers didn't need unlimited plans before he left. He knew the Verizon network couldn't handle it. Our deployment of extended-range LTE on the 700 MHz A-Block spectrum band is essentially complete with the launch of Chicago last week. And you just heard me say that Neville will start rolling out 600 MHz spectrum by the end of this year. This network expansion is providing us with the unique ability to grow our distribution footprint by 30 million to 40 million POPs. We plan to open an additional 3,000 stores this year, roughly 1,500 T-Mobile and an increase of 500 over our original goal, and 1,500 MetroPCS stores. This program will continue to ramp in the second quarter. So putting that all together, the new spectrum and the work we're doing on our current spectrum sets, sets the stage for continued momentum and the future growth of T-Mobile. We can take the Un-carrier to every corner of the United States, bringing real choice and competition to wireless customers in every part of the country. This is going to be fun, and we can't wait to get started. As we celebrate four years as a public company with a kick-ass quarter and we look back at the trends, the story is clear. It's been four years that T-Mobile has ported positive postpaid every quarter against the industry and four years that we've added more than 1 million nets per quarter. I've never been more confident about the future of T-Mobile as we look ahead to the remainder of 2017 and beyond. Braxton will update you on our 2017 guidance in detail, but let me just highlight the big picture. We're increasing our guidance for branded postpaid net customer additions to a range of 2.8 million to 3.5 million, up from the original guidance of 2.4 million to 3.4 million. At the same time, we are maintaining our financial guidance of strong underlying EBITDA growth, solid CapEx to support our network build, and a strong 3-year expected ramp of free cash flow. Now let me hand it over to our CFO, Braxton Carter, for more financial highlights and the details of our 2017 guidance. Braxton? J. Braxton Carter - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Hey. Thanks, John. And I'm so excited to share, once again, outstanding financial results. Let me give a quick snapshot of our excellent financial results and then details on our 2017 guidance. Let's start with the financial results for the first quarter. Our customer growth continues to translate into strong financial growth, as we delivered industry-leading metrics once again. Service revenues grew by 11% year over year and adjusted EBIDTA grew by 21% excluding spectrum gains this year and last year. The adjusted EBITDA margin excluding spectrum gains expanded to 36%, up from 33% a year ago. EBITDA benefited from strong cost discipline, as both cost of service and SG&A showed operating leverage, even as T-Mobile is expected to capture over 250% of the industry's postpaid phone growth in the quarter. As a percentage of service revenues, cost of services declined by 240 basis points and SG&A by 150 basis points year over year. Free cash flow improved by almost $0.5 billion to $185 million in the first quarter of 2017 from a loss of $310 million in the first quarter of 2016. Net cash from operating activities increased by two-thirds year over year. The improvement in free cash flow occurred despite higher cash CapEx, which increased to $1.5 billion as a result of front-end loaded CapEx in order to finish the rollout of our 700 MHz A-Block spectrum and a higher paydown of accounts payable both sequentially and year over year. Earnings per share came in at $0.80 in the first quarter compared to $0.56 in the first quarter of 2016. EPS in the first quarter of 2017 benefited from a $37 million spectrum gain and an income tax benefit due to a reduction in the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets in certain state jurisdictions, resulting in an effective tax rate of minus 15% for the first quarter. We currently expect the effective tax rate for the remainder of 2017 to be in the range of 36% to 38%. And of course, we have NOLs that take us well into 2020. The spectrum gain and the income tax benefit had a combined impact of $0.32 on Q1 EPS. The improvement in year-over-year EPS occurred despite a large spectrum gain contributing $0.46 per share last year. On a like-for-like basis, excluding the spectrum gains and the income tax benefit, EPS increased by $0.38 year over year, from $0.10 to $0.48. Branded postpaid ARPU of $47.53 in the first quarter grew by 2.9% year over year. We expect ARPU will continue to be generally stable from full year 2016 to full year 2017, with some quarterly variation driven primarily by the actual migration ramp to T-Mobile ONE, including taxes and fees. In terms of customer quality, we saw stable to improving trends in the quarter. Total bad debt expense and losses from sale of receivables were $188 million or 1.96% of total revenue compared to $173 million or 2% I n the first quarter of 2016, even with a customer base that grew by over 7 million from the first quarter of 2016. As a percent of total revenues, the 1.96% reported this quarter was a record low quarter for a first quarter. Now let me get to 2017 guidance. Our target for branded postpaid net customer additions is 2.8 million to 3.5 million, which is an increase from our original guidance range of 2.4 million to 3.4 million. We will continue to update guidance as the actual quarterly results warrant over the remaining quarters of the year. You guys know the playbook. On a side note, as already mentioned last quarter, we expect wholesale net additions to be negative in 2017, as our MVNO partners deemphasize Lifeline in favor of higher-ARPU customer categories. This is exactly what happened in the first quarter, with wholesale net customer losses of 158,000. Despite the potential decline in customers, we expect growth in total wholesale revenue and margins this year. For adjusted EBITDA, our target range of $10.4 billion to $10.8 billion unchanged from the prior guidance range. Our EBITDA target includes expected leasing revenues of $0.8 billion to $0.9 billion, again unchanged from last quarter. First quarter leasing revenues were $324 million. We expect leasing revenues to decline in future quarters in line with the annual guidance. As disclosed in our year-end 2016 earnings material, we also made one accounting change in 2017 in line with all of our big four competitors. We included imputed interest associated with EIP receivables within revenue for us in other revenues, which is included in adjusted EBITDA. The impact from this accounting change is expected to be approximately $200 million to $300 million in 2017 compared to $248 million in 2016. We restated the comparable quarters in 2016 accordingly. The first quarter impact was $62 million. We target cash CapEx of $4.8 billion to $5.1 billion in 2017 excluding capitalized interest, again, unchanged from prior guidance. Finally, we expect free cash flow, defined as net cash provided by operating activities minus cash CapEx, to increase at a three-year CAGR of 45% to 48% from full-year 2016 to full-year 2019, again, unchanged from prior guidance. During the same period, we expect the underlying net cash provided by operating activities to increase at a CAGR of 15% to 18%. When modeling free cash flow for 2017, please be aware that cash interest payments will be elevated compared to 2016 for two reasons. First, the additional net debt as a result of the auction. Secondly, the payment of significant one-time call premiums due to calling selected call for bonds with higher interest rates. Calling these bonds will result in significant NPV savings over the life of the debt instruments, but will increase cash interest payments in the second quarter of 2017 to $0.7 to $0.8 billion, including call premiums of $238 million. For comparison, first quarter interest payments amounted to $495 million, including $29 million in call premiums. For the full year, we expect cash interest expense, including call premiums of $267 million of $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion compared to the $1.7 billion in 2016. Excluding the call premiums, the normalized run rate for the year will be $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion. You can see the significant changes and the work on the capital structure paying major dividends for us. Now let's get to your questions. You can ask questions via phone, text message, or via Twitter or Facebook. We'll start with a question on the phone. Operator, first question please. Operator : We will go first to Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, guys, thanks. I guess two quickly if I can. First with 3,000 stores to be built this year, 1,500 of them post-paid, and the low band coverage expansion. How should we expect your gross add share to ramp over the next couple of years? Should we be looking for that ratably or delayed a little bit? And then second, Neville, can you talk about the process for clearing 600 specs from across the 1,000 POPs, and how much of your markets that are not covered with low band today will be taken care of by that one million in the next year? Thanks, guys. Neville R. Ray - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Perfect. Mike, do you want to start. G. Michael Sievert - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Yes. So let me start by saying a big piece of the strategy as we expand geographically, as we expand segments, is to allow our gross add share to continue to grow, to keep pace with our growing company. If you think about it, as we grow, even as we hit historically low churn rates, there's the opportunity to churn off more customers. And so, as we penetrate prime consumer families in the suburbs, as we go after businesses, and as we expand geographically, those are opportunities to continue taking share of the market. It's kind of interesting to stop and note as the premise of your question suggests that all this ass-kicking we've been doing in the industry taking well over 100% of the growth is in a world where we're only competing in two-thirds to three-quarters of the country. That's why we're expanding stores and networks so rapidly, so that we can participate geographically, but also that we can go after segments that have been hesitant around T-Mobile in the past. I'm going to add as we go over \u2013 Phil, I know you know this, but I want to add it for other peoples' benefits, is we put out in the release that we already had 29% postpaid share of gross adds this quarter, which I think is a little bit surprising. It's as high as we've been almost ever. And the share of port-ins was 35% with MetroPCS and as high as 40%. Now this store count, I think this is where, especially when I heard Comcast announce their distribution plans and how close customers are to their 500 retail stores. We started this year with 9,000 approximately MetroPCS stores, and we're moving that to 10,500. And we started with approximately 4,000 Magenta stores, and we'll move to 5,500. That's 16,000 presences, doors. And so far, the other status is, you know, the year is about a third done, and we're about a third done. The pace at which we're adding stores is historic. And I know there was one day, a couple of weeks ago that we opened 90 doors on that day. So it's very historic and it's a big change. And that is such a great understanding to lay this 600 MHz win on top of, because in the same way that Neville will announce how he has got a huge jumpstart on creating that ecosystem, we have a huge jumpstart on creating the retail presence that we'll go with serving these customers. But Neville, you want to go into the clearing? Neville R. Ray - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Yes, absolutely. Well, let me start with saying there couldn't be anybody more delighted than me with the motherload of spectrum we just succeeded in securing. Just to repeat once that our spectrum holdings increased 39%. That's quite an event for any company in the wireless industry. So while Braxton often calls me the happiest CTO, well, I'm the even happier CTO today. Phil, it's not just about acquiring the spectrum, to your question, Phil, it's about how quickly can we clear. And obviously, we've been doing a ton of work before this auction. We even kicked into gear and started well over a year ago. And the good news is from a clearance perspective that there are many areas of the country where they're actually clear today and all broadcasters have announced their plans to exit their licenses within 2017. So our conservative estimate on the information we've secured and put together to-date is that's north of 1 million square miles in the U.S. So a lot of geography for us to run at. We've obviously been feeding the ecosystem with radio equipment, chipsets, and John referenced in his opening comments we can now \u2013 we're delighted to announce we'll have 600 MHz handsets within the year. I think that's a huge surprise for most folks out there that not only come in clear spectrum, build spectrum, launch spectrum that we can get our customers starting to use the spectrum inside 2017. And then the last part of your question was about so what does this mean for the areas where we don't have low-band today? But just to reiterate with the Chicago launch last week, our low-band spectrum holdings now reached 269 million people in the U.S. so 99% of the licensed POPs we have on the 700 MHz. And clearly, our first target is to make sure the areas where we haven't successfully launched low-band to-date, those areas will be the ones that we first take care of. So more details to come on that, Phil, as we work through the next two months to three months, but we are running very, very hard and we've actually already we're into pre-deployment phases in some parts of the country, but we'll map out the exact cities and where we're going and what our geography looks like as we move through the next couple of months. Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Neville, can I follow up really quickly? We get pushed back that the 600 band will be hard to get into some handsets because you're the only one using it, not just in the U.S. but in many parts of the globe. Is that going to be an issue at all for you? Neville R. Ray - T-Mobile US, Inc.: No, we don't think so at all, Phil. I mean 600 is a band that's actually starting to build popularity globally and of course it's going to happen here in the U.S., not just with T-Mobile but with other providers. And this is for us, I mean we did exactly this with the AWS band going back five years, six years ago. Most carriers, most operators, including T and Verizon sat back, we charged through, we cleared the band in record time, even without FCC mandated clearance periods, anything approaching what's in place to-date with the 39 months. And so we've got a ton of experience on how to go at this. And look at where AWS today is. That's the primary band for LTE services across the United States, and it was us that kind of drove the clearance in the handset ecosystem in there when you go back in time. So delighted that we can have 600 MHz handsets in year, I think folks really understand and see what the opportunity is with 600 MHz, the fact that it can reach so many places and the swap of it we have and others have, right. We did land 45% of the auction proceeds, but there's a lot of other 600 MHz. So we'll drive the ecosystem. We're very comfortable doing it. Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks Neville. Neville R. Ray - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Yes. Operator : We'll go next to Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks very much. Good afternoon. John, I think on CNBC you touched on some of the porting numbers. Can you just update us on where we stand now after the unlimited offer is getting refreshed by Verizon and others? And maybe just touch on prepaid. Obviously, we have the late tax season, some competition. How should we think about prepaid getting pushed from Q1 into Q2? Thanks. John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Okay. On the postpaid porting, we finished the quarter about 1.89. That's up from 1.53 last quarter and, round numbers, that's about 2.3 with AT&T, 1.7 with Verizon, and about 1.6 with Sprint. And by the way, with Verizon and AT&T, those are postpaid porting ratios that take it back to places they haven't been since 2014. And Sprint has consistently now moved up to those kinds of levels. From the standpoint of this quarter, which is certainly too early to tell, we are positively porting still, once again, with every one of the others. I think the best way to think about what we saw with Verizon is we had about four days in Q1 of negative porting with them after their announcement. And certainly the 1.7 that was the quarterly number could have been a lot worse for them, but we really haven't seen much impact from AT&T and Sprint's plan so, so far, that's kind of where we stand, positive again versus everybody. And on the prepaid side I think we had a number of things. That 386,000 prepaid nets driven, as I would call it, heavily, heavily by MetroPCS as we're kind of deemphasizing Magenta prepaid. There was some delay through the tax season and probably some competitive activity amongst others by Boost that we did see. What we're most impressed with that we worked very hard on, is not just 386,000 prepaid nets, but record high ARPUs of $38.53 which certainly suggests that we are managing the prepaid side of the business very aggressively and very profitably. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Okay. Operator : We'll go next to John Hodulik with UBS. John Christopher Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks. John, I know you can't talk specifics going into the expiration of the anti-collusion rules on Thursday, but can you give us a sense for how you would frame the situation going into Thursday and sort of how T-Mobile may fit into the sort of broader equation? John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Yes. I think \u2013 and I can comment especially because my views are consistent with what I've shared in prior periods before. But you're right, on anything specific I'll have to defer. I was just on CNBC and I kind of outlined a way that people should think about what's going on. And first of all, we should be clear that there are strategic possibilities between wireless companies, cable players, adjacent industries, Amazon, Internet players, that should be thought about, because they drive great value for shareholders and also new opportunities for customers. So there definitely are some things that are intuitively obvious. Second is, none of them are being talked about and there's this huge pent-up energy, because it's been over a year since people could have conversations. Thirdly, there are some players who \u2013 I'm not bashing \u2013 but they have been clear that they need to do something, whether it be Dish or Sprint or, I would submit, Comcast or others, they need to do something to complete their hand. And then there's a general feeling of enthusiasm that the new administration under President Trump could be more favorable for the opportunities that exist. So when you put all that together, what I look about from T-Mobile is I had hoped and strategized with my team that as this period ensues, we would be exactly where we are, which is a brand who's strongest in the industry, whose net promoter scores are higher than ever, whose team is executing on full cylinders, who has not exhausted the potential growth and has 45% to 48% three-year CAGR on cash. Now we then enter into this period where we can, especially with the win in the low-band auction, we can be highly successful and will continue for both our customers and shareholders. However, there are things that we would be interested in taking a look at to understand if you can do both. So the inorganic and organic possibilities for the company are tremendous and it's great to enter those kind of periods, not from a hostage standpoint. But we are interested in looking at some of the possibilities. John Christopher Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thanks. Operator : And we'll go next to Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson. Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC : Hi. Thank you. John, I wonder if you could comment a little bit on the announcements that Comcast made about launching their own MVNO service with Verizon and how you think that will work out given the unlimited environment that you've created and what impact, if any, you think that will have on the way \u2013 the market dynamics that you compete in? John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Yes, I think Comcast's announcement was the biggest non-announcement ever in the history of the wireless industry that was built up over time. And I would have to say, it's pleasant to me to see that AT&T and Verizon don't have a corner on the market of arrogance because they showed huge arrogance about the ability to come into an industry, start by only offering service mostly to employees in their home territories, which by the way doesn't include New York and LA, force players to WiFi without any real handoff between WiFi and LTE, expect that Verizon as an MVNO will be their source of economics in an industry that's highly competitive, and have 500 points of distribution, at the same time that they are by far the most hated corporation on the planet, who will go into their own customer base with a great proposition. Hey, I know you hate me from this hostage I've held you in the cable industry, but I have a great idea. Why don't we offer you the opportunity to buy wireless services from us as well, and by the way, for that opportunity of dropped calls and missed handoffs and driving 15 miles to get you capabilities, we will price to you higher than T-Mobile or the industry is. So I think it's a charade, and I think pretty clearly at some point if they're serious about this game, they're going to need owner economics. And for now the only positive news for them is that Verizon is melting down in such a fashion that it seems to me possible that the player that could have been created by the two most hated companies coming together that I previously called Vericast could possibly now become Comizon because they need each other. So I hope that answers your \u2013 I have no concerns at all about this, and I think their non-announcement was one of the most exciting events for me in Q1. Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC : John, if I could just follow up with one thing, one of the things they have done that perhaps is more interesting is they seem to be targeting what is clearly a minority of customers in their pay per gigabyte plan, which probably isn't what most customers want, but maybe a small segment. Is that something that's interesting enough that despite your unlimited positioning, you might consider doing the same kind of thing if it shows some success? John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Listen, it's back to the future. It's confusing, it's expensive, nobody understands what it is. It's Project Fi under a different name. So again, it's probably an idea they came up with in real time for big monolithic corporations that made sense before the world had completely gone to unlimited. So I don't know if you want to comment on that, Mike. I think it speaks for itself. And I think even you're trying to find a bone to throw them. The bone to throw them is that they're arrogant, they're going to fail miserably in this industry, and at some point they will try to move to some sort of a consolidation to get owners economics. Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC : Thanks, John. John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: You're welcome. Operator : We'll go next to Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays. Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you very much. John, I was wondering. How should we think about your go-to-market strategy from here? Some carriers have suggested that unlimited in its current form is unsustainable. Do you think that that's the case, or is there willingness to trade the prospect for rising ARPU levels for further share gains? In other words, how do you think about the direction of pricing to go from these levels? John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Yes, I guess there are a couple things. So that was certainly Fran Shammo's position as he left the business, and I think they hiccupped in the wake of him leaving to bowling (36:45) Verizon, I'm sure you're talking about Verizon as the main leader, not thinking that unlimited is sustainable. Let me give you an interesting statoid, which is that we had for the 13th quarter in a row the fastest 4G LTE network at just over 25 megabits of speed this quarter and widening our advantage, both on the download and the upload versus Verizon. But an interesting thing has happened since Verizon announced unlimited, and it won't show up until you get to the next quarter's results. Verizon's network has slowed down 14%, and they are now slower on the 4G LTE side than AT&T. And in the same time the speeds on our network have grown 10%. So when we say there's only one network that's built for unlimited, it's clearly ours, so I don't agree. We see stable ARPU. We see good monetization opportunities, and we do see that our competitors don't have the ability to do this or, most importantly, the desire. Our position is very clear. We sell a monthly subscription to the Internet, and the Internet was meant to be consumed in an unlimited fashion, taxes and fees included. And that's something that they're going to have to swallow or they're going to continue to erode at the same way that they have. Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And then, if I may follow up on a prior question on the structure of the industry, what is your take on the current regulatory environment? And do you see any shifts suggesting a changing tide when it comes to what potential combinations and permutations could be supported? And if you had a wish list of assets that could help accelerate your current trajectory, what would they include? John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Again, two things to think about. One is \u2013 and I'm bringing up an oldie but goodie. All content will go to the Internet, all Internet will be viewed mobile, which has been updated to all content will go to the mobile Internet. We are the mobile Internet. So clearly, when I look ahead, as everybody else looks ahead, nobody has the full portfolio of capabilities to give customers access to the mobile Internet and all the content that they want, so I think about that. I also know, you can always have more scale in the any big fixed asset industry. Now I do feel that the old lore of the four wireless player market, it's dead. It's gone. So did Comcast enter or not? How long are we going to play that game? Is Google in or not? Will Amazon come in at some point in day? Even go the other way. Is Sprint still in or not? And so there are a tremendous different set of possibilities for an industry that will be different. And yes, I like \u2013 I've been very clear. I can't talk about specifics. But even before the auction, I've always told you, I think DISH has access to good content and spectrum. I think Sprint has an awful lot of scale and a good customer base, and something that would be interesting to take a look at. I think that the United States will ultimately converge, and I do believe that a national footprint around cable and wireless needs to be created at some point. So that's topographic. From a standpoint of Washington, in anything that I would think of possibly wanting to do with T-Mobile that included some other player, I'm very comfortable that we could make a case that it's in the best interest of customers, of the country, of the industry, versus the alternatives of the status quo. So I look forward to it. There are some intuitively obvious things that could take place. Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks so much for the incremental color. Operator : We'll go next to Michael Rollins with Citi. Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks, two questions. First, what's the average monthly data usage for your postpaid and prepaid customers, and how fast is that growing? And then second, are there initiatives that we should be mindful of that can create step-function changes in your cost structure over the next one to two years? John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Okay. We'll let Neville take the first piece. And if he does it in less than an hour and a half, we can have Braxton and Mike talk about the cost structure because there are a significant amount. Neville R. Ray - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Hey, Mike. No, I'll be quick. So we don't disclose the monthly postpaid customer data volumes. Obviously, they've been rising, I can tell you, and we do disclose this, that annually traffic is moving about 40% \u2013 is growing about 40% year on year. That will give you an indication of how much growth is out there. We're a little heavier than the rest of the pack. Obviously, as John referenced, we've been doing a great job on unlimited for many years. And so you see industry reported averages in the four to five gigabit per month range, and so they're pretty accurate. John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Can you talk about \u2013 both of you want to talk about \u2013 there are some great ones. G. Michael Sievert - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Yeah. And just to be clear on that usage piece, we do believe, as Neville said, that our customers use the most mobile Internet of any customer base in this industry. And that's in a world where we're still, despite that, the fastest connection in the industry. I think that's worth noting. It shows that our network was built for the kind of capacity that our customers demand. Hey, actually, Amir got into this a little bit too with regard to the pricing and the ARPU and where things are headed. There's another side to this, which is our focus on radically simplifying what we offer with T-Mobile ONE with taxes and fees included has another advantage. Not only does it allow us to be competitive in the marketplace and do what we do as a brand, give customers what they're looking for, but it allows us to tackle the inside of the company and simplify our operations at the same time. We're not making very specific outlooks for you, but inherent in that very optimistic operating cash flow number of 15% to 18% and the overall CAGR of 45% to 48% is a business that's getting more efficient over time. And efficiency comes from the radical simplification of our offers and from being able to tackle every part of the operation from how we handle retail, how much of our customer service is handled by human beings. And imagine being able to be twice as big as we are down the road with this current team handling the capacity. There's a huge unlock there. And so we're really excited about the potential. J. Braxton Carter - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Yes. Let me add. Just think about customers calling half of their frequency that they do today, think about in a retail fleet activations occurring in half the time or less. We've been making a major investment multiyear in the infrastructure that's going to enable just that. And you couple that with the simplification and what Un-carrier is all about and then you look at our evolution to digital and fulfilling digital and what that can do to our cost structure. There's a lot of goodness. Now we spent the last four years driving a tremendous amount of cost out of the business. You're seeing tremendous scale in the network side of business. You're starting to see it in SG&A, but there is absolutely more to come which is just all upside not only for our cash flows and our profitability, but it's upside from a growth standpoint too. Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you. John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: And as we go to the next question, underneath what you just talked about, some of the most exciting parts about what we're about over the next few years which is why we gave the free cash flow guidance that we have given. Again, it's important to note that it's been since 2014 that any of the wireless carrier has grown service revenue on a year-over-year basis, and we've been growing, as you know, double digits, so we get a lot more market that we can take and at the same time, tremendous amounts of opportunity to remove costs from the business. And removing costs from the business while you're growing comes up to a very exciting result as opposed to being something that you need to do to survive. And the combination of where we are in the scaling towards free cash flow is \u2013 it's very exciting possibilities for the company. Is there anything here on the \u2013 outside of the 27,000 Roger Cheng notes that are coming in? Roger, great job on all of your tweets. Let's continue down. We'll pick a couple on the Twitter, but operator, let's take the next one on the phone. Operator : We'll go next to Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks for taking the question, and obviously, everyone's doing the mental gymnastics now to think about all the scenarios that could unfold. But unless or until we actually see you guys do something, you obviously have to execute against a base case. And so, Braxton, my question for you is what is the company's capital allocation policy going forward from here? We've seen what you spent in the auction. Where are you comfortable from a leverage standpoint? Do you think you need to preserve certain amounts of balance sheet capacity for additional spectrum purchases or other growth investments? And where would you need to be as an organization if you're comfortable maybe expanding capital allocation to return cash to shareholders? J. Braxton Carter - T-Mobile US, Inc.: You know what, Brett, it's really exciting. We're actually have that in our scope of vision. You look at the CAGR that we put out with free cash flow, it implies a minimum of $10 billion of true cash generation over this three-year time horizon. When you look at other available spectrum opportunities, there really isn't that much out there right now. All the rest of the 700 MHz is owned and being operated by other carriers. We have a situation where there will be a very significant 5G auction coming up with over 150 MHz of high-frequency spectrum. But that's still going to be a ways off, and pretty much in the middle to the latter part of the time horizon that we're talking about. And our capitalization policy has been really clear. We really target leverage to be between 3 times and 4 times. And we look at it after taking out the non-cash impact of leasing. We know that's just accounting geography. But what this implies, especially with our rapid growth and our rapid deleveraging that we're going to be approaching sub-3 times in the not-too-distant future. And without another potential source to create a higher return, we obviously would be looking at things that would return cash to our shareholders and I think it's a very effective strategy. Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And if you went down that road, would you most likely be thinking about share repurchases? Is it too soon to think about dividends? J. Braxton Carter - T-Mobile US, Inc.: The thing about the dividend, is another form of permanent debt. Look at the true cash flow of Verizon and AT&T after dividend, I mean it's a fraction of the true cash that's generated by the business. We probably would initially look at buybacks and who knows, ultimately there could be a dividend in place. Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great, thanks for taking the question. John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Okay. Before we go to the next question with the operator, I am going to grab a couple of these that are coming in on the T-Mobile IR, Stephen Bubowski (49:00) that is T-Mobile staying concentrated in the wireless business are looking to do the kind of diversification others are doing. Let's be clear, the other guys are not trying to diversify, they are dying, and they are virtually exiting the wireless business and attempting to create new revenue streams to replace the ones they have. AOL, Yahoo!, Go90, these are new businesses along with AT&T now trying to buy Time Warner. This is eroding wireless businesses and new businesses meet. We right now are the wireless business and we are not trying to diversify out of the wireless business. The core business of what we do is wireless, we are open to looking at ways to enhance that wireless businesses capabilities to customers. But in no way are we trying to kind of exit the way that the other guys are. Diana Goebbert (49:56), this is a quick one to give to Neville. Plans for LTE-U on 600 MHz, what about carrier agg, 256 QAM et cetera, will those come at launch or later? Neville R. Ray - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Yes. So a couple of pieces in there, there was a couple of other questions too. So just LTE-U real quick. So first handset with the launch of the Galaxy 8, that's our first LTE-U capable handset, so delighted to see that move into the marketplace and we started deployment. So in a few locations now across the U.S. we are starting to turn-up LTE-U, there will be more of that as we move through 2017, but we are still doing a lot of outdoor testing, trialing. Long story short, 2018, 2019, LTE-U and into LAA is a big deal in terms of capacity and capability for wireless networks going forward. So again, we are very happy to be at the tip of the spear driving ecosystem on equipment on both the radio and the handsets. On 600 MHz, I think common theme here about carrier agg. And yes, I mean obviously the first thing to run out on 600 MHz will be low-band with aggregation with mid-bands and then as we move through into 2018 looking at aggregating to low bands. Not as easy as low to mid, but all of those combinations will be working through standardization as we move into the latter part of 2017 and early 2018. John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Okay. Let's slightly celebrate the fact that Neville talked about LTE-U in less than 45 minutes. Neville R. Ray - T-Mobile US, Inc.: I'm trying to be quick today. John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Operator, can we have the next question on the phone? Operator : We'll go next to Jonathan Chaplin with New Street Research. Jonathan Chaplin - New Street Research LLP (US): Thanks, guys. Since Neville got through those ones so fast, well let give him a chance to speak again. So I'm curious why given your spectrum position compared to Verizon's, there isn't even a much wider gap between their network speeds and yours. How are they managing to maintain the performance they've got on this network given their assets and when do you think they hit the wall? Neville R. Ray - T-Mobile US, Inc.: That's a fun question, Jonathan, right it's a question of how long can they keep it up. And as John referenced, I mean as soon as they turned up their unlimited offering last quarter, we could start to see a fairly serious decline in their speeds and they started to dip below the AT&T levels and a big separation opening up with us. So where are those guys? I mean we talked about what we pulled down in the recent auction. I mean our total spectrum assets are about the same as Verizon's now with 1 MHz or 2 MHz less in terms of absolute spectrum owned. And when you look at spectrum per customer, my God, we're killing it now. And so you look forward and you say, what are those guys going to do? How are they going to sustain the offerings that they have in the marketplace let alone the unlimited thing they pushed forward into the market over the last month or so? It's pretty challenging. They've said they're going to build, not buy so they didn't want to buy too much spectrum. They wanted to build instead. I think their CEO announced 12,000 or 13,000 small cells. They've successfully put on air over the last, I don't know, three, four years. They've been working on that. We're about 15,000. We've got another 25,000 contracted. So I don't see a great densification story which has been the saving grace that Verizon has talked about seeming to appear very soon. So, Jonathan, I don't know what they do. They have the worst spectrum position per customer of all the wireless players in the U.S. and by a material difference now. So they have their challenges. That said, I mean, we're continuing to drive really, really hard to build greater capacity on our network and gap on in terms of speeds and performance as we go forward. Everything from LTE-U I touched on, all the work we've done on QAM, on 4x4 MIMO, we've got AWS-3 spectrum to roll out. There's a whole host of things we're doing. And of course we're the global leaders on VoLTE, 7% of our calls now on Voice-over-LTE allowing us to refarm at the fastest rate of anybody. If you think about our competition, especially Verizon in these terms, heavily loaded up on their legacy network with legacy technologies in CDMA and a real issue for those guys in Sprint too to get off of CDMA and into the VoLTE story. So re-farming, adding capacity, small cells, we have a ton of activity ongoing and now, of course, we have this motherload of spectrum to help fuel our growth going forward. So we're pretty excited about our position, and I think ultimately you have to ask the Verizon guys what is it they're going to go deal. Jonathan Chaplin - New Street Research LLP (US): Thanks, Neville. That's great. John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Operator, we're going to go to the next question. And I'm excited because the longer that Walter Piecyk is talking here, it's less time than he's embarrassing himself on Periscope. So can we take the next question? Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC : Thank you, John. Operator : Next we'll go to Walter Piecyk with BTIG. Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC : Thanks, John. I just want to take the opportunity to lobby to move our earnings reports back to the morning again from this afternoon. Are you guys trying to like imitate AT&T right now? John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: No. Actually, Walt, to be honest, you've never lived in Asia. I used to live in Asia and one of the lessons I learned in studying \u2013 in singing karaoke is when the worst singer goes, you go next and after Verizon announced their earnings, I couldn't wait any longer, so sorry. Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC : Well that could be positive for AT&T then for tomorrow. So a question for Neville. Neville, you'd been really voiced some good opinions on 2.5 gigahertz historically. I wonder if you can update us on those views on 2.5 gigahertz and whether it's useable with your current footprint, especially now with HPUE, if you had an opportunity to gain access to that spectrum in some shape or form? Neville R. Ray - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Sure. I shouldn't read the media, where I heard there's a bunch of it for sale or something today. Was that right? I'm not sure why I read it. Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC : I don't know about that, but there's obviously a number of different ways you could get your hands on that so. Just curious on what you think about its usability is. Neville R. Ray - T-Mobile US, Inc.: No, obviously there's a lot of spectrum there. I think the biggest news about the 2.5 gigahertz, the fact that not much of it is deployed by Sprint yet, has been the HPUE story where you get additional uplink benefit out of a handset solution. And I've seen discussion about how HPUE now kind of levels the playing field between 2.5 gigahertz and obviously more valuable and greater propagation spectrum in mid-band. I can tell you, I mean we're testing and checking into that Walt. The work that we've done with the now-released HPUE handsets, especially the LG G6, they show a fairly nominal improvement in HPUE devices coverage footprint. To give you some specifics, we drove a fairly large area in and around the Bellevue and Seattle here and the handsets were camping on the 2.5 gigahertz about 60% of the time and with an HPUE handset that number went to about 65%, which is far from the kind of 90%, 95% that's been talked about. So I'm sure they're doing work on optimizing. I think HPUE has some benefits for them, but I think it's going to be a far cry from leveling the playing field with mid-band spectrum. That said, there's a lot of it inside that company and clearly it's got use for capacity, it's got some interest around the 5G space. I naturally believe that 5G is going to roll across all spectrum brands. I don't believe that 2.5 gigahertz is the new low band of 5G. I mean, we're going to see 5G in low-band and mid-band and 2.5 gigahertz and 3.5 gigahertz and everywhere else. That's just a matter of time. I mean, so it's an interesting asset. I mean, I think HPUE helps. We haven't seen the results yet that would make us hugely excited about comparable values with mid-band, but we'll wait to see more. Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC : Okay. And then just one other on stores. It just seems like in the media, there's a lot of people talking about so much retail getting closed and like malls and everyone hurting on that front. It seems like an odd time to add a bunch of stores. I'm just curious what do you think is different about the wireless industry that your plan of expanding stores is the right strategy when it seems like retail in general is going the opposite way? G. Michael Sievert - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Hey, Walt, it's Mike. I've actually posted a piece on this on LinkedIn a couple of weeks ago, because it's an intriguing topic. We think generally the idea that digital has come along and is therefore rendering retail obsolete is a copout. It's up to retailers to create a retail experience in their category is that remains relevant to customers and digital changes what it takes to be relevant at retail. We're certainly doing that. In our industry, it's an industry built on trust and on helpfulness and we're building a retail future where customers can do an awful lot for themselves. As Braxton said, we expect the transactions to be faster. We expect some of the categories of transactions to be fewer. But when they come to us, they're coming to us for our knowledge and expertise. And that's what we're creating in our retail stores with people who are trained great, with great tools, with a revamped IT infrastructure, and with digital capabilities outside the store that are connected directly to the experience that people have inside the store. Because we see ultimately digital being an incredible complement to what happens at retail, at least in our industry and in our company versus a replacement to it. And frankly, that a lot of retailers are giving up, throwing their hands up, and closing down reflects a lack of imagination about how to take advantage of our digital future more than anything. Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC : Great, thank you. Neville R. Ray - T-Mobile US, Inc.: And don't confuse a retail store with a RadioShack outlet. Okay. Operator, next one. Operator : We'll go next to Colby Synesael with Cowen & Company. Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great, two if I may. Obviously, the unlimited and T-Mobile ONE offer had a huge impact on the marketplace. I'm just curious if you guys are envisioning any new Un-carrier type offers that we could see coming down the pipeline later this year. And do you think you need to have a \u2013 it involves some form of M&A, or things that you could do on your own? Thanks. John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Yes, let's remember that there have been 13 things that we've done that are all permanent and all meant to change the industry. And small things like international data roaming and music streaming and Binge On, on video stream, which is a big precursor to this, no contracts, Contract Freedom, et cetera. So the question obviously goes to is the industry all empty of pain points that need to be solved? And the answer is a gigantic no. I don't know how much we want to go through. I'd go as far as to say the quarter that we're in, before the quarter finishes we'll do another one. And if I announce the topical area that we think is gigantically poised for fixing, it may give away too much as to what the topic is. But there's one that we're working on that we'll do this quarter that is so intuitively obvious of a gigantic shortcoming of the wireless industry that we're going to attack it, and we're going to attack it soon. Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great, thank you. And if I could just slip one more in there. Churn, I'm just reading through your disclosures that you guys put up today. It seems like churn excluding the changes that were made in the third quarter in terms of taking out some of those Walmart subs was relatively flat on a year-over-year basis. Are we done seeing the churn improvement that we've seen for the last few years, or do you think that there's more that can be taken out? Thanks. G. Michael Sievert - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Yes, I think there's more opportunity left. If you think about it, our network aspiration is to create a network experience that's second to none. And we've spent a lot of this call laying out that we now have the resources necessary and the raw ingredients required to get that done. So we won't stop until our network experience is the best, is second to none in this industry. And we're a company already building incredible fame for treating customers right, putting them first. That's what the Un-carrier story has always been about and at a fair price. So that's a formula in our industry with a company that is totally committed to this industry, as John said, that I think has the opportunity ultimately to create a company that has the best churn profile in the industry. This happens step-wise, and over time there will be ebbs and flows in our journey towards that result, but that's our aspiration as a company. Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thank you. John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Okay. I'm going to go to the next question, but I'm flipping through some of the ones on the IR, and I do want to acknowledge one of the 700 from Roger Cheng, who said, so John Legere, thoughts on the AT&T deal to buy Time Warner. And I think I may have been clear about this. This is almost \u2013 it's almost irrelevant to us. It's an entirely new industry that AT&T is trying to go in adjacent to something that they've exited before. They have not added a postpaid customer since Q3 of 2014, which I think would be almost exactly when they bought DIRECTV. They've had service revenue declines for a long time, and they're trying to acquire their way into an entirely new industry. So I have limited to no thoughts on the AT&T deal. I'm going to ask the operator to go to the next question. And during this question, I am likely going to have to step out. The team can continue and take a few more questions. I'm going to do a live hit on Bloomberg TV, and this is when they want to do it. Okay. So, operator, you can take the next question. Operator : We'll go to Ric Prentiss with Raymond James. Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thanks, good afternoon. First question, the 269 million POPs that you covered today with low-band, I think John mentioned that with the auction you'll be at all 325 million POPs. Neville, you also mentioned given you have few months to lay out the details. But as we think about longer term, not trying to hold you to what you're going to do in 2017, but as we think out over the next three years, any reason to think you wouldn't build out to every corner, every inch of the market as was suggested you now have spectrum to? Neville R. Ray - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Hi, Rick. Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey. Neville R. Ray - T-Mobile US, Inc.: No reason. I think I'd say this though, we have some great roaming partners that we work with and those that continue to work with us and deliver a great LTE experience, and we've done that with sharing spectrum and other things over time. There are possibilities there, so we may not organically cover all of it. But what I will say is with or without roaming, we're going to make sure we deliver the right customer experience. And so that's what we're grounded in. That's what we need to go do, and we want to take that across the U.S. from coast to coast. So obviously, that's not going to happen in 2017 everywhere. But as we move through the next two to three years, the plan is to have the best. The lofty ambition from us seemed crazy three or four years ago is to have the best damn LTE network and into 5G network in the U.S. And we've now got the rural assets and capabilities to go do that in a way that we couldn't have talked about even two, three weeks ago. So exciting opportunity for us. And for us to pick up the volume of low-band spectrum, we have effectively the same amount, absolute amount of low-band spectrum as Verizon and AT&T does. And that low-band duopoly ownership defined the industry for so long in so many parts of the country, and now that lock is finally broken and the company that can go and unlock all that value for new customers and folks looking for T-Mobile and other T-Mobile value offering and simplicity across the nation, we're now in a position we can go fully do that. Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Can you... J. Braxton Carter - T-Mobile US, Inc.: I can pin us down on this year's aspiration, it's 321 million... Neville R. Ray - T-Mobile US, Inc.: 321 million. J. Braxton Carter - T-Mobile US, Inc.: POPs covered by the end of the year, including the traditional ILECs (1:06:36). J. Braxton Carter - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Hey John Atkin sent a text message in asking Mike about an update on B2B initiatives as well as click-to-brick. I think that's a good one. G. Michael Sievert - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Yes. So, John, it's great you asked about B2B. Q1 we quietly delivered the best quarter in our history in B2B, just like we told you we would be doing. It continues to grow as a percentage of our total nets. In fact, in Q1, it was highest percentage of our net add performance that it's ever been, and that's pretty obvious why. Business customers are really smart and do the work ahead of time to figure out, will the network meet the needs, will the company treat me right, does it have the right solutions and capabilities, and they test those things. And what's happened over the past few months is, when they test those things, they come to realize that the answer to that is yes. T-Mobile has a competitive offer on the network front, rapidly moving towards a superior offer, while at the same time providing the pricing, the solutions, the customer centricity that they're looking for. So we're really, really excited about what's happening there. Our team under Jon Freier and Mike Katz are killing it. On clicks-to-bricks, really interesting. This is an area \u2013 we talked about \u2013 both Braxton and I talked about our digital transformation and our digital future. And a big piece of that is having experiences online and mobile that translate into retail. And we're seeing all kinds of great things happening here. We're one of the first companies doing real live commerce with Facebook Messenger, and we're really excited to have built commerce activities into Facebook Messenger that people can redeem directly and ultimately at retail. We're doing messaging and handling both retail transactions and messaging care transactions using LivePerson, and those are things that we're really excited to be leading the industry on. We're also doing in-store fulfillment of online offers with our brand-new website and targeting those offers to customers. And we're really excited about what's happening there, both targeting directly and targeting through social media. So all kinds of exciting things happening along the themes that I talked about before of connecting the digital experience to the retail experience and having the two add to more than one plus one. Our team under Nick Drake is doing a fantastic job in that area. J. Braxton Carter - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Okay. Let's do the next question, Mike McCormack? Operator : Mike McCormack with Jefferies. Mike L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC : Hey, guys. Thanks. Braxton, maybe just a quick comment on ARPU trajectory and how we should be thinking about taxes and fees and what that might look like over the next year or so as far as ARPU goes. J. Braxton Carter - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Yes, so when we launched T-Mobile ONE, it was certainly accretive to ARPUs, but we knew at that point that the vision here was rapid, ultimate simplification by going to tax and fees inclusive. And looking at those two together, we really anticipate that we're going to be generally stable in the ARPU, or fairly flat. And we reaffirmed today what we've been saying the last couple of public sessions about this, is that when you look at ARPUs for full year 2016 to full year 2017, the expectation is generally stable. You will get some quarterly fluctuation based upon how migration ramps, et cetera, but we're really executing to that stable ARPU and it's deliberate. We get massive benefit out of scale. We're reinvesting in the customers. We're managing to a flat ARPU environment and unlocking the margin potential of this business as we continue to grow it. Mike L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC : Great, thanks. J. Braxton Carter - T-Mobile US, Inc.: You're welcome. Okay. Let's go to another call on the phone. Matt? Operator : Matthew Niknam with Deutsche Bank. Matthew Niknam - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, guys. Thank you for taking the questions. Just two, if I could? One follow-up on the last question on ARPU. Maybe, Braxton, can you talk about how much of the existing base has actually migrated to the new plans, including taxes and fees? And what guidance assumes just in terms of migration within the base? And then, secondly, on the competitive landscape, if you can talk about how that trended into the second quarter? And really just looking for any more specifics on porting ratios, John had mentioned you were positive quarter-to-date. Just want to see if we can get any detail on how that compares to the 1.89 in 1Q. Thanks. J. Braxton Carter - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Well, let me start and I'll hand it over to Mike. All we're selling now is T-Mobile ONE tax and fees inclusive, so all of our flow there \u2013 and there certainly is migrations. We haven't disclosed the migration aspect, but our expectations are fully embedded in all of the guidance that we've given and our expectations have been shown to be very realistic with what we've seen so far. But let me turn it over to Mike. G. Michael Sievert - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Yes. I mean, one way to think about it is similar if you've been following our journey for a few years, similar to when we moved to Simple Choice in 2013 and we started tracking for you our migration from Classic plans to Simple Choice. And we said ultimately we would fully penetrate the base and we did. We hit 95%, 96% essentially full penetration. And that's the journey we're going through again. We think that the era of the data bucket is over. The era of the rate plan is over. The Internet was meant to be unlimited and the mobile Internet is the Internet. That's our strategy. So you're going to see a step-wise movement through the base as we give people the kinds of offers and incentives that they need to move across, because we think it's going to free them and give them the very best experience and because we've built a network that can handle it. And this is an area that we think is not only right for customers, but strategically right for T-Mobile. J. Braxton Carter - T-Mobile US, Inc.: You know, here's an interesting Twitter question from Wireless Week. How much head start on 600 MHz, if any, are you expecting from your ERI deal last year, color on roll-out logistics? G. Michael Sievert - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Yes, so let me take it up a notch on this question. I mean so we've been \u2013 I talked earlier on about the work that we've done with our radio vendors, handset vendors, the traditional ecosystem. We started work last year with the suppliers in the broadcast space to help kind of kick start the logistical challenges they would face in terms of repacking and relocation. We started work with production investments on antennas and equipment. We've started some logistical work on crews to do the actual activities of antenna replacement and the repack work. So we've been, kind of, fueling another ecosystem in the broadcast industry as well as our own in the wireless space. We absolutely believe that what we've done there will enable many of these broadcasters and there are many of these broadcasters that want to move quickly. We will help facilitate their progress to repack and actually relocate much faster than they could have without us. So that work is ongoing. Many of you are aware on the call I'm sure NAB is ongoing this week and we continue our work in that space with the broadcasters and the supply chain in the broadcast industry as we sit here today. So a lot happening on that front and has been for some time. And not to repeat myself, but we're very excited about what we see is our head start in 600 MHz if you want to call it that. And of course, our track record on 700 speaks for itself, and so we look to do as faster rollout if not faster in the 600 MHz space. J. Braxton Carter - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Okay. We'll do one final question on the phone, Tim Horan. Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thanks, guys. Mike, could you give us a little color what's goes on with these store openings, how many customer adds you have maybe versus a typical store? And any other color would be great. And just a quick follow up to Neville. Thanks. G. Michael Sievert - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Yes, absolutely. A couple of things to note about them. There's a ramp time associated with a store opening. It's several months long before it reaches its max productivity. That's number one. And number two, some of these stores, because they're in suburban fringe areas and greenfield areas are smaller format stores. In some cases, that doesn't affect their production size at all. In some cases they are a little bit smaller. So that's something to think about if you're trying to do modeling on it. But overall, our mission here is pretty simple. It's from the end of 2015 through the end of 2017 to add 30 million to 40 million marketable POPs to our base, up from about 230 million back when we started this journey of building, and it's really happening in a step-wise fashion as John said. It's kind of pro rata on the year overall and actually we're running \u2013 I would say on the MetroPCS side which \u2013 where we're also building, we're probably running actually ahead of the pace to finish our 1,500 stores throughout the year. So we're really delighted with how it's going. By the way, we're finding fantastic locations. A lot of times right line of sights of the Verizon store, the AT&T store, you can stand on our store and look at theirs. So we couldn't be more excited about the leases that we've signed, the openings that we've done. And by the way, early on, it's looking really good on their performance too. I saw a factoid that I can just toss out there which is 94% of our stores in their first month hit their benchmarks for the first month and we had a really aggressive first month ramp up benchmark form. So delighted with the performance. The team is doing a phenomenal job and really pulling off something that's completely unprecedented in this industry. You got a follow-up? Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Neville, maybe just give us some color on what the radius is for the 600 MHz or how many cell sites \u2013 or how does it kind of compare to the mid-band spectrum and maybe similar thing for capacity on your trials? Neville R. Ray - T-Mobile US, Inc.: I think 600 MHz is going to go a lot further. So very excited about the propagation benefits. It's going to be better than 700 MHz. Traditional math, it would be three or four mid-band cells to meet the range and capability of a low-band cell. So we truly expect \u2013 I mean, this is just tremendous spectrum for us to go and take down the last pieces of geography. We talked about how many POPs we're at. We're about \u2013 we're closing in on 2.1 million square miles of coverage is our goal for the end of the year or was our goal. We're working our math now to see how much we could pump that in some of the rural areas with 600, but certainly it's going to be more than 2.1 million square miles by the end of the year. There's a very good reason why it's really, really tough to cover the size and scale of this marketplace unless you have material low-band assets. And so once and for all we've put that to bed to T-Mobile. Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thank you. J. Braxton Carter - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Okay. On a final note, just to call Walt out, he just put a tweet out, here's the Long Live the Store post@MikeSievert was talking about on the call with a link to it. Definitely good reading, well done, Walt. Well, everybody, we really appreciate you tuning in today. We're looking forward to speaking with you again for another exciting second quarter call coming up in the not too distant future. Have a great day, and I'll turn it over to the operator. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the T-Mobile US First Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. If you have any further questions, you may contact the Investor Relations or Media Departments. Thank you for your anticipation. You may now disconnect, and have a pleasant day.",

Following opening remarks, the earnings call will be open for questions via conference line, Twitter, Facebook, or text messages. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Nils Paellmann, Head of Investor Relations for T-Mobile US. Please go ahead, sir. Nils Paellmann : Thank you very much. Welcome to T-Mobile\u2019s second quarter 2017 earnings call. With me today are John Legere, our President and CEO; Braxton Carter, our CFO and other members of the senior leadership team. Let me read the disclaimer. During this call, we will make projections and statements about the future performance of the company, which are based on current expectations and assumptions. Our Form 10-K includes risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Reconciliations between GAAP and the non-GAAP results we discuss on this call can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website. With that, let me turn it over to John Legere. John Legere : Okay. Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to T-Mobile\u2019s second quarter 2017 Ontario earnings call and Twitter conference and we are coming to you live from our headquarters in Bellevue, Washington. We are mixing things up this quarter and we are breaking with tradition a little bit by getting our results out first and ahead of the pack. And why not, we have spent the last 4.5 years breaking industry rules and dashing the hopes and dreams of our competitors. So why not change the order this quarter and give you the biggest piece of the wireless industry puzzle first. Our Q2 story is simply outstanding. So buckle up and let\u2019s get started. You have the release in the Factbook, but as always, I like to hit the highlights of the quarter. If you are looking for the big news from Q2, you could simply say that T-Mobile\u2019s business continues to perform at peak levels across the board. Our incredible customer growth that I am sure the other guys won\u2019t mention next week, combined with an all-time low churn yielded a record quarter for the Ontario. In fact, Q2 marks 17 quarters in a row where we have added more than 1 million customers. Now, think about that for a minute, 17 quarters. Now, we added 1.3 million total net adds this quarter. So, it\u2019s safe to say our traction with customers continues. We added 817,000 branded postpaid customers. So, it\u2019s looking like Q2 will be the sixth quarter in a row that we led the pack on the total postpaid side. By the way, our business channel at work contributed its highest share of postpaid customers ever. So, we are making great progress towards breaking down the duopoly stranglehold on business customers too. In fact, 181 new logos in the enterprise, federal and public sector were added in Q2 and over 40% of Fortune 1000 companies are now T-Mobile customers and we added 786,000 branded postpaid phone customers, that\u2019s 14 quarters in a row that we have led the entire industry in postpaid phone net adds. We expect to capture all of the industry postpaid phone growth with this quarter again. Our competitors are yet to report, but based on analyst forecast, it seems like AT&T is focused on big time M&A and fine with losing a couple of hundred thousand postpaid customers this quarter and frankly every quarter. Verizon\u2019s massive marketing blitz on its unlimited plan looks like it might disappoint. I bet it also cost them a real pretty penny. Spread has been giving away phone service for free like literally giving it away. What would their results be without a free year of service? Our record low churn certainly contributed to our exceptional postpaid phone net adds. Branded postpaid phone churn in Q2 was down 17 basis points year-over-year and 8 basis points sequentially to a new record low of 1.10%. Okay. So, how we do importing ratios? Well, this quarter makes more than 4 years in a row every quarter that reported positive versus the industry overall and more than 3 years every quarter that reported positive against each and every major carrier. This was a competitive quarter. It was the first full quarter with all the unlimited plans in the market. It was also a quarter in which one desperate company gave away service for free and yes, we even had a new entrant from cable, but I will give them a hall pass for now. In our prepaid business, we added 94,000 new customers. MetroPCS continues to win customers at a healthy pace, but we also made it clear that we chose not to respond to irrational offers from some of our competitors. What I should note that prepaid ARPU reached a new record of $38.65, up 2.1% year-over-year. Last, but for sure not least in our list of highlights, our financial results are fantastic too. In Q2, we delivered our highest absolute service revenue ever, with 8% year-over-year growth and 10% in total revenues, where we expect to lead the industry for the 16th time in the last 17 quarters. We generated strong net income, which was up more than 2.5 times compared to last year, while free cash flow grew by 15% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA of $3 billion reached a record high, up 19% year-over-year with a 40% margin, up 300 basis points. These amazing results across the board are at a large part due to investments we have made and we will continue to make in our network. No magic tricks here just good old-fashioned focus and execution from Neville Ray in the engineering rock stars. The team has already started network deployment on 600 megahertz spectrum that we acquired in the recent auction. In typical T-Mobile passion, we are not wasting any time and we plan to light up the first 600 megahertz site in August. We expect spectrum covering more than 1.2 million square miles to be clear in 2017, with actual deployments in many areas by year end. We expect to have several compatible devices by the holiday season, so our customers can take advantage of this right away and we will use a portion of our 600 megahertz spectrum holdings to deploy America\u2019s first nationwide 5G network in the 2019/2020 timeframe. We continue to grow our 4G LTE network, which covers 315 million people today and we have 321 million in our sites by year end 2017. We remain the fastest network in America. We have been the fastest network in America for 14 quarters in a row and the gap is getting even wider. Amazingly, Verizon fell behind AT&T in terms of download speed. Both Verizon and AT&T are completely choking in the wake of their unlimited launches and have seen significant network slowdowns. Their networks just can\u2019t take it. Meanwhile T-Mobile\u2019s network has actually become even faster in download speeds and America\u2019s best unlimited network just keeps getting better. As usual, we are just getting started. Our network expansion enables us to compete in every inch of the country now and in every segment of the market. We are making incredible progress opening new T-Mobile stores to go from covering two-thirds of the country to three-thirds of the country. Last week, we opened our 1,000th new T-Mobile store this year, with 500 more planned by year end. T-Mobile has opened stores now in over 400 new cities and towns this year alone and that\u2019s in addition to the 1,500 MetroPCS stores planned this year, 1,100 of which have been opened to-date. By year end, we will have nearly 17,000 branded locations across the country, where customers can buy T-Mobile or MetroPCS and that\u2019s just incredible. So, putting all this together, the new spectrum and the work we are doing with our current spectrum set the stage for continued momentum in future growth for T-Mobile. We will bring the Un-carrier to every inch of the United States bringing real choice and competition to all wireless customers. This is also a great story for rural America, much of which is seeing or will see real wireless competition for the first time. Places like Wyoming and Montana can now have more options, thanks to T-Mobile. I really have never been more confident about the future of T-Mobile as we look to the second half of 2017 and beyond. Braxton will update you on our detailed 2017 guidance here in a minute. But since we are reporting first, I thought I would share just a few predictions about Q2 results, you are ready. I predict that T-Mobile will be the only provider to grow total wireless revenues by double digits year-over-year. I predict that we will be the only carrier to grow wireless service revenue at all year-over-year. And I predict that we will take all of the industry\u2019s postpaid phone growth again, at the same time achieving record profitability and strong free cash flow growth. Okay. Let me hand it over to our CFO, Braxton Carter for more financial highlights. Braxton? Braxton Carter : Yes. Thanks John. Let me give you a quick snapshot of our very strong financial results and the details of our 2017 guidance. Let\u2019s start with the financial results that we simply crushed for the second quarter. Our customer growth continues to translate into strong financial growth as we delivered industry leading metrics once again. Service revenues grew by 8% year-over-year, net income grew by 158% and adjusted EBITDA grew by 19%. The adjusted EBITDA margin expanded to 40%, up from 37% a year ago. EBITDA benefited from strong cost discipline. SG&A as a percent of service revenues declined by 100 basis points year-over-year while the cost of equipment sales declined to 114% of equipment revenues, down from 131% in the first quarter and 120% in the second quarter of 2016. Cost of service increased in absolute dollars due to our network expansion and the timing of expenses associated with that expansion, but still came down 30 basis points year-over-year and percent of service revenues. Free cash flows improved 15% year-over-year to $482 million in the second quarter of 2017 recall that the second quarter of 2016 benefited from net proceeds from the sale of receivables of $371 million related to an up sizing of the EIP securitization facility. Net cash from operating activities increased by 3.5% year-over-year to just over $1.8 billion, while cash CapEx was essentially flat at $1.35 billion. As predicted last quarter, the second quarter was also impacted by higher cash interest payments of $727 million, $640 million of which was impacted free cash flow compared to $399 million in the second quarter of 2016. This resulted from higher net debt post the option and the payment of call premiums amounting to $238 million in the second quarter. Earnings per share came in at $0.67 in the second quarter compared to $0.25 in the second quarter of 2016. The effective tax rate amounted to 38% returning to the normal rate following the net tax benefits recorded in the first quarter. This also explains the sequential decline in reported EPS. Recall, the first quarter EPS excluding the after tax spectrum gains and the net tax benefits amounted to $0.48, therefore EPS adjusted for these factors actually increased sequentially. Branded postpaid phone ARPU was $47.01 in the second quarter, essentially flat compared to $47.11 in the second quarter of 2016. ARPU was impacted by the continued migration to T-Mobile ONE including taxes and fees, the impacts of promotions and the successful launch of DIGITS. We continued to expect ARPU to be generally stable from full year 2016 to full year 2017 with some quarterly variation driven primarily by the actual migration ramp to T-Mobile ONE including taxes and fees. In terms of customer quality we had excellent results in the second quarter. Total bad debt expense and losses from sale of receivables were $162 million or a record low of 1.59% of total revenues compared to $165 million or 1.78% in the second quarter of 2016 even with a significantly higher customer base. Let me now come to our 2017 guidance, we expect branded postpaid net additions to be between 3 million and 3.6 million, increased and narrowed from the previous guidance range between 2.8 million and 3.5 million. Based on our strong Q2 results, we are increasing our guidance range for adjusted EBITDA to $10.5 billion to $10.9 billion, up from the prior guidance to $10.8 billion. Our adjusted EBITDA our target includes expected leasing revenues of $850 million to 950 million, increased from the prior guidance range of $800 million and $900 million. Second quarter leasing revenues were $234 million. We target cash CapEx of $4.8 billion to $5.1 billion in 2017, excluding capitalized interest, unchanged from the prior guidance range. We do however expect to come in at the very high end of the guidance range as a result of our initial 600 megahertz rollout. Finally, we expect free cash flow defined of net cash provided by operating activities minus cash CapEx to increase at a 3-year CAGR of 45% to 48% from full year 2016 to full year 2019, again unchanged from prior guidance. During the same period, we expect the underlying net cash provided by operating activities to increase at a CAGR of 15% to 18%. Now let\u2019s get to your questions, you can ask questions via phone, text message or via Twitter or Facebook. We will start with a question on the phone. Operator first question please. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question today from Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Brett Feldman : Thanks for taking the question. Just two if you don\u2019t mind I want to quickly follow-up on your ARPU commentary, it sounds like you continue to feel like you have visibility on stable postpaid phone ARPU over the course of the year, based on what we saw in the second quarter would imply you would have a stronger back half, so I was hoping you can maybe just walk us through, what gets you comfortable with that. And then you gave a lot of color on the store openings, I was wondering if you can help us understand the extent to which some of the new stores are making the contribution to your gross additions? Thank so much. John Legere : Yes. Brett, I think the ARPU is actually an outstanding story when you compare to the rest of the national players in the industry. We have continued once again to reaffirm generally stable ARPU from full year 2017 to full year 2016. And we have been very clear that the actual migration ramp associated with customers moving into T-Mobile ONE taxes and fees can\u2019t create a little bit of quarterly variation here. But we have a significant pricing umbrella, you probably saw that we just increased pricing on our most future rich T-Mobile ONE Plus offering. We have great visibility. We have a significant pricing umbrella compared to the other parties and we are highly confident of achieving this guidance that we will continue to repeat. Braxton Carter : Mike do you want to tell about stores? Mike Sievert : Absolutely, Brett most of the opportunity is still in front of us. We have \u2013 we are excited to pass the 1,000 store mark. I think as we talked about in the past, the ramp-up period happens over a period of about a year. We are ahead of all of ramp targets. Our team is doing an amazing job with most of the upside in terms of our performance is geared for 2018 and beyond. I will say you are going to see it coming in a number of ways. One will be obviously in gross add and net add performance. Another may be in the SG&A line, because as we grow our business in the absence of expansion geographically, our expansion into segments such as business and prime customers you would be faced with ongoing promotional intensity in order to be generating the kind of growth that we are targeting. This is an alternate way to generate that growth and it may be more cost effective, so you may see it in the nominal growth numbers or you may see it in the SG&A lines in the out years or both. And I do appreciate that question, because this year\u2019s activity would be driven by the stores that we added last year and our base. So, one of the things that I think is really something for people to pause on is this is \u2013 we are going to end this year with 17,000 branded doors, which is really when you think about a lot of the discussion of people entering wireless, for example, having 17,000 doors of places where people can go get what is by far the most desired customer experience in the industry is really, it\u2019s a significant, significant barrier for people to overcome. And we are not done and I think that\u2019s the most important stuff. But I would acknowledge the team\u2019s ability in this year to put 3,000 new doors in service and our ability to attract and retain, which is what you have realized is tens of thousands of employees is really a great story. We could possibly be the fastest growing retailer in America. I am not sure about that, but I can\u2019t \u2013 I am not sure there is many other stories like that, but thanks, Brett. Brett Feldman : Thanks for the question. John Legere : Take another one on the phone, operator and then we will jump around here with some of the incoming. Operator : Absolutely. We will take our next question from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Simon Flannery : Thanks a lot. Good afternoon. John, there has been a lot written in the media about potential combinations M&A and we\u2019ve gone 3 months since the end of the anti-collusion period. Can you just update us on your thoughts about opportunities for T-Mobile from consolidation or other partnerships? And then I think you started to go down the porting route, but maybe you could just give us some specific numbers about Q2 or \u2013 and how you are doing so far in Q3? Thank you. John Legere : Sure. I would be glad to. In fact, I will do the second one first and then we will have a little fun with the first \u2013 the first question. I think your understated statement about there being noise in the system I would glad to comment on. But porting for us, again, has been a long-term story, quarters that as seen as competitive, not as competitive, we\u2019ve been very, very consistent with our ability to port positively against the industry as well as each carrier. So Q2 was just under 1.4, so 1.38-ish, and that kind of broke around to 1.2 with Verizon. And certainly, the trajectory with Verizon was getting stronger as the quarter went along, but 1.2 against Verizon in there, they are biggest swing of the bat ever. I\u2019ll take that. We are about 1.3 with Sprint, and we were about 1.63 with AT&T. Now that trend pretty much continues into this quarter. We are over 1.3, and I would categorize it as mostly flat with AT&T versus last quarter, improved versus Verizon even further, and a little bit down with Sprint as they go through some of their promotions, but still solidly over 1 and 1.1 even with Sprint. So that\u2019s the trend. The second item is a great question. I tell you the anonymous source fax machine to Bloomberg.com has been very busy in the last quarter, and if Mr. unnamed sources is on this call, maybe he can speak up as well, I\u2019ve never seen \u2013 I\u2019ve never seen a group have to respond from an analyst side, I appreciate hard your job is, because somebody meets and says hello and all of a sudden you have to model the whole item. What I would say is this. First of all, very important as you can imagine, what I want to make sure we walk away with, this is the two weeks, where all of the wireless carriers have to stop for a minute and then tell us how their existing business is going, not their hopes and dreams and aspirations inside meetings but how is the business going. And our operating momentum has delivered record results, and it continues and we feel great about it, which clearly shows that although everybody would like to say they\u2019ve got a standalone business, we do. Now secondly, this quarter, I would say we have the same but maybe more opportunities from an inorganic or an expansion standpoint than we had last quarter. I feel equally as strong about all of the same things I did last time, and I think the comment I would make is, \u201cWhat\u2019s happening now in Rumorville : first, there was a full year where people could not talk to each other. By the way, we decided to take that year to do the smartest thing you can do, which is win the auction and leave with 45% of all the spectrum. There has been a couple of months now since the auction, and what we are doing is we have been very thoughtful, very methodical, very judicious about how we decide how to expand our business and act in a fashion that is consistent what is best for our shareholders and customers. What\u2019s happening though, Simon, is that there are rumors out there, and the reason they catch fire is that the concepts have a shred of the philosophical, the academic things that we\u2019ve been talking about. We know \u2013 let\u2019s \u2013 what do we know? We know Comcast and Charter made the gigantic move of deciding that they would sit together and not do anything for a year, pretty sure they could have done that separately together without having that announcement. Sort of sounds like restraint of trade to me, but we\u2019ll let them pass on that. And then together, while they are not doing anything for a year, they decided to have exclusive discussions for 60 days with Sprint, and that\u2019s all we know. We know that billionaires, Bezos and Erg in our meeting and having a nice time, but that\u2019s it. The noise to action ratio is zero, and all of those things are because we know Cable has a shitty MVNO relationship with Verizon that they want to do something different with. We know that Sprint has a need to do something and we are interested in all of these options, but we are interested in focusing on our business and doing things in a methodical way at our schedule and at our schedule. So, sorry for going on, I am very confident about where we are and I love all the same things I did 90 days ago. Mike Sievert : And John, the official winner of the office pool is the second question was the consolidation question. So for those who had second question, congratulations. See it\u2019s later. Simon Flannery : Any more clarity from Washington on how they think about all of this? John Legere : How Washington thinks about the fact that there is a non-stop rumor mill going to Bloomberg? First of all, I think one of the things that, I think, we all have to at least accept and acknowledge all of the activity and the noise it\u2019s taking place, makes it very clear that there is not four. This is far more than four, and there is outside of the four is a whole new group leaning against the window trying to get in. Some my \u2013 and I certainly don\u2019t have any inside track on how Washington would view the kind of horizontal mergers that you are talking about. My assessment is that Carter administration may be look more favorably upon this, but I also think, if carriers were to go and propose a merger, if that were to happen. It\u2019s up to them to make the story as to why that makes sense for the consumers, why it makes sense for the country, why competition would get greater instead of less, why the 5G opportunity is huge and need for capital that comes with scale, and also clearly make the case that not only now we are hearing noise from Amazon, but Comcast and Charter, ultimately, ultimately all Ts are up going to be playing in the wireless space, and that\u2019s the environment under which I think administration would look at this, and I would know, certainly just my own opinion, I think they look favorably upon it. Simon Flannery : Thank you. John Legere : Okay. Operator, let\u2019s take one more. And then guys why don\u2019t we pick from the ones on Twitter, while we take the next question on the line? Operator : Our next question today comes from John Hodulik with UBS. John Hodulik : Great, thanks. Two if I could. First, a follow-up to Simon\u2019s question maybe for John, you mentioned that Sprint is potentially in negotiations for an MVNO with Cable, would that \u2013 how would that change the sort of attractiveness or of a combination between T-Mobile and Sprint in your mind? That\u2019s number one. And then number two, you mentioned strength in the business market in terms of the results, I don\u2019t know if you shared specific numbers with this, but maybe you can give us a sense of maybe an order of magnitude in terms of share of representative of the gross add that comes from the business market where it was, where it is now and sort of what the opportunity is on that side of things? Thanks. John Legere : Yes. I will do the first one, Mike and then we really do want to make sure, Mike has talked about the business opportunity, because that\u2019s the place. If you wanted to look at a pocket full of growth opportunity for us that I don\u2019t think you have all been counting on, that\u2019s the one. Let\u2019s also be clear, John. I don\u2019t have any insight as to what Sprint is negotiating with who, I read what you read, I am very patient watching it, it would seem logical that one of the things that a cable company would want to talk to Sprint about is an MVNO. And I think one of the things that would possibly be thought about is their network needs investment. So how are they going to provide an MVNO alternative unless they get a significant investment in the network? These are all academic. They are not as simple as they sound. And again, I think and I have seen a lot of what you have written as well as others nothing has changed to the large extreme of carriers like the T-Mobile and Sprint considering coming together. We have different views about MVNO. I certainly wouldn\u2019t \u2013 it wouldn\u2019t be my first choice to arm the cable players with a tool that could help them be more competitive. However, I have been very clear that I believe over time these industries are all coming together anyway. Those are the kind of things that may, even if you did attempt the transaction, they may happen in a regulatory approval environment. So, these are all the cart before the horse what\u2019s going to happen. Over time, if you look 3 to 5 years, you know how all of this is coming. I have been very clear. Customers are going to drive a ubiquitous look across all of technologies for you to get together and provide them a seamless experience having their content available to them wherever they are. So never say never, I think we are going to have probably an equally if not more interesting environment in the next 3 months. I think what we all need to do is pause, catch our breath, understand underneath all these Sun Valley meetings and Bloomberg articles, how are the businesses doing, how are the networks performing, how are the investments taking place and what are the real company\u2019s assets, brands and people behind these conversations. I couldn\u2019t be more confident that T-Mobile is a very strong kind of player in whatever ultimately happens to bring things together for customers. John Hodulik : Perfect. Yes. John Legere : Yes. And on the business markets we are really, really excited about the development we have seen here. We refer to the group as the AtWork Group. I think we mentioned in our remarks that 181 new logos across large enterprise and public sector in the last quarter, now 40% of the Fortune 1000. What we didn\u2019t mention and this is really interesting is that our share of requirements in that Fortune 1000 and public sector is still very low. Our market share is still very low. What we have established now are successful relationships from which we can grow and we are now starting to mind those relationships and deliver value to the customers. For example, this was \u2013 this quarter represented the highest ever percentage of our postpaid net adds that were represented by the AtWork Group and that\u2019s across all those larger sectors like enterprise and government, but also business customers interacting with us through our fleet of retail stores. So, that\u2019s a terrific accomplishment. The growth rate year-over-year is more than twice the rate of consumer and I think it reflects the opportunity that we have, the acceptance that we now have from businesses, thanks to the big network push. And it also represents the upside, because this is an area where we have much lower historical market share than we have on the consumer side. So, when we talk about our push from two-thirds to three-thirds of the country as a strategy, we are talking about three things. Geographic expansion with all that retail expansion that John talked about, segment expansion in two flavors, one prime consumers and suburban families and secondly business customers of all sizes and what\u2019s driving all this, the catalyst for all of it is the fantastic network expansion that we realized over the past two years. John Hodulik : Great, thanks. John Legere : Thanks. Anybody see one on the board they want to grab, any suggestions, web point me out, okay Kyle Romanoff. As phone upgrade season approaches, what steps will T-Mobile take to attract switchers? I will jump in. Kyle, this is really interesting, I mean, these phone launch moments that happen a couple of times a year from the big phone manufacturers are huge share switching opportunities for us as competitors. I will point out a couple of things. One is that the share switching opportunity happens over time. It doesn\u2019t happen all at once and that has to do with supply constraints that we have seen in past years. This launch cycle happens over two, sometimes even three quarters as people reassess whether they have got the right phone and then use that as an opportunity to assess whether they have got the right carrier. I will point out that we have been seeing real success with people picking T-Mobile catalyzed by a new phone choice, but it\u2019s not always because of something we do around the phone value proposition. In fact, people are coming to T-Mobile, because of T-Mobile ONE. They are picking T-Mobile, because we have America\u2019s best unlimited and T-Mobile ONE is a differentiated offer. That\u2019s certainly the way we approach the galaxy launches this year. We took a lot of share through that galaxy launch. As you know, we took all of the postpaid phone net adds in the last quarter and we expect to again this quarter, but we did it by focusing on our service value proposition and our differentiation. T-Mobile ONE, not necessarily through doing something differentiated on the phone offer itself and that\u2019s a formula we are very comfortable with. By the way for those on the call don\u2019t know who Kyle Romanoff is if you cut few quarters ago you say the young man that came in and acted as an interview for us. He just had his birthday. How old is he Dave approximately? Okay. I am just sitting and thinking when I was 15, I probably wasn\u2019t sending a note to the CEO of T-Mobile about what we are going to do to attract switchers with the deck. So, I am pretty sure you can dial forward 15 years and know who is going to be the CEO of whatever company they want. Let\u2019s see. Here is a great question does anyone else think Braxton won the Q2 earnings results wardrobe award with that hat? I agree that they met that hat. That hat by the way I was in Guatemala last week with one of our big care centers and there was a performance by a team from our Mexico care team and they gave us that hat for Braxton. But as you can see asked to be careful, Braxton went straight back to the hat that\u2019s brought home the best luck over time. Well, let\u2019s see how shocking there is about 25 questions from Walt Piecyk. Let\u2019s see, which is Walt also on the list over here. Well, you get no respect anymore, Walt. It\u2019s good thing. Pick a Walt question here before he gets around to asking Neville. Let\u2019s see, I think Braxton already answered the postpaid ARPU question, so let\u2019s go to what type of Sprint promotion would you react to if you didn\u2019t respond to one year for free? Look, we don\u2019t react to people\u2019s promotions. I think what we have got is a market where other people react to our game plan. That\u2019s been going on for years in this marketplace. We take moves and actions, bring innovation to the market. We drop it on the industry for the benefit of customers and the rest of the industry scrambles to react. That\u2019s the way it\u2019s been for years. We intend to keep it that way. Braxton Carter : John, we had a really interesting, Twitter question on that. Would we consider a dividend? I think that\u2019s one of the most exciting things about our story and that\u2019s the free cash flow generation and development. And this year for the first time we put out a CAGR on free cash flow between 45% and 48% between \u201817 and \u201819. And what that\u2019s going to translate to is over $10 billion of net cash generation after paying all expenses, after paying all interest expense and that\u2019s quite exciting. And we have commented in the past that we have in fact been looking at options to return capital to shareholders. We just got past the auction. We are going to significantly de-lever organically. And of course, we will always look at ways to invest in the business with a highest return, but with that amount of cash, we are actually starting to have conversations about instituting a small quarterly dividend that we can grow in the future. And I think that\u2019s going to be a wonderful thing for all of T-Mobile shareholders and we could obviously supplement with buybacks as our cash progression develops, so huge item there. John Legere : Perfect. By the way, those of you who are watching on Twitter just saw that Mike Sievert didn\u2019t realize that the table here is electronic. He levitated it and we had a complete explosion of the coffee here, but we didn\u2019t lose our focus for a second. And Walt, he has got to piggyback on the back of the question. I think it\u2019s fair to say that a lot of what Sprint is doing. This is very aggressive ways to attempt to offset churn and to get some subscriber growth. I think even Sprint would probably not believe that some of their promos are sustainable, but we have been in that stage where you have got to get very aggressive and turn things around. So I don\u2019t think those are \u2013 those are programs that are meant to be responded to. And I think as you watch what we did with prepaid this quarter very, very aggressive thing, so we decided not to overly respond to, but we still were able to keep our prepaid ARPU at a record high and protect our base and grow. And I not think that\u2019s probably the logical way. Yes, let\u2019s go to I think the next question operator. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Rollins with Citi Research. Michael Rollins : Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Hi, two if I could, first you were talking about the porting ratios, if they were a little lower than they were historically, but the gross adds on phones look like they were up and so I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about where the incremental gross adds may be coming from between those at port and the end result what you achieved in the quarter. And then secondly I was wondering if you could unpack more specifically what happened with the margin improvement in the quarter, it looks like you have already captured over 50% of your core or cash or EBITDA goal for the year, so how should we think about opportunities to improve EBITDA even further? Thanks. John Legere : Okay. And again Mike if you want to start a brush, I would say we were \u2013 first, let\u2019s be clear. We are very pleased with porting in that range. And ultimately if the porting as an example last quarter and this quarter, if this goes on in perpetuity, we eventually control the entire industry that\u2019s why we have been we are porting churns at a record low. So we are quite comfortable for example that we would port 1.2 to 1 with Verizon during their most aggressive quarter and now as we go back in being even higher. And to port positive with Sprint no matter what they do and to keep AT&T added very, very high levels, I think I am comfortable with that, but Mike do you want to go through the components. Mike Sievert : Well, as we run the business there is two things we look to on customer growth. One is, are we winning over more families and switchers on the consumer side and of course businesses on the business side. Porting is the great way to kind of measure that. You can see that in our net add numbers, in our share of total growth, you can see it in our record low churn, in our continued porting positive against every carrier. The second thing we look for though is existing customers deepening their relationships with us. And we saw that to a record extent this quarter as well and that\u2019s why you can see a quarter where porting while continuing very positive could soften some and phone net adds continue apace. Our customers double down with us, not only are they staying longer with record low churn, but they are deepening their relationship with us with additional lines. And I think you saw on the numbers that we disclosed we achieved an all-time high this quarter of lines per customer on the postpaid side and that help to explain the difference. Braxton Carter : And Mike very good question on EBITDA over there. First of all, we give a range and that range has our full growth expectations for the year embedded in it and you know the game plan. Quarter-after-quarter as we demonstrate actual results, we adjust that growth accordingly as warranted. You are seeing tremendous business momentum. You are seeing tremendous momentum that\u2019s just starting to develop with the distribution expansion that will really pay dividends next year. But we give a range on EBITDA for a reason and that reason is there can be growth variability for the balance of year. I will point out for the first time we have raised EBITDA guidance mid-year and that shows our confidence in what we are doing and it shows the confidence that we have on execution for the balance of the year. John Legere : Operator, I am so excited for you to introduce the next question from one of the biggest staunch long-term believers and supporters in T-Mobile U.S. business, so I would like you introduce the next question. Operator : Our next question today comes from Mr. David Barton with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. David Barton : Hey guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. This is very Un-carrier. I wanted to maybe talk a little about the recent price change that you guys instituted in the \u2013 I think with the $5 increase in the kind of T-Mobile ONE higher level plan, can you talk about what the kind of reasons for that was and I guess there has been a conversation about what that might mean, does it mean that you want to take advantage of your position in the market to try to focus on more profitability or do you want to set yourself up to kind of lower prices again when we get back to the iPhone. And I have got a prediction of my own which I think you will be seeing Verizon do some interesting moves to kind of split the difference on SD and HD pricing as well, so I look forward to that in the next of couple weeks as well? John Legere : Okay. First of all thanks for all your work. I look forward to seeing Verizon make any move. They haven\u2019t really been breathing lately. But I think your question was a good one, because there was a lot of confusion about whether there was a promo expiring or a price increase and what we are really doing around that, so Mike wanted to talk about that. Mike Sievert : Yes. David, I think what you are referring to is T-Mobile ONE Plus. This is a really incredibly popular add on the T-Mobile ONE. And it provides customers with a number of extra benefits, that\u2019s something that was available promotionally for $5. We put at its standard pricing of $10. And we are really excited about the value that this represents both for customers as well as for the owners of T-Mobile as you I think know. Our strategy is always about providing more, more value for our customers. It\u2019s not necessarily about charging less, it\u2019s about providing more for what you pay and overall better value proposition. T-Mobile ONE Plus provides not only high-definition video, but 10 gigs of tethering, double the global data roaming which is already incredible benefit 256 kilobit per second global data roaming and an extra line through DIGITS essentially in add a line. So all that value is packaged together for $10 and what we are finding is at that price, it remains an incredibly popular add-on. So it\u2019s just an example of what I was talking about on the last question which is customers are demonstrating that they appreciate the value that we are bringing and they are doubling down on their relationships with us as T-Mobile ONE Plus is one of the best examples. We were asked when we move to unlimited over and over again what your upside is going to be, are you going to be able to attract people to deepen your relationship, now that you have given away all the data. And I think this is the latest installment that says we are far from out of ideas on how to entice our customers to deepen their relationships with us. John Legere : And I will just \u2013 you brought up so I will pick pilot as well. Kidding aside, obviously Verizon has to do something as it relates to how they not just price unlimited, but how they deliver it, because their network and this isn\u2019t just an attack, it\u2019s an attack, but its data oriented attack. Their network is significantly slowing down, its choking on this and clearly the only explanation as to why they haven\u2019t offered a Binge On type capability is because they don\u2019t how. And once they figure it out, it will be a safety net for them to figure out how to get to their customers onto it. And again Binge On is one of the most incredible technological things that we have done and customers love it. And so from a standpoint of how its positioned also allowing customers who want to have full HD. That\u2019s not just a pricing game, that\u2019s a technological game and we are pretty much be looking AT&T and Verizon this last quarter. Both of their networks slowed down. So I think what they are learning is unlimited is not the easiest thing in the world. And as Neville\u2019s deployment continues and continues, our speeds are only getting better and better and we can expect that to continue. Okay. David Barton : Thanks so much guys. Mike Sievert : Thanks David. Can we talk about prepaid, we are getting a lot of questions on prepaid. And before we go back to the phones, we have a lot of fans of MetroPCS out there. This was just another fantastic quarter for us on prepaid. And what our team has accomplished across both of our brands and particularly on MetroPCS in recent quarters is unbelievable. This quarter again has the largest prepaid provider in the industry with 20 million subscribers, we were able to again post growth in a very interesting and tough competitive situation, while also achieving the highest ARPUs in our company\u2019s history on prepaid. So we are really proud of that. One big milestone that\u2019s interesting, we believe that next quarter we will surpass the point where we will now have double the customers on MetroPCS versus the 8.9 million customers that came in on May 1, 2013 when we all came together. Double the 8.9 million customers just on MetroPCS, when companies merge, the big question that\u2019s asked usually is how many will they be able to hang on, how many will be able to entice to stay, instead our MetroPCS team led by Tom Keys has engineered a doubling of that business. We believe we will hit that milestone during fourth quarter. John Legere : Mike, I am glad you brought that up, because we don\u2019t report MetroPCS numbers individually. So let\u2019s just suffice it to say that we did 94,000 prepaid nets and Metro did significantly more than that. And so when we say we chose to kind of ignore certain attacks in the prepaid market that was mostly around Magenta prepaid. And as you can see over time, the evolution of where we are going, we have over 11,000 doors by the end of the year of MetroPCS dedicated doors and that\u2019s becoming where we anchor our business and that brand is stronger than ever. The distribution is great and their ARPU has been tremendously strong. And as Mike says, you can figure out the math in the time that they have been here if they double their size, we have a real winning hand with MetroPCS. So, let\u2019s go back to the phone and take the next question. Operator : Our next question comes from Jonathan Chaplin with New Street Research. Please go ahead. Jonathan Chaplin : Thanks. In comments that the guys at Deutsche Telekom and you guys have made in the past it seemed like in a potential tie-up with Sprint, for T-Mobile to have control and Deutsche Telekom to have control of the combined entity through T-Mobile was really important. If we are looking at a situation now it is potentially a much bigger deal involving Sprint and T-Mobile and Cable. Is it still critical for Deutsche Telekom and T-Mobile to have control in that situation? And now the \u2013 sorry, go ahead. John Legere : Yes, you go ahead. Jonathan Chaplin : I was just going to throw one more question, which I will be very happy if I get answered. Now that the discussions with Sprint is sort of officially on hold, can you give any commentary around where the sticking points where in the prior set of discussions? John Legere : Yes, no. Listen, this is a long game and it\u2019s first of all, I want to just make sure I am not attacking kind of some of the things that are being rumored, but let\u2019s remember that [indiscernible] is one of the richest, biggest dealmakers in the world and his moves are significantly tracked and I dare any of you to dissect when he is working on vision fund and when he is working on, the guy is one of the biggest players in the world. And what he has been doing makes sense. That\u2019s Massa. It sprints very lucky to have him as an owner. We, as I said, every option that we had before we have and then some other ones, I don\u2019t need to point out to you some of the newer things that are coming out. You watch who is playing in the market. And from a standpoint of talks being officially on hold, I am not going to comment on any of that. It\u2019s still \u2013 any option still looks the same. There have been some comments, I believe made by Deutsche Telekom about what their preferences are. These are point in time preferences. You can talk to them about what is their current state. Remember in the last year or two, we have gone from Sprint is buying T-Mobile, T-Mobile is buying Sprint, nobody is buying everybody. And now, we think that Charter and Comcast and all Ts and DISH and T-Mobile are all going to get together in some big amorphous pile and come running out. And by the way the amount of things you have had to write Jonathan are incredible. I mean, I think you as much as anybody would like some clarity. I think the same kinds of things that made sense 3 months ago makes sense now. These aren\u2019t linear. We are going to be very patient and methodical. Things that makes sense for our customers and shareholders are very apparent and we have nothing negative to say about those opportunities. And when things are tangible and when we can come out of the Sun Valley meetings and into the delight of the day I think our shareholders would be very pleased to see the things that we are working on. So, I am not commenting on talks, I am not going to comment on if talks ended and if they ended why and where they are going to start, but it was a good try. Jonathan Chaplin : Thanks, John. John Legere : You\u2019re welcome. Okay. Take the next question, operator. Operator : Sure. We will take our next question from Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Phil Cusick : Hey, guys. Thanks. I am going to stay with M&A. But Braxton, I have got a follow-up on your dividend comment, with so much volatility in the industry and a number of carriers tied down by their probably way too big dividends. Why would you do a dividend rather than buying back stock? Is there like a share liquidity issue or a DT capital return component that you are thinking about? Braxton Carter : There really isn\u2019t. And in my comments, I said starting off the small dividend. And so I think one of the benefits to this would be to all shareholders of T-Mobile, we would open up and a whole another class of investors that require yield versus growth. And it also shows the confidence that we have in our cash flow generation. By all means we would start out with a modest dividend, but even a modest dividend would accomplish that and then we will look at using buybacks of the supplemental and what better place to put our money than buying back T-Mobile stock. Phil Cusick : I would assume you wouldn\u2019t make a decision on this until probably year end? Braxton Carter : No, it\u2019s something that we are starting to discuss now. There is no imminent decision. Phil Cusick : Okay. And then if I can one more, Mike, what\u2019s happening with online sales. It seems like this should be a bigger share of sales at every carrier, but seems to be pretty slow. How are you doing there? Mike Sievert : It\u2019s coming along great. We have put in some terrific new technology, which has really changed the game in terms of how our customers are interacting with. It\u2019s not just online, but also through partnerships. It\u2019s like Facebook Messenger, for example, to a asynchronous messaging through our own app, which has been downloaded 20 million times and many other breakthroughs. A thing I want to point out though is that there is work to be done in this entire industry before consumers shift wholesale into the online world. And our view is that the industry needs to be radically simplified. That\u2019s why we are leading the way with our Un-carrier moves. That\u2019s the inspiration behind T-Mobile ONE. That was the inspiration behind Un-carrier Next, with taxes and fees included, creating a monthly subscription to the Internet that\u2019s so simple that customers really are inspired to take on more and more of it on their own. We also are rapidly building stores and you might say well, isn\u2019t that intention with an online future and we think absolutely not. Our view is that in the next few years what we are going to see as customers move their way towards a digital centric relationship is that they will have a digitally accelerated retail relationship with us. And what we mean by that is making retail better, making it more interesting, turning it into a better showroom for our brand, turning it into a fulfillment center for online first transactions and having people come to us for what we do best, which is provide our knowledge and expertise, because no matter how good you may get at it as a consumer, you do this transaction once every 2 years, we do it several times a day. So we are better at it. And people like to be able to hold us accountable to provide something we do better than any other carrier in the marketplace, which is provide great customer service. So, we are building stores like crazy. We are putting in the tools to create a great digitally accelerated relationship at retail and we are radically simplifying everything about this company to create a product that deserves a digital relationship in the first place. Phil Cusick : Can you give us an idea of where those digital sales are today? Are there handsets or gross adds? Mike Sievert : No, we haven\u2019t disclosed the percentage of sales that are purely digital. I will tell you that an increasing number of our total transactions are purely digital. So there is two things and eventually we will give you some more color on. There is pure digital. There is retail that\u2019s been touched by digital and there is also transactions, every single time you call care or change your rate plan or change something about your device is an opportunity for a transaction to be conducted either partly or totally digital. All those things are growing is all I think we can disclose today. Some of them are growing really led by leaps and bounds, but we aren\u2019t in a position to lay out a lot of details for you quite yet. John Legere : But I think the preface with which you asked the question we completely agree with, which is everybody has room to grow in digital utilization at the sales capability and we probably have more to grow than anyone, which puts it in the giant opportunity basket for us and one that we are significantly planning about. Now, I just want to cover because I am \u2013 if you take the last several questions together and this is before we even unleashed Neville for one of his very short network updates that would take us well into the evening. You can see the reasons for our excitement and enthusiasm like one is again, I hope I\u2019m very clear, value chain migration, merger and acquisition to get much better scale and capability is something we are completely supportive of and very methodically looking at a way to do in the best interest of our shareholders. And I am optimistic some of that will continue to be on the front burner. At the same time the expansion of our retail capabilities, the expansion of our network, the tools that we have been creating and have far room to grow on that. Along with the guidance that we have given about the cash profile of the company of the next couple years, you can see that the hands that we have to play to support shareholders we even found ourselves here thinking out loud about things like dividends and share repurchase progress. So I think we have got a basket of tools that are built on top of this great business momentum we have. That\u2019s a hand that I am very, very excited to play and I think you been probing on each of those angles very well. So thank you for your question. Let\u2019s go, do you see a question up here, it\u2019s a good launching pad for us to unleash Neville Ray. Well, let\u2019s go to Walt just say spectrum, okay operator introduce the next question. Operator : Our next question today comes from Walt Piecyk with BTIG. Walt Piecyk : Thank you. That\u2019s a great segue, because that\u2019s exactly what I want to ask about can you hear me? John Legere : Yes, you are one of our favorites. And one of the biggest changes in industry in the past three months is you finally has stopped periscoping which is real. Walt Piecyk : You follow me on Instagram now. By the way, do you think because you let Barden [ph] ask a question on your call, I am going to get a question on Sprint\u2019s quarterly call, for the first time and how long? John Legere : See if I can help, yes. Walt Piecyk : Come on Marcella [ph] you can take it. So Braxton has talked about this treasure trove of spectrum at 2.5, so I am just curious, first of all what\u2019s the minimum amount since you guys are doing these like fat channel LTEs to get your very fast speeds, what\u2019s the minimum amount of 2.5 that you would need, that you would deploy in your network, do you have to change the number of cell sites that you have today, because your current link project for that 2.5 spectrum enough to use it. And then lastly this is all part of the same question, you paid $0.80 for the 600, I think if you look at DISH and where the stock is trading right now, it\u2019s discounting spectrum at $1, where would you think about the relative value of the 2.5, what\u2019s say compared to DISH which is effectively the stock is discounted by $1 megahertz pop, is that worth less. more, the same, so anything on the 2.5 that we can fill in will be great? Thanks. John Legere : Let\u2019s do this, Neville. I want to make one comment about the treasure trove because it keeps coming back to haunt us. And then maybe you can go through Walt\u2019s question, but also give us an update and we will the Gong Show has come back to television by the way so we will just keep the Gong ready if you got to [indiscernible]. Well, I wanted to comment on that the treasure trove, it is very important to note that if you \u2013 we have spoken about 2.5 from a standpoint of hey, you are walking down the street and you look off on the right and you see a gigantic pile of 2.5 spectrum. And then you ask yourself, hey what do you think of that pilot spectrum, do you like it and we say, of course we do, it\u2019s a big pilot 2.5, it\u2019s a treasure trove. It wasn\u2019t a commentary on our requirement for it, our desire to transform our company to get our hands on it, it\u2019s simply a commentary on is there a value in a gigantic pile of 2.5 spectrum. And if you took it other than then you took it the wrong way. So we don\u2019t withdraw our treasure trove comment, because I don\u2019t think there is a pile of almost any kind of spectrum that Neville wouldn\u2019t run over and bear, do your best to give a brief answer and update on the network. Neville Ray : You said brief, no questions. Well, clearly Walt never seen a megahertz we don\u2019t like, right. That\u2019s no network guys is going to say anything different. I mean I think for us the thing we keep forgetting is we have just closed on a massive investment in spectrum for this company. I mean John reference it earlier on, we came out with 45% of the proceeds of the Broadcast Incentive Auction, that increased our spectrum assets by just shy of 40% So we have a lot of spectrum to grow into as we continue to grow this business. We talked earlier on about the speed at which we are deploying 600 megahertz, so this isn\u2019t spectrum that\u2019s going to see the light of day three, 4 years from now as many would like to talk about or talked about pre the auction. This is spectrum that will be in customers\u2019 hands with handsets before the end of this year. So we have a lot of growth and capability in that spectrum. And then I look at all of the other things and sources of growth and capacity that we are driving in and on to our network today. We blogged earlier this week and we have showed what\u2019s happening with speed performance across the major networks. And I think we might even be able to put up a quick visual for you on the webcast of what that looks like to remind you. John referenced earlier on, I mean the Verizon and AT&T guys have been tanking in terms of their overall speed performance, neither network was ready for unlimited, they moved too fast, too quick. AT&T ended up above the Verizon in terms of speed performance for last quarter well below us. But only because of Verizon\u2019s god-awful performance, AT&T ended up in second place. They decline themselves the Verizon fared far worse. So at a point in time in the industry when the other big guys are running around trying to scramble as to how to deal with unlimited, we are actually rocking in terms of our network performance. We have the best performance on our network in our company\u2019s history the highest speeds, the lowest congestion if you can find it and that\u2019s because we have done so much to maximize the asset base we have and all LTE network VoLTE, driving the feature set with LTE advance at a pace which is the other guys had spinning. I mean you compound all those factors, we are in a tremendous place with the assets that we have with full bore on exploring 5 gigahertz on unlicensed LTE and LAA. We recently conducted testing on LAA. We were putting down just shy of 800 megabits per second on LAA testing, that\u2019s not going to be seen everywhere, but the opportunities in terms of how to grow capacity and capability on this network are endless for us. And so then you come back to this question about how important is it for us to have spectrum from other sources at this point in time. I mean my sites are on really I don\u2019t think about 2.5 that much. I don\u2019t think about DISH spectrum that much, its tough spectrum to come after and to secure. But we will make sure we have a great future with the assets we have. We have just purchased and we are moving into with unlicensed. And then I think about the 5G story that\u2019s coming. We are the first carrier that has the capability to talk about launching a nationwide 5G network with the 600 megahertz spectrum we acquired, really, really difficult and tough for anybody else to talk that way. Then you think about millimeter wave, industry needs more millimeter wave spectrum for urban hotspot like deployment, we have some, we would like to see more that will push on the regulatory front to make sure that that happens. And then in the middle Walt, is this thing called 3.5 and there was a question up earlier on I did go at it. But what\u2019s our interest in 3.5 gigahertz spectrum and I have huge interest in the 3.5 gigahertz block. If you want to talk about where is the most formative block of spectrum emerging globally for 5G, it\u2019s in the 3.5 gigahertz to kind of 4 gigahertz range. And so we are now sing the FCC and the administration start to look at not just CBRS, but really opening up a powerful block of spectrum in that 3.5 gigahertz to 4 gigahertz range, 500 gigahertz on top of CBRS, NOI from the FCC just this week. So think about all the alternatives that are coming that need to be pushed on and need to be worked on. And then what is that 2.5 worth, what is that DISH spectrum worth, well, there is a lot of alternatives is all I can say at this point in time to us. Walt Piecyk : How about the minimum amount that you could use there Neville aside from the valuation like what\u2019s \u2013 is it a 40 block minimum, 20 block, what would you want to have as a minimum just to even endorse that band in your network? Neville Ray : Yes. I mean you are always going to want to look at something of about 40 megahertz plus, I mean ideally 60 megahertz, I mean I look at kind of unused spectrum in the Sprint network today, it\u2019s primarily the EBS asset, the BRS is pretty much consumed with our existing operations as 90-20 rule there is about 80% of the pops, but probably 20% of the geography of the U.S. So it\u2019s far from a national band, it\u2019s got urban deployment use, but yes, you would need 40 megahertz to 60 megahertz. John Legere : Operator, if you could unhook his mic and put him on same list. Walt Piecyk : I am going to turn my mic off. John Legere : Put him on the same list that he is always been. And we will go to the next question. We are going to take two more in the queue and then we will try to wrap up. Operator : Okay. Our next question today comes from Craig Moffett from MoffettNathanson. Craig Moffett : Well, I am almost afraid to tee up Neville one more time, but\u2026 John Legere : No upgrade. Craig Moffett : Can we just add to that very helpful discussion, Neville, about small cells and talk about where you are with small cells, what you are seeing in terms of the pace of getting them zoned and online? And can you put some numbers around what you are expecting for \u2013 where you are today and then what you are expecting for this year and next? John Legere : Maybe Neville add in the evolution of wireless industries in the world as a kind of tail end of that. Go ahead. Neville Ray : Well, I think I covered most of the basis, Craig; but you caught me, I didn\u2019t cover off on densification on the network, and that was one of the pieces what was implied in his question. Obviously, we have the most dense network in the US today, and the low-band build networks from Verizon and AT&T continue to scramble to come close to matching, anything close to matching the density we have. But we are not sitting on our hands. We have been very active on the small cell front. As you know, we pick up about 13,000 kind of DAS nodes small-cell equivalents through the Metro transaction, which have been moved across the simple LTE in all its glory. In addition to that, traditional small cell and new small cell built well over 2,000 in the ground. That number will hit about 8,000 by the end of this year. And more importantly, we have built a pipeline of over $25,000 in the fiber-fed small cell locations that we can run at. So we are very busy, very active there. We spent many months making sure we had a very cost effective and modular model that we could run out and move out at pace. So, we have built a very strong pipeline that we can cool down on over the next couple of years. Performance is really, really good. We just had a major milestone in LA. So, we have got kind of formative mass in LA. Now over 1,000 small cells turned up in the Los Angeles market, and we are actually now starting to see one of the full network benefits : micro network offload, speed enhancements, really good numbers coming through when you get a material volume of small cells on the ground in a key urban and metro environment. So we are very active there. The last thing I would add is that all goal and what we are working towards is that every small cell come fourth quarter of this year that we deploy would be leveraging unlicensed LTE in the 5 GHz band. And so back to this question about spectrum scarcity, think about small cells proliferating that can leverage, primarily, underutilized 5 GHz spectrum in these outdoor environments. It is a very powerful tool in the toolkit. John Legere : A round of applause for Neville for brevity. Okay, operator, let\u2019s take one last question. Operator : Next question today comes from Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays. Amir Rozwadowski : Thanks very much, folks. I appreciate you squeezing me in. A couple of questions, if I may. First and foremost, if I think about sort of the churn trajectory of the business, if I look at the churn performance this quarter, both down sequentially and on a year-over-year basis, you both have made sort of continue to make mark improvements there. What\u2019s the long-term goal in terms of the churn? And where you think you can get to on a postpaid basis? And unfortunately, I will turn it back to Neville on a question in terms of size and scope of 5G investment. There has been a lot of discussions in the marketplace about the size and scope of what will be needed for 5G investments just on an industry-wide basis. Given sort of the cash expectations and growth expectation, do you feel as though you have got sufficient capital to make those investments on a going forward basis or this scale via any sort of inorganic activity hope accelerate that and drive sort of improve the technology augmentation by the overall industry? Thanks very much. John Legere : Amir, your question was longer than Neville\u2019s answer. I\u2019m just saying. I will start on the churn piece and then we can turn to the investment piece. Yes, Amir, we see no reason why T-Mobile cannot achieve industry-best churn benchmarks. And if you look around the world, here in the US, Verizon has had some of the best churn performance. We see no reason why we cannot meet or beat the churn that any provider in the industry is able to provide. We have the best customer satisfaction, the highest NPS scores, a rapidly growing network, a rapidly growing network reputation, which is lagging the network, and on-carrier differentiation that customers really love. And what we are doing is building the customer base that over time will be able to contribute to long-term churn reduction. It\u2019s a journey. It is going to have its ups and downs. It has a seasonal curve to it. We do expect the second half of the year to be higher than the first half of the year again this year as we have seen in the last several years, but the long-term trajectory is for continual improvement. Neville Ray : Yes, thanks, Amir. So trying to lay this out the right way, I mean, I look at 5G and what\u2019s happening, not just in the U.S. but globally, and there is kind of three flavors, right? And we have got ourselves pretty much wrapped up around the axle in the U.S. on just millimeter wave. Millimeter wave is important, and it is important for very high throughput capabilities and services in primarily in urban environments, because the propagation on millimeter wave is going to be very taxed and very limited. But for us, when I think about capital intensity deploying millimeter wave, for example, a lot of the small cells that we are going out and securing space on now, we are looking to secure space to provide a 5G box as part of that rollout. So the actual cost to come back on a small cell amount millimeter wave capability will be actually very small. Now the question is, how much of that do you need to do. And if there is a massive, massive volume because you just depend on millimeter wave, yes, it could cost you an incredible amount of cash and investment, and time and money, to make that happen. But that\u2019s not what 5G is all about. If you swing the pendulum to the other end of the spectrum and you think about a low-band spectrum and the need for massive coverage, IoT capabilities and technologies, that\u2019s where you need the low-band spectrum similar to what we have now secured in 600 MHz to go make that happen. That\u2019s the complete some of the polar opposite from the millimeter wave story, but it is a very, very important part of the 5G story. Now for us, how we will be looking at that. So as we start to roll out 600 MHz, we are very close to securing 600 MHz radio product already that will be 5G new radio capable. Not fully from a software perspective, but as we put those radios on the tower tops and spend all that money, it is a radio product that we can upgrade to 5G with software when the standards in the software is complete. So again, this is another great opportunity for us to minimize this kind of cash burn and effort and time and resources when it comes to low-band 5G rollout. And in the middle, you need something in this kind of mid-band space, at that\u2019s where 3.5 GHz will probably dominate from a global perspective. Work to be done there, but again, for us what\u2019s the cost, it\u2019s actually rolling out a mid-band radio on a very dense grid, a very dense macro grid that we already have. And so I think I differ from some of my peers in our competitors about we are going to 1 million small cells dotted around the US, hug on every street poll, there are a lot of ways to go crack the 5G nut with the right spectrum resources. And that is the piece we are focused on. Now when you say does unaided inorganic transactional spectrum will scale help you short those, the module for the company is to make sure that we have an incredibly strong organic path, not just for LTE and what happens in this marketplace for the next 2 to 3 years, but come the 5G story that will emerge and evolve around us in the \u201819-\u201920 timeframe. John Legere : Listen this. I appreciate everybody before I give Braxton the final word here. This was a long call. We covered a lot of ground. I hope, amongst other things, that you note our energy and enthusiasm not only for where the company is but for the environment we are in and the opportunities for our shareholders in many different paths down based on a built on a momentum of a business that I could not be prouder or happier about, and I appreciate you are hanging in there with lot of great questions sure we could go call for another hour. Braxton, the final words? Braxton Carter : Yes. Thanks everyone for tuning in and we\u2019ll look forward to speaking to you again next quarter. John Legere : Thank you very much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the T-Mobile US Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference. If you have any further questions, you may contact the Investor Relations or Media departments. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect and have a pleasant day.",

    "content": "\ufeff John Legere : Hello, everyone. It's that time again. One of my favorite times of every quarter, when we get to report our financial and operational results. However, with all the rumors and speculation out there, we decided that we wanted to make sure you all saw and focused on our Q3 results and not just on the rumors and speculation that seem to fill the news every day. What better way to do that than to do a video blog, so here we go. Q3 was another great quarter for T-Mobile across the board. We broke records with our financial results, delivered incredibly strong customer growth, and we're raising our guidance for 2017 once again. Back when we started this Un-carrier journey in 2013, we said customer growth will lead to revenue growth, which will lead to growth in adjusted EBITDA and ultimately, free cash flow. Well, these results make that pretty obvious. Should I just drop the mic now? If there are still skeptics out there after 4.5 years, let me take you through these numbers. Let's start with our record-breaking financial results. Our service revenue grew to $7.6 billion in Q3, the highest in T-Mobile history. We expect to be the only company in U.S. wireless, growing service revenues year-over-year, call that one of my famous predictions. As a reminder, both AT&T and Verizon have lower service revenues today than they did in the first quarter of 2013, when the Un-carrier started. Meanwhile, our service revenues are up nearly 50% since then. And it doesn't stop there. Adjusted EBITDA hit $2.8 billion for the quarter, our best Q3 ever. Free cash flow? Another record. We generated $921 million this quarter, up almost 60% year-over-year, and we're hitting these records while continuing to invest in the network with CapEx up 24% year-over-year. What's our secret? We actually like our customers, and we listen to them. Everyone should try it. Yes, it's simple, but it's something the duopoly just doesn't seem to understand.  Now on to customers. In Q3, we welcomed 1.3 million net new customers to T-Mobile. This is the 18th quarter in a row that we delivered over 1 million net adds. Yes, that's nearly half a decade. 595,000 of those customers were postpaid phone nets, and it looks like we'll lead the industry in this category for the 15th quarter in a row. We also continue to grow on the prepaid side, adding 226,000 new customers in Q3. In Q2, our prepaid ARPU hit a record high, and we just beat it again in Q3 with prepaid ARPU at $38.93. Our prepaid business is fueled by MetroPCS, a company that we acquired in 2013, the same year we started our Un-carrier revolution. Now that was an acquisition that delivered goodness to both shareholders and customers. As analysts have put it, we rewrote the book on telecom mergers and our MetroPCS customer base is set to double by the end of this year from the time of the acquisition.  Now I do want to take a second to talk about the impact of hurricanes during the quarter. First, I have to reiterate that our thoughts, prayers and our sympathies go out to everyone who is still dealing with the aftermath of these devastating storms. It's truly heartbreaking. I also want to sincerely thank all of the employees who came together to help those in need. It shows what T-Mobile is all about. Finally, Neville and his team are working around-the-clock in Puerto Rico to get our network up and running, as the hurricanes destroyed vital infrastructure. I'm incredibly proud of what they've accomplished so far, and we won't rest until the full network is up and running again. We are standing strong with Puerto Rico.  Our network is at the heart of T-Mobile and it powers everything we do. We set a goal years ago to have the best network in the United States. This was at a time when we had 0 LTE and 0 low band spectrum and today, we cover 316 million POPs of LTE, with 321 million POPs targeted by the end of this year. This will all be possible with the 700 megahertz we deployed, and now the 600 megahertz spectrum, some of which is already live today. Did I mention our new 600 megahertz sites are being launched with 5G-ready equipment? So exciting. When the time comes, we will literally turn on 5G with the flip of a switch, and as I've said many times before, we expect to be the first wireless provider with a nationwide 5G network. Our network continues to get even faster and once again, was the fastest LTE network in the country in Q3, with the gap to our competition widening more and more. That marks 15 quarters in a row with the fastest LTE. All of this hard work led to T-Mobile's network being ranked #1 in every single category in OpenSignal's recent report. You heard that right. T-Mobile is OpenSignal's new #1 network. We swept their most recent network award, something no major provider in the world has ever done. Verizon's network continues to struggle since we forced them to offer unlimited. Even with their best efforts to walk back their unlimited plans, their network is still choking. And their counterpart isn't doing much better. AT&T's taking all their declining businesses, bundling them together and begging customers to buy bloated and antiquated bundles. We attacked this pain point in Q3 with Netflix on us. Now America's best unlimited is even better.  Our network expansion has set the stage for us to really drive our expanded distribution, and we're taking full advantage of this opportunity. With 2,500 new Magenta and Metro stores already built this year, we're well on our way to our 3,000 new stores target for this year. Many of these stores are in places where T-Mobile has never had a presence before, and customers are so excited to see us come to town. This brings true competition to many rural areas who had no choice outside the duopoly. Our Q3 results show that the success of the Un-carrier continues. Q4 has already begun, and we're raising our guidance for 2017 again. We now expect to add 3.3 million to 3.6 million postpaid nets. That's up from 3 million to 3.6 million, previously. And we're raising adjusted EBITDA guidance for the second time in 2017. We expect adjusted EBITDA to land between $10.8 billion and $11 billion. That's up from $10.5 billion to $10.9 billion previously. As I close, I just want to thank our customers and congratulate our employees on another amazing quarter. We forced dramatic change in this industry, but we've got a lot more work to do to get it where it needs to be. So I'll end with the 3 words that delight our customers and terrify our competition, we won't stop.",

Welcome to the T-Mobile US Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to hand -- turn the conference over to Mr. Nils Paellmann, Head of Investor Relations for T-Mobile US. Please go ahead, sir. Nils Paellmann : Yes, thank you. Welcome to T-Mobile's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Earnings Call. With me today are John Legere, our President and CEO; Braxton Carter, our CFO; and other members of the senior leadership team. Let me read the disclaimer. During this call, we will make projections and statements about the future performance of the company, which are based on current expectations and assumptions. Our Form 10-K, which we also published this morning, includes risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Reconciliations between GAAP and the non-GAAP results we discuss on this call can be found in the Quarterly Results section of the Investor Relations page of our website. With that, let me turn it over to John Legere. John Legere : Okay. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to T-Mobile's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Earnings Call and Twitter Conference coming to you live from the Big Apple. It's hard to believe but it's been 5 full years since I called BS and declared war in the status quo of the wireless industry. It was January 2013 at CES when I broke the news that T-Mobile is going to take a stand against the stupid, broken, arrogant industry and we have. Fast-forward 5 years, and we see a very different picture. The Un-carrier has absolutely changed wireless for good, and our customer and financial growth reflects that. We went from approximately 33 million customers at the end of 2012 to nearly 73 million today. Think about that. We increased our customer count by over 39 million customers, more than double, all while Neville and his team turned a lagging 3G network into a blazing fast 4G LTE industry leader with a commitment on the books to launch the first nationwide 5G summary -- network. And the story continues. We already took the mystery, the start of the mystery, for Q4 away by dropping our incredible customer results at the city conference in January, so let me concentrate on the outstanding financials. We posted record results across the board in 2017. Service revenues grew by 8.3% to over $30 billion in 2017. The fourth quarter was our best quarter ever with $7.8 billion. By the way, we remain the only growth company in U.S. wireless. Total revenues grew by 8.3% to over $40 billion in 2017, and again, the fourth quarter was our best ever with $10.8 billion. Net income broke records too, with $4.5 billion in 2017, up 211%. Fourth quarter EPS was $3.11 a share, or $0.61 excluding the one-time tax gain. Braxton will provide you with some more details on the impact of tax reform in a minute.  Adjusted EBITDA amounted to a best ever $11.2 billion, up 5.4%, and that included a $201 million net impact from the hurricane. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was a Q4 record of $2.7 billion, up 4% including a net hurricane impact of $53 million. Speaking of hurricanes, I want to take a moment to commend our teams for the recovery efforts. Puerto Rico was particularly hard, and I had a chance to visit the island and witness the situation firsthand in December. While the recovery in the island still has a long way to go, T-Mobile's business recovery has been nothing short of remarkable. And today, 97% of our cell sites are back on air, 86% of our retail stores are open. In December, our stores in Puerto Rico had their best month on record. There's still a lot of work to do but I couldn't be more proud of what the team in Puerto Rico has accomplished and we will continue our own recovery efforts, and are committed to do what we can to help the island fully recover. Okay, back to these great financial results. Based on our very strong free cash flow, we initiated a share buyback program in December of 2017. As of February 5, we have bought back 12.3 million shares for a total of $783 million. So let's talk customer results. Now that all of our competitors have released their results, I get to deliver the verdict. With 891 postpaid -- 891,000 postpaid phone net adds in Q4, we captured more than twice the postpaid phone net adds of our next closest competitor, Verizon; more than 3x AT&T and almost 5x Sprint. This strong result was supported by our lowest ever Q4 postpaid phone churn of 1.18%, down 10 basis points year-over-year. With 1.9 million total net adds, we have captured over 1 million net adds for 19 quarters in a row. Also, we captured more than 5 million total net adds for the fourth year in a row, with the 2017 total coming in at 5.7 million. 2017 was also a transformational year for our network and our distribution footprint. We further closed the coverage GAAP, widened the speed GAAP, and built nearly 2,800 stores this year alone. At the end -- year-end, our network coverage reached 322 million POPs, exceeding our original target for 2017. In typical T-Mobile, or shall I say, Neville style, we are off to a running start on our 600 megahertz rollout. At year-end, we were live in 586 cities and towns in 28 states, already covering 300,000 square miles, and this pace will accelerate even faster in 2018. We already had launched 2 compatible phones during the holiday season, and we expect more than 12 new smartphones in 2018 to be 600-megahertz capable. Download and upload speeds continued to accelerate. In Q4, we were the first U.S. wireless provider to exceed 30 megs average download speed threshold, according to crowd-sourced third-party data, with a blazing fast 31.6 meg average. And OpenSignal, the global standard for measuring consumers' real-world mobile network experience, named T-Mobile as the winner in 5, count them, 5 categories in their recent report. Nearly 6 billion tests from actual customers of every major wireless network shows that T-Mobile's network is the fastest in the industry, and that T-Mobile customers get an LTE signal more often than AT&T, Sprint and even Verizon. Our network expansion has enabled our store expansion. In terms of the store rollout, we opened nearly 1,500 new T-Mobile stores, and more than 1,300 net new MetroPCS stores in 2017, and we're far from done. Our outlook for 2018 calls for 2 million to 3 million branded postpaid net customer additions, and adjusted EBITDA of $11.3 billion to $11.7 billion. We also increased our 3-year CAGRs for free cash flow. 2018 will be our best year yet. We've got a number of initiatives underway that will enable us to achieve our goals and raise the bar for our customers, and we'll do it all on a network that's second to none. 2017 was only the beginning of our expansion efforts. As our network expands, so too will our retail presence as we look to bring the Un-carrier to every corner of the U.S. and every segment of the market. I already covered our incredible distribution expansion, and we'll build on that in 2018 with an emphasis on greenfield markets, places that the Un-carrier hasn't had a presence before. Places where customers have only had a choice between bad and worse. We'll also continue to focus on new customer segments. Our Unlimited 55+ plan was a massive success, and we think there is some great upside in other segments too. Of course, T-Mobile for business remains a huge opportunity as more and more business and government customers of all sizes see the benefits that only T-Mobile can deliver. Remember, we only have a 2% to 3% market share in enterprise, so there's lots of room to run. Our Layer3 TV acquisition closed in January, and it's a major step in taking Un-carrier beyond wireless. This move represents a progression in our video strategy, which began with Binge On, was strengthened with Netflix On Us, and will expand further with Layer3 TV's management, technology and content relationships, which will enable us to bring the Un-carrier philosophy to video. We continue to believe that content is moving to the Internet, and the Internet is going mobile, creating multiple opportunities for T-Mobile to continue disrupting the existing landscape for the benefit of consumers everywhere. And to ensure that we deliver on our commitment to customer experience, we're working hard to simplify and completely transform our business with digital. Customers want simple and they expect end-to-end integration. A digital transformation drives efficiency in all aspects of our business, and allows us to deliver personalized customer experience at scale. Our innovative customer care model is delivering remarkable results and getting T-Mobile recognition from Nielsen and J.D. Power. The whole customer experience ecosystem benefits if we get digital right. And we are -- have already been making tons of progress. As I've said in the past, none of this would be possible without our network. It's our foundation and we expect to maintain our position as the fastest growing network in 2018. By the end of the year, we're targeting total population coverage of 325 million and geographic coverage of 2.5 million square miles. We'll accelerate our 600 megahertz rollout in 2018, while laying the foundation for the country's first nationwide 5G network by 2020. And this is just the start. As you can tell, we're incredibly confident in our future. Our 2018 guidance shows that we have no plans of letting up. Our CFO, Braxton Carter, will walk you through our financial highlights and the details of our guidance. Okay, Braxton, let's take a closer look. Braxton Carter : Well, thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. 2017 was another year of outstanding financial performance, executing on our strategy of balancing growth and profitability. Let me start with tax reform. Tax reform will be very beneficial to us, both through lower tax rates as well as the immediate expensing of CapEx for 5 years. The one-time gain due to the write-down of deferred tax liabilities in Q4 '17 amounted to $2.2 billion. EPS, excluding this one-time gain, was $0.61. The new normalized P&L tax rate is estimated to be 24% to 25% for 2018, a significant decline from our prior effective tax rate. As a result of tax reform, we don't expect to be a material cash taxpayer until 2024, compared to 2020 previously. We expect positive impact on free cash flow from 2020 to 2027 of $6.5 billion to $7 billion. Additionally, we do not anticipate any permanent interest expense disallowance in the future. Adjusted EBITDA in 2017 amounted to $11.2 billion, or $11 billion, excluding spectrum gains and leasing revenues of $877 million. This is at the top end of our guidance range of $10.8 billion to $11 billion, which itself has been increased twice during 2017. Note that reported adjusted EBITDA included a net impact from the hurricanes of $201 million and spectrum gains of $235 million in 2017. Adjusted EBITDA performance is a reflection of the strong cost performance, especially cost of services, which declined by 80 basis points as a percent of service revenues in 2017, excluding the impact from the hurricanes. SG&A also declined by 40 basis points as a percentage of service revenues in full year 2017, again, excluding the impact from the hurricanes. Free cash flow amounted to $2.7 billion in 2017, an increase of 90% over $1.4 billion in 2016. This was driven by the increase in net cash provided by operating activities, which was $8 billion, up 30%, partially offset by a higher CapEx, $5.2 billion, up 11%. As expected, prepaid phone ARPU remained generally stable in 2017. ARPU amounted to $46.97 in 2017, a decline of 1.1% compared to $47.47 in 2016. Excluding the impact of the hurricanes, ARPU amounted to $47.06 in 2017, a decline of 0.9%. This was impacted by the dilution from promotions targeting family plans in new segments. With regard to 2018, we continue to expect that ARPU for the full year will be generally stable compared to 2017. This does not include the impact of the new revenue recognition standard. In terms of customer quality, our results in the fourth quarter were very solid. Total bad debt expense from offsets from sale receivables were $147 million or a record low of 1.37% of total revenues, compared to $190 million or 1.86% in the fourth quarter of 2016, even with a significantly higher customer base. Total EIP receivables classified as prime, including EIP receivables sold, reached 54%, up both sequentially and year-over-year. Let me now come to our 2018 guidance. We expect branded postpaid net adds to be between 2 million and 3 million. You know our game plan. As we performed during the year, we will adjust this guidance as we demonstrate the growth that we're showing. The guidance also takes into account our desire to balance growth and profitability. The lower switcher volumes we've seen in recent quarters, and our pursuit of growth adjacencies, which we expect will afford us the opportunity to be less promotional in existing markets. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $11.3 billion to $11.7 billion, not including the impact of the new revenue recognition standard. This guidance takes into account an expected decline in leasing revenues in 2018. Our target is 600 million to 700 million in 2018, compared to 877 million in 2017, as well as our build-out of low-band spectrum, including the accelerated rollout of 600 megahertz, driving up cost of services by 300 million to 400 million year-over-year. This investment will provide a tremendous growth opportunity for years to come, and sets the stage for a nationwide 5G network. The new revenue recognition standard will increase adjusted EBITDA by another $0.2 billion to $0.5 billion for a total range of adjusted EBITDA of $11.5 billion to $12.2 billion. We target cash CapEx of $4.9 billion to $5.3 billion, excluding capitalized interest. This includes expenditures for 5G deployment. Finally, we expect free cash flow defined as net cash provided by operating activities minus cash CapEx to increase at a 3-year CAGR of 46% to 48% from full year 2016 to full year 2019, up from the prior range of 45% to 48%. During the same period, we expect the underlying net cash provided by operating activities to increase at a CAGR of 16% to 18%, up from the prior range of 15% to 18%. These increases are after considering the impacts of the approved $1.5 billion stock buyback. Let me be clear that our guidance is on the basis of accounting standards as of December 31, 2017. On top of that, in 2018, we expect the following impacts from the adoption of the new revenue standard : total revenues, up $0.3 billion to $0.5 billion; net income, up $0.2 billion to $0.4 billion; adjusted EBITDA, up $0.2 billion to $0.5 billion. We expect postpaid phone ARPU to be negatively impacted from changes in revenue allocation under the new standard. In addition, the adoption of the new cash flow standard will result in a reclassification of cash flows. In Q1 2018, we plan to redefine free cash flow to reflect these changes and present cash flows on a consistent basis for investor transparency. And of course, it will be a full reconciliation. Now let's get to your questions. You could ask questions via phone, text message or via Twitter or Facebook. We will start with a question on the phone. Operator, first question, please? Operator : [Operator Instructions]. We can now take our first question. It comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Simon Flannery : You talked a lot about 5G and the 600 rollout. There's been a little bit of an arms' race during this earning season to get out first, discussions about the low band, high band and so forth. So John and Neville, it will be great to just get a perspective of where you see the 600 fitting into that ecosystem. And I think you've also expressed a lot of interest in the 3.5 gigahertz as well. And then John, maybe -- or you can give us some updated porting information quarter-to-date. John Legere : Well, let's do this. At the risk of losing the entire 1.5 hours, I'll start the 5G item and give it to Neville, and then he can come -- throw it back to me. But Simon, I just -- I think your definition of it as an arms' race portrays some of the mass confusion that the market in the United States must have about what 5G is. What its opportunity is, when it's going to be delivered. And I thought one of the pinnacles of that was -- remember, this is one Super Bowl after the Super Bowl that Lowell McAdams predicted that you would sit at the Super Bowl and have the massive impact of 5G waving over you as your world was permanently changed.  And I think Alexander Graham Bell McAdams in effect took a 5G tablet and used 28-gig spectrum to go to a hotspot in the building and make a call, which is not even as cool as being able to do broadband access replacement. But it was basically hilarious to see him staring at a tablet saying, Hello, can you hear me? This is clearly not what 5G is. It's not the time frame where it's going to be. And I think one of the big problems we have is, AT&T and Verizon, in particular, who have lost or never had competitive network, are now trying to recapture the network brand by defining 5G in something that's only attainable by them. So with that, I'll go to Neville, because this item is one of the most important educational phenomenons, because clearly 5G will bring gigantic benefits of spectral efficiency and faster speeds and longer battery life, 10x, 20x in these categories, as well as the ability to connect millions of devices. But it will be in all spectrum bands and it will be over time, and it will require some of what we've got a glimpse that the government was worrying about, which is people need more spectrum. They need siting help. They need a lot of push for the country to succeed in this, and it may even drive industry structure questions. So it's a great topic. But it sure as hell isn't a 2018 arms' race. And with that, Neville, take a quick shot at it and send it back to me and I'll give porting numbers beyond your wildest imagination. Neville Ray : You covered most of it, John. Just real quickly, Simon, to fill in. I mean, obviously, you mentioned 600 megahertz. We had a massive success in the spectrum auction last year. $8 billion worth of spectrum increased our holdings by 39% as a company. So we've been really, really busy putting that spectrum to work. You heard from John in the opening comments, we've already put a footprint down at 300,000 square miles on 600 megahertz. That's 3x the size of U.K., twice the size of Germany, bigger than France, to put it into perspective. That's a lot of territory on spectrum that we just got into our hands. And to your question on 5G, the hardware that's hitting the ground is 5G-capable. And so we've been very clear from the outset that we'll launch 5G services in 2019, leveraging 600 megahertz, and we'll do that when the software is available, which will be early in '19, and when the handsets are available, so smartphones are available, which will be first half of next year. In addition to that on the millimeter wave side, not to forget, we have 200 megahertz of millimeter wave spectrum across 100 million POPs in the U.S,. and in key urban environments like New York, L.A., Miami, and we will start to deploy that capability towards the end of this year. And again, smartphones will be coming onboard in the first half of '19. And that will be in those dense urban areas where you want to start maximizing speed and capacity. So we've got great book ends on the low band. The low-band spectrum will do many of the things John talked about on smartphones. It will also open up this massive set of opportunities on 5G in the Internet of Things space, where you can connect everything that can be connected. Sensor networks, massive connectivity, very, very low battery life. So that's a really exciting space that we intend to be extremely active in, and nobody can match us at this point in time on that low-band capability in 5G. So that's going to be a really, really exciting space for us. And I think this year, just on Verizon and AT&T, I think Verizon doing everything they can to back out of the dead-end street on fixed broadband displacement using millimeter wave. It's a pre-standard system. They'll have to rip and replace almost everything they put on the ground between now and the end of the year. That's why the ambition is so small and so, not very excited about that. And then AT&T, finally, thank them for joining our camps saying 5G is really about mobility. But the devices they're going to bring on this year probably in 39 gigahertz is just going to be kind of a broadband device and mobile perk. So realistically, the race is on for 5G. It's going to hit the mobile space. It's going to be there in the first half of '19, and we're going to be really busy and really relevant. John Legere : So Simon, the second half of your question, which I can also have the -- I'm watching a flurry of tweets come in from Walt Piecyk, which is wonderful, because I hear he has no voice from losing his voice at the Eagles' game. And I -- I'm not sure if it was true, but I heard he was one of the 3 people that punched a police horse. So I'll have this to be -- I want to -- excuse me, one of his answer. So porting, postpaid phone porting -- postpaid porting is really a fascinating look underneath what's happening competitively. And it shouldn't surprise you that the trend has been as follows : the overall postpaid porting in Q3 for T-Mobile versus the industry was 1.53:1; which in Q4, was 1.68:1; which so far in Q1 is 1.73:1. And on each carrier, or let's just pick a couple, because like there was a small sigh as AT&T announced their numbers and people were thinking, Oh, whoa, it's me. The porting with AT&T in Q3 was 1.71; in Q4, it was 1.83; and so far in Q4, it's -- I mean, in Q1, it's 1.84. Let's touch Verizon, because that's always fascinating. Q3, 1.6; Q4, 1.7; Q1, 1.91. Sprint is -- Q3 was 1.24; Q4 was 1.45; and right now, it's about 1.4. So relatively stable. So steady as she goes with T-Mobile. And let's just remember that the 891,000 postpaid phones that we took in Q4, that happens to add up to the 430,000 that Verizon had, 280,000 AT&T had, and 180,000 that Sprint had. But for the year, we took 2.82 million of the 3.6 million, and let's remember, that AT&T lost 570,000 postpaid phones for the year, counting the 280,000 that they bought and stuffed in their bag, and defined as something that really impacted their margin and profitability, which is certainly not something that they can do too many times. So that's the competitive landscape. I'm not sure what it is between all those characters, but it's steady as she goes for T-Mobile. Operator : We can now move along to our next audio question. It comes from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan. Philip Cusick : John, let me just follow up on that. Can you talk about the industry strength in postpaid this quarter and the year? Including Comcast, the industry up about 15% in postpaid. And your thoughts on the sustainability of that. And do you think it's a coincidence that industry prepaid adds have slowed at the same time? Or is there a reason that customers are shifting upward? John Legere : Well I think, Phil, I would say -- we, as well as you, were a little bit surprised because you generally think you know the size of the industry pool, and the anomaly this quarter was the AT&T numbers, which I hope you're all still digging into. We obviously published very explicit information about the migration from prepaid to postpaid, which is a tremendous feeder pool. Our 149,000 prepaid nets we felt was very strong, part of our 855,000. The anomaly, of course, is -- AT&T, I believe, is the only carrier that I ever heard of that actually has postpaid to prepaid migration as well. So that's another item, they don't really make it easy for you to see. And this competitive items for AT&T -- it was kind of funny because, think about this, a lever that AT&T feels like that they can pull is that they tell the customer base that for a limited time only, you can get unlimited without having to take DirecTV. And that's kind of a lever that works for them. It's amongst their base. And so when they ultimately release the shackles of a DirecTV and do a BOGO without a porting requirement and an add a line, that's a costly temporary way to -- and I don't fully understand all of what they did, but again, it's a blip. They announced it as something that they acquired. It sounds like window dressing to me. And frankly, I continue, and I'm sure you all are too, but you're just being polite. To be astonished at the lack of success or ability to enter wireless in any scale by the cable players.  The 180,000 adds in that base in a year cost of $412 million with a stated intent to grow similar in that range for another year and lose a total of $1.2 billion, that's kind of an admission that the MVNO contract sucks and nobody's interested in the Wi-Fi phone, and we're just going to sit on our hands and decide what to do later. But it's very irrelevant. And I would assume Charter will be irrelevant squared. So I'm not sure I understand that anomaly in the industry, but I think it wasn't that big of a blip. Our -- all I know is our trends, our postpaid, our prepaid was kind of in line with what we thought would happen. Philip Cusick : Let me follow up. This is a lower postpaid guide for adds than we've seen in the last couple of years. And Braxton, it's funny you're already talking it up a little bit. But are you building in some maybe cable gets more aggressive cushion? John Legere : No. First of all, I think last year, we forecast 2.4 to 3.4. Does that originally... Braxton Carter : No. The original guidance matched exactly what we just did for the first quarter. John Legere : So this is -- I always expect a windfall of -- yes, they are low guiders. Remember, we never missed anything. We like that trend. Golf is won or lost on the first tee and we're negotiating strokes here, so we like this guidance. But I would say the furthest thing from my mind is any concern about the impact of cable. First of all, I think they're incompetent and they don't belong in wireless without having owner economics. 500 stores across the country, telling people in Manhattan your closest store is in Long Island is crazy. An MVNO that doesn't work. Wi-Fi is not a way to play this game. And I think from a standpoint of their impact, I think their impact will be to grab customers sideways from the other big model. And so I mean, I think Verizon and Comcast are going to try to pick each other's pockets. I mean, I think Verizon's enthusiasm about doing their 5G tablet calls on at the Super Bowl are that they're praying to have some sort of broadband access capability to the home to compete with a Comcast. So that -- no, I don't see any impact to us at all. And yes, we are very conservative in our guidance. And let's see how you feel about that conversation a year from now. Braxton Carter : Phil, if you go back and look, the guide on the postpaid phone -- postpaid growth is exactly the same this year as it was last year. And the game plan that we have done every year for the last 5 years, is conservatively position the growth equation and a much higher aspiration built into the adjusted EBITDA. And for -- going into the fifth full year, we've never not hit or exceeded our guidance. And consistently we have narrowed, and when appropriate, increased the postpaid growth as we demonstrate that growth during the year. So it's exactly the same thing. We talk about it exactly the same way that we have for the last 5 years. John Legere : Color us not afraid of their cable inside-out strategy. I mean it sounds like being sheltered inside your house with a Wi-Fi connection and looking out in the gigantic United States and saying, Hey, we're going to go cover that next. I'd rather be outside looking in. Operator : We can then move along to our next question. It comes from Jonathan Chaplin of New Street Research. Jonathan Chaplin : I'd like to pick up, John, on the comment you made briefly about changes in the industry maybe needing to precipitate a change in industry structure. With the sort of opportunity with Sprint looking like it's passed, where do you see the opportunities for a change in industry structure, John? Is it the fact that cable is incompetent in acquiring subs, and so they need to acquire you? And in early last year, you thought there was sort of potentially really good opportunities with DISH. Is that still an opportunity? Or are there other deals that you see happening in the industry to fix the industry structure? John Legere : Yes. Good question. In this -- I think I've been consistent on this all along, so let's just update my view. Nothing is off the table. Why would anything be off the table? Why would anything be passed? The capabilities and the assets of all of us are the same with their strengths and limitations. The trends of the industry are going in the same directions. All content going the Internet, Internet is going mobile. So you can see, and I think what happened so far is, there was already a little bit of waiting around to see what happens, Charter and Comcast agreed to not to agree to do anything for a year, and let's hold hands and make believe we're not interested in wireless and see what happens with Sprint and T-Mobile, and Charley's for this 27th time playing his hand out. I think the AT&T Time Warner got a surprise extension. Just put everything on a hold for a while. But my belief is that there is a huge pent-up bubble of logical things that need to happen for customers to be served. I also believe that, that 5-minute flash scare that we were going to have, the DMV of 5G networks run by the United States government, was a wake-up call of the magnitude that needs to happen for all of the players in the industry to get that infrastructure to be globally competitive in the United States. So I think there is going to be policy action, there is going to be spectrum deployed, there's going to be siting assistance. And I think they'll also start to be, I believe, an industry structure analysis around the benefits of deploying such a scalable capability. So I think that changes the math of whether or not consolidation within players could be doable. So is there a possibility in the future that T-Mobile could do something with DISH or Sprint or U.S. Cellular or -- yes. Is there a possibility the Comcast or a Charter could do something with us or to us or around us? Yes. Will I believe that some of that will happen? I believe all of that will happen. It's not a matter of if, it's a matter of when. And I think there'll be more, and I think there'll be -- my belief is that the pace at which these things are thought about and are going on, and I'm not even going to touch content yet, I think it's actually accelerating behind-the-scenes and will -- I think, it'll -- some of those things will happen sooner than most people think. Jonathan Chaplin : A quick follow-up. Some of your comments about cable because you're a little bit bummed that they are rolling out 6G while you're only rolling out 5G. John Legere : Yes. You know what? I thought Verizon had the lead on creating something that was fake. That 6G was the best thing I've ever heard. And the only thing I'm shocked at is that Sprint didn't announce 7G the next day. Operator : We can now move along to our next audio question. It comes from Matthew Niknam of Deutsche Bank. Matthew Niknam : Just two, if I could. One, on the competitive backdrop. So I'm wondering, is this more of a new normal in terms of your go-to-market with a more balanced approach to growth and profitability? Just given that 1Q has typically been your sort of countercyclical pedal to the metal but a little bit more aggressive marketing. We have not, at least to-date, seen much of a shift from you guys in 1Q. So wondering what's changed potentially, if anything, in terms of addressable market. And then secondly, on tax reform. Just given the cash savings, how would you should think about potential accelerating network investment in '18 versus the current guide that implies more flattish trends? John Legere : Okay. On two fronts. I'll start and give it to Mike and then Braxton. But on the -- are we going to be competitive in Q1? The only thing I can say is, it's only Wednesday. And pretty clearly, our game plan hasn't changed. And one of the things that I think you're onto, and I think we've demonstrated very strongly, is we are all about balancing growth and profitability, right? And I think we do that very well. And I would say -- I don't think this is more arrogant than I usually am, but the -- we took 50% of the industry postpaid phone in Q4, and we absolutely could have taken more. I'm saying we -- not that we chose that number, but we definitely chose how we would participate, and that's why these financials are so strong and we'll continue to play in that range. We took 80% of the year. By the way, last year in 2016, we took over 100% of the postpaid phones in the industry. So we'll watch this very carefully and balance growth and profitability. And you can see if in a quarter where we're focused on profitability, we have 891,000 postpaid phones, then I think we've got it dialed in pretty well. The free cash flow that we're going to start generating is phenomenal. And when you look at the 46% to 48% growth and you look at the ending year at $2.7 billion, we've got a pretty good machine going here that we're going to continue. So you want to talk about offers? And then you talk about the taxes. Michael Sievert : Well, I'll just pile on one thing you just said. I mean, Matthew, another way to think about the fact that we took 50% of postpaid phone growth in the fourth quarter is that we took the same amount of growth in postpaid phones as ATT-plus-Verizon-plus-Sprint combined. And if that's balanced, then yes, I think we're a balanced player and we have been a balanced player all along. We -- this is an outstanding growth story. But unlike some companies who deliver an outstanding growth story, we're delivering the financials as we go along. And we're really excited about this massive delivery of cash flow and the fact that we're able to increase our cash flow guidance yet again this quarter. So we're delivering as we go. As for this quarter, I -- we -- balance doesn't mean we're going to sit on the sidelines. We're -- John showed you our port ratios have improved already versus last quarters, excellent ratios versus the competitors. And we have it to your point, that's in a part of the quarter where we really haven't put our foot on the pedal yet. And you can certainly expect that we will. Braxton Carter : Yes. Man, I'm really glad you brought up the tax reform. But to answer your question specifically and then make a couple of additional comments is, if you look back over the last five years, we've always met or exceeded our guidance. And then we've never had a downward or negative revision to our guidance. I think one particular thing about 2017 is for the first time ever, you saw us raise EBITDA guidance twice during the year. And that was the first time that, that had happened along with the progression of our growth throughout the year. Our CapEx guidance for the year fully includes everything that we plan to do. If you look at the history there, we've always been right on guidance, sometimes close to the midpoint, sometimes up to the top end of the guidance. But absolutely, everything is fully embedded in what we anticipate from a CapEx standpoint. And we've also consistently discussed that we don't see any large step function increase in CapEx when we look out into the future. It's been going up. It's been going up slightly every year. But Neville has always had a project. And as we complete these projects, significant dollars roll into the next project. And I think it's really innovative and really industry-leading that Neville is getting so far ahead on the 5G bill. With touching the towers on the 600 megahertz, that's expensive. And again, that's fully included in here, but he is deploying a hardware that's 5G capable that all it's going to take is a software upgrade when the standards get developed. So that foundation is being laid in. You've heard us talk about 25,000 small cells in some of the most dense, most difficult to zone parts of the country. There's a lot of foresight that's happening here. And historically, there's been a lot of foresight. Neville really pioneered laying a fiber backbone and interconnect in place on the ran well before other people were going down that path. The facts kind of speak for themselves. But back to the cash, we have a motherload of cash coming. The guidance, and -- I challenge you to find anybody who's growing cash like that within our sector or even more broadly in telecom, but what's happening between '17 and '19, it's almost $10 billion worth of cash generation. And with the push out of the NOLs due to the immediate expensing of CapEx, not only does our trend of increasing cash flow continue, we have a significant upside in value. And what it translates to is incredible financial flexibility. We instituted our first buyback based upon what we thought was really opportunistic given where the stock is trading at versus our views on future cash generation. We're talking about doing tuck-in acquisitions. We do have spectrum auctions coming that we certainly will be a participant in. Don't expect to spend anything like we did in the 600, but we will be players there. But all this translates into incredible potential in the future to do things like return cash to shareholders, have very strategic tuck-in acquisitions, continue the significant success-based investments in the network. And that is the story and that's going to be the future driver of value creation. And it's all underpinned by the best network in the country, which is improving day by day and the incredible work that Mike's doing in innovation, and we've got a lot of momentum. So we're very, very, very comfortable. John Legere : Okay, before we go back to operator, I'm going to go into one of the Twitter messages from the T-Mobile IR handle. Bill Howe [ph] has been an avid sender of messages, so we're coming your way. One of the many is, as T-Mobile business ramps and contributes to the growth story, provide elaboration on penetration beyond small biz and into enterprise. Go beyond line revenue on to different upsell services, et cetera. So as we introduced in my comments, and I'll turn to Mike, this is one of the significant growth areas for the company, and not way in the future but right now. And there's reasons why as the network has started to really be able to perform, why enterprise and business customers are far likely to be able to test it and move to it than a consumer in an immediate fashion. But Mike why don't you talk about this one. Michael Sievert : That's right, in fact, in some ways, our business success may be foreshadowing our ability to continue to generate consumer success because a business sale is a considered sale. Unlike consumers, they actually take that product out and test it extensively before picking us. And man, are they picking us. Just a few quick stats. So this year, in 2017, for the first time, over 20% of our postpaid net add performance was in the business sector, which was a terrific step-up. And in fact, outside of retail, which is where all of the development of larger businesses built, to the premise of your question, comes from, our year-over-year growth in our flow was 94% in '17 versus '16. So it really shows that what -- in -- on the heels of this network expansion that Neville and team have pulled off, businesses are rushing in. And what's interesting is we're also winning sort of torture test style customers.  We're in 4 of the 5 big airlines, of the biggest airlines. We're in 4 of the 8 biggest technology companies. We're in 35 of 50 state governments now. 40% of the Fortune 1000 are at least doing some business with us, and most are deepening their relationships. The biggest consulting companies in the world, the biggest hotel chains in the world. So people who really care about coverage and network performance are choosing us at record rates, and it's a nice -- nice to see. And to the premise of your question, we're just getting started because we actually aren't deep yet in being able to offer a broad range of solutions to these customers, and they're now coming for us asking for us to have a significant seat at a more strategic table with them. So we're excited about where we sit. John Legere : Perfect. Operator, let's go back to the phone for the 5G pathway. Operator : We can then move along to our next audio question. It comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Brett Feldman : Braxton, you talk about the importance of balancing growth in the top line and growth in the bottom line. I was hoping you could talk a bit about where you see the primary levers of driving more operating leverage going forward. So, for example, you're going to spend a little bit more on cost of service this year as you build out 600 megahertz. As you think out over the next few years, what are the big cost buckets that you can attack in order to continue to scale your margins as you scale your customer base? And then Neville, a kind of a follow-up question to Phil's about the strength that we saw on the postpaid. You've had unlimited as a lead product offer for several quarters now. I was hoping you could give us a little bit of visibility into the usage there. And I'm curious whether you're seeing any patterns that suggest people are using your unlimited plans as a replacement for fixed line broadband. Braxton Carter : Yes, Brent. Yes, So from a 600 megahertz standpoint, we were very clear that there's going to be a step-up in cost of service related to the geographical expansion of our network to create a commercial-grade quality coverage that supports the geographical distribution. And when we look at our confidence in being a growth company for many years to come, Mike talked about the business segment which has incredible opportunity for us. But the other is the expansion to the -- of our distribution to the other third of the country that we really haven't played in for the last five years. And there's 100 million people there where we virtually have no penetration, and it's going to be an amazing growth adjacency. But there has to be some upfront investment to create that commercial-grade quality to bring those customers on, and then we'll significantly scale that investment over the next several years. And some of these early results are just astounding in these greenfield markets. And all of our expansion in the upcoming year is going to really be tied to these greenfield markets, and it's going to be a tremendous opportunity. And between the business and the geographical expansion of our distribution, it will allow us to actually be more efficient in the 2/3 and then the old way that we've always done business in 2/3 of the country. So it's going to create even a double whammy on margin expansion. And let me put everything into context. We're still scaling our margins, growing like we're growing. If our growth significantly moderated, you would see a massive explosion of margins. But this is an acquisition-based model. There's a cost to bring the customers in, and nobody is growing like we're growing. And that's a trade-off worth making because it's that growth and the unlock of leveraging the fixed costs that we have in this business that ultimately give us the ability to close the gap on margins at both Verizon and AT&T, be it non-growth companies in wireless, achieve on a daily basis. I'm going to create a lot more terminal value. But we've always had a philosophy of balance. We could have grown much, much more. You heard John say it in the fourth quarter. We've said that before in the fourth quarters, but it really holds true on a year-to-year basis. We believe the right path to credibility and value creation is consistent execution of our strategy. Neville Ray : Brett, I mean, I think if you look at our customer base, obviously we've had unlimited in the marketplace for a long period of time, and you saw the struggles of our competitors as they introduced unlimited in '17. We have the most satisfied customers in the industry, looking at any number of different benchmarks and consumer feedback studies. We have customers that consume the highest volume of data. And to boot, we have the highest-performing LTE network. So we're the fastest network again in Q4 of '17. That's 16 quarters, I think, 4 years in a row, where we've just been killing it on LTE. And here's the fun piece. I mean, I'll just tie in some of the 5G stuff that came up earlier on. If we think anything that's happening from Verizon and AT&T in the 5G space in '18 or '19 is going to make one iota of difference in this industry, we're all -- you're all mistaken. I mean, this industry is going to compete around LTE well into the next decade. That's where the majority of terminals and customers live today, and that's how it's going to be for a material period of time. And so we're in this very, very strong position of strength. We're the best-performing LTE network in the nation. And we've been working through how to expand and deal with capacity and growth on this network for a number of years, and we have a very, very rich pipeline not just to introduce 5G in the '19 time frame, as we said at the beginning, but to continue to add to the capabilities and performance of our LTE network. So I'm very comfortable where we are. The second part of your question, Brett, was about other customers where we're their only connection to the Internet today. And sure, that's the case for many customers. Does that mean that we are a -- we're committed to being a fixed substitution player? At some point in time, maybe we'll introduce product lines in that space. But believe me, the millimeter wave story and what Verizon has been touting, now AT&T has backed away from is plagued with challenges, and I think everybody has woken up to that. 28 gigahertz, the outside in story, is extremely difficult. And it's somewhat ironic with Verizon who tout reliability as the poster child for -- supposedly in the industry, and yet they're committing to try and deliver fixed broadband in the most unreliable fashion known to man, on 28-gig outdoor in. So it's going to be very, very challenging to really disrupt that space from a wireless perspective in the way they're approaching with 5G. But we're going to be very, very focused driving that LTE performance and strength. We're not taking one eye off the ball with what we're doing on LTE because that's how we will win over the next 3 years. And we will not miss anything on the 5G front. Operator : We can now move along to our next question. It comes from Michael Rollins of Citi. Michael Rollins : I was curious if you could help us on the capital allocation front and talk about your aspirations for investment-grade debt ratings, how that then works into a net debt leverage target range. And then finally, how you think about the pacing of buybacks and returning capital with respect to maybe staying somewhere within the range that you've set. Braxton Carter : Yes. John Legere : I just want to stop for a moment and acknowledge the fact that we're having this discussion about investment grade. I mean, just -- I just love the question. It's really -- we should have a moment to cherish that. Okay, go ahead. Braxton Carter : Yes, you know what's really interesting, Michael, is we just did a $5 billion debt raise timed very, very well in the marketplace, where the spreads are basically already investment grade regardless of the ratings. And the 8-year money and the 10-year money, if you look at the 10-year, we're within 50 basis points of where AT&T raises their 10-year money at. And a little bit higher, a little bit wider spread with Verizon but well within 1 percentage point of where Verizon raises their 10-year money. And by any question or any measurement, that essentially already is an investment-grade item. We're delevering a little bit. We called $1 billion worth of bonds at the beginning of the year, so our gross debt is going down. With the improvements in the fundamentals of the business and the cash flow, we continue to expect that we will be IT rated at some point in the future. But that really isn't a goal to have those ratings this year or necessarily next year. It's more of a midterm aspiration. I talked a little bit about this on the investor call that we had on our debt raise. It's really kind of a medium-term aspiration. And what really matters is how do we execute in the market versus what our actual rating is. I can tell you that we have not changed our capital policy. It's still 3 to 4x. There's times we'll be below it. There's times we'll be up in that range depending on just what's going on and what inorganic opportunity is out there in front of us. But it all points to incredible flexibility. And as we get closer to that true investment-grade ratings from Moody's, S&P and Fitch, we will certainly have to do a revision in that targeted leverage policy as part of that ratings upgrade. But that's not the focus again this year or next year. That's really to come in the future. I talked a little bit about the amazing cash story here. And if you look at our forward multiples as a percentage of cash flow, even as to what we've guided, let alone what you're going to see in '20, '21, '22, we're a very, very affordable stock as compared to other comps that are out there.  And that's why we're doing the buyback at this point. It makes a lot of sense to invest back into our stock when we know what the potential is and the confidence that we have of the value creation that's going to be here. And to that point, not only are we doing it, DT is doing it. DT is providing no shares to sell related to the buyback, and they've said that they are going to actually be buying our stock. Now it's up to them to announce when that's going to happen and how much that's going to happen. And when the time is appropriate, they will certainly put that out there. But with this amount of cash generation, we do think that there's going to be significant opportunity in the future to do additional buybacks, and that's going to definitely be part of our strategy going forward. John Legere : Okay. And before we move to the next question on the phone, I'm going to take a couple that are coming in. It's really easy one here. It comes from Robbie, which says, I'm thinking about switching. How is T-Mobile service? Hopefully, you're listening to this call. T-Mobile service is incredible. My email is john.legere@t-mobile.com, and I will personally help you move from godawful whatever place you're at. Secondly, in -- there's a number of questions coming in that are asking for some update on what are our plans around the closing of the deal of Layer3 TV, which is really something exciting. So Mike, why don't you just give a couple of minutes on that and we'll -- then we'll move back? Michael Sievert : Yes, thanks for all the interest. Most of the questions are tell us your plans, which, of course, we're not able to do that. Last time we talked about this, we said we would be coming out with something in 2018, and that's the case. But this market is just fascinating. I mean, customers are leaving traditional linear TV at historic rates, 2% and 3% in some categories per quarter. And younger people, 25% -- 35% per year declines in some categories. And so -- and there's a reason for that. It's like you're -- where you really live your digital life, your phone, your tablet, it's like it never met your TV. And we -- the eyeballs are moving to phones for a reason because everything is more engaging in a mobile and social fueled world. The videos come at you in a way that's -- that draws you in. And then you sit down in front of your great, big TV panel, and then -- and you pick up a plastic remote control and you get a program guide. And it's no wonder people are fleeing that. I got news for you. Young people don't hate 4K panels with HDR video quality. What they hate is what's being served up to them on those panels and how antiquated it is and how non-engaging it is compared to the highly targeted social- and mobile-fueled content that they can get on their phone. So we're bringing those worlds together, and I'm excited about what it'll look like. I can't give you all the plans yet but stay tuned. This is about bringing the Un-carrier philosophy to this marketplace because people aren't getting something that's engaging to them on those TVs. It's not connected to their mobile life and their phone well enough. And by the way, the business practices of these companies, both cable and satellite, are appalling. If -- arguably, they're worse than wireless was when we launched the Un-carrier in 2013. Stay tuned. Operator : We can now move along to our next question. It comes from John Hodulik of UBS. John Hodulik : Maybe to just follow up on a couple other things. And Mike, your comments and maybe connect the dots a little bit. As mobile 5G gets rolled out and you guys are using the 600 megahertz spectrum, which propagates very well and goes -- moves through walls very well, and you're digesting Layer 3, I mean, can we expect, as that mobile fabric gets rolled out, a sort of wireline replacement service for both broadband and video, that's number one, especially sort of given the much lower cost per bid that you guys will be generating with the new infrastructure? Number two, it sounds like you're using the 600 megahertz spectrum as a primary fabric for 5G. AT&T recently sold a decent size chunk of -- or all of their winnings in the auction to largely private equity investors. Why weren't you interested in that spectrum, especially since they, I think, sold it effectively at cost? So that's number one. And then number two, just some follow-up on ARPU. Was there much impact from the Netflix promotion? And maybe sort of what you really expect to see as we adopt the new rev rec standards. John Legere : With the Internet TV question, I mean, one of the things that makes our approach to video and TV different is that it only requires an Internet connection. And as you know, we launched into this with Binge On. We made it better with Netflix On Us. But the infrastructure that our customers need to be able to enjoy video on their mobile devices and ultimately in their homes is an Internet connection, something that ultimately, we are a bigger and bigger and more important player in. We are a major broadband company, and 5G only takes away further the distinctions between wireless and wireline that have traditionally been in place. And so as a major provider of Internet services, it makes sense that we provide access to the content that Internet is most famous for, which is video content. So we're excited about that. John Legere : I'll start, Neville, on this. It sort of reminds me like when I was young. And if I did something bad, I would like throw a rock through a window, and my mother would say, Why did you do that? And I'd say, Well, Dave did it. And she would say, Well, that's not a good reason. And I sort of feel that way when you say, well, AT&T did something stupid. Why didn't you do that? By the way, why didn't Verizon, who is really strapped for spectrum, show up for the low-band auction? Why didn't Comcast stay in? These are dumb strategic moves. AT&T is completely directionless right now and attempting to change their whole business out of the wireless industry into something else. So I don't think we can look at these short term. We love the low-band spectrum that we got. We love its use right now. We love it as a base for 5G. That's not all we're going to do in 5G. By the time 5G is fully deployed as an industry, it will be in every spectrum band, and we will be participating in a lot of ways either through acquisition of spectrum, acquisition of companies, mergers and consolidation. There's so much going to happen here. But I think we can talk about what does it mean for us right now. What are we going to do in the 600? What capability will that bring? But that's no more the full portfolio of capability of 5G than Alexander Graham Bell McAdams tablet is. I mean, it's a big game. But Neville, [indiscernible]? Neville Ray : Why, I think, you covered it, John. I mean, I think you have to ask AT&T, Mike, what -- why we weren't engaged in that 600 megahertz opportunity that recently appeared. So they did very badly in the auction, and they've offloaded spectrum that they really didn't know what to do with because they didn't buy that much. But, I mean, history will tell us, I mean, I think huge mistake from Verizon and AT&T to miss out on an opportunity to put fresh greenfield spectrum in their hands for 5G. And that's what we're going to do with it, and we bought a boatload of it. And so that's the opportunity they missed out on. Can they do much more in the low-band space over the next 2 to 3 years? It's going to be really, really difficult for them. So them offloading that spectrum didn't necessarily surprise me. Did they ask us? Well, not really, so. Braxton Carter : On your final question on the ARPU, one of the things we pride ourselves is giving more transparency on our results than any other wireless carrier that reports. And on the rev rec, there will be a negative impact on ARPU. We really haven't quantified it. But more importantly, what we'll do throughout the year is show ARPU on a pre-standard and post-standard basis so you will fully understand the impact to the new revenue standard on ARPUs. And Netflix is a contra revenue, where a lot of the Un-carrier things that we do, do have a cost component to it that typically shows up in the cost sections. Because of the construct of our contract with Netflix, it is contra revenue, it is decretive to ARPU and it's just really an accounting on geography issue. It is a piece of the equation. I mean, we're calling it out. It will grow in the future as our penetration in Netflix grows, but there's a lot of puts and takes to ARPU, both positive and negative, and it's something that we're very focused on, and we're reinforcing that we expect generally stable ARPU. And compared to everybody else, that's a great position to be in. John Legere : Okay, before we go back to the questions on the phone, there are a number of other items coming in, and I'll just lump one together. It has a lot to do with updating our distribution, which we touched slightly in the expansion. And I -- the numbers are staggering. Again, when we -- when I kind of poked fun at somebody with limited distribution, you have to understand 2 big trends are taking place at T-Mobile. One is that the network is now moving to covering virtually the entire United States. And we had an effort under way in the last 15 to 18 months to migrate the distribution to start to catch up. And what we said and what we've done is we covered an additional 30 million POPs with our distribution. So we now cover about 260 million. And in 2017, we opened 2,800 new doors. That was 1,300 Metro, 1,500 T-Mobile. And just to update you, we now have 5,300 Magenta doors and 11,100 Metro stores or 16,400. That's a staggering ability to touch customers. We also opened some phenomenal ones that may sound counterintuitive, but we opened several signature stores that have been highly successful. And most recently, we opened a -- right on the Las Vegas strip a 2-storey, beautiful store that is driving tremendous amounts of interest in our company. And as we move into 2018, the distribution expansion will be 2 things. One is, the stores that we opened in the last year, they don't get up to speed yet. So it'll be well into the end of this year before those stores are fully productive. And then the amount of stores, I don't think we announced the number yet this year, but it's focused on greenfield. It's focused on places where the network's deployed where there is no competition, that sad, little town that just has Verizon or maybe Verizon and AT&T, and they hate them both. And when we open a door in those towns, I mean, the mayor comes out, there's marching bands and people just march right into our store and move over to us. So that's the -- that's kind of where we are. But 16,400 doors, that's a gigantic barrier to people who want to touch this many customers, and we're not done. Michael Sievert : Well, I mean, imagine showing up -- it's absolutely amazing the response when you show up to a town where only Verizon and, let's say, U.S. Cellular have been offered in the past. And that's a big focus for us over the next year. And this is actually pretty related to a lot of the discussion we've been having around the cost profile of the business and around ARPU. Because remember, all of this production that we're delivering in terms of record EBITDA and record cash flow is in a world where we were in 2017 the fastest-growing retailer in the country with a massive store expansion that's not yet producing financial results. And that's very exciting. The other aspect of this is as it does produce gross add flow, it reduces, as Braxton said in his remarks, some of the requirements for the n-th amount of promotional intensity in our urban cores. And that's also important for our ARPU development. So this is a great thing for us and our future potential. And this year is going to be an exciting year. Operator : We can now move on to our next question. It comes from Craig Moffett of MoffusMoffesson. Craig Moffett : MoffettNathanson. John, I wonder if we could go back to the Layer 3 discussion for a second. Can you just talk about the -- in general, what is the benefit of owning your own video distribution versus sort of playing Switzerland and providing whether it's Netflix or -- that you already do or all services agnostically? What's the need for having your own aggregation service like Level 3? John Legere : Yes, is this still Craig Moffus or did you put Craig Moffett on the phone? Well, Craig, listen. I think your question is dead in the center. And I would say, as of now, we are playing Switzerland, what we've done with Binge On and what we've done with Netflix On Us. And again, we haven't completely announced what it is we're going to do. And I would say as you think about the personalizing of the video experience for a user of a mobile device and the understanding of all the different ways that, that user requires and uses their social media and their various over-the-top capabilities and the ability to create platforms that allow them to seamlessly decide what they want to watch and how they want to navigate through it through the smartphone capability as a leverage point, we haven't stated anything yet into that how much we need to own in order to do that. So I think your question is good. We tend to agree with the position. We haven't ruled out what we will do in content. But when we talk about what we're trying to create as an experience, when we talk about Layer 3, that we've made it clear most of what we acquired for them is talent and technology along with some content relationship ownership. And we like their business; we'll continue to use it. But we're creating something that we haven't announced yet that is totally new and different. And I would say leans in the direction of what you're talking about. Michael Sievert : Actually, it's a great question because we're so different than your cable company. Your cable company actually cares whether or not the content you spend your time with is a traditional cable channel or OTT content. They care a lot because they're defending a massive castle of financials that they're able to deliver from you subscribing to these cable channels. We just want -- to us, the magic of the Internet is that you can have everything. And so being able to take a Switzerland position is something that frankly, we don't see enough of in the marketplace, and we think consumers would appreciate it a lot. John Legere : Okay. So I'm going to throw the question, Operator, to the next one coming in. For those of you that are following on the camera and get the answers will note that I will walk away from the table. I've got to be on with Cramer and Faber at CNBC in about 15 minutes, so I'm going to head over to the Exchange. So my thanks to everybody. But the call will continue to go and all your questions will get answered, okay? Operator? Operator : We'll now move along to our next question. It comes from Ric Prentiss of Raymond James. Richard Prentiss : First, on the transparency side, appreciate the '18 guidance both before and after the new revenue standard. That really helps. But maybe capture John before he heads out. You mentioned 5G a lot on the call. Can you help us understand what the use cases are on 5G? Is it content? Is it advertising? Is it IoT? Is it all of the above? But we're all hearing about 5G, arms races and what you guys are doing. But what should we think of as far as what the business cases are to get revenue from 5G? John Legere : Let's tag team on that one. But Ric, we're really excited about the potential that we see. And for us, it starts with mobile. I talked a few minutes ago about how the traditional distinctions between what you can get on a mobile device and what you can get on a wireline broadband connection are falling away with each passing generation. In fact, even with LTE, we believe we are the only Internet connection for a significant minority of our customers who have no other Internet connection. And the potential to deliver more and more of their time, their needs, their requirements through wireless and 5G is a massive opportunity. And in fact, there's some speculation that a little bit of the postpaid volume we're seeing recently is from a phenomenon of people dropping expensive broadband delivered through wires out of their portfolio. So there's a lot of potential there. But probably the more exciting potential is the ability of the technology to deliver massive connectivity to millions and millions of devices simultaneously with dramatically changed battery usage profiles, which really is going to unleash this Internet of Things concept that people have been talking about for 3 years but that has been stubborn in coming along. The idea of sensors built into everything that are very low cost, lasts for years and years at a time and enhance your life through connectivity. And when the smartphone came out, we were picturing possibly music. We were picturing browsing, email. We could have never predicted Uber. And so the potential that 4G LTE and smartphones brought. We can now talk about sensors. We can talk about massive connectivity. But we really can't conceive of how developers and innovators will completely deliver on that promise. We know that it's a step change forward in performance and that we'll be here with not only the connectivity but the solutions that help those innovators bring their technology to market. Neville Ray : Let me just pile on, Ric. Neville. So Clearly, 5G is going to ride along with LTE as you look through the next 4, 5, 6 years. And in the smartphone space, just double down on Mike's comments, it's really going to enhance the experience on the products and devices that we've seen and become familiar with and open up new ways to use those, supported by faster speeds and lower latencies. So much more responsive devices and devices that can consume media and content at a higher pace with greater resolution. I mean, that whole space is really going to open up. And I think that's the most exciting space in -- it's in the mobility domain of 5G. Then the IoT opportunity is enormous. We're very well positioned with our low-band assets to really see that space explode in all the use cases that Mike talked about. And then the industry is scratching its head trying to figure out this thing on fixed broadband displacement. And Verizon, as we said earlier on in the call, is -- they're taking a run at that this year. Very small number of markets. It's proven to be a very, very tough case. I don't know how they're going to manage to sell this thing. Maybe they'll give it away to start with to get -- unless there's economic benefit. I mean, watching Netflix at home on cable is going to look pretty much the same as watching Netflix at home on a millimeter wave service. Apart from the millimeter wave service, it'll probably be less reliable. So it's going to be a challenging space. But that's unfortunately driven by primarily Verizon. It's been the most talked about use case in the 5G space. And I think, quite frankly, it's the most tedious and boring. But we're going to be playing very, very hard in that mobility and IoT space. That's where we really want to put our shoulders to the wheel and make some change start -- in '19. Richard Prentiss : Makes sense. Also, SoftBank and Sprint talked about OneWeb and satellites getting involved in rural fixed wireless replacement. What are your thoughts as far as how satellite fits into the whole equation? Neville Ray : Unfortunately, I think Sprint needs all the help it can get, Ric, so. Okay, we'll do the next question. Amir? Operator : We can now move along to our next question. It comes from Amir Rozwadowski of Barclays. Amir Rozwadowski : Just wanted to dovetail on some of the questions on 5G. Neville, you had mentioned sort of some of the difficulties with some of the upper-band spectrum deployments. But we have seen you folks make some moves in terms of getting the government to free up some of those bands, some of the millimeter wave bands, in terms of trying to generate an auction in 2018. So I would love to reconcile that thought process with how you think about sort of the opportunity set as part of your portfolio in going after some of those upper-band spectrums in terms of delivering mobile services on 5G. Neville Ray : So I mean, we -- don't get me wrong, Amir, on my comments. I love millimeter wave spectrum. And we have a nice, big, hefty chunk of it today, but, as I said at the beginning of the call, we'll start to use when smartphones become available in early '19. And we're encouraged by the FCC's actions around driving an auction. I wish it was going to be in '18. I think it's probably going to be in '19. And they'll be like a 2 gigahertz plus bandwidth of millimeter wave across multiple bands that will come up under the hammer in early '19. And we're going to be, obviously, very interested in that. Why? I mean, my reticence around millimeter wave is making it work from an outside in perspective. And we've done as much testing as anybody else. It's really, really hard. But you look at our spectrum deployed smartly in urban environments where the propagation is less of a concern, in urban outdoor environments, it's got huge potential. But it's not the only way to really enhance the mobile experience. We've already launched license-assisted access. So this is unlicensed spectrum in the 5-gig band with LTE. And the performance capabilities there we're seeing in markets like New York is very, very promising. And there's a lot of spectrum there. So bottom line, when you look at this mobility experience, we're pushing together tremendous LTE, we'll do massive MIMO this year, we're driving LAA very hard, we'll have 5G millimeter wave coming on top. You put all those things together and then you can really start to push this mobile experience. And that's our direction and plan. The challenge on millimeter wave is broad and massive deployment, and that's where you need low band as your mobility anchor and also something else that we've been pushing very hard on. We need kind of more mid-band spectrum in the U.S. to support all of the competition and all of the opportunity that's out there. That's a little further out. That's the 3.7, 4.2-gig band, and that's probably into the next decade before we'll see that become available. But we have a lot of ways to really enhance the customer experience between now and then. Michael Sievert : I'll just add, Amir, the only thing we -- the other thing we don't like about millimeter wave is when it gets talked about by our competitors as the definition of 5G. As Neville just clearly laid out, 5G is a capability that will go across every band of spectrum and make every band of spectrum more spectrally efficient, more able to handle massive connectivity, more responsive with lower latency times, be able to be responsive to sensors with incredible battery performance. These are things that will affect every spectrum band. And we're starting with 600 because we think an awful lot of these IoT use cases are going to require connectivity that's everywhere. I mean, if you picture sensors in people's clothing, on their person going with them or agricultural solutions, et cetera, et cetera, where massive numbers of sensors are out in the public, you need to be sure that those sensors are going to be on the network. And that means starting with low band. So we're going nationwide coast-to-coast, and we'll be the first one with a national 5G deployment because of that. Well, our competitors just simply can't do that. And since they simply can't do that, they equate 5G to millimeter wave, which is all they can do in the early years. Amir Rozwadowski : That's very helpful. And one follow-up, if I may, on -- Mike, perhaps on the expansion of your footprint and distribution. It sounds like qualitatively, you guys are seeing some potential uplift in terms of subscriber momentum coming off of those markets where you have improved distribution. Is there any sense that you can give us in terms of market share on a relative basis, how you see that opportunity set shaking out relative to some of the strength that you've seen in some of the Metro markets? Are we still at early stages versus your target market? And how much of sort of your net add guidance this year is predicated on achieving improved traction within those markets? Michael Sievert : It is early days. And the performance has been excellent, I mean, above our expectations. So we're really delighted with how this expansion has gone. And part of it is because of the probably unanticipated pent-up demand in greenfield places, which was only part of our '17 deployment. It really is amazing how communities have responded and how these stores are performing. And you think it's not -- shouldn't be that surprising. We've spent all this money for years telling the world about Un-carrier on national television that's available in all 3/3 of the country while only having distribution in 2/3 of the country. And that probably can be frustrating to people whose only choices are U.S. Cellular and Verizon. So when we show up, it's exciting. We've had U.S. senators, mayors, marching bands to inaugurate our stores in their towns because of the difference it makes when T-Mobile and the Un-carrier value proposition arrives in town. As John said, we've expanded over the last 1.5 years, 2 years from 230 million POPs fully covered by our distribution to 260 million. Now the network Neville has built already covers 322 million. So we've got room to run as we continue to expand our distribution to reach every American in the coming years. Braxton Carter : Okay, we have time for one more question. And I do want to comment at just Gypsy Elizabeth [ph], thank you for the compliment on the hat. Really love that. Operator : We can now move along to our next question. It comes from Amy Yong as Macquarie. Amy Yong : Maybe I'll sneak in 2 questions. So first, Sprint recently discussed how they fit in, in their -- in the Softbank ecosystem, and I was wondering if you can talk through your relationship with DT, particularly as they take up their stake in T-Mobile. And my second question is on operating leverage. Maybe talk us through margins for the year. I think most of us understand that there will be some incremental costs associated with T-Mobile TV. But obviously, you've also been gaining some scale. Michael Sievert : Yes, just to start out. Anybody can pile on. With -- I just got back from Germany last week to attend the annual meeting that the management team there holds, and there are a lot of exciting opportunities to collaborate with DT. And this is a company that operates in, I think, 19 countries around the world and, in some cases, more as a challenger like T-Mobile US, in some cases as the highly entrenched incumbent. And it's -- there's lots we can collaborate on. In particular, as we look at 5G and IoT, we're excited about the potential to leverage the broader scale because DT, like T-Mobile US, is making big investments in getting ready for 5G and unleashing the talent of developers and innovators everywhere. So there's a great collaboration opportunity there. Braxton Carter : And Amy, we do -- we don't guide specifically to margins. We do expect continued scale with the business. Certainly, there is increase in the OpEx relating to the geographical expansion that you noted. But with all that said, we do expect continued margin expansion as we leverage the fixed costs associated with our business. Michael Sievert : I mean, we're -- oh, I'm sorry. I thought you're... Braxton Carter : Go ahead. Michael Sievert : And we're at a really interesting point in our history, right, where we're at the precipice of unlocking all this cash flow that Braxton laid out in detail. We've got record EBITDA, record cash flow, record profitability at a time when we're in the middle of a growth scale. And an awful lot of companies would have a trade-off between those things : growth or delivering on the financials. We're delivering both. And what's interesting is we're covering the costs of massive investments that we're making in that record profits. In that record profits is already paid for the biggest retail expansion in the country that's not yet delivering financial results. A massive network expansion, including laying in that 600 megahertz nationwide across hundreds of thousands and eventually millions of square miles, we're paying for all that right now while still delivering all-time record profits and growth rates that exceed all 3 of our competitors combined. So that's a good place to be. Braxton Carter : Well, everyone, thank you for tuning in today. We look forward to speaking with you again next quarter and watching the further progress of the Un-carrier. Have a great day. Operator? Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the T-Mobile US Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Earnings Call. Should any further questions, you may contact the Investor Relations or Media departments. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect, and have a pleasant day.",

Welcome to the T-Mobile US First Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. Following opening remarks, the earnings call will be open for questions via the conference line, Twitter, Facebook or text message. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Nils Paellmann, Head of Investor Relations for T-Mobile US. Please go ahead, sir. Nils Paellmann : Okay, thank you very much. Welcome to T-Mobile\u2019s first quarter 2018 earnings call. With me today are John Legere, our CEO; Mike Sievert, our newly appointed President, in addition to his role as COO; Braxton Carter, our CFO; and other members of the senior leadership team. Let me read the disclaimer, it\u2019s a little bit longer because of the Sprint transaction. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements that include projections and statements about our future financial and operating results, our plans. The benefit we expect to receive from the proposed merger with Sprint and other statements that are not historical facts. Such statements are based upon the current beliefs and expectations of our management and are subject to significant risk and uncertainties outside of our control that could cause our actual results to differ materially including the risk factors set forth in our From 10-K. Reconciliations between GAAP and the non-GAAP results we discuss on this call can be found in the Quarterly Results section of the Investor Relations page of our website. In addition, in connection with the proposed transaction, we will file with the SEC a joined consent solicitation statement and prospectus that were contained important information about T-Mobile and Sprint the merger and related matters. With that, let me turn it over to John Legere. John Legere : Okay. Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to T-Mobile\u2019s first quarter 2018 earnings call and twitter conference coming to you live from Washington, D.C. It was five years ago today that we closed our transaction with MetroPCS and became a public company. With increased scale and resources of T-Mobile and MetroPCS, we joined forces in our mission \u2013 turn on our microphone. With increased scale and resources of T-Mobile and MetroPCS, we joined forces in our mission to make wireless better by putting customers first. The results have been nothing short of remarkable on. On Sunday, we announced another giant milestone in our journey to drive change on behalf of consumers. We reached a definitive agreement, which Sprint to come together and form a larger, stronger competitor. And yesterday, we spent the day with a number of broadcast media outlets. And today, we\u2019re here in Washington, D.C. making sure the world understand how this transaction will create robust competition in the 5G era and outstanding benefits to U.S. wireless consumers. The new company will be a pro consumer strongly disruptive force. This transaction and the unique combination of resources it brings will enable the new company to do things that neither T-Mobile nor Sprint could do on its own, all for the benefit of the American consumer. The new company will be able to rapidly build the first and best nationwide 5G network with unprecedented capacity in scale to truly accelerate innovation and increase competition. The combination will also super charge the pro consumer and career strategy with innovative service offerings, lower prices and increased competition in wireless, broadband, entertainment and beyond. Let me be clear. We will continue to be an aggressive disruptor unafraid to challenge the status quo and force the competition to respond. It\u2019s in our DNA, it\u2019s who we are. We will continue to be pro consumer and that means lower prices, better service and more choices to more consumers in every corner of the country. We\u2019re confident that once the regulators learn about the compelling benefits of this transaction, they will agree that this is the right move at the right time for America. Our customer obsessed company will be the leader in delivering a nationwide 5G network in the pivotal early years that will unleash a wave of new innovation for American businesses, catapulting the U.S. back into a leadership position and ensuring we will be a global economic and innovation leader in the 5G era. Together we will build a network with historic capabilities that will have the breadth and depth to reach every person across the country assuring a new competition for the underserved rural American markets. Well, I\u2019m sure you have a few questions about the transaction, but in the meantime, let\u2019s talk about first quarter results. We added 1.4 million total net customers, extending our winning streak to 20 quarters in a row with more than 1 million total net customer additions, that\u2019s a half a decade if you\u2019re keeping score at home. With 617,000 branded postpaid phone net additions, we are expected to capture 93% of the industry postpaid phone growth including Comcast and 12 times more than Verizon, Comcast and AT&T combined. And let\u2019s not lose sight of the fact that Dumb and Dumber, both lost postpaid phone customers this quarter. We also had strong branded postpaid net additions of 1 million, due in part to the particular success of the Apple Watch and other wearables. These customers are staying longer than ever before. Q1 was our lowest ever branded postpaid phone churn of 1.07% down 11 basis points year-over-year. This is in large part due to the tremendous performance of the network and the amazing work being done by our frontline organizations. Our frontline teams are working hard to serve our customers and it shows. Our retail organization posted a net promoter score of 65.5 in Q1 up from 57.6 a year ago. In customer care just recorded its lowest ever calls per account. And prepaid net customer additions picked up from Q4 with 199,000 despite a delayed tax season. Our financial results would just as solid. Service revenues grew by 6.5% year-over-year to $7.8 billion, which was a record high. We\u2019ve remain the only growth company in U.S. wireless. Total revenues grew 8.8% year-over-year to $10.5 billion. Net income was strong at $0.7 billion and fully diluted EPS came in at $0.78. Adjusted EBITDA amounted to $3 billion up 12.4% year-over-year excluding the spectrum gain of $37 million in Q1 2017. This was the highest adjusted EBITDA for a first quarter in our history and the second highest quarterly adjusted EBITDA ever. Based on our very strong free cash flow profile, we initiated a share buyback program in December 2017. As of April 27, we have bought back almost 24 million shares per total of $1.5 billion completing our initial program. Braxton will give you more details on buybacks, including the board approved three year plan for $9 billion total, including the completed initial $1.5 billion. As a result of our announced merger with Sprint, we have now suspended any further buybacks. 2017 was a transformational year for our network and our distribution footprint and we\u2019re off to a running start in 2018. We now cover 322 million POPs with LTE. By year-end, we expect to close the coverage GAAP with Verizon by covering 325 million POPs. The 600 megahertz rollout continues at a furious pace. We are now live in 823 cities and towns in 31 states. And the 600 megahertz gear we are deploying now will be upgradable to 5G with a software update laying the foundation for the first nationwide 5G network. Speaking of 5G at Mobile World Congress this year, we announced plans to bring 5G, 30 cities in 2018, using both 600 megahertz and millimeter wave spectrum. This network will harness 4G and 5G bandwidths simultaneously for dual connectivity and will be ready for the first 5G smartphones in the first half of 2019. Coming back to our 600 megahertz rollout. In March, we launched our first 600 megahertz capable flagship smartphone, the Samsung Galaxy S9, which was our third 600 megahertz capable smartphone. Including the GS9 we expect more than a dozen new smartphones in 2018 to be 600 megahertz capable. Download and upload speeds continue to accelerate. In Q1, our average download 4G LTE speed was 32.1 megabits, well ahead of our competitors. Q1 marks by the way, the 17th quarter role of the T-Mobile with the fastest LTE network. Our network expansion has enabled our store expansion. We are seeing very encouraging results, especially in Greenfield markets, where our initial results are tracking well above expectations. We continue to see strong momentum with business customers. Business had its best ever first quarter in terms of activations and we added 74 new logos in the quarter, including some of the biggest names in retail. Our increased outlook for 2018, calls for $2.6 million to $3.3 million branded post-paid net customer additions and adjusted EBITDA of $11.4 billion to $11.8 billion. Our three year CAGR estimate for free cash flow remains at 46% to 48% with cash CapEx still expected to be in the range of $4.9 billion to $5.3 billion. Our CFO Braxton Carter will walk you through financial results and the details of our guidance. Okay, Braxton Carter, let\u2019s take a closer look. Braxton Carter : Hey, thanks, John. Let me start with tax reform. Last quarter we told you that we expect tax reform to be very beneficial for us with a significant lower effect of tax rate going forward, while fueling additional pro-consumer competitive moves. For this quarter, net income amounted to $671 million with an effective tax rate of 24%. Net income also included the benefit of $71 million from the new revenue recognition standard. When comparing our net income with the last year recall that Q1 2017 benefited from an income tax benefit of $270 million due to a valuation allowance adjustment and after tax spectrum gain of $23 million. On a sequential basis, net income was also impacted by higher depreciation, which increased 6.1% from Q4 2017, due to lease depreciation and the impact of the build out of our 4G LTE network. We expect this trend of higher depreciation to continue into the second quarter and full year and impact net income accordingly. Adjusted EBITDA amounted to $3 billion up 10.8% or 12.4%, excluding the spectrum gain of $37 million in Q1 2017, and including lease revenues of $171 million versus $324 million in the prior year. Note that adjusted EBITDA included a negative impact from last year\u2019s hurricane of $36 million. The adjusted EBITDA performance is reflection of strong cost management. Cost of service to stayed essentially flat sequentially, despite the rapid rollout of 600 megahertz spectrum. SG&A was down 3.9% from the elevated Q4 seasonal spending. Equipment losses decreased significantly both year-over-year and sequentially in connection with a light post paid upgrade rate of just 5%. Free cash flow increased by 261% to $668 million. This was driven by 27% increase in net cash provided by operating activities combined with a slight reduction in CapEx to $1.4 billion. Note that we have redefined free cash flow to align with the new cash flow standard and to present cash flows on a consistent basis for investor transparency. Branded postpaid phone ARPU, even with the $0.22 negative impact of the new revenue standard proved very resilient in the first quarter, at $46.66, up from $46.54 adjusted for hurricanes in the fourth quarter, we\u2019re pleased without thus. In terms of customer quality, our results from the fourth quarter were outstanding. Total bad debt expense and loss from sale receivables were $106 million or a record low of 1.01% of total revenues, compared to $188 million or 1.96% in the first quarter of 2017, even with a significantly higher customer base. Total EIP receivables classified as prime, including EIP receivables sold, amounted to 53% in line with the prior year. Okay, let\u2019s take look at 2018 guidance. We expect branded net customer additions to be between 2.6 to 3.3 million, up substantial from our initial guidance range of 2 million and 3 million. The guidance takes into account our long-term strategy to balance growth and profitability. The lower switcher volumes we\u2019ve seen in recent quarters, and our pursuit of growth adjacencies, which we expect will afford us the option to be less promotional in our legacy markets. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $11.4 billion to $11.8 billion, again a significant increase, not including the impact of the new revenue recognition standard, up from the initial guidance range of $11.3 billion to $11.7 billion. The new revenue recognition standard will increase adjusted EBITDA by another $0.2 billion to $0.5 billion for an all and guidance range of $11.6 billion to $12.3 billion. This guidance takes into account and expected decline in leasing revenues in 2018. Remember our target is $600 million to $700 million in 2018, compared to $877 million in all of 2017, as well as our build-out of low-band spectrum, including the accelerated rollout of 600 megahertz, driving up cost of services by $300 million to $400 million year-over-year. Our increased outlook for 2018 demonstrates, we\u2019re following the same playbook with regard to the guidance as that we\u2019ve done in the past and we definitely know \u2013 announce that on our last earnings call and you can see that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re doing. We target cash CapEx of $4.9 billion to $5.3 billion, excluding capitalized interest. This includes expenditures for 5G deployment. This is unchanged from the prior guidance. Finally, we expect free cash flow to increase at a three-year CAGR of 46% to 48% from full year 2016 to full year 2019, unchanged from the prior range. During the same period, we expect the underlying net cash provided by operating activities to increase at a CAGR of 7% to 12% compared to the prior range of 16% to 18%. This change resulted solely from the adoption of the new cash flow accounting standard. To conclude, let me provide you with some more details on our $9 billion three-year buyback program that was already mentioned by John. This program consist of buyback of a total opportunity of $2 billion by the end of 2018, including the initial $1.5 billion and the $200 million that DT bought, $3 billion in 2019 and $4 billion in 2020. This demonstrates our extreme confidence in the future cash flows with the business. The program was approved by our board in April, but given the just announced merger with Sprint in order to preserve our cash for the upcoming integration phase with Sprint. This program is contingent upon the terminations of the business combination arrangement with Sprint. The actual total repurchase of amounted to approximately $2 billion, including the repurchase of Deutsche Telekom. Now let\u2019s get to your questions. You can ask questions via phone, text message, or via Twitter or Facebook. We will start with a question on the phone. Operator, first question, please? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Brett Feldman : Thanks for taking question and just a few about cost. Brax, you noted that you are continuing to expect your cost of service to increase $300 million to $400 million this year versus last year. I think, you\u2019re at that run rate now, but if there\u2019s going to be another step up at some point here. That will be helpful. And then just a topic that I\u2019ve come back to before SG&A. Your SG&A expenses relative your service revenues are the highest in the sector and obviously, that\u2019s been partly a function of your growth. But I was hoping, you could give us an insight into, what\u2019s going to get you to a point, where you\u2019re going to show more operating leverage? And then maybe even thinking about merger synergies how we can think about SG&A and getting efficiencies there as you bring the companies together. Thank you. John Legere : Yes, great questions, Brett. So on the cost to service, no, you\u2019re seeing the run rate that we\u2019ve talked about. So our prior guidance has not changed. And you will just see that continued cadence throughout the year as we rollout 600. No incremental step ups there. SG&A, the fact of the matter is we\u2019re growing more than AT&T, Verizon, Sprint and Comcast together. It\u2019s a fact. And when you have variable selling costs, we, as a result, have the highest SG&A. I guarantee you our back office is tremendously more efficient than Dumb and Dumber. But we\u2019re putting our firepower into organically scaling this business, and that\u2019s why you don\u2019t see some of the efficiency. And we\u2019ve always talked about if our growth was to moderate, which is not going to, given the adjacencies of the geographical distribution expansion and new business, you will see an explosion in margin with a significant reduction in SG&A. This is a \u2013 this is a result of how much we\u2019re growing. In terms of the pro forma for the new company, yes, let\u2019s go into a little bit of detail here. And we had a lot of fun announcing the transaction. And we\u2019ve been avowedly looking at what everybody has been writing and publishing. And I want to share some thoughts here, because several people have kind of question why revenues and EBITDA might look a little bit out in the 3 to 4 range that we put out there. And the fact of the matter is not. This is not a reflection of anything going on at T-Mobile or reflection that\u2019s going on with Sprint. Our pro forma of those disclosures were based on, it\u2019s a conservative number, and that\u2019s exactly what we took into the rating agencies. There were no revenue synergies from fixed wireless broadband, IoT and new 5G opportunities from new businesses that we are going to enter. The EBITDA number assumes no growth in leasing revenues from the current combined Sprint and T-Mobile, which many analysts forecast have leasing going up for Sprint. EBITDA forecast also assume that we migrate all Sprint postpaid customers to the lowest \u2013 to the lower T-Mobile ARPU by the end of 2021. And that\u2019s really important. What we talked about is driving price competition into America. The fact of the matter is, Sprint\u2019s ARPU 10% higher than ours, and we\u2019re rationalizing an entire combined new co-base with this price competition. And that is very different than what many people would model on a stand-alone basis. 2021 EBITDA is burdened by more than $2 billion of cost to achieve. And by the end of that year, we will have incurred over 2/3 of the $15 billion cost to achieve that\u2019s fully embedded in those numbers. 2021 run rate synergies are only 2/3 of the long run level. Again, we have a conservative representation of this model, but we will not hit the $6 billion-plus run rate synergy until 2022. We also do not assume upfront accounting charges for lease payments on decommission sites. We burdened EBITDA as these charges are incurred. And certainly, when we get down to final purchase price allocations, et cetera, you\u2019re most likely would take a charge upfront and paid over time. And this is an inflection of the ongoing cash flows of the company. And by the end of 2021, just to repeat, we will incurred about 2/3 of the $15 billion of cost to achieve. When it comes to SG&A and some of the back-office synergies, which is really that jest of your question there. Yes, we have about $1 billion in savings run rate on back office. So what is that? The savings in IT and billing as well as other fixed G&A. And we also have about a $1 billion in savings and sales, service and marketing. And these are savings from store consolidation, partially offset by increased labor at retail stores to service our full customer base. And we have significant savings in advertising, handset cost, think about the procurement benefits, increased costs for higher quality care, there is an offset to that, and we\u2019ve modeled the care model for the Sprint customer base to be the care model that we deploy at T-Mobile. But the net-net, both the back office and the sales, service and marketing have about $1 billion of run rate synergies. I hope that information is helpful for everyone. And then we just want to get everybody on the same page as you\u2019re absorbing the details on this incredible historic combination that we announced. Brett Feldman : Very helpful, thank you. John Legere : Okay. Nils Paellmann : Operator, next question. Operator : Our next question will come from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Simon Flannery : Great. Thank you very much. John, given that you are down in D.C. perhaps you could just give us an update on how things went, how you are received down there today. Any updates on the competitive activity around latest porting data? And you said you\u2019re going to be less promotional, but does that mean we won\u2019t see on carriers for the balance of the year? Thanks. John Legere : Okay. Thank you. I\u2019ll turn my microphone on. Yes, it\u2019s been a very busy few days, and kind of in rank order or board meetings, deal announcement, media and employee catch up, and now, we\u2019re in Washington. And obviously, there is a tremendous amount to do here that we\u2019re just starting. We had a number of meetings at the SEC today that went extremely well. Obviously, it\u2019s a start of a process that we want to respect. We have a lot more recessions this year this week and next weekend. We look forward to meeting with the DOJ and everybody else. I would say, my assessment so far is that there is a very good open mind to review all of the aspects of what we feel is an amazing potential opportunity for the country. And so far, our statements that we made about why this makes sense around the opportunity for the country in 5G, things that T-Mobile and Sprint could not do alone that we can do together for the breadth and the depth of 5G network that\u2019s really important, and we\u2019ll cause a change in the country\u2019s trend of competitiveness in 5G. The ability for us, as you see what we\u2019re accomplishing here and what we\u2019re doing for consumers to supercharge that and really bring additional services and additional competition, additional speed as well as price to customers as a result of supercharging the Un-carrier. And then, of course, discussing the fact that in the new company that we will create with Sprint, more people will be employed from day one and on then of the two companies separately. So that conversation has started. I\u2019m very pleased with it. Certainly, over the last 48 hours, I have understood that there is a lot of misconception and a lot of conversation, but our story is strong and I\u2019m extremely confident that it will be approved. So we\u2019ll keep you posted there. It\u2019s a beautiful day in D.C., and I look forward to spending many more here and meeting and discussing this incredible opportunity with everyone that will hear me. So we\u2019ll keep you posted on that. Mike, why don\u2019t you discuss some of the competitive activity. Mike Sievert : Of course, we had another comparative quarter. And I think what this quarter\u2019s results show is that when it gets competitive, this company is able to deliver. Just on porting ratios, overall, they were about flat from those elevated levels we saw in Q4. Remember, in Q4, we were up from Q3, which was up from Q2, and we were able to maintain all that. The complexion of that is we advanced versus AT&T and Verizon just a bit. We were down marginally versus Sprint who made in a step forward in porting. Give me a couple of the numbers, AT&T our numbers for 2Q or for 1Q were 1.87, was 1.8 for Verizon, up from 1.7 last quarter versus Sprint it was 1.35, down from 1.45 in the prior quarter. And the trends continue in Q2. Again, a little stronger so far quarter-to-date. So it\u2019s \u2013 you saw the numbers with these incredible performance in postpaid, prepaid, postpaid phones, postpaid other across the board. And what turned out to be a really competitive quarter. The story of the quarter was everybody was waiting around on tax season because it was delayed. And so you saw everybody kind of take a pause and then they went crazy. Some try to dip in before tax season, decided they didn\u2019t like it and dipped back out. So it was really interesting to try to watch our competitors navigate through. Our strategy is not really like that. We usually just get our game plan. We put our heads down and we execute it, and it included some value propositions that we announced last fall that we just continued on. And they turned out to be very successful in the results speak for themselves. But thanks for the question. Simon Flannery : Great, thank you. Nils Paellmann : Operator? Operator : Our next question will come from Philip Cusick with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Philip Cusick : Hey guys, I guess, for Mike, can you go more into the trends in the connected car and Apple Watch that are driving this postpaid net add numbers? What does that look like in there? And how much additional revenue and value do you really derived from those devices? Thanks. Mike Sievert : Sure, of course. It\u2019s good business. And that\u2019s why we pursue it. These are products that come in, $10, $20 family lines sort of ARPU levels. And that\u2019s not a lot different than in smartphone that comes in once you have three or four lines in. So it\u2019s just a nice way for us to continue advancing our business with customers. It\u2019s similar to a SyncUP Drive, which is one of the things that connects cars from us. We are on 700,000-plus units into that initiative. And this is just another way for families to take advantage of their connectivity and extend their relationship with us. So the strategy for us with our customers is really simple. Number one, make sure we have brand in a network and a value proposition that attracts families, and go after segments that we\u2019ve historically been underrepresented in. It\u2019s very similar. And number two, have the portfolio of products so that people can deepen their relationship with us. And that\u2019s not measured so much in ARPU as it is measured in whether or not they pick up a variety of these other connections, which are a big source of strength for us. So generally speaking, we\u2019re really pleased with what we\u2019re seeing. And to your point, Apple Watch was a nice surprise hit. I think there was some pent-up demand for connected device from Apple, because that device has been run our third version of it. But this time with built-in connectivity, its turned out to be very popular. Braxton Carter : I\u2019d just add Mike, it\u2019s our postpaid devices in addition to our 670,000 phone additions. So its \u2013 if you look at our full portfolio for what we\u2019re adding into customers, its \u2013 I will leave it at that. Philip Cusick : Thanks, guys. Braxton Carter : Yes. Nils Paellmann : Operator? Operator : Our next question will come from John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead. John Hodulik : Sure. Thanks, guys. I guess, first, with the deal, I mean, Braxton you pointed out some of the misunderstanding may be from the financial standpoint, anything else out there that\u2019s resonating with you that maybe sort of that you think might be misunderstood and then causing some of the sort of price moves we\u2019ve seen. And then from the second question following up on the earlier sub question, looks like gross adds were down a little bit, postpaid phone gross adds should have been down a little bit year-over-year. I guess, first, what\u2019s driving are you guys \u2013 did you guys just pull back a little bit versus some of the other sort of promotional activity we saw, especially in AT&T? And are you seeing a shift in the gross add share as you would expect sort of from the urban areas to some of these rural areas as you roll out the spectrum in the stores? Thanks. Braxton Carter : Yes. Hey, thanks for the open invitation because there are some more things I\u2019d like to communicate. Just to make sure everybody is on the same page. John Hodulik : You could have asked him how as weekend was. Braxton Carter : The first thing, we talks about run rate synergies of $6 billion-plus. I want to emphasize that\u2019s pretax. We\u2019ve talked about cost to achieve a $15 billion and gave you more details on this call. That\u2019s pretax. And we\u2019ve talked about the MPV of the synergies being an amazing $43 billion-plus. The MPV is discounted at an 8% [indiscernible] and is post the tax effect. So I just want to make sure everybody is aligned on those. The other thing that I would add, and then I\u2019ll turn it over to Mike. The portion of CapEx versus OpEx in this synergies. And in the slide deck, we said 93% of these were OpEx synergies and the balance was CapEx synergies. But I think, an important part when you\u2019re taking all the information, I know there is a lot to absorb here, but the CapEx synergies are net of avoided capital cost because we have so much existing network asset to work from. And that avoided cost is about $8 billion of CapEx that otherwise the two individual stand-alone companies would have incurred. And that\u2019s an offset to the total cost into the $15 billion of cost to achieve, which is truly the cash outlay that needs to happen during this period. So those were other things that I wanted to pass on. And then I\u2019ll turn it over to Mike. Mike Sievert : Yes. On your business question you\u2019re asking about gross adds and what drives in the industry switching. Couple of things, and Braxton has pointed this out many times in prior quarters. What we execute when we launch each quarter is a balanced plan designed to achieve the net adds and therefore the run rate revenue growth and profit growth that will flow from those. Not designed to achieve the gross adds. And what\u2019s happened is that industry switching has fallen some. You\u2019re going to see that in the churn rate of all the competitors and you have seen it in ours. Historically low churn of 1.07%. What that means is, you could look at clinically and say whether is less opportunity to grow, we look at it and say, we actually don\u2019t have to do as much to get the net adds in an environment like that. And that\u2019s a good thing if you\u2019re a net gainer. For us, we can go get the growth that we need and we go get as much as we plan to get and keep our plan in balance. That\u2019s why you see our EBITDA profile improving, guidance being raised again this quarter on that front because it\u2019s really working. So there are less switches in the market. That means we don\u2019t need as many gross adds to deliver on our net plan that we committed to and they are certainly financial benefits to that. You asked about the complexion of the growth. Here\u2019s something going on. Number one, it is more rural and small town than it used to be. And it really shows the expansion of the stores is kicking in and helping. It\u2019s fantastic to see all-time highs in rural, suburban, smaller town growth. It\u2019s more prime than it\u2019s been in a long time. It\u2019s really not to see prime suburban families picking T-Mobile at some of the highest levels we\u2019ve seen. Another piece that\u2019s very encouraging is a higher proportion of our net adds are coming from new accounts, not just data lines. And that was a great development in 1Q and we\u2019re seeing it continue into Q2, all three of these trends, so really nice to see. Last thing I\u2019ll point out on all this, is that the big iconic launch of the quarter came late. The GS9 came in March and that affected things throughout the playbook like upgrade rates, as well as the total number of switches in the switching pool. John Legere : So those are some of the details. I\u2019m just a throw it backup to the highest level for one second. And so when you say, what did people missed. And I\u2019m not sure that people missed anything. For me right now over the past couple of days, I have tremendous knowledge that in various degrees is making its way out to the rest of the world. And it\u2019s in two buckets. And I think part of what we\u2019ve been conversing about a very deeply with investors is the value of this transaction to shareholders. And the value is tremendous as well as our execution ability. What we are extremely confident in our ability to execute against this plan. That\u2019s A. And that will over time become clear to people. Then there is the approval processes. And I also not only know the headline stories that we\u2019ve been telling, the very detailed understandings that underpin those headlines as well as the econometric models and things that will be able to prove. The trick is for these two things to come together and be fully understood at the same time. And I\u2019m very confident that we\u2019ll be able to get that message out. The question is, is it out there yet? And that\u2019s just a matter of time. And I\u2019m very confident that over time those two things will merge. And asking for that to happen in 36 hours is a lot to ask. It may take at least another day. Joking, nonetheless. John Hodulik : Okay. Thanks, guys. Nils Paellmann : Operator? Operator : Our next question will come from Jonathan Chaplin with New Street Research. Please go ahead. Jonathan Chaplin : Hi, thanks. And thanks for the really detailed discussion around the build-out for pro formas and synergies as to pretty useful. Two questions related to that, if I may. So the first would be, I think you very appropriately taking a conservative approach on assuming the Sprint ARPU comes down to TMUS\u2019s ARPU. But Braxton, what if you assumed for TMUS\u2019s ARPU or pricing in the industry in general as you take competition to the market with the new cost structure that you\u2019re going to have? And the second question is, in the event that the deal doesn\u2019t pan out for some reason, the only cost I see to you is the MVNO that you\u2019ve given Sprint? How should we think about the impact that providing that MVNO would have on your network? In which parts of the country does it apply or is it everywhere? And how should we think sort of valuing that impact? Braxton Carter : So on the ARPU question, we\u2019re reiterating once again when you look at all of our materials, that we have generally stable ARPU, which we define as plus to minus 1%. Now to join headlines here, the amazing churn results, this company is recording, you also saw a sequential increase for normalized ARPU between Q4 and Q1. And you haven\u2019t seen that for a while. We were within the 1% tolerance down last year. Now when we modeled pro forma and how do we know really predict the stuff, but when we\u2019ve modeled pro forma on a year-to-year basis going forward. By 2021, all of the Sprint ARPU will be at the T-Mobile ARPU. But we\u2019re also assuming price competition and it\u2019s fueled by the tremendous tax benefits, the margin unlock, because we are now able to inorganically scale, you saw the margin expansion that we\u2019re projecting. And all this can fuel maintaining a significant pricing umbrella and continuing to put some pressure into the marketplace. If you were thinking about an annual model, I would think about it on the lines of type of the guidance that we\u2019ve given. But this is way out there, too early to predict, but we have assumed price competition in all this modeling. Hope that makes sense. Now on the MVNO, it\u2019s really not an MVNO, it is really truly a traditional roaming agreement. And there are no geographical limitations to this agreement. And they are paying a rate to us for that. There\u2019s no reverse recycle roaming on the Sprint network. And I\u2019d like to turn it over to Neville, who can much more clearly articulate the modeling what was done, and that we have absolute capacity to support this roaming agreement over the course of its four-year term. Neville? Neville Ray : Yes, I\u2019ll just to add on and be brief. I mean, the main focus here is to provide the Sprint customers LTE service where they don\u2019t have that service today effectively. So it\u2019s LTE coverage in as Braxton said in many areas of the country, it allows the Sprint customers to leverage the breadth and depth of the T-Mobile network and the expensive footprint that we put down on LTE. John Legere : Last word on it, I mean, we can\u2019t get on all the details, but this is going to be accretive to our business. And so we\u2019ve design this, as Neville said in a way that we\u2019re not concerned about it having capacity impacts on our existing customers and there is some provisions in there that make sure that our customers experience, it\u2019s not going to be affected. But we do have available capacity on this network and we\u2019re now monetizing that within incremental flow of revenue. So we\u2019re really excited about this as a business, and we think it\u2019s going to be accretive to our results assuming that they turn it up and start to use it extensively. Jonathan Chaplin : I can quickly just follow-up to Neville. I\u2019m guessing, if this is really just to cover areas of their network doesn\u2019t cover. Those areas where with your Spectrum portfolio, you\u2019re going to have massive excess capacity anyway. And that\u2019s why it doesn\u2019t plays any strain of additional cost on your network. Neville Ray : Absolutely, Jonathan. That\u2019s the whole intent. I mean, we modeled this thing through the geographic areas and so on and we\u2019re not worried on that front. Jonathan Chaplin : Thanks, guys. Nils Paellmann : Okay. Operator? Operator : Our next question will come from Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead. Cathy Yao : This is actually Cathy Yao dialing in for Craig. Can you dive into your network synergy estimate 4 billion plus in a little bit greater detail just from a quick bottom of the envelope calculation if you were to assume 25,000 sell-sides shut down and foregone tower rents, that only gets you to maybe something like 1.5 billion or so in network synergies there? And then my second question is, how do you manage through the transition? Do you stop opening new stores? Does that jeopardize stand-alone growth potentially? Thank you. Mike Sievert : I mean, so thanks for the question, Cathy. So the way to think about the synergies is 35,000 sites worth of decommissioned site volume over the integration period. There\u2019s also about 16,000 sites that both companies would have built on their own that we won\u2019t now need to build. And so the synergy volume is driven by over 50,000 sites worth of effectively avoided OpEx. So if you \u2013 it\u2019s pretty easy to map out. You can put $70,000, $80,000 a year on a site. You do that on 50,000 sites, and you\u2019ve got your run rate. That\u2019s fairly straightforward math. So that\u2019s where \u2013 that\u2019s the quick breakdown for you. There\u2019s other synergistic cost obviously in terms of the core and small cells and other pieces, but that\u2019s the major foundational piece is the 50,000 avoided sites. Cathy Yao : Thank you. Mike Sievert : Could you want follow-up on stores. The plan here obviously is, we\u2019re going to build additional stores in rural areas and areas that neither company reaches. So that\u2019s the big part of the plan. And within areas that both companies operate, there\u2019s a rationalization of store footprint. What\u2019s interesting is, our plan covers costs associated with employing many of the people as we rationalize those stores in a most concentrated way in the remaining stores. Because remember, when you still have all these customers to take care of in traffic in stores, whether it\u2019s in two store or one store tends to be a function of the customer sites. We\u2019re still going to need an awful lot of these people, but we\u2019re going to change around where they work and be much more efficient with where they\u2019re located and save a lot in leasing over time, et cetera. John Legere : And during the goes \u2013 hopefully goes, as I said but both our network and on retail, et cetera, our plan through the approval period is business as usual and continuing forward. Mike Sievert : And speaking a business as usual, John\u2019s question, one piece that didn\u2019t get answered what\u2019s he said, are you still going to have on carrier moves. So it\u2019s make sure, everybody understands that. We actually have a date. [Indiscernible] But yes, of course, we do. DME on Twitter and all \u2013 anyway, the answer is yes. Okay, operator? Operator : Our next question will come from Ric Prentiss with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Ric Prentiss : Thanks. Couple of questions, guys. First Braxton, you would mentioned about the adjusted EBITDA and how that includes the lease impact flat at Sprint. Help us understand how much that number should be in the 2018 pro forma for both you guys and what that looks like into the future? And then the second question I\u2019ll come back with on the site decommissioning if you answer the first one first please. Braxton Carter : Yes, sure. It\u2019s $500 million to $600 million for T-Mobile. And I think Sprint is having their call later this week. I really should not speak about Sprint from a stand-alone. And I think it\u2019s probably more appropriate to ask them that question at the tail end of this week when they announce. Ric Prentiss : Okay. And on the network synergy question, the $4 billion, you mentioned a little bit about the cost, I appreciate the detail Neville, you think about $10 billion cost to achieve. Can you help us understand how that paces throughout the years? And how does that compare to your MetroPCS deal, as far as your synergy versus what it cost to achieve those synergies? And are there any MetroPCS sites still left in that 35,000 decom number that Neville was mentioning? Braxton Carter : Let me start, then I will hand it over to Neville. On the cost to achieve, we said that we would have two-thirds of incurred by 2021. And we have \u2013 that\u2019s of the total. And I think that the final thing I leave it, before I turn it over to Neville to get into more detail, as we beat the time and we beat the total amount of synergies on the Metro deal. And again, the same people who did that or the same people sitting at this table putting together these projections. Neville? Neville Ray : Yes, thanks, Ric. So quickly on the cost to achieve this, a big chunk of that is obviously prepaid rent and ETLs on backhaul on the sites that we\u2019re going to decommission. So in terms of timing, which I think is the core of your question, I mean, the integration period, we\u2019ve been very successful with Metro. It was about two years from when we started. Obviously, many more markets to run at, although the scale of the markets aren\u2019t that much greater when you look at, customer base is being migrated compared to Metro. But two to three year integration period, at the end of that, you\u2019re in a position to start curtailing and decommissioning sites. And so that\u2019s when the cost to achieve starts to kick in, probably year three through year four, somewhere in that timeframe, but somewhat dependent on how we trial through on the integration front. But as Braxton said, we\u2019re very confident. We really know how to do this. We have an excellent playbook to model and replicate and work through. Ric Prentiss : Is the augmentation \u2013 are the augmentation and the new cell sites included in that cost to achieve. I think you mentioned putting in the 10,000 new rural sites and augmenting Clearwater spectrum on the T-Mobile sites and T-Mobile spectrum on the Sprint sites. Does that built into that cost to achieve concept as well? John Legere : Yes, every dollar Ric that we need to drive into this network to create this incredible 5G opportunity is covered in the financials that you\u2019ve seen. There is a $40 billion invest in the networking here, which is a fabulous opportunity. And so the scale and pace of everything we need to do here is all in the plan. And then the really incredible thing, and I know this is hard to get your heads around, right, but we\u2019re going to be integrating, and at the same time, we are integrating, we are upgrading all that radio we add on the Sprint keep sites and on the T-Mobile sites is 5G capable. And so this is the piece we\u2019re integrating, we had to go spend that money on a combination anyway. We can now leverage hardware readiness and as we move through this over the next 12 to 18 months and we get started, software readiness on 5G gear. And so the way I look at this, every dollar we spent is a 5G dollar to build. So we getting that as a benefit sometime, it\u2019s the timing got shine on you on these things that\u2019s very much the case here. So not only are we integrating the two networks together, but we\u2019re building this awesome 5G network in the process. Ric Prentiss : Thanks. Nils Paellmann : Operator? Operator : Our next question will come from Tim Horan with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Tim Horan : Thanks, guys. John, I wanted to talk about wireless quad play service, maybe something that can completely replace wireline. It seems like it could be really disruptive to the wireline industry and save customers a $1,000 a year. I know you guys mentioned in the press release over the weekend at 12% households are wireless only for Internet access. And we think over the top 80 days only like 4%, 5% at this point. But if your network can support this price effectively and cost effectively. First off, can your network support it? And secondly, if the FCC then look and the DOJ look at this as a combined market wireline, wireless as one market? Thanks for your thought. John Legere : Yes. First of all, I think, that should be considered a statement and not a question. But my question is on in the first part. Braxton Carter : I\u2019ll tell you what, the answer is yes. And that\u2019s why we talked about it on Sunday. When Neville shared those network capacity numbers that we have clear line of side in a detailed integration plan to get 15 times our national average and speeds with the potential for a 100 times. Let\u2019s just do that math. 15 times, he just told you that our national average speed is 33 megabits per second. That\u2019s not peak speeds or urban speeds, that include every town, village and hamlet in this country on average. That means that\u2019s going to 450 megabits per second within the planning horizon of this business. As a national average, not a place to get in some parts of some towns like our competitors millimeter wave strategies that can go higher than that in very isolated places. So what you do with a nationwide average of 450 megabits per second. Well, first you recognize that\u2019s way higher than most people get in to home broadband today. So of course, we can be a competitor in that space. And this is a market that is incredibly underserved. 53% of broadband \u2013 high-speed broadband customers have only one choice for high-speed broadband in their area. So there\u2019s a huge opportunity here for us to bring real competitiveness to that market for the first time. Now secondly, we acquired Layer3 TV last year with the aspiration of entering the TV business. Those aspirations obviously, get ratchet it up in the context of bringing together Sprint and T-Mobile. Because now you have a network, where you can provide this all IPTV service not just through their home broadband connection or under their smartphone, but through a wireless alternative to their home broadband as well. So T-Mobile\u2019s in the position as a new T-Mobile to be able to offer a quad play if that\u2019s what the market wants. And we don\u2019t know what the marketer want. They don\u2019t ask for services in the context of the industries that built all that capital a while back. They don\u2019t think about it as a cable industry and the wireless industry, which happened to be named as, John has pointed in the past, for capital we all deployed years ago. They just want great services. This new company will be uniquely positioned to be able to compete across all three segments of the rapidly converging market, distributing entertainment to people wherever they maybe including their home, serving their home Internet needs and serving their wireless needs as when they\u2019re on the go. John Legere : And I really appreciate the content in your question. There\u2019s two parts to it. And I want to be highly respectful to one of them. One of them is, how will decision makers in Washington make their decisions. And that\u2019s not something that, I have the respect that they have their processes, they\u2019re trying to protect competition, protect American consumers, et cetera. Your point though is very consistent with what my and our dialogue will be. The \u2013 where are we going? Where is the competitive environment going? Where do consumers want? What do they need? And how should this dialogue be had? I\u2019m not only highly confident about the transaction making tremendous sense under traditional measurements, but under the evolution of what you\u2019re suggesting and what we see as to where things are going in a converged environment. I think it makes tremendous, tremendous sense, but I can prejudge how decision makers are going to evaluate themselves. Tim Horan : Just to clarify that, your conversations with decision makers, are they being forward-looking or rearview mirror looking close \u2013 DOJ\u2019s metrics are always rearview mirror. But the question is, is the SEC really going to look on your conversations will be around the future of the industry over the past. John Legere : Yes. And again, so far what my dialogue has been is a very respectful notification of what we\u2019re doing, a strong suggestion to decision makers that they not prejudge and they allow us to prepare all the information and a strong confidence by me that we have the detail in the data to match our headlines. And I do see across the board, a willingness to listen to something that can be strong for consumers and for America on many fronts. So far so good, we\u2019ll continue to plug in. But I want to be highly respectful to a process that\u2019s just beginning and make sure that a lot of my initial contacts are telling that I\u2019m overly willing to engage in detail, and that we do have things to match our headlines and things that are great for the country. Tim Horan : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Mike McCormack with Guggenheim. Please go ahead. Mike McCormack : Hey, guys. Thanks. Brax, moving just quick comment on enhanced ARPU, look to me like that the first half had sort of tougher comps in the back half, it gets easier. Is that goal of sort of plus or minus 1% being pretty conservative? And then obviously, good results in the churn side this quarter. Can you just walk through some of the things that drove that and as we step into 2Q, 3Q, 4Q. How that should be pacing? Thanks. John Legere : Yes, sure. On the ARPU, you got to go back to \u2013 what is our strategy? And our strategy is that we\u2019re going to create more terminal value for our shareholders by organically scaling the business and unlocking the margin and realizing that margin expansion as we organically scale versus the monetization of ARPU. So certainly, if the choice was made with a different strategy, there would be opportunities to do more than 1% increase in ARPU, that\u2019s not the model we\u2019re executing to. And Mike made it very, very clear that we have upcoming on carrier moves. We\u2019re going to continue to add value. We\u2019re going to continue to be ultra-aggressive the NewCo put it\u2019s on steroids. And you really need to stay within the overall guidance that we\u2019ve given the marketplace of generally stable. And the churn equation has just been amazing. I\u2019ll turn over Mike \u2013 to Mike to talk about some of the operational things that are behind us. But the first thing, I\u2019ll say is first and foremost everything about this fantastic network that no one is team of created that continues to get better by the day. But I\u2019ll turn it over to Mike. Mike Sievert : That\u2019s exactly right. I mean, I think you\u2019re seeing churn rates fall across the board and we\u2019re really delighted that we\u2019re seeing our historically lowest churn rates ever. We\u2019re not giving guidance on this metric. But we remain really optimistic about it. We may continue to see new benchmarks being hit here. And it has to do with the network. And the network \u2013 what\u2019s happening it\u2019s interesting, we\u2019re reaching in the next couple years, the end of the 4G LTE lifecycle and plunging into 5G and what you\u2019re seeing is a maturation of networks, where if you back up two and three and four years ago, network was a major point of difference for one or two of the players in this market. And they were \u2013 it was their reason for being, it was Verizon\u2019s reason for being that advantage has been removed. We have a mature LTE environment now. And T-Mobile has certainly put itself in a position where there\u2019s nobody out there, that can differentiate on network versus us anymore. And you see that in our rate. Secondly, people are sticking with their smartphones a lot longer, and you\u2019ve seen these upgrade rates, hit historic lows, since the smartphone boom began and smartphone changing is a time when you can consider changing carriers. So that\u2019s been another contributor. Both of these trends are trends that we see in our business, potentially continuing to develop. I think this new company the new T-Mobile has a chance to create a new kind of network-based competition that could drive switching again. And we intend to be a very fierce competitor on value, on price and on network. And we think there\u2019s a chance to drive real differentiation back into the market on network. But basically, that traditional advantage of that horizon used to have in network is gone. They don\u2019t know what to do about it. In the meantime, our business is driving as a result. Braxton Carter : I had a very important e-mail question that just came in. And if it wasn\u2019t clear before, I want to definitively state that our EBITDAs and our margins that we gave pro forma for NewCo include all costs to achieve an integration expenses. Now I realize from an accounting standpoint that stuff is typically separated. It\u2019s very important for everybody to understand that those margins are inclusive of all the cost to achieve. Nils Paellmann : Good clarification. Operator, I think we\u2019ll take one or two more. Next question? Operator : Our next question will come from Scott Goldman with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Scott Goldman : Hey, guys. Thanks. Two questions, if I could. Maybe first for Neville, if we go back to \u2013 excuse me one of the questions \u2013 a couple questions ago, just around the speeds, capabilities and talking about 450 megabit per second. Is that just leveraging 600 megahertz as well as the Sprint mid-band that we\u2019re talking about there? Or does that require a millimeter wave to get those types of speeds? And I\u2019m just trying to figure out in there, sort of what your potential interest might be in the millimeter wave and CBRS auctions, should they come up over the next year in change? And then secondly, maybe for Mike just \u2013 if you can just give an update little bit on the business opportunity. I think that accounted for about a fifth of net adds last year and what impact that has in the economics, when we think about churn and ARPU and those types of metrics? Thanks. Mike Sievert : Okay. Let me start Scott. So the speeds and incredible kind of capacities and performance, capabilities that Mike talked about, they come from this unique opportunity between Sprint and T-Mobile to combine on an incredible set of spectrum assets. 600 megahertz, obviously, the spectrum we secured in the auction not too long ago and we\u2019ve been deploying at a furious pace the 2, 2.5 gig spectrum we should roughly point out from Sprint. The timelines by which we can achieve these types of speeds and capabilities will be reforming other spectrum assets that we have within the company, PCS spectrum for example. And on top, in the dense urban environments where we do believe, you can deploy a millimeter wave. But it needs to be in the right locations and it\u2019s going to be sparsely deployed in urban environments because of the propagation constraints. But you put all of those spectrum assets to work. And the result and capabilities are just all inspiring. But the line share of the capability here is coming from the combination of the existing assets millimeter wave helps on top, the 2.5 gig brings an incredible capability and the combination of these two companies allows that 2.5 gig spectrum to be committed to 5G at a pace and scale that you couldn\u2019t do otherwise on your own. So it\u2019s results an incredible capacity story. I think then if you look at millimeter wave auctions and clearly there\u2019s going to be an auction this year, 28 gig and it\u2019s going to carry along 24 gig too. We are interested and we\u2019ve been very clear both companies will determine that paths forward independently on those auctions. And so millimeter wave is still going to be a material interest to us as a company. And then you mention CBRS and soon we hope, or at some point in time, that\u2019ll be a C band auction. And all of those spectrum assets are going to be important to lookout and consider. John Legere : Okay. On the business, you asked about business. Yes, you\u2019re right. I mean 2017 was an all time high in record on performance. 1Q again fantastic results 20% of net adds, what\u2019s happening here is that, companies \u2013 we\u2019re winning new logos at a historically high rate and we disclose some of that to you in our discussion that\u2019s exciting to see because we\u2019re not just seeing the old favorites doubling down or winning new companies. And we\u2019re winning them after they conduct extensive trials and I really love this, because it kind of, is a predictor of our consumer success that we can look forward to, because consumers buy on reputation and our reputation lags our actual network facts. Business is more on facts because they try them all that they get 100 units of each and take them for weeks at a time and then come back and we\u2019re winning those bids with more new logo development than we\u2019ve ever seen. Now I want to stress couple things. One is that we\u2019re winning what I call stress test customers, airlines, hotel chains, retailers, highly distributed companies that are virtually everywhere that need coverage. So we have virtually all the airlines now we have 8 of the top 10 retailers in the country, 39 state governments et cetera. But the second thing, I want to emphasize is even though that\u2019s great. For all of this amazing success, we\u2019re a four-share, where we\u2019ve become a four-share in this market. And that\u2019s why I want to finish by saying, how excited I am about the new T-Mobile and what it can do in this space? Because this is a massive market, we are gaining share now. But the truth is this combined network, the world\u2019s most advanced 5G network is going to be a game changer when it comes to our relative competitiveness and being able to finally bring real meaningful competition not just to AT&T and Verizon but even to fiber companies, cable companies and others who serve this space. So that\u2019s really exciting and really important. And it\u2019s one of the early investments, we\u2019re going to make. Our business plan is funded for an expansion of our enterprise team. In year one, we\u2019re going to take advantage of this set of capabilities and get after it and we funded our plan in year one to hire aggressively to get after the business market. Scott Goldman : Just quick follow-up\u2026 John Legere : Yes, go ahead. Scott Goldman : Thank you, John. Just as the quick follow-up. How much of a driver is that some of the improved churn that we see or even though maybe some of the better ARPU that we seen in the quarter. Is that something that drive those metrics going forward? John Legere : Got it. Yes, sorry, you asked that, I didn\u2019t answer. Not really, the overall financial profile is similar to a large family plan. So we \u2013 cost to acquire churn rates, ARPU rates, there are pros and cons on each side. But they\u2019re not materially different better or worse. Scott Goldman : Thank you. Nils Paellmann : Okay, operator, I think we take one more question. Operator : Our next question will come from Walter Piecyk with BTIG. Please go ahead. Walter Piecyk : Thank you. I want to go to back to Chaplin\u2019s question on the roaming thing. Just because never made understand the technology, does the VoIP work, like what has to happened in the VoIP, do they have to have in their phones in order for voice calls to work on your network? Or is it just have to be enabling your network? How does that work? Neville Ray : It\u2019s LTE data. Walter Piecyk : So will they be able to make VoIP calls, like will Sprint customer, because I don\u2019t think they have VoIP in their network. But will their phones work on your network as a VoIP call. Neville Ray : They could\u2026 Walter Piecyk : Like a VoLTE, I\u2019m sorry, VoLTE that\u2019s what I mean to say. Yelling at me. Neville Ray : Well, they could do VoIP, but not VoLTE at this point. But they obviously\u2026 Walter Piecyk : Not VoLTE, okay, got it. Yes, yes, sorry. So no VoLTE. So the roaming only really give them data, right. So that but they would need actual voice calls in these areas, where they don\u2019t have service? Neville Ray : Yes, they have underlying voice, right from \u2013 on the CDMA side. The issue that we\u2019re trying to address and work together on is LTE data coverage. That\u2019s what we do with the agreement. Walter Piecyk : Okay. And then Mike, I forgot who ask you but that you\u2019re talking about the mix of more prime and more rural and obviously, does the huge opportunity for you guys given the very low penetration. Do you guys have plan on maybe providing more tangible data on that as far as like if you\u2019re 3% now, it\u2019s going 10% or 15% or anything else you can give us to see if this is resonating in the base, as far as leveraging some of these investments that you\u2019ve now been making for over a year? Mike Sievert : Yes. That\u2019s great, Walt. I\u2019m sure we can provide some color here and there. When we start breaking it down into segments. The challenge for that is we got some great things we\u2019re doing and pockets of opportunity that we find. And it\u2019s very competitively sensitive in a competitive market for us to slice and dice it for you. But I don\u2019t see any reason, why we can\u2019t provide some additional color here and there on an occasional basis. Walter Piecyk : And then just one last one. I mean, if you look at AT&T, the net adds obviously down, when you back up all that migration stuff but better than I think what people are expected they off their upgrade rate, also reverse. You were talking about, I think your exact quote here that this downward upgrade rate would continue, so but it seems like AT&T through BOGO offers is yielding some benefits there. Is your view that basically, it\u2019s not worth it to give away a free phone in order to actually grow your phone growths add? Or can you just give us a little bit more concept on what your thought process is on using phone promotions going forward? Mike Sievert : I think it\u2019s, the more interesting question is what their thought process. In other words, we were really confused by their plan and I don\u2019t think that their plan was confusing by choice. In other words, they dipped in and out of promotions and I think they didn\u2019t like what it felt like and walk them back really, really deep BOGO offers et cetera, that nobody else in the market matched and then they snatched them back out of the market. They seem confused about whether or not you need to also have satellite service, in order to get their best deal and a fair deal. So yes, I mean they did have some pretty heavy device promotions in market that looked to us like they were uneconomic offers. And then they snatched them out, when it didn\u2019t result in any meaningful share gains for them. And so what happens is, if you don\u2019t get lift and attract customers from offers like that, it\u2019s awfully hard to pencil \u2013 why in a business model. Remember, we took subsidies out a long time ago, these run rates are meant \u2013 people are meant to be buying phones by and large, why they would do that? John Legere : So well, I would just say, I\u2019ve been so well behaved today. I hesitate to do this, I think you can describe AT&T\u2019s plan as Buy One Get One customer which is what they were doing very specifically and if you can describe AT&T\u2019s numbers as better than expected. The only thing that we need to change is what expectations are? Because\u2026 Walter Piecyk : That element of it. Obviously, there are other elements\u2026 John Legere : Yes, it was most horrific print I\u2019ve ever seen. And if you tried to ask part four of a question, while we\u2019re going to put you on the list that you\u2019re already on with the other part of our merger. Walter Piecyk : All right. Thank you. Have a great night. John Legere : I want to say before Braxton says farewell. There\u2019s a tremendous amount of questions that came in on Twitter. And they were quite heavily deal-relate, I will tell you that there were several of a theme that I just want to say, I really enjoyed, because it\u2019s our number of people that are saying, exactly what I want to hear and what I\u2019m down here doing, which is \u201cHey John, this story about what you can create in this merger with Sprint on 5G sounds really interesting this jobs items sounds interesting. This price competition in supercharging on the carrier, yes, it\u2019s interesting the service expansion. But hey, the devil\u2019s in the details. So prove it.\u201d And that\u2019s music to my ears, because obviously, we wouldn\u2019t come out with this unless we could show it and prove it and I almost feel like I should reply on Twitter, which is, okay, deal, if I can prove it, are we good? So in effect, I find that awareness of the things that we\u2019re saying fantastic and in the right for stage. I\u2019m also extremely proud of the results that we posted here. And I also want to make sure, that it a lot of the questions came in that momentum and that focus on the business will not change a single iota during this approval process and that\u2019s something you can count on from us. And Braxton? Braxton Carter : So thanks everybody for tune in and it\u2019s been quite the week so far. We look forward to speaking again very soon another great quarter for T-Mobile coming up and more importantly, we just can\u2019t convey how we\u2019re excited about taking the end carrier in super charging it with the creation of this new company. So with that we\u2019ll turn it over to the operator. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the T-Mobile US first quarter 2018 earnings call. If you have any further questions, you may contact the investor relations or media departments. Thank you for your participation, you may now disconnect and have a pleasant day.",

Welcome to the T-Mobile US Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. Following opening remarks, the earnings call will be opened for questions via the conference line, Twitter, Facebook or text message. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Nils Paellmann, Head of Investor Relations for T-Mobile US. Please go ahead, sir. Nils Paellmann : Yes, thank you very much. Welcome to our second quarter 2018 earnings call. With me today are John Legere, our CEO; Mike Sievert, our President and COO; Braxton Carter, our CFO; and other members of the senior leadership team. Let me read the disclaimer, during this call, we will make forward-looking statements that include projections and statements about our future financial operating results, our plans, the benefit we expect to receive from the proposed merger with Sprint and other statements that are not historical facts. Such statements are based upon the current beliefs and expectations of our management and are subject to significant risk and uncertainty outside of our control that could cause our actual results to differ materially including the risk factors set forth in our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Reconciliations between GAAP and the non-GAAP results we discuss on this call can be found in the Quarterly Results section of the Investor Relations page of our website. In addition, in connection with the proposed transaction on July 30, we filed with the SEC a registration statement on Form S4 that contains important information about T-Mobile and Sprint, the merger, and related matters. The registration statement has not yet become effective.  So, with that, let me turn it over to John Legere. John Legere : Okay, good afternoon everyone. Welcome to T-Mobile second quarter 2018 earnings call and Twitter conference coming to you live from Bellevue, Washington. We have incredible results to cover. Let me just give you the headlines and then we can jump into the details. We just posted our best Q2 ever and led the industry in postpaid phone growth for the 18th quarter in a row. Service revenues and adjusted EBITDA are hitting record highs and we also posted record low branded postpaid phone churn. Our network was just recognized by Ookla and OpenSignal as leading the industry in 4G LTE speeds, extending our winning streak 18 quarters in a row. And even Verizon\u2019s favorite pay to play measurement service RootMetrics gave T-Mobile\u2019s network some love in their report last week with 454 metro area routes score awards, second only to Verizon and well ahead of AT&T. Our retail and customer care teams are setting the standard for customer experience and our increased guidance shows that we expect to maintain this level of performance in the second half of the year. In a nutshell, T-Mobile continues to meet the needs of customers by delivering more value and that is translating into incredible results. So let's dive into our fantastic second quarter. We added 1.6 million total net customers, extending our winning streak to 21 quarters in a row with more than 1 million. That's more than half a decade if you're keeping score at home. With 686,000 branded postpaid phone net additions, we captured about two thirds of the industry's postpaid phone growth, grew nearly two times faster than Verizon, AT&T, Sprint, and Comcast combined and more than three times faster than our next closest competitor Comcast. And we grew faster sequentially and year over year. So who says we're slowing down. Our share gains are also reflected in strong postpaid porting ratios. The overall postpaid porting ratio was 1.86, up from 1.69 in Q1 and 1.38 in Q2 of last year. In the second quarter, our postpaid porting ratio against both AT&T and Verizon was higher than two to one. Yes, I did say two. This acceleration in growth has been driven in particular by our continued focus on under penetrated segments such as new geographies, business, 55+, and most recently this April military, one of the most underappreciated segments. We also had strong branded postpaid net additions of 1 million, supported by continued strong growth of wearables, particularly the Apple Watch. Our customers are staying longer than ever before. In Q2, we had our lowest ever branded postpaid phone churn of 0.95%, down 15 basis points year over year. This blew away even the most bullish analysts estimates and was our first quarter ever with churn below 1%. And branded prepaid net customer additions came in at 91,000, flat year over year despite increased competitive activity in the market. Our financial results were just as solid as our customer results. Service revenues grew by 7% year over year to $7.9 billion which was another record high. Net income was strong at $0.8 billion, up 35% year over year and fully diluted EPS came in at $0.92. Adjusted EBITDA amounted to a record high $3.2 billion, up 7% year over year with a 41% adjusted EBITDA margin. Now turning to network, we continue to expand coverage and improve our already industry leading network performance. We now cover 323 million POPs with 4G LTE, well on our way to 325 million by year end. And we continue to aggressively rollout low band spectrum with our 700 megahertz deployment virtually complete and our 600 megahertz deployment continuing at a furious pace. We now have low band spectrum deployed to 289 million POPs and 600 megahertz is live in 992 cities and towns in 33 states as of today. And the 600 megahertz gear we are deploying will be upgradable to 5G with a software update. In March, we launched our first 600 megahertz capable flagship smartphone, the Samsung Galaxy S9 which was followed by the LG G7 ThinQ in June. Including these phones, we now have a dozen smartphones in market that are 600 megahertz capable. Our plan continues to be to bring 5G to 30 cities in 2018 starting with New York, LA, Dallas, Las Vegas, with nationwide coverage coming in 2020. This network will utilize 600 megahertz and will harness 4G and 5G bandwidth simultaneously for dual connectivity and will be ready for the first 5G smartphones in 2019. As I mentioned earlier, Ookla released their mobile speed test report and millions of real world tests confirm what we already know, T-Mobile\u2019s download and upload speeds continue to lead the industry. In Q2, our average download 4G LTE speed was 31.8 megabits per second, well ahead of all our competitors. Like I mentioned, Q2 marks the 18 quarter in a row that T-Mobile is the fastest 4G LTE network. Open Signal also just published their state of mobile networks report which analyzed billions of data points from actual users, T-Mobile once again cleaned up winning five of seven categories outright and tied for first place with Verizon for 4G availability, can you hear me now. Our front line is setting the standard for customer experience. Digitally accelerated retails making it easier to join T-Mobile by simplifying the switching experience and team of experts in care is making it easy to serve our customers in driving record low calls per account. Our strong momentum and record Q2 means that we are increasing our guidance for 2018 again. Our outlook now calls for 3 million to 3.6 million branded postpaid net customer additions and adjusted EBITDA of $11.7 billion to $12.4 billion. Our three-year CAGR estimate for free cash flow remains at 46% to 48% with cash CapEx now expected to be at the high end of the guidance range of 4.9 billion to 5.3 billion. Let me also give you a brief update on the progress of our pending merger with Sprint. While we still have a number of steps remaining in the regulatory approval process, we are optimistic and confident that regulators will recognize the significant pro competitive benefits of this combination and grant regulatory approval. I think we made it clear that this merger is pro consumer and all about super charging the Un-carrier and about bringing broad and deep nationwide 5G to Americans as fast as possible. On top of that, the new T-Mobile will increase competition and create American jobs. A few milestones to note; our public interest statement was filed with the FCC on June 18. On June 27, Marcello Claure and I had the opportunity to testify in front of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on antitrust, competition policy, and consumer rights. The FCC put out its public notice on July 18 starting their non-binding 180-day transaction clock. Our preliminary S4 was filed with the FCC on Monday, July 30. So we're making great progress and look forward to continuing to tell the story about how this merger will be good for consumers and good for the country. Okay, before handing over, let me mention one more thing. Isn't it about time we shake things up in this industry, again? Let me just say that our next industry shaking Un-carrier move is just two weeks away. I'll leave it at that and let speculation begin. I can't wait to talk to you all on August 15. Okay, our CFO Braxton Carter will take us through the financial results and the details of our guidance. Braxton, let's take a closer look. Braxton Carter : Hey, thanks, John, and I'm so excited to report on another fantastic quarter here at T-Mobile. Net income amounted to 782 million, up 35% year over year. This was due to higher operating income, lower interest expense, and lower tax expense due to the continued positive impact of tax reform. Net income included a benefit of 62 million from the new revenue recognition standard and also benefited from 45 million in after-tax insurance reimbursements for the hurricane impacts. On the other hand, net income was impacted by 39 million in after-tax costs associated with the Sprint merger. On a sequential basis, net income was also impacted by higher depreciation which increased 3.7% from Q1 due to lease depreciation and the impact of the further expansion and build out of our network. We expect this trend of higher depreciation to continue into the second half of the year and impact net income accordingly. Adjusted EBITDA amounted to 3.2 billion, up 7.3% and included lease revenues of 177 million versus 234 million in the prior year. Note that adjusted EBITDA included a positive impact from last year's hurricanes of 70 million due to insurance reimbursements and 84 million from the new revenue recognition standard. The adjusted EBITDA performance is a reflection of strong cost management. Cost of services as a percentage of service revenue increased by just 30 basis points sequentially despite the rapid rollout of 600 megahertz and that excludes the net positive impact from hurricanes in Q1 and Q2. Also the new revenue recognition standard added 26 million to the cost of services in Q2. SG&A as a percentage of service revenue decreased by 90 basis points sequentially despite the acceleration in growth. This was adjusted for the 41 million in costs associated with the Sprint merger which are also excluded from adjusted EBITDA. Equipment losses decreased by 45 million or 9.1% sequentially in connection with a still light postpaid upgrade rate of 6% and a sequential decrease in the number of devices sold. Free cash flow increased by 61% to 774 million, this was driven by 14% increase in net cash provided by operating activities and a 50% increase in proceeds related to our deferred purchase price from securitization transactions. Please note that the net cash proceeds from securitization amounted to just 25 million in Q2 and a drag of 125 million in the first half of 2018. The increase in free cash flow occurred despite a significant increase in cash CapEx which grew by 21% year over year to 1.6 billion. As last year, CapEx was front-end loaded in connection with our accelerated 600 megahertz rollout. Branded postpaid phone ARPU proved fairly resilient in the second quarter at 46.52, down 0.3% sequentially and 1.2% year over year, reflecting the impact of promotions targeting new segments, offset by the positive impact of continued adoption of our T-Mobile ONE rate plans. For the year as a whole, we continue to expect ARPU to be generally stable excluding the impact from the new revenue recognition standard. In terms of customer quality, our results in the second quarter were outstanding. Total bad debt expense and losses from sell receivables were 102 million or a record low of 0.96% of total revenues compared to 162 million or 1.59% in the second quarter of 2017 even with a significantly higher customer base. Do note that Q2 is usually a seasonal low for bad debt expense for our industry, so we do not expect a sequential pick up in the second half of the year. Now let's get on the 2018 guidance, we expect branded postpaid net customer additions to be between 3 million and 3.6 million, up from the prior guidance range of 2.6 million to 3.3 million. This guidance takes into account our long-term strategy to balance growth and profitability, the lower switcher volumes we've seen in recent quarters and our pursuit of growth adjacencies. Our guidance also takes into account the expected typical seasonal sequential uptick in postpaid churn which will occur in the second half of the year. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of 11.5 billion to 11.9 billion, not including the impact of the new revenue recognition standard, up from the prior guidance range of 11.4 billion to 11.8 billion. The new revenue recognition standard will increase adjusted EBITDA by another 0.2 billion to 0.5 billion for an all-in new guidance range of 11.7 billion to 12.4 billion. This guidance takes into account an expected decline in leasing revenues in 2018, we still targeted at 600 million to 700 million but that's compared to 877 million in 2017 as well as our build out of low band spectrum including the accelerated rollout of 600 megahertz spectrum driving up expected cost of services by 300 million to 400 million per year which we communicated at the beginning of the year. Our increased outlook for 2018 demonstrates that we're following the same approach with regard to our guidance in prior years. Note that we now have increased the ranges for both branded postpaid net additions and for adjusted EBITDA twice this year. We target cash CapEx of 4.9 billion to 5.3 billion excluding capitalized interest. This includes expenditures for 5G deployment. Updated from prior guidance, we now expect to come in at the high end of the guidance range given the massive success that Neville and his team are having clearing 600 megahertz spectrum. Finally, we expect free cash flow to increase at a three-year CAGR of 46% to 48% from full-year 2016 to full-year 2019 unchanged from the prior range. During the same period, we expect the net underlying net cash provided by operating activities to increase at an unchanged CAGR of 7% to 12%. Let me emphasize that our free cash flow guidance does not assume any material net cash inflows from securitizations going forward. Before we get to your questions, let me briefly address preliminary S4 for the merger with Sprint. The S4 contains disclosures regarding the transaction including certain standalone and pro forma combined financial projections, which have been prepared on the basis and subject to the qualifications described in the S4. The prospective financial information in the S4 reflects what we believe as a conservative case, does not include the impacts of the revenue recognition standard and it is not necessarily our current view on the outlook for the upcoming years. We encourage you to read the disclosure in the S4 for additional information. The S4 has not yet become effective and the purpose of today's call is to discuss our second quarter. So I\u2019d ask that you focus your questions on our earnings. Now, let's get to your questions, you can ask questions via phone, text message, or via Twitter or Facebook. We'll start with a question on the phone. Operator, first question please. Operator : And our first question comes from Mike Rollins with Citi. Mike Rollins : Thanks. So couple questions if I could, first on the gross ads side. Can talk about you know what you're seeing you mentioned some of the vertical strength, but can you talk a little bit more about maybe some of the benefit that the vertical promotions gave you in the quarter like 55+ military promotions? And then what you're seeing from customers who have been bundling in the Netflix promotion? Are you seeing any significant differences in this cohort for churn or engagement rights? Thanks very much. John Legere : Mike, I think that's the best first question of all time. It\u2019s a day of best. Mike? Mike Sievert : Unfortunately, Michael, I would give you a little bit of color, but probably can\u2019t unpack it very quantitatively for you. The color is probably as you would suspect. This unlimited 55+ and also the military offer we launched a few months ago that we're very proud of. They're just going great. They're going gangbusters and it's really showing new audiences where we've been under indexed, audiences that have been under appreciated in this market that somebody is looking out for. And our business is responding. So they've been nice contributors. Another thing that\u2019s been a nice contributor has been the business markets. We say our highest activations ever in the business markets this last quarter, more public sector successes across the board enterprise successes and in larger enterprises where churn is more favorable. So, the lowest churn in our business markets ever this last quarter as well. And to your question about Netflix, yeah, we can\u2019t unpack it for you too much except to say, yes, it does turn out that those that are taking advantage of it do have lower churn. And that was one of the things that was important for our business case and it is panning out to be the case. John Legere : Mike, I think one of the things I\u2019m glad you recognized. We were very forward looking team, not just on the investments in our network but the focus on the segments that we know provide growth including of course geographic expansion around the network. And that has gotten us to the point where quarter after quarter we are not getting the growth that we thought about three to four or more quarters ago. I would also say that one of the most exciting parts is, on a day to day basis going forward, our network has never been better and it is going to be better every day. And secondly, we have started to perform in the customer care environment in a way that I don't think American business itself has ever seen. And those two aspects of a care experience and a network experience that's never been matched up to now, I feel very bullish about what we're going to be able to do going forward. Mike Rollins : If I can just follow up on your comments on the regulatory side; are there some incremental learning that the management team has had over the last few months in your conversations and engagement with regulators that you\u2019d want to share with the audience today? John Legere : I wouldn't say new learnings, we've been very, very pleased from day one with the story that we're providing as to why the coming together with Sprint is pro-competition, pro-consumer, pro-America, very critical from many aspects especially the deployment of 5G capabilities. And the whole story together has been something that we've been telling and working on and we're very confident that with that story and the details of why these two companies coming together makes tremendous sense for competition, for the country, the learning is that it's a story that we need to keep telling and it's a story that with the aspects associated with the people we are competing against has been very well received. But as you know, this is a process where all I can say is we're in a process, we're in multiple processes that we greatly respect and we have committed to playing continuous and not necessarily in the public eye. But as it's going, I would say we feel very good that if we continue to tell this story to the associated regulatory groups that they will see why this is a deal that should be approved. Mike Rollins : Thank you. John Legere : Operator, we\u2019re going to take another question on the phone, but I ask my peers here to go through the various questions that are coming in on TMUS in the various IR sites that if, you know, pick one, I\u2019ll pause and one or two questions from the operator and we\u2019ll go to those as well. So, operator we\u2019ll take the next question on the phone. Operator : Our next question comes from Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Brett Feldman : Obviously another quarter of strong service revenue growth, some of your peers started to show some better service revenue growth, but in their case, it was ARPU driven, where you guys are still doing it by winning customers. It does look like the pricing feeling is moving up a bit in the industry. And so I was hoping you could share your thoughts on sort of the trade-off between figuring out ways to get people to maybe pay a bit more for the service to get more value versus keeping your pricing well below peers to make sure that you can drive higher customer growth. Thanks. John Legere : Let's just make sure we go into that question from a standpoint of remembering that 7% service revenue growth, 7% EBITDA and the increase that we are driving in cash from operations and free cash flow in this business is something that's a part of going in. I certainly haven't seen any of our peers driving that kind of growth in top-line revenue. And I think mostly our peers, our competitors are attempting to break the zero line. So I'm very pleased with the differentiation of what we're doing and how we\u2019re driving it all the way to cash, but maybe Mike and Braxton can talk both about ARPU. Mike Sievert : A lot of what we're seeing on these ARPU developments has to do with customers choosing to deepen their relationships with us. It's not just about the prices we offer, it's about customers seeing the value of what we offer and deciding to buy up our stack and that's important. We were able to beat consensus of ARPU this quarter, we were generally stable from a year ago, 1.2% or so. But what's happening is that people are taking advantage of, for example, our taxes and fees included, which is a terrific value and something that's contributing, for example, to our all-time record churn and so these things have business cases that unfold, but that's offset by customers deciding to move up from our legacy, simple choice offers into our fully unlimited T-Mobile ONE, customers buying more features from us like T-Mobile ONE Plus, which is a great add-on package and other things. So they're choosing proactively to deepen their relationships with us and partly that's because the experience they're having on our network, we\u2019re attracting more prime consumers, more suburban families, people with more serious wireless needs and because the customers have more serious needs, they're buying up our stack. John Legere : Yeah. And let me just add a couple of things, when you really deep dive some of these ARPU changes and trajectory with the competitors, you've got to remember that they're doing it by screwing the customer. Administrative fees are a huge part of what's happening there and you're taking that out of the pockets of existing customers. You know our strategy has been that when we model all permutations of how we could manage the business and we're very balanced in the way that we do it, we can create a lot more terminal value by unlocking the scale benefits of the network that's in place and we're doing that with a generally stable ARPU, which has been down just slightly over the last two years. And that's a situation that we're going to do on a standalone basis and it gets really exciting the competition that we can bring with all of the network capacity with the new T-Mobile that will be formed in the future and that's our philosophy, that\u2019s the way we run the business and we're here to create shareholder value. Mike Sievert : The experience we've had, not just this quarter, but if you go back since we started the carrier moves, you go back to 2013, our customers have enjoyed a 12-fold increase in the data that they can use with about an 11% decline in price, but also a significant expansion in our EBITDA and EBITDA margin. That's the history. Our history with MetroPCS is even greater. Since we merged and acquired MetroPCS, we have twice as many customers, three times as many employees, we cover five times as many markets and MetroPCS customers have gotten greater than 10-fold the amount of data. And they've enjoyed in their various plans between 17% and 25% lower priced plans, and by the way, they use more data than the rest of our customer base. So when you click ahead to what we're talking about when coming together with Sprint and this significant expansion in available capacity that we're going to have, that's where you can clearly see competition will definitely go up, service offerings will expand and prices, customers will be the beneficiary of lower prices, while we'll be able to drive the profitability because of the significant decrease in cost structure. So that's our game plan in the past. We\u2019ve proved it. It's our game plan going forward as well as into the new T-Mobile. Operator : Our next question comes from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Simon Flannery : I was wondering, John, if you could update us on Layer3 TV and I think Braxton, you talked about the adjacencies, but what do you see in the ability to take the on carrier model beyond your current offerings? John Legere : Mike, why don\u2019t you start with, what you want, update on Layer3 TV and maybe we can segue into, not just through Layer3, but in you new T-Mobile, what we're thinking about and why it's critical for the industry and for the country? Mike Sievert : Well, as we said, when we announced the acquisition of Layer3, this is a market that, if there ever was one that needs to be on carrier and we see a lot of opportunity. We\u2019re doing a few things. Number one, we have our heads down, kind of quietly expanding what we have and as a test bed, while simultaneously developing the product that we intend to bring to market and you're going to see a lot of firsts in that product, because customers have a lot of needs. They're sick and tired of these outdated systems that the legacy cable companies have been bringing them with their outdated program guides and the technology island that your TV represents as opposed to your highly connected social media fueled life that you live in your mobile phones. So we're really excited about what we can do there. We continue to plan it for this year, during 2018, as our initial launch and our team's doing a fantastic job. What's really interesting and we went into Layer3 with the idea in the back of our heads of the new T-Mobile. What's really interesting is what component it could become when the 5G network of the new company starts to unfold, because this 5G network is a network where we intend to plunge into broadband, not just mobile connections like today, but in the in-home broadband, because this network has the depth and breadth of 5G that's simply unprecedented in the market.  We see the opportunity to offer broadband during -- in huge swaths of the market, which will bring competition benefits to customers even those who don't choose us, but we think about 10 million will choose us over the first few years, because we'll be offering a better price broadband offering and by the way, an offering to parts of the market that have literally no competition today like half of Americans today have one or zero high speed broadband offers. That's crazy, it's the definition of uncompetitive. Once we do that, now, all of a sudden, the TV is even more interesting because you're offering the broadband and you can offer the TV on top of it. So that's a big piece of the future of the new T-Mobile. And I think one of the exciting -- there was a question previously about any learnings, since we announced the transaction. Amongst the things that I'm watching happening in the industry and various announcements is when you see what's happening in the cable industry for example and what broadband access is driving for their value and you realize the speeds that they're giving, what people haven't really connected to until recently is that with the new T-Mobile, by 2021, two-thirds of the country will have greater than 100 megabit speed, so if you think about in the context of broadband, by 2024, it will be 90%.  And very importantly, in the underserved rural America segment, when you get out to 2024, we'll have 74% of them covered with greater than 10 megs, but with home CP and our in-broadband distribution opportunity that we see, you'll have 84% that can get greater than 25 megabits. Now, that's a big learning, because I don't think people have really thought through what's going to come with the network capabilities at the wireless players like us will bring and what its impact is going to be, on amongst other things, in home broadband where we expect to serve close to 10 million customers out by 2024 and 20% to 25% of them will be in rural America and these are the things that I don't think people have double clicked on yet with what happens when network speeds get to be 150, 450 megabits and certainly greater in hot areas. Simon Flannery : And you can support several hundred gigs per customer in that environment? Mike Sievert : That's right. Neville? Neville Ray : Yeah. So Bill\u2019s question, few on millimeter wave or mid-band, not 2.5 gig is foundational future complement to skinny 600 megahertz. I think Mike Dano from Fierce had a question here too, which is along same lines, will you participate in the upcoming FCC millimeter wave spectrum auction. So real quick, I think we can claim and I don't think it would be disputed that we've been the most vocal company probably globally around the need for spectrum in all bands for 5G, be that low, mid or high. And so we've had a lot of passion about that in the regulatory environments with across the technical community and standardization. And today, obviously, everybody talks about 5G being used across mid, low and high bands. That's a different discussion than the one that was happening 12 to 18 months ago.  So that's a good thing. We're very encouraged by the actions of the FCC on millimeter wave, their efforts and work on midband Spectrum, be that CBRS or the C-Band. There's timing challenges on especially on C-Band that's going to take maybe several years to realize, but millimeter wave auctions are planned for this year and into \u201919. And yes, for sure, we have material interest in participating in those auctions and something that's of keen interest to us at T-Mobile. We obviously have to work through the process in like about transaction with -- pending transaction with Sprint with the FCC and we're currently doing that and we look forward to participating in the auctions later this year. I think from a mid band perspective, CBRS probably \u201819. And then when we look at C-Band and some of the other opportunities, it\u2019s going to be into the next decade. But yeah, 5G across all bands, a key priority for us and will continue to be so. John Legere : Neville, I think the topic that you're covering is a great way, so going to the end, yes, we are interested -- we've made that very clear from the beginning. We have some processes that we have to work through with the FCC that we are clearly driving ahead and we have nothing to report, but our interest is high. I would also say never confuse our attacks on the millimeter wave strategy of our competitors with us not believing that there's a place for millimeter wave spectrum in the 5G portfolio of what you need to create. It's just not a standalone way to drive what this nation needs for coverage in 5G. And very importantly, what we've said is with the breadth and the depth that you can get with the new T-Mobile\u2019s network of T-Mobile low band and Sprint\u2019s 2.5, we can deliver something that is truly one of a kind in the world from a standpoint of 5G. And the millimeter wave component is something we're very interested in and we'll put it in the portfolio. We have some spectrum already that we\u2019ll be deploying, but this nationwide deep, broad network is what this country needs and that's kind of not something you get purely by hot spots in three or four geographic locations, but good question and by the way along with millimeter wave, Neville has never met any spectrum yet on this planet that he wasn't interested in. So okay, operator. Operator : We will take our next question from Jonathan Chaplin with New Street Research. Jonathan Chaplin : First one for Braxton Carter. You've taken the EBITDA guidance of twice, CapEx guidance hasn't changed and free cash flow guidance for 2019 is unchanged. What are you anticipating in 2019 in terms of, sort of a, is it a step-up in CapEx, working capital drag, or something else that would suggest free cash flow shouldn't be higher than where you've guided? John Legere : Yes. I just want to point out that you're going to be explaining why you have a meager 46% to 48% CAGR on three year free cash flow, which is something we should stop for a moment and just celebrate before. Braxton Carter : Jonathan, great question, but we did actually change our guidance relating to the cash CapEx and what we signaled earlier is that we're going to be at the very high end of the guidance range on cash CapEx. And that's really a function of the tremendous success and you have probably seen some of the press releases that Neville and his team have had clearing up broadcaster spectrum. And even with that change being at the high end, there is no changes in the free cash flow guidance. You kind of know the way that we handle our guidance, we don't mess, we've never missed in five years and we outperform what we say we're going to do. When we look forward to \u201919, what we've talked about publicly is we've got tremendous momentum, you know how we run our business, there will be a substantial step up in the EBITDA, we will provide guidance for \u201919 in connection with the year-end call. Cash CapEx, when you look at the trend over the last couple of years, they have been inching up a couple of hundred million a year, which is really a reflection of a success based investment model. And were highly confident that we're going to meet or over achieve the numbers that we get out here and that's what gets me really excited as CFO because we all know the path to value creation is ultimately the generation of significantly ramping cash flows and the thesis is very, very much in place for T-Mobile. Jonathan Chaplin : Can I follow-up with a quick one for John and maybe for Mike. We've seen a huge surge in industry net adds in what I would think of as a pretty saturated market, any thoughts as to what could be driving it. John Legere : A couple of things. One thing Jonathan is you're seeing some softening in the prepaid subsector and that's not necessarily all in one quarter, it's a trend over the past six months, it was strong in some cases this quarter, driven by prepaid other, other than phone devices, but there's been a transference of trend over the past years, so -- and that's partly due to the economy. So what's happening is more people are qualifying for postpaid than they were a year or two ago and when you can qualify for postpaid, a lot of people take it because they want these device financing deals that they're now qualifying for. So I think that's been a healthy trend for the industry and it's at least in part driven by the economy. Before we go to the next question, I would note that in the past ten minutes, Walt Piecyk has submitted approximately 25 questions. 18 or 20 of them are highly inappropriate, will not be discussed. But just to tell you a couple things, Walt, yes, we do know what the next carrier move is and we're not just crowdsourcing it over the next two weeks, however, if you have any ideas and we see them, it doesn't mean we can't do more than one.  There was also a question, I assume was tongue in cheek, which is, will you coordinate bids would Sprint in the 5G millimeter wave auction, which is, we're going for the right to be able to participate in the auction, but it's unsaid, it doesn't need to be said that it would be inappropriate and not something we would be able to ever think of doing to coordinate bid. So I'm sure you were just poking fun there, but hope those are two of your 25 questions, but feel free to keep typing them in. They\u2019re somewhat humorous, if not to me, the others that are watching. Operator next question? Operator : We will take our next question from Phil Cusick with JP Morgan. Phil Cusick : Maybe for Mike, can you talk about the performance in the new geographies you\u2019ve launched in the last few years, I know they've come in sort of cohorts, but where are we in terms of markets that are launched and with what distribution and where does that go in the next couple of years? Mike Sievert : Yeah. So a couple of things. One is, we've seen the overall retail footprint grow just in line with the predictions we gave you a couple of years ago. We had said when we were addressing about 230 million Americans, we'd see it hit about 260 million Americans addressed by our retail fleet and that's what we've accomplished. That in a little more. And back to John's point, a big piece of what I think you count on this management team to do is to look ahead a couple of years and see that potential headwinds and take actions to make sure that that they become positive tailwinds and our retail expansion and geographic expansion has been a great example of that. What we're seeing is what we predicted for you we would see, which is there's been particularly in Greenfield markets a pent up demand for T-Mobile. We've got markets where we have entered and gone immediately into share affording leadership, that's a great sign for us. So our retail fleet has been highly productive. As a result, we're going to concentrate any additional expansion into Greenfield areas, smaller towns, rural areas, we're also expanding our fleet of retail like trucks because that's a great way to address some smaller towns. So we've been emboldened by the results.  I'll tell you that on the flip side of it, in some of the urban areas, we've also found that we've got the right penetration now, that we don't need more retail penetration in urban markets and that's an important learning for us as well. But generally speaking, what we predicted for you when we launched this retail expansion and last year in \u201917 became America's fastest growing retailer is paying out just like we predicted for you that it would. Phil Cusick : Can you talk about penetration in those markets versus your sort of top 200 million POPs penetration? Mike Sievert : Not really. Some of these markets by the way are very small, but in some cases, where we\u2019re brand new never existed before in just two or three quarters, we're seeing mid-single digit penetrations. That's nice to see. But again, it's -- the results, your results may vary because all these markets are quite different. John Legere : So I think, you're onto a really important piece of the confidence that we have that there is tremendous future growth opportunity. With this geographical expansion across the US and even when we combine with Sprint, we just take that up on steroids and the other growth adjacency that Mike was talking about earlier that gives us extreme confidence from multiple years of high growth is what we're seeing in the business channel. We're still tremendously under indexed but have incredible momentum going in that channel. And Mike threw up some of those stats earlier, we're just really excited about these two areas. Phil Cusick : Maybe if I can follow-up, the increase in postpaid ad guidance was pretty nice to see, but it implies a pretty big slowdown in the back half, is there anything happening in either tablets or watches that we should look for a headwind or is this just typical conservatism. John Legere : You know how we do the guidance. I think Bill Ho actually asked the question earlier, this is the fourth or fifth year where you've increased your growth guidance every quarter. I think it\u2019s the fifth year. We take it up as we execute throughout the year and we see nothing that's really going to stop the trend. So, no change really in the way that we're providing guidance to the marketplace and we're really optimistic for the back half of the year. Mike Sievert : Maybe a little conservative, but one of the reasons we do this is because the back half of the year contains, in some sense, a higher degree of uncertainty every year and that's because some of the big phone launches happen during that time and it's hard to predict competitive moves. I will say the last couple of years, we've seen -- we haven't been really surprised by what we've seen from our competitors in those big phone launches. So, we will have to see how the year plays out, but we're feeling very confident. John Legere : But, I think it's important as we said in the commentary coming off a record Q2, our guidance change is intended to show that we feel very good about the rest of the year. John Legere : And finally, I think you asked about tablets. We never really played the tablet game to generate growth. We've consistently done 200,000, 300,000 give or take. We've never really pushed that button to juice it up and I think that strategy played out well when you look at what's really happened in the tablet space, being connected with all the other carriers who did actually play that game pretty heavily. Mike Sievert : Okay. Phil, you\u2019re on the verge of asking as many questions as Walt, so we're going to go to the next question, operator. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Craig Moffett with Moffett Nathanson. Craig Moffett : A question for Neville I guess. In the public interest statement, Sprint obviously revealed a lot of struggles, putting its 2.5 gigahertz spectrum to work. I\u2019m wondering what's different about what you can do other than just having more financial resources to put to work to densify that network, are there things that as you look back Sprint could have done differently that you think make the 2.5 spectrum seem so important to the combined entity strategy or if you can just talk about that a bit. Neville Ray : If you think back to T-Mobile\u2019s history and even more recently with the combination with MetroPCS, we\u2019ve built the most dense network in the United States hands down. I think others have talked about densifying away from their initial low band footprints. AT&T and Verizon continue that struggle and battle. Sprint has done less densification some, but when you look at network status today, and you look at who has the most dense network in the US, macro, small cell, it's T-Mobile. And so what we can do with this transaction is take that to the next level. And we would obviously combine key sites and add to the T-Mobile network with Sprint sites in key areas for coverage and primarily capacity, but put down a network that will be incredibly difficult for others to match and it's going to be very, very well suited to 2.5 gigahertz.  So this is round peg square hole story. I mean even today our network is more suited for 2.5 gig deployment than anybody else's because of its metro density. And so when you think about a combined T-Mobile and Sprint, the incremental density, capability and you put a 2.5 layer on that, it's going to perform incredibly well along the lines of John and Mike\u2019s statements about what we can offer the capacity that we can generate, it's pretty mind blowing and very exciting when you think about the capability, when you finally put the right spectrum assets together with the right network architecture that T-Mobile has. Craig Moffett : Sorry, just to follow-on for a second, can you just talk about the indoor propagation issues, is that densification that you\u2019re talking about sufficient to solve the indoor propagation problems that Sprint has had with the Spectrum. Mike Sievert : Yes. It certainly helps. And even today, I mean, if you deploy 2.5 on our dense networking key urban areas, then, you'd see pretty strong performance, but it's important again. We\u2019ve mentioned earlier on the call, you need low band and you need low band to get deep into those building costs, you need a good strong mid band layer and mid band in 5G includes 2.5 gigahertz, the spectrum band that Sprint has the most of. And so yes, I mean, the whole plan here and if you think about the statements Mike made about broadband and what we can do, the intent here is to lay down a layer of flawless capability for not just macro one on street, but also to penetrate the home and the 2.5 gigahertz spectrum with the right network architecture and layout can absolutely help us achieve that. John Legere : I just want to say that the teams over -- under on the timing of your answer was 12 to 15 minutes and you exceeded that. With respects to continuing to lower churn numbers, does T-Mobile have new initiatives that could add on to this or is the plan to continue customer -- current customer loyalty techniques? We haven't talked much about churn. Kyle, thanks for the question. I\u2019ll tell you what. Our teams should just feel so proud today that we've bust through this 1.0 barrier for the first time ever and delivered 0.95% churn and it really shows the two things are working incredibly well for this business. Number one, Americans are finally realizing that our network has caught up and beaten Verizon's and AT&T\u2019s.  There may be some coverage differences around the margins in a couple of square miles in the rural areas, but where we all live and work, our network is the best bar none and Americans are finally figuring that out mostly through word of mouth, which gets to the second piece, which is that our brand is firing on all cylinders. We're experiencing the highest net promoter scores right now in the history of this industry and that means that people are telling other people about T-Mobile and those two things are working together bring more customers to us and drive our churn down. And to your question Kyle, yeah, that's something we think is sustainable and it will only be taken to the next level when we come together and create the new T-Mobile but that that element of an ever improving network and an ever improving brand is core to who we are. Operator : The next questions comes from Amy Yong with Macquarie. Amy Yong : I guess just following up on your comment on broadband, maybe if you could elaborate a little bit more on your fixed wireless strategy, timing, market size, Verizon is obviously talking about a 30 million market opportunity, but being very selective on which cities they're going after, can you talk about how yours might compare with Verizons? And then I know you addressed cable competition in your comment, but maybe some early thoughts on charter and Comcast\u2019s price point and strategy thus far. Mike Sievert : Yeah. A couple of things. Amy, I mean I think, our competition is talking about it as a way of justifying, getting going with millimeter wave, because they're kind of quickly realizing that millimeter wave, as John was saying, as a standalone 5G mobility strategy really isn't a strategy and so they're pivoting now their story to fixed wireless in the homes. So that's what they're doing, what we're doing is building a broad and deep 5G network that's a combination of spectrum, low, mid and high and that allows us to address big sections of the country with the new T-Mobile and bring broadband. And as John said, we will be in a place in just three years into this where 62% of the country, two-thirds of the country have one 100 megabits per second service or better and that's going to allow us to support about 10 million customers that use home broadband type capacities like a half a terabyte a month types of capacities and so we're going after this market, we're not going to get into right now what markets are where, but we're going to bring a level of competition to this market that's very serious and that the industry has not seen and it's a market that needs competition very badly. Braxton Carter : I just add in real quick. I mean, the Verizon number on 30 million is always fascinating to me, 30 million homes passed on a millimeter wave product. That\u2019s one mighty task, but go at it guys. John Legere : Okay. I think we have time for one more question, which I hesitate to go to the phone on because I\u2019m looking ahead, but operator let's take the next question. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Walt Piecyk with BTIG. Walt Piecyk : John, I actually wasn't joking about those coordination. I think actually if you disclose it to the FCC ahead of time, you're allowed to do it, but presumably that's not the plan for any of these upcoming auctions right. John Legere : That\u2019s not planned. Walt Piecyk : Got it. Can you give us a sense, I mean, upgrade rates are or were down for you guys and for all your peers, can you give us a sense of when you look at the age product in your base, what you think is going to happen as we exit 2018 and whether this might be a year that promotions invert back up by you or some of your competitors. John Legere : A couple of things. One is, it's not just about promotions, it's also about what you get in the new devices and one thing you've heard from us Walt over and over is talk about the importance of the 600 megahertz layer in our network, well, because of that, we're going to see it really important that customers adopt 600 megahertz compatible phones. And so, you may see us getting behind phones in a big way that have that technology because we're obsessed with customer experience and we know with how fast Neville\u2019s going, rolling out this network, 950 cities so far in 33 states already being touched by 600 megahertz, we need to get handsets in people's hands. And so you're going to see us pursuing a strategy that's pro upgrade, especially when it's an upgrade that will get you onto a 600 megahertz compatible phone. Walt Piecyk : Got it. And then Mike, you haven't grown postpaid phone net adds for a while, so this is the first time in six quarters. Is this the inflection point that we've been looking for in terms of the low band investments and the store investments that you've made resonating with these very low penetrated markets that you\u2019ve talked about in the past, whether it's sub-urb enterprise, whatever it is, which of these areas do you think are inflecting or is this just, hey, you had a good quarter, it might slow down in the second half of the year and we\u2019re still waiting for that kind of a big kick in where you take the Verizon subs and mass going forward. Mike Sievert : I mean as John said, this is -- what you're seeing is a demonstration that the investments we've been telling you about are starting to pay off. And if anybody had any question about whether this business was slowing down, this quarter is the latest stance. Our postpaid phone net adds are equal to if you took every other player in the market, including the number two player Comcast and added them all up and then double it. That's how many postpaid phone net adds we delivered in the quarter and it's a demonstration that the strategy is working, geographic expansion, business expansion, segment expansion, suburban fringe expansion, going after different groupings of customers that have always been under penetrated into our base and it's working, so we're really proud of the results and as you can tell, it's not just driven by us taking share with 2.0 porting ratios for AT&T and Verizon, but it's also driven by having the lowest postpaid phones sharing in the history of our company and we think that's sustainable. That's driven by our network and it's driven by the brand and those things are both very, very strong and getting stronger. Walt Piecyk : Last time you got over 2.0 was when Verizon launched unlimited, so I guess we\u2019ll see what the competitive response is if any. Mike Sievert : Right. I think the word of the day at school today must have been inflection point, but I don't think that we've been very consistent over many, many quarters. We feel very strong it. All right. Well, you\u2019re always welcome on this call. John Legere : So hey, we want to thank everybody for taking their time on this 1 day of August. We\u2019re really excited about what's coming up in the second half of the year and we'll talk to you next quarter. Thank you. Operator? Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the T-Mobile US Second quarter 2018 earnings call. If you have any further questions, you may contact the Investor Relations or media department. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect and have a pleasant day.",

LLC Operator : Good afternoon. Welcome to the T-Mobile US Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. Following opening remarks, the earnings call will be open for questions via the conference line, Twitter, Facebook, or text message. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Nils Paellmann, Head of Investor Relations for T-Mobile US. Please go ahead, sir. Nils Paellmann - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Yes. Thank you very much. Welcome to T-Mobile's third quarter 2018 earnings call. With me today are John Legere, our CEO; Mike Sievert, our President and COO; Braxton Carter, our CFO; and other members of the senior leadership team. Let me read the disclaimer. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements that include projections and statements about our future financial operating results, our plans, the benefits we expect to receive from the proposed merger with Sprint and other statements that are not historical facts. Such statements are based upon the current beliefs and expectations of our management and are subject to significant risk and uncertainties outside of our control that could cause our actual results to differ materially, including the risk factors set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Reconciliations between GAAP and the non-GAAP results we discuss on this call can be found in the Quarterly Results section of the Investor Relations page of our website. In addition, in connection with the proposed transaction on July 30, 2018, we filed a registration statement on Form S-4 with the SEC related to the merger. The registration statement became effective yesterday on October 29, 2018 and is available on the New T-Mobile website. It contains some important information about T-Mobile and Sprint, the merger and related matters. With that, let me turn it over to John Legere. John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Okay. Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to T-Mobile's third quarter 2018 earnings call and Twitter conference. I'm coming to you live from Bellevue, Washington. Q3 was another incredible quarter and I can hardly wait to discuss these results. Let me quickly touch on the highlights, then Braxton can jump into the details and then we'll get to your questions. The headline for T-Mobile in Q3 is that we delivered another record-breaking quarter. Yes, another one. We continue to drive our business beyond expectations despite the work underway to close the merger. In Q3, we posted our best financials ever and we led the industry in postpaid phone nets for the 19th quarter in a row. Our business is firing on all cylinders and it's a beautiful thing. Service revenues, total revenues and adjusted EBITDA are all hitting record highs. And by the way, we also posted record low Q3 branded postpaid phone churn. Our increased guidance shows our confidence for the remainder of the year. T-Mobile continues to meet the needs of wireless customers quarter after quarter and that is translating into incredible results. Q3 was a busy quarter to say the least. T-Mobile's network led the industry in 4G LTE speeds, extending our winning streak to 19 quarters in a row. Now think about that. Nearly five straight years of Un-carrier wireless customers having the fastest network in the U.S. Only Neville Ray could have dreamed a few years ago that that was even possible. We also launched our most recent Un-carrier move Team of Experts nationwide in Q3, had an iPhone launch and got even more recognition from J.D. Powers. So we packed a lot into the quarter and clearly, made the most of it. So let's dive into our record-breaking third quarter. First, I've got to highlight our very strong financial results. Service revenues hit record highs reaching $8.1 billion, growing by 6% year-over-year. Total revenues increased by 8% year-over-year to $10.8 billion, also a record high. Net income was strong at $0.8 billion, up 45% year-over-year, and fully diluted earnings per share came in at $0.93, up $0.30 or 48% year-over-year. We hit another record high with adjusted EBITDA of $3.2 billion, up 15% year-over-year with a 40% adjusted EBITDA margin. Customer results were very strong as well. We once again added 1.6 million total net customers, extending our winning streak to 22 quarters in a row with more than one million. And we added 774000 branded postpaid phone customers. Now, based on consensus for Sprint and actual results from all the others, we expect to capture more than 60% of the industry's postpaid phone growth, grow nearly 75% faster than Verizon, AT&T, Sprint, Comcast and Charter combined and more than 2.6 times faster than our next closest competitor, Verizon. And our growth in postpaid phone nets accelerated again, benefiting from the investments we have made in our network and marketing, and the continued focus on underpenetrated segments, such as new geographies, 55+, Military and T-Mobile for Business, all of which contributed to our great quarter. We also had strong total branded postpaid net additions of 1.1 million, supported by continued strong growth of wearables. This means, we've added 3.1 million postpaid customers year-to-date, allowing us to raise our customer guidance once again. These wireless customers are coming and staying longer than ever before. In Q3, we had our lowest ever branded postpaid phone churn for a third quarter, which was 1.02%. That's down 21 basis points year-over-year. This was an even bigger year-over-year reduction than in Q2. Branded prepaid net customer additions came in at 35,000. As you may know, MetroPCS just became Metro by T-Mobile on October 8, launching attractive new unlimited plans that include premium features such as Amazon Prime and Google One. We expect that these changes will help us appeal to new customer segments and double down on our efforts to aggressively go after postpaid and prepaid customers from our competitors. Now turning to network, we continue to expand coverage and deliver industry-leading network performance. We now cover 324 million POPs with 4G LTE, well on our way to 325 million by year-end. And we continue to aggressively roll out low-band spectrum with our 700 megahertz deployment virtually complete and our 600 megahertz deployment continuing at a furious pace. We now have low-band spectrum deployed to 291 million POPs and 600 megahertz is live in more than 1,500 cities and towns in 37 states across the Continental U.S. and Puerto Rico in states like Arizona, California, Iowa, Kansas and New York, just to name a few. We currently have 21 devices with Band 71 compatible with LTE on 600 megahertz, including the latest generation iPhones. And the 600 megahertz network hardware we're deploying is upgradeable to 5G with a software update. Our standalone plan calls for 5G equipment to be deployed in six of the top 10 markets, including New York and Los Angeles, and hundreds of cities across the U.S. in 2018. This network will be ready for the introduction of the first 5G smartphones in 2019. We plan on the delivery of a nationwide 5G network in 2020 and we're building 5G with global standards-based equipment, the true 5G. And through our pending merger with Sprint, we will be able to deliver a 5G performance capability well beyond what either company can deliver on a standalone basis. And as I mentioned earlier, we continue to lead the industry in 4G LTE speeds. In Q3, our average download 4G LTE speed was 31.7 megabits per second, well ahead of all of our competitors. Like I mentioned, Q3 marks nearly five years that T-Mobile has had the fastest 4G LTE network. Our frontline is setting the standard for customer experience. It's been two months since we said no bouncing, no bots, and no BS in customer care when we launched Team of Experts nationwide. Since then, our Net Promoter Score, which measures likelihood to recommend a brand, hit all-time highs. These scores are the highest in the history of the wireless industry, and we're seeing employee satisfaction score soar to record highs as well. We transformed the traditional call center job into a career and employee turnover and care has been nearly cut in half with Team of Experts. And last week, we made good on our promise to help others up their customer service game by adopting Team of Experts with a two-day TEX Talks event at our Charleston customer experience center with 67 companies, including several Fortune 100 brands in attendance. Our friends at AT&T, Comcast and Verizon were no-shows at this event. We tried calling them, but we couldn't get through to a real person. It's pretty clear that Team of Experts is a game changer and a major competitive advantage for T-Mobile. Our strong momentum in Q3 and record Q3 means that we're increasing our guidance for 2018 once again. Our outlook now calls for 3.8 million to 4.1 million branded postpaid net customer additions and adjusted EBITDA of $12.0 billion to $12.5 billion. Our three-year CAGR estimate of free cash flow remains at 46% to 48% with cash CapEx still expected to be at the high end of the guidance range of $4.9 billion to $5.3 billion. Now, we're using today's call to focus on our Q3 results, but before I hand it over to Braxton, let me give you a quick update on the progress of our pending merger with Sprint. This combination will enable us to build America's best nationwide 5G network that is both broad and deep and that will ensure that America retains its global leadership in wireless and that American-based companies and entrepreneurs are at the forefront of the explosion of innovation and economic growth that 5G is going to spawn. The New T-Mobile will supercharge competition in wireless, broadband and beyond, which will result in lower prices for consumers and create jobs starting on day one. Now, we have a lot of respect for the regulatory process, which is not yet finished. We have completed a number of major milestones and remain optimistic and confident that once the facts are reviewed by regulators, they will recognize the significant pro-competitive and pro-consumer benefits of this combination. A few milestones to update you on since our last earnings call. On September 17, we filed our response to the petitions to deny with the FCC. On October 1, Sunit Patel started his new position as Executive Vice President of Merger and Integration. I've known Sunit for a very long time and I'm very excited that he decided to join our team. On July 30, 2018, we filed a registration statement on Form S-4 with the SEC related to the merger. The registration statement became effective yesterday, October 29. Tomorrow, October 31, the formal comment period comes to a close at the FCC. And we continue to work through the process with the Department of Justice. At the state level, we have ongoing conversations with state regulators and already received approvals for more than half of the state Public Utility Commissions that are reviewing the merger. As you can see, we're making progress. We continue to expect this merger to close in the first half of 2019. In the meantime, we look forward to continuing to work with the regulators to share our story about how this merger will be good for consumers and good for the country. Okay, Braxton. Braxton will take us through a look at the financial results and the details of our guidance. So Braxton, let's take a closer look. J. Braxton Carter - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Absolutely, John, and happy Halloween to everybody, and we're so excited to announce another monster quarter here at T-Mobile. Net income amounted to $795 million, up 45% year-over-year. This was due to higher operating income, lower interest expense and lower tax expense. Net income included a benefit of $101 million from the new revenue recognition standard and also benefited from $88 million in after-tax reimbursements for the hurricane impacts net of costs incurred. On the other hand, net income was impacted by $53 million in after-tax costs associated with the pending Sprint merger. Our effective tax rate ticked up to 29.6% this quarter compared to 26.8% in Q2. Taxes this quarter were impacted by a one-time state income tax charge and non-deductible merger costs and we now anticipate an effective tax rate of 26% to 27% in 2018. Adjusted EBITDA amounted to $3.2 billion, up 15%, and including lease revenues of $176 million versus $159 million in the prior year. Note that adjusted EBITDA included a positive impact from last year's hurricanes, net of costs of $138 million due to insurance reimbursements and $136 million from the new revenue recognition standard. The adjusted EBITDA performance is a reflection of strong cost management. Cost of services as a percent of service revenue increased by just 40 basis points year-over-year despite the rapid rollout of 600 megahertz spectrum, excluding the impact from hurricanes. Again, this reflects a culture of strong cost control and optimization. The new revenue recognition standard added $24 million to the cost of services in Q3. SG&A as a percentage of service revenue decreased by 20 basis points year-over-year despite the acceleration in growth. This is adjusted for the $53 million of costs associated with the Sprint merger, which are also excluded from adjusted EBITDA. Equipment losses decreased by $28 million or 5.6% year-over-year in connection with a still light postpaid upgrade rate of 6% and a year-over-year decrease in the number of devices sold. Free cash flow was roughly stable year-over-year at $0.9 billion. This was driven by a 27% decrease in net cash provided by operating activities and a 21% increase in gross proceeds related to our deferred purchase price from securitization transactions. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was entirely due to higher net cash outflows from working capital, which increased by $0.7 billion year-over-year. Outflows from working capital were primarily impacted by an incremental paydown of accounts payable of a $253 million year-over-year to capture early pay discounts and $228 million year-over-year buildup in inventories in connection with the launch of the new iPhone generation. Please note that net cash outflow from securitization amounted to $18 million in Q3 and an outflow of $143 million in the first nine months of 2018. Therefore, free cash flow did not benefit from any net proceeds from securitization. Cash CapEx was relatively steady year-over-year at $1.4 billion. Importantly, free cash flow for the first nine months amounted to $2.3 billion, up 47% year-over-year. Branded postpaid phone ARPU amounted to $46.17, down 0.8% sequentially and 1.6% year-over-year. The sequential decrease was primarily due to the continued adoption of tax-inclusive plans, including the growing success of new customer segments such as Business, 55+ and Military. In addition, the year-over-year reduction was also due to a reduction in certain non-recurring charges including the non-cash net benefit from Data Stash. Importantly, for the year as a whole, we still expect ARPU to be generally stable excluding the impact from the new revenue recognition standard. In terms of customer quality, our results in the third quarter were strong. Total bad debt expense and losses from sales of receivables were $128 million or 1.18% of total revenue compared to $190 million or 1.89% in the third quarter of 2017, even with a significantly higher customer base. While bad debt expense increased quarter-over-quarter, as expected, as a result of typical seasonality, the results still reflect a significant year-over-year improvement. Now, let me come to our 2018 guidance. We expect branded postpaid net customer additions to be between 3.8 million and 4.1 million, an increase and narrowing from the prior guidance range of 3 million to 3.6 million. The guidance takes into account our long-term strategy to balance growth and profitability and the lower switcher volume we've seen in recent quarters as well as our pursuit of growth adjacencies. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $11.8 billion to $12 billion, not including the impact of the new revenue recognition standard, an increase in narrowing from our prior guidance range of $11.5 billion to $11.9 billion. The new revenue recognition standard will increase adjusted EBITDA by another $0.2 billion to $0.5 billion for an all-in new guidance range of $12 billion to $12.5 billion. This guidance takes into account leasing revenues of $600 million to $700 million in 2018. We now expect leasing revenues to be at the high end of this range. Note that we have now increased the ranges for branded postpaid net additions and for adjusted EBITDA three times this year. We target cash CapEx of $4.9 billion to $5.3 billion excluding capitalized interest. We continue to expect to come in at the high end of the guidance range. Finally, we expect free cash flow to increase at a three-year CAGR of 46% to 48% from full year 2016 to full year 2019 unchanged from the prior range. During the same period, we expect the underlying net cash provided by operating activities to increase at an unchanged CAGR of 7% to 12%. Let me emphasize that free cash flow guidance does not assume any material net cash inflows from securitization going forward. Now, let's get to your questions. As during last quarter earnings call, I would ask you to focus your questions on our operational results. Also, we cannot answer any questions related to the current millimeter wave auctions, due to the quiet period around these auctions. You can ask questions via phone, via message, or via Twitter or Facebook. We will start with the question on the phone. Operator, first question, please? Operator : Thank you We'll take our first question from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks very much. Good evening. On 5G, you talked a lot about the roll-out. And I don't know, if Neville's maybe can talk through some of the spectrum beyond 600 megahertz. You've been very active in the CBRS and C-band process. So perhaps you could talk about your interest in those and then any updates on Layer3 rollout? Thanks. John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Neville, why don't you give an overview from a network standpoint on 5G? Opening this Pandora's box to Neville by the time his answer's done, 5G handsets may be available. Neville R. Ray - T-Mobile US, Inc.: I'll try to be a little angel. How is that? No. Thanks, John, and thanks for the question, Simon. I mean, obviously, we are incredibly focused on the combination with Sprint and the 5G opportunity that we can deliver through that combination is unique. It's incredibly compelling. It's going to bring a level of 5G capability and service to the U.S. market that nobody can do on their own. None of the four players, including ourselves, can deliver anything like what we can deliver with Sprint. And our deal is all down to spectrum from a network perspective and the combination of our mid, low and high-band assets delivering capabilities in terms of breadth of 5G coverage, and also depth of 5G coverage, which will create compelling user experiences, wireless, fixed wireless alternatives and on and on. If you haven't read our PIS and our various filings, go have a look. There's a ton of data in there and it's an incredibly compelling opportunity. That said, we are laying down outside of the deal discussion itself. I mean, we're obviously laying down the foundational layer for much of that now as T-Mobile. We're very busy on 600 megahertz deployment, as John referenced during the call. 1,500 cities now live with LTE in 600 megahertz across 37, 38 states, including Puerto Rico inside a year. So we're very proud of what we're doing there. And we're building a 5G-capable network. Already six of the top 10 markets and hundreds of cities underway with that 5G build. So a lot of activity fully underway for us to put that 5G capability into the hands of our customers in 2019, handsets coming online in that timeframe, so super excited. Obviously, as Braxton referenced, we are participating. We intend to participate in the upcoming millimeter wave auctions. So there is more spectrum coming for the 5G era, which is great. We're always going to need more spectrum. And so I look at millimeter wave as the first opportunity that the FCC has lined up. I think the CBRS spectrum that you referenced, real opportunities for commercial deployment there, Simon, as we move into probably mid-2019 timeframe. As the SaaS system gets matured and certified so that we can start to deploy in the unlicensed space ahead of any licensed spectrum auctions on the CBRS. And then, a lot of activity on C-band, a lot of discussion, filings yesterday. I mean, obviously, we'd like to see a lot more spectrum come through than is currently being proposed by the incumbent holders on that spectrum. We think it's critical that more mid-band spectrum is brought to the U.S. so that we've got a good strong roadmap for future 5G services. I'll stop there, so I don't consume the whole call. John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: I want to throw the ball the Mike to talk about Layer3, but as we do, Simon, your question about 5G is so important and it's so on the mind of everybody in the country and around the world about what 5G is. And not only our timeline being looked at, but I'm going to introduce what I call a continuum of reality, the continuum of what people are announcing for 5G and where it fits between fantasy and ultimate reality. And you won't be surprised that on one end of the spectrum is real true 5G standards-based nationwide deployment that would be T-Mobile. On the other side in the total lack of reality would be Verizon. And that is a non-standards-based fixed broadband replacement using millimeter wave in some buildings in some parts of four cities so that the startling impact could be that people will be able to surf Netflix in their home as they were able to before. I would call that a laboratory marketing-based fiction approach, and AT&T is somewhere in between. This is very, very important, because what we're doing with the merger with Sprint to really bring what the country will have as the first real deep and broad 5G capability. It's very important for our country and it's very important because it will continue to put pressure on AT&T and Verizon to invest. And the overall winner will be the United States looking at those three million jobs that will be brought by the evolution of 5G and the $0.5 trillion of economic impact. So appreciate your question on 5G. The work that Neville is doing is important, but the merger with Sprint is also very, very important on this front. Mike, do you want to talk about Layer3? G. Michael Sievert - T-Mobile US, Inc.: That's a great segue into the TV topic, Simon, because what we are busily building, we have our heads down creating the first TV service for the 5G era. And that means a couple of things. That means, first of all, preparing for the day when we take on broadband in people's homes and not in sporadic parts of some cities, as John was just saying, with millimeter wave where you have to be 500 feet from a tower, but nationwide. We intend to bring broadband competition to 52% of U.S. ZIP Codes with the New T-Mobile. And obviously, for us to be able to be there, serving people's home with 5G broadband, we need to have an incredible 5G TV service to be able to provide an integrated suite. And that's what we have our heads down building, a TV service that is free from having to have wires, that has hundreds of high-definition choices coming in wirelessly, that's free from a particular cable box, that puts you in control, that's met your smartphone, that's connected to your social, digital and mobile life in a way that TV has never been before as an island. So that's what we are busy building. And yes, the journey will start later this year. And we're very excited about that. And the second phase of the journey next year will be expanding into mobile because as John was saying, 5G is about mobility not just fixed. And we are the only company with a strategy to bring 5G nationwide to every customer instead of just some parts of some cities like our competitors. And that's why the TV service will also follow with a mobile TV service next year. So we're heads down hard at work. We are very excited about the strategy and it plays very tightly to the 5G strategy of the New T-Mobile. John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Okay. Now that we've answered Simon's question... Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you. John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: ... we're out of time. I'm just kidding. Operator, next question? Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan: Hi, guys. Thanks. Braxton, I want to make sure I understand the cost numbers. It looks like insurance payments of $81 million in 3Q and another $63 million recognized in 3Q, what lines did that impact and are there any more to come this year? And then, Neville, not to press \u2013 but \u2013 I'm sorry, go ahead. J. Braxton Carter - T-Mobile US, Inc.: No, go ahead, Phil. John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Finish pressing. Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan: I was going to say Neville \u2013 not to press, I'll finish pressing. But given the more than 300 megahertz of low and mid-band spectrum you'll have with Sprint, do you still see yourself as a substantial buyer of C-band were it to come available? Or is this more a theoretical exercise in your filings? J. Braxton Carter - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Yeah. So, first of all, Phil, we have closed out all of last year's hurricane claims. Very, very successful in doing so. Remember, we took the full hit to our EBITDA last year. All the recoveries this year flowed through to the bottom line and are part of our 3 time increase in EBITDA guidance that we've done this year. So we've returned all that back to the bottom line performance of the company. If you want a complete reconciliation of all components of where the hurricane had an impact, I refer you to our FactBook as well as our Q where we do a detailed line-by-line analysis of that so that you can track with full transparency what impact it has. As you know, we're committed to full transparency and best-of-class reporting of any of our peers out in the marketplace. John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: As we throw the ball to Neville, I would like to point out that Phil is attempting for the first time in history to get Neville to say there's some spectrum he doesn't desperately want to buy. Neville? Neville R. Ray - T-Mobile US, Inc.: You've got to say, I've never seen a megahertz, I don't like, John. I always say, say it every call. No, I mean, Phil, I think you have to look at the scale and size of the 5G opportunity as we build and roll out these networks. And so, obviously, as I said at the beginning, we're very focused on combining our combination with Sprint and the opportunity that it creates, but it gets us moving. And if you look at what's happening in other parts of the world right now, where governments are bringing forward hundreds of megahertz of free and clear mid-band spectrum so that the wireless operators can move aggressively into this 5G opportunity. We need those opportunities here in the U.S. And with our deal, without the deal, C-band is going to be important. And right now, the volume of spectrum there, it's clearly an underutilized asset today. And so there's a real opportunity to bring a meaningful volume of spectrum to the marketplace. And we filed yesterday on it. We think that the approach we've outlined would be in the best interest of wireless consumers as well as the average taxpayer and U.S. citizen. So have a read through our filings, but the answer is, yes. We're interested in that spectrum. Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan: Thanks very much, Neville. John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Operator, we'll go to the next question. And while we do why don't you guys take a look at some of the online questions? And maybe after this question, we'll take some of the ones that are coming in. Operator? Operator : Absolutely. We'll hear now from Michael Rollins with Citi. Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Investment Research : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you can talk a bit more about ARPU and churn performance. So on the ARPU side, maybe talk a little bit about what's happening on the pricing front and how that relates to the guidance, I believe, of roughly flattish for the year? And then on the churn side, as the churn has come down and you're looking at the aging of your customers, is there room for that churn to further improve? Or are you hitting an area where you think that it could potentially stay around these levels for some time? Thanks. John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Okay. Braxton, you want to start on ARPU and then, Mike, you talk about the churn? (00:33:39) J. Braxton Carter - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Yeah, sure. So, yeah, Mike, the ARPU equation always has a little bit of seasonality to it. But when you look at the macro, and there are puts and takes going both ways, our guidance is generally stable. And we have defined that for the capital markets as plus or minus 1%. And we have definitely performed within that guidance level for multiple years at the same time that you've seen massive drops in ARPUs from the other carriers. When you look at Q3, in particular, in the reiteration of that guidance, what that will tell you when you do the math on it, that ARPU is going up in Q4. To stay within that reiterated guidance range, that definitely will be the case. But let's talk a little bit about the theory here. We often get asked by investors, why don't you go out and try to monetize more from your customers and drive ARPU up? And you're certainly seeing that happen with some of the carriers out there. And our response is, we're the Un-carrier and the terminal benefit from increased scale of our model, which is a great story for years to come, far outweighs any monetization that we could do in the marketplace. And you look around the genius of the marketing that's being deployed here in a very highly saturated market, going after particular segments. And the interesting thing about going after particular segments is looking at the underlying full economic characteristics. How often do they upgrade? What is their churn characteristics? What is the bad debt profile? And all of our segments are actually creating more overall enterprise value, customer lifetime value, net present value in the way that we're approaching the marketplace. So, we're happy to execute in a generally stable environment with some potential dilution as long as we're driving more value to the enterprise. And you can see that translating into the very significant cash flow growth and just look at net income for the quarter. I think it's very wise economics. So, great question. I'll hand it over to Mike for churn. G. Michael Sievert - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Yeah, Michael. On churn, this was the best Q3 performance we've ever seen. And as John was saying in his remarks, the year-over-year 21 basis point improvement was even better than last quarter where we experienced our all-time lowest churn. So we've got great momentum here. And to your question, we don't see any reason why there isn't room to run here. In fact, with the New T-Mobile, as an example, we don't see why there would ever be air in the long run between our churn rate and AT&T's or Verizon's. We expect to build a network that's demonstrably superior. And at the end of the day, churn's a function of the network, first and foremost. It's a function of the customer experience and we are differentiated there with Team of Experts in a very significant way. It's a function of the brand and what it feels like to be a part of the company that puts customer first and treats them right. And you can see that as a leading indicator in our Net Promoter Scores. Our Net Promoter Scores are the highest that this industry has ever seen. Right now, we are simultaneously experiencing our highest levels of customer satisfaction and our lowest cost to care for our customers in our history, because of the innovation of Team of Experts. So we see room to run here. John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Listen this \u2013 I could say it 10 times, wireless customers, wireless customers, wireless customers. It's kind of what this company is about. And from the standpoint of the things that drive them as we focus on them, the network capability is getting better every day and we are not slowing down, as Neville has continued to discuss. Team of Experts, as amazing as the results are, is in its infancy and we're learning more and more. And if you look at the employee base of T-Mobile that is absolutely obsessed with our customers. I would say, these results for churn are amazing. We're extremely proud of them, but we're just getting started and that'll be fun to report in the future. Okay. I want to go \u2013 we have taken questions from this young amazing journalist before, his name is Kyle Romanoff. (00:38:36). Amazing that whether it's Slow Cooker Sunday or whether it's the earnings call, somehow he gets through the clutter. So I don't know, if there is a earnings call version of a Hackathon, but we've got to figure out how this guy gets through. And Kyle (00:38:52) has about 15 questions in here. So I'm going to pick one. Any updates on T-Mobile for Business? And any major changes coming on that front from a broad perspective in the coming year? Mike? G. Michael Sievert - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Yeah. Our business team led by Mike Katz and his leadership team is firing on all cylinders. This quarter was, in fact, an all-time record on gross activations and net activations for our business group. And what's interesting is the complexion of customers that are coming to us is also changing and improving, more and more we're winning big enterprises and large public sector customers that we just weren't able to compete for a couple of years ago. And that's driving most of the growth right now. And those are great customers that have a very considered sale, but once they pick you, stick with you. We're also seeing that these wins are not just 10% of the base where they're using us as a price cut, (00:39:48) but where they're picking us as their standard bearer for their company or their government entity. And that's huge. We're seeing the world's biggest retailers, the biggest electronics and cell phone manufacturers. We're seeing online leaders, global consulting firms, hotel companies and casinos. We're seeing the federal government, including some of the biggest agencies, one particularly notable win, a huge win in the public center this quarter, state government. So lots of bigger enterprises choosing us because of the value proposition that we keep talking about in response to the rest of the questions. The network has finally earned our way into those discussions. The wireless network is second to none now. Public sector and government customers don't go on reputation. They try it first. They usually take 100 phones and try them for weeks. And then, more than any time in our history, they're picking T-Mobile. John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Yeah. Mike, I would just like to add. A lot of questions have come in and our statements about the quarter have made it very clear that our growth is being driven by, amongst other things, geographic expansion and serving segments like 55+, Military and Business, et cetera, that have heretofore been underserved. We have a great leader Mike Katz, who's running TFB, as they call it, T-Mobile for Business. I would say the energy of that organization has surged possibly the most inside our company, in addition to business customers having now a network experience that's different and a care experience that's different. T-Mobile for Business is adding a significant part to our growth and the fascinating part is we are a significant low share player to what has dominated by the duopoly and a very unsatisfied base. So not just now but as we move through the merger with Sprint, this is a gigantic bringing of competition to an area that is desperately needed. And our success in this space has so much more to follow. So we're very, very proud of that team. G. Michael Sievert - T-Mobile US, Inc.: We remain less than 5% of enterprise share and less than 10% overall of business share in this country. So that's room to run. John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: And I think the fun part is, as Mike said, 5% share, but almost the rest of it is held by the bad guys who the customers absolutely are waiting every day to leave, which is beautiful. So the two together suggest, Kyle, (00:42:19) you had a \u2013 I was waiting for Kyle (00:42:21) to be asking follow-up questions, but I realized he's not on. So we're done (00:42:25). All right, operator, let's take the next question on the phone. Operator : Absolutely. We'll hear now from John Hodulik with UBS. John C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thanks, guys. John, maybe you could comment on the competitive environment and what you expect to see sort of heading into the holiday selling season, especially with the new iPhones out there? And then, secondly, if you could give us any porting data you might have and if you're seeing any impact from the entry of the cable companies into the market? Thanks. John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Yeah. Those are all great questions. And certainly, it's been a \u2013 wireless, in general, is a very competitive market. And we hear \u2013 quarter in and quarter out, we hear it's highly competitive, it's not competitive. And we consistently drive right through that. I would say its steady competitive environment. The cable players are clearly coming into this space. I'll comment on that in a second. From a standpoint of what's happening between us and the major players, obviously, as you see from the postpaid phone nets that we're growing significantly faster than everybody. Postpaid porting on Q3 was about 1.73, very strong. Think about these numbers. That's an overall average 1.73 to 1. And that's about as high as we've seen since about Q1 of 2017 outside of last quarter. So these last two quarters, these are very high numbers. We would expect Q4 to be strong as well. Q4 is a fascinating quarter. October's kind of a quieter period. But if you look us, say, starting last weekend and going through where we are now, yeah, the postpaid porting was about 1.7%, so it's kind of in that range, strong, feel very good about it, feel good about it for the quarter. And I would say the cable guys are definitely here. Couple of things. Comcast has had a pretty steady flow of a couple hundred thousand nets. My assessment is those are coming almost exclusively from Verizon. So, you dust the 5G focus on fixed broadband, et cetera, but we are not feeling that major pressure from them. It's too early to tell for Charter. And I would say the one thing that should be noted, these are very deep pockets. We're used to seeing these in the duopolists. And now, you've got really big companies that seem to be willing to spend tremendous amounts of money on \u2013 I mean, I think Comcast's dropped about $178 million to get 222,000 customers. That's not really scalable and they should've just handed that money to Verizon to push those customers over to them. But it makes for a very competitive environment. We feel very comfortable in what we're doing and the response and what brings customers to T-Mobile, but there are clearly two additional players in the wireless space now in Comcast and Charters, and I'm sure others to follow. John C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thanks, John. John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Okay. Operator? Operator : Absolutely. We'll now take our next question from Jonathan Chaplin with New Street Research. Jonathan Chaplin - New Street Research LLP (US): Thanks. A quick one for Braxton. Braxton, if you haven't been building out new geographies and building capabilities to go up-market for new business segments, what would margins have looked like? I'm really just trying to get a sense for what the underlying operating leverage in the business would be with the kind of growth you're generating at the moment? J. Braxton Carter - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Yeah. So, Jonathan, great question. First of all, it's not just building out new geographies. What Neville is doing is laying the foundation for 5G in our network in connection with the deployment of 600 megahertz, an extremely innovative and cost-effective way to ready our network for nationwide 5G. We are the only announced carrier who is doing that. And quite frankly, that's where a lot of the expenses is being associated. If you want more of a normalized run rate without that activity, I would go back about a year where you're seeing incredible scale over a multiple year period on what was happening from a cost of service standpoint before we got into the significant expansion. And even then, we had projects, the 700 megahertz project. So what we're doing is we're investing in the future. We're wisely investing in the future. We're laying the foundation for 5G and we're doing it extremely cost effectively. Neville, do you want to add anything to that? Neville R. Ray - T-Mobile US, Inc.: I wouldn't. (00:48:04) Jonathan Chaplin - New Street Research LLP (US): So, Braxton, if I can follow up? With a lot of the groundwork for 5G and for 600 megahertz done by the end of this year, would you expect to see the same kind of margin expansion next year that you saw a year ago? J. Braxton Carter - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Well, probably not as much as we did a year ago. And the reason for that is, this will be truly a multiple-year project. Neville, do you want to give a little insight about how much you progress clearing and type of thing? I think that might be informative. Neville R. Ray - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, obviously, we do have a lot of the work underway and under our belt, but we still have a lot to get done. And so I'm ecstatic with the progress we've made on 600 megahertz. I think anybody in the industry including the folks at the FCC would tell you that this is the fastest they've ever seen an auction spectrum band get put into commercial service. And just this last week, we crossed 21 devices now with 600 megahertz capability, including the new range of iPhones and even the tablets that were announced today. So we're making tremendous progress on generating and creating a 600 megahertz ecosystem as T-Mobile, which is phenomenal progress. The fact that as we deploy radio now, we can build 5G-ready equipment waiting for software that will come online early in the New Year is another huge bonus as Braxton referenced. But we do have to continue to clear the 600 megahertz airwaves. We're making material progress on that, but there's an agreed-to schedule with the FCC and the broadcasters, which we fully respect. And that runs through 2020. So we have work to do that's scheduled 2019. We have to work to do that's scheduled in 2020. We continue to look at acceleration opportunities, but back to Braxton's point, this is a three-year program. It's not all done and it's going to take some time to get completed. John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Okay. Operator, next question? Jonathan Chaplin - New Street Research LLP (US): Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll here now from Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson. Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC : Hi. I'm going to give Neville a chance to give us more time to wait for the 5G phones to hit the market here. Sprint published an ex parte that was, I think, sort of quite self-effacing, I suppose, about the 2.5 gigahertz spectrum. Can you just talk about what you've learned as you continue to dig into the 2.5 gigahertz spectrum, both the EBS and EBRS spectrum, just to get a sense of what you think you can do with it? And whether the characteristics and economics of putting it to use are different than you might have expected before you started the due diligence process? Neville R. Ray - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Yeah. Craig, I don't want to keep consuming the call time here. I mean, this is fairly deep technical stuff, right, but obviously, we're excited about that 2.5 gig opportunity. It's a good slug of mid-bound spectrum. It's predominantly used, obviously, for LTE today. And the combination of the two companies allows to free up a lot of that spectrum for 5G services quicker than Sprint could do on their own or any company could do on their own, come to that. I think the piece that's exciting, obviously, we've done a huge amount of network modeling and analysis and work on the opportunity of the combination. And what we see there is that the 2.5 gig spectrum, I mean, it's always required a density of network in comparison to traditional sub-2 gig spectrum, right, because of the propagation limitations. That said, the other aspect of this combination with Sprint is that we can densify what's already the most dense network in the U.S. from T-Mobile. And when you look at that density amplification or combination and you apply 2.5 gigahertz spectrum, BRS or EBS, on that dense grid, you end up in a pretty special place. So it's something that the combination of the two companies and the assets of the two companies can really make that 2.5 gig spectrum sing and perform in a way that no single company can do on their own today. I'll leave it there. Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC : Okay. And sorry, if I could just ask one follow-up clarification. When you said earlier that you get generally stable ARPU, is that as reported or on a 606 accounting adjusted basis? J. Braxton Carter - T-Mobile US, Inc.: No, that's as reported, plus or minus 1%, same tolerance as before. Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC : Okay. But on an as reported basis. Got it. Thank you. J. Braxton Carter - T-Mobile US, Inc.: You're welcome. John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: And a footnote on what Neville has said and these are things that have been part of our filings and story because, obviously, we're quite limited in how much we can do outside of planning with Sprint during this pre-approval period. But certainly, we've done tremendous amounts of modeling the business and the network. And one thing I can say that our filings have shown is that since we announced the deal on April 27 to now, the network and the modeling of the business has only gotten better. So from a standpoint of the things that we're learning and finding out, the story from a business and from a network standpoint gets better. I would also like to say, maybe I'll just do this quickly, a very proudly stated one of the items that we see as a status point that should be viewed for what it is. Not only that we have hired a person to lead the integration of the companies but the caliber and the capability and the depth of who we were able to get that many of you know in Sunit Patel. And I think maybe just take a second, I'll introduce Sunit and ask him if he wants to make a quick comment in his long tenure here in being in charge of putting together two companies that we can't really put together yet. Sunit Patel - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. So I joined about a month ago and I was quite impressed at the breadth and depth of the amount of work going on and integration planning with both companies. At this stage, we are really focused on our readiness for closing and how we operate in the marketplace soon after closing. Over the last month, we've been vectoring in on the specific requirements and deliverables, we need to do that. Between now and the end of the year, we expect to finalize that and start on the work and planning needed for us to be ready. In addition, we'll be spending time on how we should be organized as a combined company. The integration teams from both companies are working well together with strong alignment and support from the leadership at both companies. The effort is organized around both key work streams and functional areas. So overall, I plunged in a lot of work to do, happy with what I am seeing, quite a few decisions and challenges ahead. And we'll provide another update on our next earnings call. John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Okay, operator. I think we have time for one or two more. And I would say that no earnings call would be complete without the question from the next person. And certainly, I would like to commit up front that even as we embark on creating the New T-Mobile, we will set precedent of also continuing to take this next caller's questions. So, operator, next question, please? Operator : Absolutely. We'll take our next question from Walter Piecyk with BTIG. Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC : John, that's definitely a relief to hear. Thank you very much. I want to go back to the comment on the different business segments, because your gross adds have been up the last couple of quarters. It seems like it's from enterprise, maybe Military, the over-55 group. Where are you in terms of those penetration rates on the suburban side because that's where a lot of this low-band spectrum and some of the new stores were supposed to resonate? So can you give us any update there? And then maybe, Mike, your thoughts on how is it that AT&T and Verizon are seeing increasing gross adds? Is this just you think churn between them or is there just overall velocity that's happening in the market right now? G. Michael Sievert - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Yeah. Well, your second one first. Overall, and I think you've noted this in the past, postpaid's taking share from prepaid. So that's why the category's generally up. But, for us, yeah, this strategy is working on all fronts. We did a distribution expansion from 230 million to 265 million POPs now covered by our stores. We talked a lot about that through 2016 and 2017. That's now largely complete, that phase that we had been talking about. The New T-Mobile certainly sees lots of room to run for ongoing distribution expansion up to 300 million. So big future potential there. And also, as we've been saying, big present potential, because there's a curve to these stores and we're just now starting to see the productivity that you would expect. Really, running ahead of our expectations, particularly in greenfield areas where we put a lot of those stores. So that's great. And then segments, suburban families, prime credit customers, military families, rural customers, over-55, all these are under-penetrated areas where we're starting to see success. And some we've been at it for a little over a year, some a little less than a year. But in the grand scheme of things, we're just getting started in so many of these areas. And then finally, business, which I gave a long answer to before. We have very low shares, but very high current success rates. And that's something that I think can only build on itself. So we're feeling very optimistic right now about the ability to serve wireless customers in more and more segments. Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC : And then on the flipside of that on prepaid. I mean is it that you're just not responding to offers in the market from AT&T? Because you look at your churn, it's obviously improved year-on-year, absolutely (00:58:28) fine, but the gross adds are down, I think, a bit. Is that just not reacting to AT&T? Is Sprint taking those customers? What's going on in prepaid? Is there a game plan to reverse that or are you happy with where it's at? G. Michael Sievert - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Well, the way we think about it is, it's all one market. And the way \u2013 I would turn it around and say, AT&T has been forced to retreat to the prepaid part of the market because it's the only place they can find success. If you look at total branded nets that in prepaid is a subcomponent of, we're up. We're up sequentially and we're up overall year-over-year. And so prepaid's a component of that. What you've seen is an improving of our mix. With overall branded nets up, more and more of ours are coming from the postpaid side, which is our aspiration. It's what our owners would expect of us and it's what we're delivering. Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC : Got it. Thank you. John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Okay. Operator, I think we have time for one more question. Am I right here? Nils Paellmann - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Yeah. John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Okay. One more question, operator? Operator : Absolutely. We'll now take our next question from Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thank you for squeezing me in and I'm actually going to just follow up on prepaid question. Mike, I was hoping you can maybe just talk more about that category? What has been the shift in the market that you're adjusting to with the rebranding? What gives you confidence you can actually rebrand and not maybe trip over your own momentum there because the Metro brand is very well-regarded? And then ultimately, how are we going to know if this pivot worked? Are you trying to reinvigorate sub-growth? Or do you think by attaching the T-Mobile brand directly to Metro, you can actually drive ARPUs higher? Thanks. G. Michael Sievert - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Thanks. Our team under Tom Keys did research here and concluded some very simple things, which is there's a lot of people on the postpaid side at AT&T and Verizon who ought to be on an offer like Metro and who weren't giving Metro the kind of consideration because it was seen as so separate. And these are all one market. As John said, when we announced Metro by T-Mobile, prepaid and postpaid are increasingly \u2013 the distinction as when did you pay, at the beginning of the month or at the end of the month. But there's been over the years a stigma to it that has caused some postpaid customers not to take a close look. And we feel like there's a big opportunity to showcase to certain people at AT&T and Verizon, who absolutely based on their credit profile, their income profile, where they live, they ought to be on an offer like Metro. And this is going to put them more in the consideration set to look at us because it's Metro by T-Mobile. And you'll see that the T-Mobile brand and network is standing behind Metro. As to further complexities, you remember, the distribution's separate. So we're not worried about cannibalization rates or some of the internal complexities. This is just about focusing externally on customers at AT&T and Verizon. Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: And just to follow-up, but it does sound like you'll see this in the sub-numbers if it works the way you hope, is that fair? G. Michael Sievert - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Remember, you're going to be looking at the total. As I said to the last question that Walt was asking, we're chasing overall performance in our branded portfolio and we want to see an improving of the mix over time, and prepaid plays an important role in that. So, yes, but we'll be looking at the total competitiveness of the company, not any one particular subcomponent. John J. Legere - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Okay, Braxton. J. Braxton Carter - T-Mobile US, Inc.: Yeah. I want to thank everyone for tuning in to today's call. We look forward to speaking to you again next quarter and continuing the tradition. Thank you very much. Operator? Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the T-Mobile US Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. If you have any further question, you may contact the Investor Relations or Media Departments. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect and have a pleasant day.",

Following opening remarks, the earnings call will be open for questions via the conference line, Twitter or Facebook. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Nils Paellmann, Head of Investor Relations for T-Mobile US. Please go ahead, sir. Nils Paellmann : Yes. Thank you. Also good morning and welcome to T-Mobile's fourth quarter and full year 2018 earnings call. With me today are John Legere, our CEO; Mike Sievert, our President and COO; Braxton Carter, our CFO; and other members of the senior leadership team. Let me just briefly read the disclaimer. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements that include projections and statements about our future financial operating results, our plans, the benefits we expect to receive from the proposed merger with Sprint and other statements that are not historical facts. Such statements are based upon the current beliefs and expectations of our management and are subject to significant risk and uncertainties outside of our control that could cause our actual results to differ materially, including the risk factors set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Reconciliations between GAAP and the non-GAAP results we discuss on this call can be found in the Quarterly Results section of the Investor Relations page of our website. In addition, in connection with the proposed transaction on July 30, 2018, we filed a registration statement on Form S-4 with the SEC related to the merger. The registration statement became effective on October 29, 2018 and is available on the New T-Mobile website. It contains important information about T-Mobile and Sprint, the merger and related matters. With that, let me turn it over to John Legere. John? John Legere : All right, with that exciting opening, good morning, everyone. Welcome to T-Mobile's fourth quarter and full year 2018 earnings call and Twitter conference coming to you live from Washington DC. We pre-released our record breaking custom results on January 9, and the financial released today are just as strong. Let me quickly touch on the highlights, then Braxton can jump into the details and we'll get to your questions. First, let me \u2013 let's start my takeaways in the quarter. T-Mobile delivered another record breaking quarter in Q4, yes another one, despite the work underway to close the merger with Sprint we continued to drive our business beyond expectations and I could not be more proud of our T-Mobile team. We had the highest total customer net additions ever in Q4 and we followed that up with record breaking financials, which is a winning formula for our shareholders. T-Mobile led the industry in postpaid phone net adds for the fifth year in a row and we posted a Q4 record low branded postpaid phone churn. Both service and total revenues hit record highs in this quarter while adjusted EBITDA was our best Q4 ever. Our 2019 guidance shows our confidence for the standalone outlook for T-Mobile. We continue to meet the needs of wireless customers and translate that into incredible results. I feel good about the state of our business going into 2019. So, let's dive into the numbers. I'll focus mostly on Q4 to keep it brief, but you can see all the numbers in our earnings release fact book and our Form 10-K. First, I've got to highlight our very strong financial results. Service revenues hit record highs reaching $8.2 billion growing by 6% year-over-year. Total revenues increased by 6% year-over-year to $11.4 billion, also a record high. Net income was strong at $640 million and a fully diluted EPS came in at $0.75. We hit a Q4 record high with adjusted EBITDA of $3 billion up 10% year-over-year with a 36% adjusted EBITDA margin. For full-year 2018 adjusted EBITDA amounted to a record high $12.4 billion towards the high end of our increased guidance range of $12 billion to $12.5 billion. The customer results as you saw in on January 9, were record-breaking. We added a record 2.4 million total net customers extending our winning streak to 23 quarters in a row with more than 1 million, and we added over 1 million branded postpaid phone customers capturing over 50% of industry postpaid phone growth including cable and delivering 56% more postpaid phone net additions than our closest competitor Verizon. And our growth in postpaid phone nets accelerated again benefiting from the investments we have made in our network, marketing, and the continued focus on underpenetrated segments such as new geographies 55+, Military and T-Mobile for Business, all of which contributed to our great quarter. We also had strong total branded postpaid net additions of 1.4 million supported by continued strong growth in wearables. This means we added 4.5 million branded postpaid customers in 2018 smashing through our increased guidance range of 3.8 million to 4.1 million. These wireless customers are coming and staying longer than ever before. In Q4 we had our lowest ever branded postpaid phone churn for fourth quarter of 0.99%, down 19 basis points year-over-year. This quarter was by the way the first time ever that T-Mobile's churn was lower than AT&T's, a might major milestone for both of us. Branded prepaid net customer additions came in at an industry best to 135,000 driven by Metro by T-Mobile, a significant acceleration from Q3. We continue to be a leader in prepaid and continue to find a way to deliver growth quarter after quarter. Our engineering team is hard at work furiously building out our 600 MHz and setting the stage for America's first real nationwide 5G network next year. Our aggressive build out is on 5G ready equipment and we have made rapid progress in just one year since getting our hands on the spectrum. 2700 cities and towns in 43 states and Puerto Rico are live on 600 MHz and we already have 29 600 MHz capable devices in our lineup today including the new iPhones. We have standards based 5G equipment deployed to six of the top 10 markets including New York and Los Angeles. We believe the 5G revolution should be for everyone, everywhere, and not just the few intense areas. While the other guys hyped 5G we continue to focus on real 5G using global standards based equipment, 5G NR that will light up and deliver for customers across the U.S. How has the competition responded to our plans? Well, AT&T responded by trying to rebrand 4G as 5GE and we know the customers see right through their bullshit and Verizon by the way, their current standard pups, pre-standard 5G footprint covers what they even themselves call limited areas in four cities, while our 5G capable 600 MHz network already covers hundreds of thousands of square miles. Also we continue to expand our 4G LTE coverage and deliver industry leading network performance. Our network now covers more than 325 million Americans with 4G LTE effectively matching Verizon's population coverage. We now have 600 and 700 MHz low band spectrum deployed to 301 million people across the country and we continue to lead the industry in 4G LTE speeds. In Q4 our average download 4G LTE speed was 33.4 Mb per second once again ahead of all the competitors. We remain very confident in our outlook for 2019 and this is reflected in our guidance. Our outlook calls for 2.6 to 3.6 million branded postpaid net customer additions and adjusted EBITDA of $12.7 to $13.2 billion excluding the impact of the new lease standard. Cash capx is $5.4 billion to $5.7 billion excluding capitalized interest and by the way our three-year free cash flow CAGR remains unchanged at 46% to 48%. Now we're using today's call to focus on our incredible Q4 and full-year results. But before I hand it over to Braxton, let me give you a quick update on the progress of our pending merger with Sprint. The combined company will create an aggressive competitor in wireless, broadband, and beyond, which will result in lower prices for consumers and will create jobs starting on day one. American consumers will benefit from a nationwide 5G network that is both broad and deep and we can't wait to get started. We continue to work through the regulatory review process with humility and respect for all parties involved. A number of major milestones have been completed and we remain optimistic and confident that once regulators review all the facts they will recognize the significant pro consumer and pro competitive benefits of this combination. We continue to have a productive dialogue with both federal and state regulatory authorities. A few milestones in last earnings. On December 17, we received approval from both CFIUS and Team Telecom proving that regulators are ignoring the noise and conducting a fact-based review. And on January 29, the FCC shot clock resumed again after the government reopened. At state level we have received 15 of the required 19 State PUC approvals. Marcello Claure and I look forward to our hearings next week with the House Committee on Energy and Commerce and the House Judiciary Committees. Our integration planning is well underway and we're making great progress. As part of our integration planning, on January 30 we announced plans to build five New T-Mobile Customer Experience Centers with Overland Park Kansas as the first location chosen and Upstate New York being the second location which will create an average of 1000 new jobs each. And when we announced the merger in April, we said the New T-Mobile would deliver a dramatically improved network experience and consumers would pay less while getting more. Critics of our merger, largely employed by big telco and big cable have principally argued that we are going to raise rates right after the merger closes. I want to reiterate unequivocally that prices will go down and customers will get more for less. We're entering the final stages of our regulatory review process and it's an important time to document the commitments that we've made from day one. This is another example of T-Mobile putting its money where its mouth is and backing up what we said in our public interest statement. In summary, I am very, very pleased with the progress we've made on our merger and the process so far and I continue to expect regulatory approval in the first half of this year. Okay, to wrap it up I also couldn't be more excited about the performance in 2018 and our guidance shows continued momentum in 2019. The combination with Sprint means that we will be able to create a future that is even more exciting for American consumers. Okay, Braxton will take us through our financial results and the details of our guidance. Let's take a closer look Braxton. J. Braxton Carter : Well, thanks John and I'm so excited to be here today talking about first of all our record 2018 highlighted by record low churn and the acceleration of growth year-over-year. Second thing I'm very excited about is sharing with you details of our 2019 guidance. You know our playbook, extremely conservative, extremely measured and was we execute throughout the year we consistently raise that guidance during the year. To highlight that in 2018 we actually increased growth guidance and EBITDA guidance every quarter going into year end. I'll also focus on Q4 of my remarks most otherwise noted. Net income amounted to $640 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.75. As you recall, Q4 2017 had a significant net tax benefit of $2.2 billion or $2.50 per share related to tax reform. Excluding this benefit, net income would have grown by 21% year-over-year and diluted EPS by 23%. Adjusted EBITDA amounted to $3 billion up 10% and included leasing revenues of $168 million versus $160 million in the prior year. Note that adjusted EBITDA included a negative impact from the hurricane costs of $14 million and a positive impact from the new revenue recognition standard of $83 million. Excluding the combined impacts from hurricane costs, the new revenue standard and gains on the disposable of spectrum in 2017 adjusted EBITDA would have increased 12% year-over-year. The adjusted EBITDA performance is a reflection of strong cost management. Cost services as a percent of service revenues excluding the combined impact from the hurricanes in the new revenue standard decreased by 90 basis points year-over-year despite the rapid rollout of 600 MHz spectrum. SG&A as a percentage of service revenues excluding the combined impacts from the hurricane, the new revenue standard and Sprint merger related costs decreased by 70 basis points year-over-year despite the acceleration in growth. Free cash flow increased 7% year-over-year to $1.2 billion. This was driven by a 10% increase in net cash provided by operating activities compensating for a 29% increase in cash CapEx. Please note that the net cash outflow from securitizations amounted to $36 million in Q4 and an outflow of $179 million in 2018. Therefore, free cash flow did not benefit from any net proceeds from securitization. Despite these headwinds, full year 2018 free cash flow amounted to $3.6 billion, up 30% year-over-year. Branded postpaid phone ARPU amounted to $46.29 in Q4 up 0.3% sequentially as we signaled in our last earnings call and down 0.2% year-over-year. Full year 2018 ARPU was $46.40 down 1.2%. Excluding the impact of the new revenue standard, the year-over-year decrease would have been 1.1%. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to the growing success of new customer segments and rate plans such as T-Mobile for Business, T-Mobile ONE Unlimited 55+, T-Mobile Military and T-Mobile Essentials. The impact of the ongoing growth in our Netflix offering decreased postpaid ARPU in full-year 2018 by $0.32. In addition the year-over-year reduction was also due to a reduction in certain nonrecurring charges. For full-year 2019 we expect branded postpaid phone ARPU to remain generally stable compared to full-year 2018. Even with the year-over-year ARPU decrease service revenues grew by 6% year-over-year due to strong customer growth. Even more impressive, growth in branded postpaid revenues accelerated to 8% in Q4 compared to 6.6% growth in Q3. Please note that starting in Q1 2019 we plan to discontinue Average Billings Per User or ABPU which is a metric that we developed to provide transparency during the transition from Classic to EIP rate plans but has lost relevance now that we are effectively all EIP. In terms of customer quality, our results from the fourth quarter were very strong. Total bad debt expense and losses from sale receivables were $118 million or 1.03% of total revenues compared to $147 million or 1.37% in the fourth quarter of 2017. Now let's come to our exciting 2019 guidance. We expect branded postpaid net customer additions to be between 2.6 million and 3.6 million. This guidance takes into account our long-term strategy to balance growth and profitability, a continuation of the lower switcher volume that we've seen in recent quarters, and our pursuit of growth adjacencies. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $12.7 billion to $13.2 billion excluding the impact of the new lease standard. This guidance takes into account leasing revenue of $600 million to $700 million in 2019. It also takes into account our network expansion, in particular the 600 MHz and 5G rollouts, driving up cost of service by $200 million to $300 million year-over-year. When comparing this guidance to 2018, please consider that our 2018 adjusted EBITDA benefited from positive impacts of $398 million from the new revenue standard and a net $158 million from hurricane reimbursements. We expect a lower positive impact from the new revenue standard in 2019 about half of the 2018 benefit. Adjusting for these factors, namely hurricanes and the new revenue standard, our adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2019 implies a high single-digit growth rate. We believe there is significant operating leverage still to be realized despite the increased investments we're making in our network in 2019. Pre-close Sprint merger costs are expected to be $350 million to $500 million in 2019 depending on timing of a potential merger close. These costs will be excluded from adjusted EBITDA but will impact net income. Our effective tax rate is expected to be between 26% to 27% for the full year 2019. And we target cash CapEx of $5.4 billion to $5.7 billion excluding capitalized interest which is expected to amount to approximately $400 million in 2019. Similar to prior years we expect cash CapEx to be front end loaded with Q1 2019 in the range of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion. This reflects the tremendous work and momentum that Neville and the team have in place given our rollout of 600 MHz and 5G capable radios. Finally, we continue to expect free cash flow to increase at a three-year CAGR of 46% to 48% from full-year 2016 to full-year 2019, unchanged from the prior range even with higher cash CapEx in 2019. Our free cash flow guidance does not assume any material net cash inflows from securitization going forward. During the same period we expect the underlying net cash provided by operating activities to increase at a CAGR of 17% to 21%, up from the prior range of 7% to 12%. This increase reflects a higher adjusted EBITDA compared to earlier plans and also results from a change in our securitization facilities that led to a geographical change with the proceeds related to beneficial interests and securitization transactions line in the cash flow statement, but they don't change the overall free cash flow. In this regard, there are likely more changes coming this year and we will adjust the guidance accordingly in future quarters. In addition, we expect the following impacts from the adoption of the new lease standard : a positive impact of $140 million to $180 million on net income, a negative impact of $40 million to $80 million on adjusted EBITDA, and significant increases in assets of $9.1 billion to $10 billion and liabilities of $7 billion to $7.5 billion with a corresponding positive equity adjustment of $2.1 billion to $2.5 billion. Again, please see the earnings release fact book and the Form 10-K for full details. Now let's get to your questions. As during last quarter's call, I would like to ask you to focus your questions on our operating results. Also we cannot answer any questions related to the current millimeter wave auctions due to the quiet period around these auctions. You can ask questions via phone, Twitter or Facebook. We'll start with a question on the phone. Operator, first question please? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead. John Hodulik : Great, miracle questions for Neville on 5G, Neville can you talk a little bit about the capabilities of the network right out of the gates with the 30 MHz and the 600 MHz spectrum that you're employing and talk about the availability of phones that can utilize the 600 MHz spectrum? When do you expect to get them to the year? And then lastly, maybe something on pricing side do you expect pricing for 5G to be similar to 4G or do you hope to get a premium for the faster service? Thanks. John Legere : All right, so why don\u2019t the rest of you come back at 9 o'clock. Neville, go ahead, Neville. Neville Ray : I'll be brief. No, so let's \u2013 I'm going to pass the pricing over to you Mike when we get there, but super quick. So let's go over rest of it, so handsets John second half for the 600 look to be strong possibilities now with millimeter wave, you know handsets in first half, but no dates confirmed, but that's kind of the rough breakdown. We're excited about what we see coming in you know via multiband device in the second half of the year to meet the \u2013 obviously the footprint that we're working through. And then in terms of performance and capability super excited with what we see on the 600 MHz an hour and the software is firming up really nicely, performance is strong, speeds are going to be on top of LTE. You can see an aggressive competitive response against 5G NR victory lap on the fastest LTE. AT&T especially trying to figure out how to not be second or third in that race for the coming couple of years. We're going to be adding 600 MHz spectrum to the fight, both with LTE and with 5G NR and speeds and performance are going to continue to increase on this network into 2019 and materially more so in 2020 when we can reach our nationwide ambition on the 600 MHz 5G deployment. Mike Sievert : So, on pricing, the short answer would be, we have big aspirations for incremental revenues and growth from 5G, but not through pricing, through our current smartphone plans. So the incremental revenues come from more and more users picking wireless technologies instead of other technologies for their conductivity. There is a big broadband business that we expect to build, there are big enterprise opportunities, there are IoT opportunities, there more devices per users, there are new capabilities being developed, all of which we can monetize with revenue growth. But we don't have plans for the smartphone plans that you see today to charge differently for 5G enablement versus 4G LTE. John Hodulik : Got it, thanks guys. Mike Sievert : Yep. Operator : Our next question will come from Michael Rollins with Citi. Please go ahead. Michael Rollins : Hi thanks for taking the questions, two if I could. First, can you talk about the macro industry environment and what you think has driven the acceleration in category postpaid phone add and how sustainable that is? And then second, and maybe related to that, can you talk a bit about the competitive landscape in terms of what you're seeing from cable, what are you seeing from your competitors for bundling video and application into the rate plans and how do you expect that to evolve in the coming year? Thanks. John Legere : You want to start Mike? Mike Sievert : Sure, postpaid versus prepaid the two subcategories, what we've seen and you've seen this over the last several quarters Mike is that there's been better growth in the postpaid side than on the prepaid side, and there are couple of big trends there. One is, these subcategories, the distinctions between them continue to fall away. Postpaid and prepaid offer very similar things and you know it really is a matter of do you want to pay your bill at the beginning of the month and maybe some simpler product lineups or do you want to pay the bill at the end of the month and have some increased options in terms of how you buy family plans financing et cetera. And as the distinctions fall away as a category we've seen more growth on the postpaid side as the subcategories have converged. Secondly the economy is very strong and as the economy continues to be strong more people have been buying on the postpaid side and so that piece certainly would flow with the cycles. So overall it's been I think a very good trend for the industry. In respect to T-Mobile we have a very, very strong prepaid position, and know if the category dynamics change we're well positioned either way. John Legere : And I think, let's make sure that we don't jump over some of the pertinent items that are part of kind of what's taking place in the industry. And it very, for me it's exciting to see that in whatever the competitive environment is, including now that we've added cable players into the mix, that T-Mobile continues to perform at rates that would be described by for example, the postpaid porting ratios for this quarter were 1.91 over to with AT&T up against everybody, greater than 50% of the postpaid additions across everybody, including the cable players. And just for a matter of reference, so 1.91 is one of those, that's a very strong postpaid porting ratio and frankly it is the same or better so this quarter. So it's \u2013 the machine is moving very well. It's also important to note that the cable players are aggressively coming in to the wireless space, but so far aggressively means, as you would probably expect players of this size, that they are spending massive amounts of money would negative cash flow and negative EBITDA to attain small amounts of customers. I think charter had about $304 million negative free cash flow for just over 100,000 postpaid net. So it's a very clearly it's disruptive in the industry, but it's really something that is probably difficult to look forward and see how that they will do it. I also am a little puzzled as to how with such an important item that I believe Comcast has decided now to not be transparent and put their wireless results inside of cable. So these are interesting aspects. I'm very, very pleased with what took place on the prepaid side, 135,000 prepaid nets in an industry that before we see TracFone shrunk. So it continues to show that we are strong and aggressive on both sides and these results this quarter really are a great statement at how well the T-Mobile machine and brand are moving along. Mike Sievert : And Mike, the last part of your question was about cabling convergence. Yes, we think these offers that give customers options to look across wireless and media are popular and that's one of the reasons why we led the way with our un-carrier move centered around Netflix. We've partnered with the most popular brand in the space and it's been a big part of what customers like about T-Mobile ONE and they rely on us to bring them not only unlimited streaming which we pioneered, but great media choices as well. So we have a nice start in that space. Relative to what AT&T is bundling in and relative to old-school cable that the cable guys are bundling in. So it's an interesting space, it's changing rapidly and we feel well positioned within it. Michael Rollins : Thanks. Operator : We'll take our next question from Philip Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Philip Cusick : Hey guys, I guess first to start Mike with what you just mentioned. On the Layer3 strategy I think it has been great to partner with Netflix, that seems to be working really well, does it still makes sense to create your own video bundle? Mike Sievert : Oh it does, yes. If you think about our TV strategy there's two pieces to it. The first piece we've been talking to you about the home TV strategy, that's the one we were expecting to launch late in 2018 and that we now expect to launch in the first half of 2019. As I mentioned to you on the last call, we're not date-driven when it comes to the home part of the strategy, we're quality driven. We did launch in four cities a predecessor product under the Layer3 TV brand. We're getting great learnings from customers, great feedback about features they'd like to see and we decided to develop those features and some additional quality improvements before rebranding and rolling out a home product. Principally because our business aspirations in that place are highly tied to something that's still in development anyways, which is our home broadband strategy. So those two can operate independently of each other, but they really operate well in concert in our future plans and particularly in the context of the New T-Mobile where we have very ambitious home broadband plans. So I'm very excited about what's happening there. We have some great things in the works and I expect to be able to bring redefined and rebranded product to many, many more places across the country in the first half of this year. What you're asking about though in addition is a mobile strategy and we believe there's a space for us here. Customers, you know have incredible array of optionality today through the massive expansion of OTT services that are available. It's subscription palooza out there. Every single media brand is, either has or is developing an OTT solution and most of these companies don't have a way to bring these products to market. They're learning about that. They don't have distributed networks like us. They don't have access to the phones like we have. And we think we can play a role for our customers as I've been saying in the past at bringing these worlds of media and the rest of your digital and social and mobile life together. Helping you choose the subscriptions that makes sense, building for those things, search and discovery of content. We think there's a big role for our brand to play in helping you. And as I said in the past, we actually, and to the premise of your question Phil, we don't have plans to develop an undifferentiated skinny bundle out there. There are plenty of those, but we think there's a more nuanced role for us to play in helping you get access to the great media brands out there that you love, and to be able to put together your own media subscription in smaller pieces $5, $6 $7, $8 at a time, it's an exciting future for us. So there's two big pieces to it and most of the fun starts this year in 2019. Philip Cusick : Good luck with that. Thanks. John Legere : Okay, thanks. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Simon Flannery : Great, thank you very much. On the subscriber guidance for 2019, can you just talk about where you see the biggest opportunities amongst the various segments 55 and over Military geographic expansion, et cetera, how far along those opportunities are you in terms of penetrating them and is there any big change in the contribution in '18 versus '19? And then Neville, there is some disclosure around your small cell build out and systems, perhaps you'd just update us on where you are today on the network build out from that perspective and what we should be looking for in '19? Thanks. John Legere : Let me start with the segments, it's early days is the short answer and we're very excited about what we're seeing in our day-to-day flow. But when it comes to our market share in these underpenetrated segments, they're underpenetrated and so that's really exciting. We continue to have a significantly lower share in suburban prime families. We continue to have a significantly lower share in Military and over 55 and particularly in Business. Despite our flow share which is exciting, day in, day out we're winning more than our fair share and that means we have a growth opportunity. So, and by the way, there are more of these segments out there and I think we've demonstrated that we can simultaneously execute on our core while expanding our brand to more and more audiences. And you're seeing that in the \u2013 not just the activations that we're able to deliver right now, but in the outstanding churn performance. Some of these customers that we're winning are customers who have been with their prior carrier for years and years. So the network improvements are contributing to churn, but so is the makeup of the customers that we've been acquiring over the last year, more prime, more stable customers that were at their last carrier for many years and have made the first switching decision in a long time to switch from someone else to T-Mobile. Neville Ray : And Simon, let me pick up on the small cell piece, so just over 21,000 small cells in play today. We plan on continuing our march on small cells another 20,000 or so plan to come off as we exit '19 and into '20. And we continue to densify this network to prepare for obviously a tremendous capacity and performance future. Biggest focus right now is, as we've reference multiple times here is the 600 MHz build, that's going to be the biggest and largest and most transformative piece as we move through '19 and into '20. I mean thousands upon thousands of new sites with 600 MHz capability coming on air, but we do not take our eye off the ball at all on capacity and performance. We're at the best capacity performance in our company's history right now, lowest congestion figures we've ever seen. We love to be that way. The proxy for that in the marketplace is our fastest speed performance. And as I mentioned earlier, we continue to win on that front and look to maintain that lead. On the small cell piece, we are starting to see and introduce license assisted access, so LTE in the 5 gig space we're seeing very positive results and returns from those investments and so a lot of opportunity to grow capacity in the urban calls. We're not taking our eye off that ball, but big, big most major improvements coming on the 600 MHz side this year. Simon Flannery : Great, Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Brett Feldman : Thanks. Braxton, during your comments you talked about how there's still a lot of opportunities for the company to achieve more operating leverage and I also believe you spent some time talking about SG&A because actually last year your SG&A as a percentage of revenue went up just a little bit as you put into the release. So all of this EBITDA growth you've been achieving has been happening despite the fact you really haven't achieved any operating leverage to that cost item. What do you have embedded in your assumptions for 2019 in terms of SG&A and really what's going to have to happen to get to the point where maybe as a percentage of revenue that cost item starts to decline more than we've seen in the past? Thanks. J. Braxton Carter : Sure, I think that, let back to the item of two pieces. I mean we have the back office piece of SG&A where we're actually seeing some very nice scaling. But when you look at the selling part of the equation, please keep in mind that we've had a significant acceleration of growth year-over-year and the reality of our model is it's an acquisition based model, a cost to grow and a cost to grow more. And that acceleration of growth is ultimately through the conversion of the revenue, EBITDA and cash flow the driver of value. And if you look at a scenario where our growth was actually lower and if you really study our guidance on subscribers, look at where we guided last year, look where we ended up, and look at the significant increase in the range that we provided this year over the initial guidance last year, it's very, very, very, exciting. If our growth was to moderate, which is not what we're executing towards, Mike talked about this tremendous multiple year growth potential in many of our growth adjacencies, our segments, before we get to really exciting things that 5G is going to bring to the table, that acceleration of growth plays into this factor. If the growth actually went down we would have a significant expansion of our EBITDA margins, but that's really not what we're executing towards. I hope that makes sense, but on a very macro level that's really what the driver is. Brett Feldman : So, just in terms of this year's guidance, is it fair to say that you're probably assuming SG&A continues to kind of grow in line with revenue because your growth strategy is staying that way or is there some other nuance now when you think about it, you gave us some color on costs of service, I'm just trying to dig into other line items a little more. J. Braxton Carter : Yes, they'll be a little bit of scale, but obviously we have significant growth aspirations for the next year, so you've got to take that into account. Brett Feldman : All right, thank you. J. Braxton Carter : You\u2019re welcome. John Legere : Operator, before we go to the next question I want to be cognizant of how many questions are coming in, in the various forms and somebody that's always been very patient and deliberate in posting questions via Twitter as Bill Ho and Mike maybe you and Braxton can talk about this one, but Bill's got a question along with a chart and since his bars were so nicely put in magenta, I think it's something that we should answer. 4Q '18, can you discuss postpaid 4Q upgrade trending over the years now that this quarter is at an all time low, validate that subject keeping handsets longer and low upgrade promos, outlook to get base prepaid and postpaid on 600 capable devices and for 5G coverage '20 and '21, so it's kind of a upgrade rate story? Mike Sievert : Yes, I can start on it. Bill, you're right, I mean the upgrade rate was 6% this quarter and that was marginally lower than, I think it was 7% this quarter last year. And what we're seeing is an ongoing category trend. Smartphones are getting more and more expensive. Some of the phones are well over a $1000 now and they have capabilities that is still relevant to consumers a couple of years out. And so between the costs rising and the capabilities being able to do what they want to do on a smartphone, they're just keeping them longer and that's not a trend we see changing anytime soon. It's not a bad trend for our business, although I will say that when you're switching phones it's a great moment to switch carriers and so we always take advantage of these big phone moments to remind people they're with the wrong carrier and it's time for them to switch. So and despite that slowdown you've seen we've been able to overcome it by having an acceleration to the point of the last question in our growth rates. So we've been able to manage through it very nicely in a period where there's lower churn partly driven by slower upgrade rates in the category and yet we're outgrowing our past and that's something that we feel very good about. By the way this last quarter was a great quarter of phone launches. We feel very pleased with how the new iPhones performed on our network and remember these are all 600 MHz compatible phones, so these are driving increases in customer satisfaction, given the rollout that Neville and team have done in 42 states across 2,700 cities and towns on 600 MHz. So we're delighted with what's happening with phones, but it's a trend that we don't see really changing any time soon unless what we see from the OEMs begins to change. John Legere : And I'm and I'm not sure whether there will be a large hoard of people running out now to get phones that will show 5GF or fake on them. And I have two opinions on that. One is please tell me not that many people are fooled by the fact that this is total bullshit and what it is of course is something that it's 4G LTE Advanced. I mean it's carrier aggregation 4 x 4 MIMO, it's 256-QAM. It's things that Neville did so long ago he has to go back and remember what they are. So, but if people really want to have a phone that flashes that on, we are your team, I mean we can we can get to that. In fact I will get you a little sticky thing and put it right on your phone right now. So let's see how it plays out, but I don't think it's going to be a major upgrade trend, but if it turns you on we're ready for you, 5GE all the way. All right let's take the next one on the line. Operator : And we\u2019ll move next to Jonathan Chaplin with New Street Research. Please go ahead. Jonathan Chaplin : Thanks. Two quick ones if I may, so with your churn now lower than AT&Ts you clearly got a product from everybody's perspective that's at least as good as AT&T and Verizon's. But there's a huge gap in your pricing and the gap is widening as they take price up and you guys give more and more value to your customers. If the deal with Sprint didn't go through, wouldn't there be an opportunity for you to take up price from where it is now without really giving up anything on subscriber growth? And then the second question is, just on SOGA with the footprint expansion and with you attacking new attacking new verticals, I would have expected SOGA to start inching up particularly with your comments around the investment in SG&A that you made in response to an earlier question and it's actually been pretty stable. Why aren't we seeing your share of gross adds in the industry inch up as you're attacking markets? Thanks. John Legere : You want to start? Mike Sievert : First of all, there's a lot of different measures on SOGA. Our measures show that it is growing. So, you know we look at variety of different data sets including data that looks well beyond porting data which is the underlying source for a lot of SOGA. We look at switching data which can use digital fingerprinting to figure out what switching looks like in the industry from a variety of vendors and that data shows us that SOGA is on the rise at T-Mobile. And then to your point churn is at an all time low and to think that three or four years ago that we would surpass AT&T or Verizon in overall churn given their very established incumbent advantages of long term penetration of older customers who churn less, prime customers who churn less, enterprise customers who churn less and yet despite all those incumbent long term advantages our churn was lower than A&T's for the first time ever this quarter. And we continue to be bullish about the prospects for churn for the reasons I've described, so that's terrific. You asked about pricing. Look we have an established success model on pricing and we would be loathe to change it. Our brand is based on it. Our success model behind it is proven and we're generating incredible development of shareholder value executing that strategy with all time record cash flows for example and very ambitious guidance financially for the year and beyond. So it's a strategy that works for us and it's a strategy of growing revenues by taking the other guy's customers, not a strategy of growing revenues by trying to be a price leader and that's something that our brand relies on heavily. Now you're asking about differences in standalone versus New T-Mobile. One of the differences is the capacity that New T-Mobile will have relative to standalone and it's important to understand it. The core tenet of New T-Mobile is that by bringing these companies together, you get something very different from the T-Mobile you know today plus the Sprint you know today, very different. The combination has a multiplicative effect on the total available network capacity and that's very exciting because pricing in the industry is a function of your costs and it's a function of your capacity. And our costs in New T-Mobile are going to go down dramatically when it comes to what it costs to produce a gigabyte of data and that's going to allow us to continue executing this strategy of being a disruptor, a low price provider, that's finally able to do something that the premise of your question addresses, which is break down this traditional tradeoff that customers have always been forced to make, which is do you want a good deal or do you want the best network? Which one do you want? Choose one, and the New T-Mobile will be positioned uniquely to give you both. J. Braxton Carter : You know, Jonathan, let me add you've talked about the potential to monetize. When we tumble the numbers and you'll remember our focus is 100% on value creation and cash generation of this business, that we create much more terminal value on executing in a generally stable which we just reaffirmed today for '19, ARPU environment because we still lack the scale on a standalone business. So the unlock and the value creation versus a short term game of monetizing and reducing that organic scale, it makes all the sense in the world to play it and to execute like we're playing. And I think Mike very, very clearly made the argument about that brand and who we are in the end carrier. John? John Legere : I got one follow on, it is just, I think I'm awake now and Jonathan has always been one of my favorites. He's very, very thoughtful, he is not always right but he's very clear in his analysis and my question for Jonathan when I see him will be, since you are part of New Street are you forced to use as your input to regulatory process what comes out of the other side of your firm? Because I've never seen anything more comical than watching an environment with a complete lack of any indication as to what's happening, attempt to writer things every day. The sun is up, oh my God, that must be bad for the deal, it must be good for the deal. They clarified a pricing commitment, okay it must be going down. It is hilarious to watch. It's kind of shameful and I only hope that a New Street for example at the end of the year everybody should have to go back and kind of check against their predictions and then the money should flow to those of you that were rooted somewhat in reality. So Jonathan, if I can help I can tell you that all that noise is coming out of the other side is not the right smoke coming out of the chimney and you should get all the bonuses. And so with that I actually just say, I apologize to watching everybody have to struggle to look for signs of what has been so far I want to reiterate, an extremely deep, ongoing, well done process with the Department of Justice and the FCC, tens of millions of pages of documentation and modeling discussion that is going very well and a game that is pretty clearly if not in the bottom of the ninth inning it's in the late innings. And most of what you see going on are very good indications of a dialogue that's moving extremely well and I look forward to a time when the full narrative can be public and Jonathan then you can have a real input to go by on the regulatory outlook of the New T-Mobile. Okay, let's take the next question. Operator : We'll go next to Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead. Craig Moffett : Hi, two questions. First an operating question. Can you just maybe Mike update us a little bit on the mix story? You've talked for a long time about how your 600 expansion would operate through phases of improving the quality of the urban product starting to penetrate suburban outer rings and then eventually open new footprints in more rural areas. I wonder if you could just update us on how that mix is shifting over time in your gross adds? And then I guess, I'll come to the defense of the other side of New Street for a second. Having opened the topic John, can you just comment on was there in fact any precipitant to that led you to write the letter or to make the commitment about the price fees? J. Braxton Carter : You want to do the second part first or? John Legere : Yes, so again, as I said from the very first day back in April going into the first week of May, I've been down here in Washington with the very same story that the 5G Network that's going to be built with the $40 billion worth of investment and the breadth and the depth is going to be something that the country needs and has yet to see, it's going to be super charging the uncarrier, capacity will go up precipitously and prices will go down and jobs will increase. And that's been a dialogue that has gone from sound bite to tremendous modeling and conversation and depositions and hearings. And every now and then in the process, it's seen as a good time to take a piece of the consistency of what we've said and document it for prosperity. Now I would clearly tell you that in saying that in year 1, 2 and 3 prices will not go up, there's no loophole. We were not saying, people will try to find what's that loophole. It's no loophole. By the way prices going down is the same as not going up, they are in the same boat. 5G creating a unit cost differential that we pass on and usage going up significantly by customers with customers paying less in the absolute, that's exactly what we're talking about. So I can't speak to every piece of the process that's going on with every state and every aspect of the government, but in some of those conversations things are better documented, things are better announced and sometimes you just say okay. If there is a piece of this that you want clarification on, I'm your man. Raise that right hand and I'll tell you exactly what it is. And that's what this is and it's good news. What bad conversation could be going on, when you're clarifying the statement that you made that this is good for the country, it's good for the consumer, it's good for competition. Jobs are going up, prices are going down, supply is going to increase and the nation's competitiveness in 5G is going to go up. So that's what it is and anybody who can glance in and try to find a negative of that better go find some happy pills, because it's a sad view that people are making their life trying to look and find ways to be an expert in a process that they can't see. Sorry but that's, I don\u2019t know if that's helpful. It was helpful for me. Mike Sievert : Yes, I thought the question was pretty straightforward about the day-to-day operations and look the bottom line is, you know I think we shared some of these numbers before. We moved our geographic footprint of our distribution from 230 million POPs when we began the expansion to about 265 million POPs directly addressed by our distribution and that's helping to support our growth. And as I said, and by the way it's a substantial portion of our overall nets now that are coming from the combination of our geographic expansion and our segment expansion. Segment expansion includes over 55, it includes Military, it includes suburban prime consumers, it includes Business where we had an all time record quarter in Q4. So when you add up the segment expansion and the geographic expansion, it's a substantial portion of our total nets. And I think it demonstrates that this management team is constantly on the look for, what do we need to be focused on in order to keep this growth trend growing one and two years from now. And we've put the investments in the ground ahead of time to get there. And we're starting to see now the benefits of all those things that we told you would deliver benefits. And it's one of the reasons why our growth is not only not slowing down as many predicted it would do, but is actually accelerating as you saw in the results for the full year '18 and for Q4. Craig Moffett : Could I push you to try to normalize those kind of numbers in terms of market share, like what do you think your market share is in urban markets versus suburban versus rural? John Legere : Only that as I was saying earlier in the call it's very underpenetrated. So and I think I've shared before that we believe our market share in Business for example with large enterprises is sub 5% and overall business is sub 10% and that means 90% of the customers inclusive of all categories and business are with the other guys. Suburban prime over 55, rural customers these are all places where we're significantly underpenetrated. Prime customers, we remain underpenetrated even though we are seeing right now flow share that's fantastic on prime suburban families. So lots of upside still to go on these segments where traditionally our network didn't used to address their needs, years ago. Now that the network is there and is better than the competition in many respects for most people, we're starting to see these kinds of customers come in, in historic numbers and they're starting to fill into the base. But we have a long way to go when it comes to underlying market shares. Craig Moffett : That's helpful. Thank you. John Legere : Operator, this is the part in most companies earnings call where they see that it's Walt Piecyk and they eliminate him from the call stream, but we are not that company. So let's take the next question. Operator : Perfect. We\u2019ll go to Walt Piecyk with BTIG. Please go ahead. Walt Piecyk : Actually John, it's really only Sprint that remains is the only company that won't take my question on their calls, everyone else has, including [indiscernible] by the way. Can you \u2013 and you talked about Layer3 a little bit, and I think Mike mentioned a home broadband strategy. Is the home broadband strategy part of the first half of 2019 target as well or is that just kind of, I mean is it integrated in terms of the payTV strategy, just a little color on that? And then I have another technical question for Neville afterwards. John Legere : Sure. In 2019 we are going to begin piloting home broadband offers and they're based on 4G LTE for some of this year, later we'll move to 5G and it's a pilot. So you're going to see us doing activity and it's for a reason. We expect in New T-Mobile for this to be a substantial part of our growth story. As we've talked to you about in the New T-Mobile plans, we see the opportunity for millions of households. We intend to market home broadband service in 52% of U.S. zip codes. We see a major opportunity to deliver a median speed across the country of 450 megabits per second which of course by definition means half the people are getting faster speeds than that. And to really bring competition to a category that is the definition of uncompetitive. 48% of American households have no choice when it comes to their home broadband and that is crazy. If you look at what our competitors are doing, they're rolling out millimeter wave to some parts of some towns to compete for those households. We see a much wider opportunity for that. And we can be very disruptive in the broadband space as the New T-Mobile because the costs of our network are paid for by the mobile business. We have to build a network with the capacity that we're planning in order to be the viable growing competitor in mobile that we intend to be. Having done that, there become places all over this country where you have the capacity to serve millions of home broadband customers without the extra burden of significant extra capital. What that means is in-home broadband we can be very disruptive, not just on reaching some people who never had a great broadband choice but on the price as well and still have a very profitable business. Now all that stuff most of our aspirations for that are in the context of New T-Mobile because it's capacity dependent and home broadband is very, very consumptive. Despite that, we're going to start testing it this year and in the first half of this year, so that we can get the learnings that are required to go to market and win. The last part of your question was integration between that offer and the TV, the home TV offer that is being relaunched and rebranded. The integration will come but in the early stages of those two initiatives we'll be testing them separately. Don't get confused by that because the ultimate strategy is for these to be home TV and home broadband to be a blended go-to-market approach. Walt Piecyk : Understood, thanks. And then Neville, can you just talk a little bit about the 600? I mean you have 30 MHz, in the press release you talked about - on page 7 you talked about 300 million POPs covered but you kind of threw 700 in there. So it's unclear what's 6 and what's 7, but more importantly, the 30 MHz is it enough to deliver, what you would consider or what most would consider 5G speeds to make a differential and when you flip that to 5G and R, does that take away the coverage benefits that an LTE customer would get who just bought a 600 MHz phone on their iPhone. Neville Ray : So just to be clear Walt, great question, but I mean we're rolling out the 600 MHz in LTE right, so we're putting down a 10 MHz layer there and that's you saw the 301 million POPs you know covered on low band, so that's a combination of 700 and 60000. We didn\u2019t have that 700 footprint everywhere across the U.S. So customers are starting to see more low band coverage and all the benefits that brings in many new places. So the 600 LTE rollout has been going incredibly strong. We provided data around that. We have a national average of 30 MHz, so in some markets we have 40 and in a few places we have 50 MHz of 600 MHz and less in some than the 30. We're retaining the balance of that spectrum for the 5G rollout. We talked about the equipment that we're rolling out now is 5G capable, so as we get our software matured and ready for prime time, we will light up 5G services on those same radios that we've been deploying and are deploying across the country. So the 5G story is coming on super strong as we move through '19. And we'll be in a position to launch those services as we go into the second half and as I mentioned earlier on the devices come on board. Then in terms of speed I think it's a fascinating discussion in the U.S. right on 5G. And I'm very confident that we're going to continue to drive our speeds materially north. We're bringing a lot of spectrum into the 5G space and we, you know we're having all of that benefit of 5G spectrum efficiency and it's additional capabilities and I can compound that's been and performance with LTE. And so, I know as we move into the latter half of this year, our customers are going to see much faster speeds than they do today if they have a 5G capable handset compared to just being on LTE. Nobody loses on LTE Walt, right? But the 5G customers that adopt on those handsets are going to see faster speeds. And then I look at what's going to happen with our good old buddies in T and Verizon. And it's tough to imagine what they are doing this year. I mean AT& T if I can just double down on some of John's comments earlier on, on the 5G [ph] or 5GE whatever they're calling it, AT&T is desperate right now. We have a better network and so they fall in behind fascinating as they talked about this new LTE Advanced 5GE thing, we've been doing it for years. They're saying they're going to reach 200 million POPs by some point in time midyear '19. That's so far in my rearview mirror, I can't remember. So they are out there trying to tell people they've got something which is better than what they've really got. I love the fact they are going to now expand and show to people the limitations of their LTE network and their LTE Advanced network. So and in between what are they doing? Their little millimeter wave launch in a few cities, talking about speeds and performance, what speeds and performance, nothing. And then of course the Verizon story and we call it 5G WTF, going nowhere, some launches in a few cities last year, nothing happening, no mid band or even low band strategy emerging from Verizon on 5G. Tough to see what - anything that's going to happen from those guys in '19. AT&T starting to talk behind our 5G strategy saying they'll do low band now, multiband et cetera. So everybody kind of lining behind our strategy in the U.S., but they're all late and we're going to be the first guys putting down meaningful footprint with enhanced speeds in the 5G space and we won't be lying about what's happening on a customer's phone when we do it. Walt Piecyk : Well, so just to be clear, just a quick follow. If you dedicate something to 5G NR it can't switch dynamic to LTE, so if you're competitors have spectrum that they've deployed on LTE, that they say is 5G upgradable, it's either one of the others. You'd really need this clean block of spectrum to have a dedicated 5G NR. It can't be switching back and forth in your case 10 to LTE and 20 to 5G NR. Do I have that right? John Legere : That's right. Within low band that's right. Obviously, well the industry is working really hard on you know dynamic spectrum sharing right? You've probably heard the stone being bounced about. And the ability to actually move technologies across spectrum bands in a way that we haven\u2019t been able to do as an industry that's not ready for prime time by any means. So your statement is correct as we move into 2020 and beyond. Walt Piecyk : Understood, thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Ric Prentiss with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Ric Prentiss : Thanks for taking the question guys. It seems like overarching message in the call has been, get spectrum, build network, open stores and make sales. As we look at the... So as you look at your clearing of the 600 MHz I think you talked about doubling from like 135 million POPs to 207 million POPs. The CapEx front end loaded in '19 to Walt's question and Craig's question the footprint that you're marking to goes from 230 to 265. When should we expect the next wave of store openings and is it built into your '19 budget, is it in the '20 budget? But it seems like, yes there's usually another 30 plus million POPs of market too that could continue the footprint expansion. So just wondering what's the timeline, is it baked into guidance yet? John Legere : Just and will pass it to you Mike. But you had a great list of things people take as fundamentals that for granted, and one that wasn't in there that I want to point out, in addition to build a network, incredible network, one of the biggest variables that's improved our churn to now being better than AT&Ts is our customer care. What we've done with team of experts and what we're getting for feedback and accolades for not only the happiness of the employees, but the most satisfied nature of the customers when you combined both what's happening with network and what I think would be one of the harder things for anybody to duplicate is what's happening with care. And on top of that there's nothing that beats giving everybody a Taco every week. I think that is, it may sound simple, but Taco every week and a lift ride in the first week to go get it, now that's pure magic. So, we did burst all the records on T-Mobile Tuesdays this week. Mike Sievert : You're right, there's a real opportunity for retail expansion that remains. In fact one of the learnings from the last expansion, not surprisingly is that the best performing new stores were the ones in Greenfield markets and so there are more Greenfield markets to go as your question suggested. I think for us the most prudent way to pursue that is to be thoughtful about the likelihood of New T-Mobile being here by the middle of the year. And so, as you've probably heard us talk about in our New T-Mobile plans, we plan to create one rationalized retail fleet across both the former companies and we plan to expand from there. We expect 600 or so additional stores in the New T-Mobile mostly in the rural and Greenfield markets, smaller towns et cetera, as our initial foray. But there may be opportunity even beyond that. So, but what we've got right now is working really well. Our new stores are still coming up the curve. We're swallowing that growth, executing really well and we're being thoughtful about getting this merger completed and then further retail expansion in that context. Should we remain standalone? Of course there's more opportunity and you know the data backs it up as your question suggests. Ric Prentiss : The other aspect, and it sure seems like digital is becoming more important as far as channels. Can you talk a little about what you're doing as far as digital sales channels and digital customer care? Mike Sievert : Absolutely. First of all, we've just won exciting recognition for our application with JD Power recognition, we have the best app. Our customers are using it at historic rates. It's contributing to some of the cost improvements that we've seen. It's such a different and refreshing experience versus anything we were delivering two and three years ago. So if you haven't used it lately I can encourage you to check it out and it will remind you to get your Taco at the T-Mobile Tuesday\u2019s app as well. Digital is a really important strategy for us and we're pursuing it a little differently than I've heard some of our competitors are pursuing it. Yes, we're interested in pure digital acquisition and we've done some amazing things on that front including being one of the only ones with a great all digital e-SIM activation process, taking advantage of new e-SIM capabilities. We have the highest ranked e-commerce platform in the category that we've quietly built and executed. We've seen growth in all digital which remains in the single digits by the way, but significant growth in all digital. But I think and we think the biggest opportunity near term in digital is to make the 90% more effective, meaning digitally accelerated retail. And most of our investments are in that arena making the retail experience better. What we've learned and all carriers probably have learned is that nearly everyone goes to the web or mobile platforms to research the category before showing up at retail. And so, the question really is, for digital is how do you use that existing customer behavior to create a great end-to-end experience that begins in digital and ends in a fantastic retail experience that's better for customers and lower cost for us. We've made some great strides in that arena and you'll see most of our dollars and most of our development behind the digitally accelerated retail concept. Ric Prentiss : Thanks Mike. Mike Sievert : Yep. Operator : We'll move next to Amy Yong with Macquarie. Please go ahead. Amy Yong : Thanks and good morning. Maybe if I could squeeze two in, can you talk a little bit more about service revenue which grew 6%, what are the puts and takes for 2019? And then maybe just a second one on the prepaid market, I think you elaborated or you mentioned that post is growing faster than prepaid, what are you seeing in terms of the market and competition and maybe if you could talk about the rebranding of mature by T-Mobile where are the results so far? Thanks. J. Braxton Carter : Yes, when you look at the service revenue piece of the equation Amy, for years we've been no not only significantly outstripping the competition and growth, we continue to do that when you look at the fourth quarter. I think we're the only carrier that really grew total service revenues, but the underlying basis there is the ramping of the subscriber base. And remember we have a generally stable ARPU which really translates to that additional scale is what's driving that top line service revenue growth. And that's really the way that I would look at it and that's definitely the assumption going into 2019. Mike Sievert : And then on prepaid Amy, this was a fantastic quarter for us, big sequential gain and of course we took more than 100% of the net adds in the category because we believed that some category of prepaid at least until we see tracked on the results was not growing and yet we delivered 135,000 net additions. And you asked about Metro by T-Mobile and I would say it's a big piece of why we're performing so well. Tom Keys and the team have delivered a terrific strategy that we've been considering for a long time, which is whether or not there's a way to very carefully bring the MetroPCS community closer to the T-Mobile brand because what they want is a great network experience and they want the simplicity and value of Metro and the convenience of Metro which is in their own neighborhood. And what we have found is a combination that's really starting to win and you saw a nice sequential improvement in the quarter. We launched Metro by T-Mobile and we're starting to see more network attribution among Metro customers understanding that they're a part of something really different than other prepaid brands might be able to offer them, so we're delighted with what we're seeing with the strategy that the team delivered so far. John Legere : Just say, what's happened with MetroPCS since we acquired them is a great example of something to look back on to show the credibility of what we plan on doing with the New T-Mobile. We heard quite a few things about problems with network integration, and what's going to happen to employees, what's going happen to customers and we were able to have now twice as many customers at MetroPCS than when we acquired them, three times as many employees, twice as many stores, five times as many cities and they are clearly getting way more at lower prices than what they were getting including fully loaded offers that include Amazon Prime and Google One, et cetera. So it's been a great, great, story associated with what we planned to do wiassessed wwanted et cetera so it's been a great, great story associated with what we plan to do with the New T-Mobile, great example. I think we're going to take one last question operator. Operator : Thank you. And we'll take our final question from Colby Synesael with Cowen and Company. Colby your line is open. John Legere : I think we took our last question. Operator : Colby, your line is open. Colby Synesael : Can you guys hear me? J. Braxton Carter : Yes. We sure can Colby. John Legere : I think Colby just wanted to say how awesome the quarter was and\u2026 Colby Synesael : Do you hear me? John Legere : Yes. Colby Synesael : So for Netflix they just recently increased their pricing. I'm just curious what you talked to us about, what you expect the impact to be and then the timing on that? And then Neville, CBRS team at beginning quite the momentum, just curious what your thoughts are on that in terms of timing and how you guys plan to deploy that as well? Thanks. John Legere : On Netflix it's generally what we said when the price increase came out which is we are not passing through an increase to our customers right now and in fact we did not receive a pass through from Netflix yet, so it's a great partnership we're working together to make a plan and we've announced that we won't have much more to say about it until May 1, between now and then no change for our customers, no change to the benefit. Neville Ray : And then super quick Colby on CBRS, obviously were engaged with testing, trawling. No, confirmed date yet for the option off the license spectrum and still uncertainty if that\u2019s going to happen and in '19 or whether that would slide into 2020. So continued interest from us, but obviously, the spectrum volume that's available there especially in a license is pretty limited. And there are some power issues and so on to work through in terms of its propagation capabilities but we continue to look at the spectrum and evaluate and will see where the option timeline comes out. Colby Synesael : Great, thank you. Nils Paellmann : Okay, well thank you everyone for tuning in. We look forward to speaking to you again next quarter. Operator? Operator : Ladies and gentlemen this concludes the T-Mobile US fourth quarter and full year 2018 earnings call. If you have any further questions, you may contact the investor relations or media department. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect and have a pleasant day.",

Following opening remarks, the earnings call will be open for questions via the question line or via Twitter. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Nils Paellmann, Head of Investor Relations for T-Mobile US. Please go ahead, sir. Nils Paellmann : Yes, thank you very much. Welcome to T-Mobile\u2019s first quarter 2019 earnings call. With me today are John Legere, our CEO; Mike Sievert, our President and COO; Braxton Carter, our CFO; and other members of the senior leadership team. Let me read the disclaimer. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements that include projections and statements about our future financial operating results, our plans, the benefits we expect to receive from the proposed merger with Sprint and other statements that are not historical facts. Such statements are based upon the current beliefs and expectations of our management and are subject to significant risk and uncertainties outside of our control that could cause our actual results to differ materially, including the risk factors set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Reconciliations between GAAP and the non-GAAP results we discuss on this call can be found in the Quarterly Results section of the Investor Relations page of our website. In addition, in connection with the proposed transaction on July 30, 2018, we filed a registration statement on Form S-4 with the SEC related to the merger. The registration statement became effective on October 29, 2018 and is available on the New T-Mobile website. It contains important information about T-Mobile and Sprint, the merger and related matters. With this, let me turn it over to John Legere. John Legere : Okay. Well done, Nils. Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to T-Mobile\u2019s first quarter 2019 earnings call and Twitter conference coming to you live from Bellevue, Washington. T-Mobile\u2019s off to a fast start in 2019 and I could not be more excited about the state of our business and the opportunities ahead. We have a lot to cover today. So let\u2019s start with our incredible results. The two carriers reported earlier this week and one of the big cable giants reported this morning. So most of the cards are on the table for Q1 and I have to say, I really like our hand. In a quarter where Verizon had 44,000 postpaid phone losses, and AT&T lost 55,000 postpaid phone customers for a total combined loss of 99,000. Comcast added 170,000, the low expectations I might add. And even with Charter and Sprint left to report. T-Mobile still took an estimated 88% of the industry\u2019s postpaid phone growth. We also put up a customer growth number that accelerated year-over-year, extended our streak of more than 1 million total net per quarter to six years and delivered an all time record low postpaid phone churn results of 0.88%, by the way, that churn number is better than AT&T and within 4 basis points of Verizon. On top of that, we delivered our best ever Q1 financial results. So if I sound a little fired up about my team and about my business, it\u2019s because I am. I\u2019ve seen certain comments recently about our business. Can the momentum continue? Can they keep their eye on the ball and manage the business while planning for a massive merger? Can they take care of customers and deliver incredible results? My friends, the answer is yes. I\u2019d also like to give a big shout out to our incredible employees who made all this possible. There are a lot of numbers to unpack, so let\u2019s dive right in. First, let\u2019s talk customers. We added 1.7 million total net customers extending our winning streak to 24 quarters in a row with more than 1 million net adds. And we added 656,000 branded postpaid phone customers capturing an estimated 88% of the expected industry postpaid phone growth including cable and delivering almost four times more postpaid phone nets additions than Comcast the next closest competitor. In fact, we expect to be the only major wireless carrier with positive postpaid phone net adds this quarter. And our growth in postpaid phone nets accelerated year-over-year, despite lower industry switching volumes. We also had strong total branded postpaid net additions of over 1 million, once again supported by continued strong growth in wearables. These wireless customers are coming and staying longer than ever before. In Q1, we had all time record low branded postpaid phone churn of 0.88%, down 19 basis points year-over-year. Not only this in all time record low, it\u2019s also lower than AT&T for the second quarter in a row. Branded prepaid net customer additions was 69,000 and we\u2019re pleased with our performance in the quarter. Next, I\u2019ve got to highlight our very strong financial results. Total revenues increased by 6% year-over-year to $11.1 billion a record high for Q1. Service revenues hit record highs reaching $8.3 billion growing by 6% year-over-year and branded postpaid revenues grew by 8.3%. We hit a record high adjusted EBITDA of $3.3 billion, up 11% year-over-year with a 40% adjusted EBITDA margin. Net income was at Q1 record of $908 million, up 35% year-over-year and fully diluted EPS came in at $1.06, up 36%. Our momentum continues to be fueled by investments in new geographies, underpenetrated segments and customer care and we\u2019re not stopping there. We continue to make moves that lay the foundation to increase competition in a converged 5G world and as we join forces with Sprint. First, we launched our Home Internet pilot. We expect to deliver speeds of up to 50 megabits per second initially and paving the way for a 5G experience of up to 1 gigabit per second. If ever there was a business that could use a good uncarriering it\u2019s this one. No annual service contracts, no hidden fees and no equipment cost. Sound familiar? You probably also notice, we took a next step in the TV space for the launch of TVision Home. This product starts as an upgraded and rebranded Layer3 TV launching in eight big cities, but core to our strategy is that TVision will be mobile based and work with apps, hardware and services that people already use. So we will have more to say about TV later this year. And we continue our launch innovative new products for customers too. Just last week we introduced T-Mobile MONEY, a no fee interest earning mobile first checking account for the millions of under bank Americans tired of bank fees. As more and more Americans manage their money on their smartphones, we saw an opportunity as the uncarrier to address another consumer pain point and create a new value proposition. Also, we continued to expand our 4G LTE coverage and deliver industry-leading network performance. Our network now covers approximately 326 million Americans with 4G LTE. And now we have 600 megahertz and 700 megahertz low band spectrum deployed to 304 million people across the country. In terms of 4G LTE speeds for 21 quarters in a row, we delivered the fastest combined average of download and upload speeds. Our engineering team is hard at work building the foundation for America\u2019s first real nationwide 4G network with an aggressive build out of 600 megahertz spectrum, which we expect to be ready next year as well as millimeter wave. Our 600 megahertz LTE deployment is on equipment that\u2019s 5G ready. And we continue to make incredible progress since getting our hands on the spectrum. Almost 3,500 cities and towns in 44 states and Puerto Rico alive with LTE on 600 megahertz today, well ahead of expectations. And we have 4,600 megahertz capable devices in our lineup today including the new iPhones. We plan to launch 5G on 600 megahertz as soon as we have compatible smart phones in the second half of this year. And if our merger with Sprint is approved, we will get access to unmatched available mid-band spectrum for 5G, which will result in a uniquely powerful 5G network with eight times the capacity by 2024 of the combined standalones today and 15 times average speeds by 2024 verses today. We certainly watched Verizon\u2019s 5G launch experiment on millimeter wave spectrum in tiny pockets of two cities with interest. Not surprisingly, customers are having a hard time finding a signal. And probably not just because Verizon won\u2019t publish a coverage map. And I won\u2019t even get into that trickery AT&T is using with customers on 5GE. While they both are pursuing 5G BS, we think 5G should be for everyone, everywhere. Having 5G on 600 megahertz in terms of coverage and adding Sprint spectrum for broad capacity will be a true game changer and will turn New T-Mobile into the undisputed 5G leader, not only in the U.S. but around the world. We remained very confident in our outlook for 2019 and it\u2019s reflected in our guidance that Braxton will review in a minute. Okay, let me give you a quick update on the progress of our pending merger with Sprint. Nearly one year ago to the day, we announced our groundbreaking merger. We spent the last 12 months sharing our story and laying out the facts and proof about how the New T-Mobile will deliver the nation\u2019s first broad and deep nationwide 5G network supercharged competition in wireless and beyond and create thousands of American jobs starting on day one. We continue to work through the regulatory review process and believe that we are in the final innings of a process that we have a great deal of respect for. We\u2019ve completed a number of major milestones and we remain optimistic and confident that with the substantial facts in the record before them, the regulators will recognize that this merger is good for consumers. We continue to have a productive dialogue with both federal and state regulatory authorities. So I wanted to highlight a few milestones since our last earnings call. On March 6, we made a filing with the FCC laying out our plans to bring competition to the home broadband market with a target to serve 9.5 million U.S. households by 2024. On April 4, the FCC resumed its non-binding shot clock, which now stands a day 143, which is currently expected to conclude on June 3. At the state level, we\u2019ve received 16 of the required 19 state public utility commission approvals, including the New York PSC. We are making progress in the process with California PUC having reached an agreement with the California Emerging Technology Fund on April 8. On January 30, we announced plans following the closing of the merger to build five New T-Mobile customer experience centers, creating at least 5,000 American jobs. We\u2019ve announced three locations today, including Overland Park, Kansas, Greater Rochester area or Upstate New York and Kingsburg, California area. I can\u2019t wait to create the New T-Mobile and truly take it to the entrenched players in wireless cable and beyond. Make no mistake. Opponents of this transaction are desperate to maintain the status quo, all to the detriment of their customers and for their own benefit. New T-Mobile will be the number three wireless player with the number one network and will aggressively compete by giving more to customers all while asking them to pay less. On the regulatory front, I\u2019m pleased with the progress we have made on our merger and the process so far and I still expect regulatory approval from the DOJ and the FCC in the first half of this year. Okay. To wrap up, I couldn\u2019t be more excited about our performance in Q1 2019 and our guidance shows that we expect our momentum to continue in 2019. The combination with Sprint means that we\u2019ll be able to create a future that is even more exciting for American consumers. Okay, Braxton, you\u2019re going to take us through the financial results, the details of our guidance. So let\u2019s take a closer look. Braxton Carter : Thanks, John. And I\u2019m so excited to be here for another amazing quarter at T-Mobile. Net income amounted to $908 million and diluted earnings per share at $1.06, up 35% and 36% year-over-year respectively. Net income benefited from higher operating income and lower interest expense. The effective tax rate amounted to 24.5%. The tax rate was lower in Q1 due to the higher excess tax benefits related to our equity compensation and lower state taxes. For 2019 as a whole, we continue to expect the effective tax rates in the range of 26% to 27%. Note that, net income and EPS were fully burdened by the Sprint merger related costs of $93 million and $0.11 per share after taxes respectively in the first quarter. These costs $113 million before taxes are excluded from adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA amounted to a record $3.3 billion, up 11% and included leasing revenues of $161 million versus $171 million in the prior year. The adjusted EBITDA performance as a reflection of strong cost management. Cost of service as a percentage of service revenue decreased by 170 basis points year-over-year, despite the rapid rollout of 600 megahertz spectrum. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to lower lease expense associated with adoption of the new lease standard and lower regulatory program costs, offsetting the higher costs from the network build. While costs of services decreased this quarter, we still expect significant increases in future quarters, due to the ramp up in our 600 megahertz build out. SG&A as a percentage of service revenues increased by 110 basis points year-over-year, excluding the Sprint merger related costs, SG&A decreased by 30 basis points year-over-year, despite the headwind from the amortization or commissions from the new revenue recognition standard relative to last year. Free cash flow decreased by 7% year-over-year to $618 million, primarily due to a 41% increase in cash CapEx. As we have flagged in our last earnings call, we expect CapEx to be front end loaded this year. Also free cash flow in Q1 included $34 million in merger related cash costs. Excluding these merger related costs, free cash flow would have been $652 million. Branded Postpaid Phone ARPU amounted to $46.07 in Q1, down 1.3% year-over-year. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in regulatory program revenues from the continued adoption of tax inclusive plans, a reduction in certain non-recurring charges and the growing success of new customer segments and rate plans including T-Mobile for business, as well as the impact on the ongoing growth in our Netflix offering, partially offset by higher premium service revenues per subscriber and a net reduction in promotional activities. The impact of the ongoing growth in our Netflix offering decreased postpaid phone ARPU by $0.27 year-over-year. For full year 2019, we still expect Branded Postpaid Phone ARPU to remain generally stable compared to the full year 2018 with a range of plus or minus 1%. Even with the year-over-year ARPU decrease growth and branded postpaid revenues accelerated to 8.3% in Q1 compared to an 8% growth in Q4. This was partially offset by branded prepaid revenues, which decrease 0.7%, due to slower customer growth and the impact of promotions. In terms of customer quality, our results in the first quarter continued to be strong. Total bad debt expense and losses from sale receivables were $108 million or 0.98% of total revenues compared to $106 million or 1.01% in the first quarter of 2018. So let\u2019s get to 2019 guidance. We expect branded postpaid net customer additions to now be between 3.1 and 3.7 million, significantly up from our prior guidance of 2.6 to 3.6 million. This guidance takes into account our long-term strategy to balance growth and profitability, a continuation of the lower switcher volume we\u2019ve seen in recent quarters, and our pursuit of growth adjacencies.We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $12.7 billion to $13.2 billion unchanged from prior guidance. This guidance takes into account leasing revenues of $600 million to $700 million in 2019. It also takes into account our network expansion, in particular the 600 MHz and 5G rollouts. Pre-close merger related costs are still expected to be $350 million to $500 million in 2019, depending on timing of the potential close. For Q2 alone, we expect Sprint merger related costs of $200 million to $250 million, a significant increase from Q1. These costs will be excluded from adjusted EBITDA, but will impact net income and cash flows. We target cash CapEx of $5.4 billion to $5.7 billion, excluding capitalized interest, which is expected to amount to approximately $400 million in 2019. This is also unchanged from our prior guidance. CapEx will continue to be front-end loaded with Q2 expected to be a slight step down from Q1 levels. Finally, we expect free cash flow to increase at the three-year CAGR of 46% to 48% from full year 2016 to full year 2019, unchanged from our prior range. Our free cash flow CAGR guidance does not assume any material net cash outflows from securitization going forward and it excludes merger costs from the cash basis. Well, let\u2019s get to your questions. As during last quarter\u2019s earnings call, I would ask you to focus your questions on our operational results. Also we cannot answer any questions related to the current millimeter wave options due to the quiet period around these options. You can ask questions via phone or via Twitter. We\u2019ll start with a question on the phone. Operator, first question, please. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from Philip Cusick with JPMorgan. Philip Cusick : Two simple ones, if I can. Mike, can you talk about where we\u2019re in the process of expanding the 4G network and distribution in the areas where you don\u2019t have 700 megahertz spectrum? And then Braxton, can you talk about just simply what was EBITDA growth on an apples \u2013 thus for ASC 606 and lease accounting? Thank you. Mike Sievert : Phil, on the first one, I think we\u2019ve reported in the past we\u2019ve done a major distribution expansion, it is generally followed the expansion of the network. It\u2019s fairly agnostic to low-band versus mid-band. What it looks at is whether or not in that marketable area. We have sufficient coverage and enough households to be able to get two wall indoor coverage. And if we have enough households in that area with very high quality coverage, then we launched distribution and that can be through low-band, mid-band or a combination thereof. And so the POP coverage close and then the distribution coverage close. We\u2019ve now got distribution coverage to well north of 265 million people. And that\u2019s a big milestone from when we started talking about this a couple of years ago and told you about geographic expansion. And that says two things, number one, the geographic expansion starting to work, because this is an initiative that we\u2019ve been talking about for some time. We told you it takes 12 months to 18 months for those stores to become productive. We\u2019re starting to see some of the results of that, which is terrific. And second, there is a lot of runway left. As we create more and more conditions where that\u2019s the case, particularly in the context of the New T-Mobile where we can create a game changing experience in more rural areas, there\u2019s lots of runway left in both scenarios. Philip Cusick : Can you help of filling some of the impact there, Mike for the quarter, over the last few quarters? Mike Sievert : Only to say it\u2019s contributing. And that it takes 12 months to 18 months for those stores to start producing. And that our experience has been that\u2019s a most productive expansion investments we\u2019ve made have been in Greenfield areas, pretty intuitive, small towns, suburban fringe, those areas have out produced, the expansions, we did to add density in the urban cores. Our urban cores are our most productive areas by far, but of course there\u2019s cannibalization effect as you add distribution density in those areas. And so from a future investment standpoint, you\u2019ll probably see us focused more on suburban fringe and Greenfield markets. Philip Cusick : Okay. Braxton? Braxton Carter : Yes, Phil. I think one of the things that we really pride ourselves transparency and providing investors with all the tools to truly understand the underlying momentum of the business. The new lease standard is fairly de minimis to the overall results. And rev rec, certainly has several moving items with it, but not overly material. I would just point you to our Q and to our Factbook for quantification of those items. Philip Cusick : Thank you. Mike Sievert : Operator? Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Michael Rollins of Citi. Michael Rollins : Thanks. Two if I could. First, talk a little bit more about what you\u2019re seeing on the ARPU front and the competitive environment for pricing more broadly. And second, can you give us an update on how you\u2019re thinking about bundles within the category, especially in the context of your current Netflix promotion and what you\u2019re starting to launch with Layer3? Thanks. Mike Sievert : So couple things, one is overall, this was another quarter of pretty good competitive intensity. And everybody has different lens on it. I can tell you that in a quarter where we think we took 88% of all of the postpaid phone net adds and help to drive AT&T and Verizon both in the negative territory. It shows that whether it\u2019s a \u2013 you define it as a more modestly competitive quarter or whether you define it as a more intensely competitive quarter. I would imagine it sure felt intense over there at those places. For us, it was just another quarter of delivering what you\u2019ve come to expect us to deliver regardless of the condition. So I\u2019m really pleased with that. And then Mike, you had a second question, it was about bundling. Listen, bundling, it depends on what you mean by bundling. If what you mean by bundling is that will give you a decent deal on the core product only if you buy a bunch of other stuff, you don\u2019t really want. No, we\u2019re not going to do bundling. That\u2019s the game plan that AT&T pursues. You can only get a fair deal a lot of the time depending on how they post their promotions. On their core wireless product, when you take a bunch of prep on satellite TV that you don\u2019t want. Now on the other hand, if you\u2019re asking are we going to plunge ourselves into home broadband with a disruptive offer in the New T-Mobile absolutely we are. Are we going to augment that with TV offers that range from full line cable TV replacement, some more disruptive lower price offers? Absolutely, we\u2019re going to do that. We\u2019re going to offer those in concert with wireless and create value propositions that are attractive to consumers. Yes, that\u2019s what the uncarrier does. So it all comes down to what do you mean by bundling. Braxton Carter : Well, he was confused. He was referring to what AT&T does, which is bungling. Hey Mike, let me add a couple things on the ARPU. I think first and foremost, you\u2019re seeing very clearly that we\u2019re reiterating our guidance, relating to ARPU. And if you look back to last two years, we\u2019ve been at the low end of that guidance obviously. And the underlying theory here with the uncarrier we have much more terminal value on lock by not trying to monetize the existing customer base, but by scaling this business, which we\u2019ve done exceptionally well at over the last six years and ultimately that\u2019s what\u2019s creating value. The progress in service revenues and the significant increases in service revenues, you would not be that if you had a strategy of monetizing and raising ARPUs, you\u2019re certainly going to have less volume. And the way that we translate that into profitability and then free cash flow, it\u2019s a much more powerful way to build the business. And our strategy here has been the same strategy that we\u2019ve been executing really through the whole life of T-Mobile. But it\u2019s important to note that we\u2019re bounding it. There\u2019s always a balance between the growth and profitability. And that\u2019s why I think the guidance that we just reiterated today on ARPU is so important. Michael Rollins : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from John Hodulik of UBS. John Hodulik : Great, thanks. Maybe two questions. First, one of the growth initiative, the Home Internet, anything you tell us in terms of the details of the product in terms of whether or not it\u2019s more of a sort of urban based or rural, pricing or caps or any other details you can provide. And then secondly, there\u2019s been some recent filings from Sprint suggesting the company is going through be struggling more than they appear to, I would say to investors. Do those filings suggest or temper your enthusiasm for the deal? Or does it suggest that the company may go through a rougher patch in terms of the integration if you guys are able to close the deal? thanks. John Legere : Take the first half Mike. Mike Sievert : Yes, the first one Home Internet. Think about it as a trial program. What we\u2019re doing is preparing ourselves for the New T-Mobile. The New T-Mobile has big aspirations in this space 5G and that particular capabilities of this New T-Mobile network will allow us to go after 66% or 66 million more than half of all households in the United States. And eventually we \u2013 our plan as John mentioned is to win 9.5 million of those that\u2019s a big deal. That\u2019ll make us one of the biggest broadband providers in the country. So we have to get ready for it and get the learnings even in this 4G era under our belt. So that\u2019s what\u2019s going on. It's really exciting. This is even today in 4G LTE, a 50 megabit per second service. And what we\u2019re doing is essentially allowing customers in a capacity of wire way. So where we think we have the capacity to support very high quality services for them. We\u2019ll accept the applications. And it\u2019s been a very exciting. When they sign on, they save a lot of money. And of course, there\u2019s no need for an in-home visit, no need to wait around all day for a cable tech, et cetera. So it\u2019s very exciting and we\u2019re looking forward to a lot more to coming on that front. John Legere : Yes. I guess on the second question, I guess the only thing I could say, not specifically about any filings that Sprint has, but I can say in the one year since we announced the deal, and all of the work that we\u2019d done, all the due diligence we\u2019ve done, all of the integration planning that we\u2019ve done. Our enthusiasm for the opportunity is greater than it\u2019s ever been. Our belief in the size of the synergy pool and the power of the network when you put them together, the impact on 5G for the country, the positive nature on jobs, the expansion into rural and in-home broadband has gone up. So if you take all aspects of what we\u2019ve learned and done in our diligence as well as our work with the FCC and the DOJ. One year later, we\u2019re more enthusiastic and more excited about the coming together of these companies than we were one year ago. John Hodulik : Got it. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Simon Flannery : Great. Thank you very much. Neville, I had a blog post a couple of days ago talking about the importance of low, mid and high-band spectrum you\u2019ve talked a lot about the mid-band importance. But can you expound a little bit more on the 600? I think you said you\u2019d have some 5G devices later this year. On a kind of go-to-market basis, what can we expect to see in terms of being a competitive 5G offering with the sort of spectrum position you have there. And maybe John, you can just update us on supporting activity you\u2019ve seen recently. Thank you. John Legere : And I would just reintroduce Neville Ray as the adult in the 5G room. Neville Ray : Hopefully, you enjoyed the blogs on. So a few words on the importance of 600 megahertz and just to try and enable folks to understand where we are. John provided a lot of stats on the 600 rollout. And I remind you again that, as we\u2019re rolling out 600 megahertz, we\u2019re using 5G capable radio. So obviously we\u2019re taking new software on a regular basis, the 5G softwares coming in heavy and fast. But here we are today, we\u2019ve got over 1 million square miles of 600 megahertz LTE rolled out for across I\u2019m working in 44 states and Puerto Rico. And we have a 100 million covered POPs on 600 megahertz LTE. So we\u2019ve said that in 2020, we\u2019ll have a nationwide footprint on 5G. And as we look at our launch environment, when we get the terminals in the second half of 2019, we\u2019re going to be lighting up an enormous footprint on 5G, an enormous footprint on 600 megahertz. And we have a lot of spectrum as you point out. We were incredibly successful in the auction, which seems like yesterday, that was two years ago. And we intend to put down a very large three, four lane highway across the U.S. with 600 megahertz. And I think it\u2019s going to be in stark contrast to the pockets of 5G that are out there today and very, very limited from AT&T and Verizon. And Verizon maybe doing more cities, but it seems to be a handful of sites in very urban environments with very limited range. And we\u2019re not sitting there just throwing rocks at millimeter wave. We believe in millimeter wave, but \u2013 and we will launch millimeter wave services ourselves. But I can tell you now the software is not mature. We continue to work with the same equipment and software as the Verizon guys have decided to launch and even have the goal to ask their customers to pay $10 bucks more a month to access wherever they could find it. I believe they pulled that back today. They\u2019ve pulled back the $10 price like they were trying to force on people, but comparing contrast tens of millions of covered POPs with 5G to handfuls. That\u2019s the excitement and scale of what we love to do with 5G. Not in 2020, but in 2019. And as soon as we can get those devices onto \u2013 and into our customer\u2019s hands, we will. John Legere : I just editorialize, I\u2019ve been doing this a long time, I\u2019ve never seen a team move as fast to deploy spectrum as an excellent team that moved on this 600. Yes, we use to think that we are now across 3,500 cities and towns in 44 states and Puerto Rico, 1 million square miles of territory with 600 and all of that already 5G compatible. We talk about being the first one to be nationwide next year, a lot of times that\u2019s defined as 200 million, maybe we\u2019ll march past that. But here we are in April of 2019 already having accomplished that kind of a milestone. It\u2019s amazing. So the second half of the question, I\u2019ll just \u2013 brief on one of our agile the pieces of data that we pull at each quarter in belt, postpaid porting is a piece of data that\u2019s just a small part of the way we look at our business. But a very positive one, it was about 1.89, call 1.9 for the quarter up 20 basis points year-over-year. So that should \u2013 and so that part of the question. Simon Flannery : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson. Craig Moffett : Hi, thank you. Neville, if I could, I\u2019m going to stay with the spectrum related questions for a minute. First in John\u2019s comments when he was talking about the speeds that you could achieve with your 600 network, correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but I think that was including the 2.5 gigahertz spectrum. Just based on the rollout of on the 600, what kind of speeds do you think you can deliver with your 5G network on your existing spectrum? And then in the event that the merger didn\u2019t provide you with the 2.5 gigahertz spectrum, how do you think about satisfying the need for additional mid-band? Neville Ray : Yes. So a bunch of questions within the question that Craig, I mean clearly there\u2019s nobody more excited in the room than me around what we can achieve with a combination of Sprint and T-Mobile in the New T-Mobile. And I talked the lengths are about what we can do with 600 megahertz and obviously, as we light up, think about just on a standalone basis, lighting up 30 megahertz nationwide on top of the assets that we\u2019ve deployed today. So speeds are absolutely going to move from the 30, 35 net averages, they that exist in the network today, into the 60s and 70s peak speeds are going to move well north probably not quite doubling where we are today, but into the hundreds of megabits per second. That\u2019s achievable, right. As you combine an aggregate, the 600 megahertz in with the mid-band spectrum that we have. So that\u2019s a very interesting proposition. But it fails in comparison to what we can do with the New T-Mobile. And the rollout that we can achieve with 2.5 gigahertz and especially the amount of spectrum mid-band spectrum that we can push into 5G early, and address this need of mid-band 5G, which the world \u2013 the rest of the world is running with. Craig as you know, here in the U.S., we have this mid-band dilemma. We can solve that with the combination of T-Mobile and Sprint, and really move forward with a tremendous 5G experience with breadth and depth and all of the data and the fact points that John pointed out earlier in the messaging. So that\u2019s the piece I\u2019m focused on. Obviously on a standalone basis, it\u2019s a different world. But then that\u2019s us and AT&T and Verizon and everybody else trying to figure out how do we move to that next level of performance with 5G in a world where the mid-band spectrum that\u2019s needed to really drive that is not coming from auctions or from other sources in any real timeframe that\u2019s comfortable for anybody. But the combination of T-Mobile and Sprint creates that mid-band opportunity in a way that cannot be created in the U.S. marketplace over the coming years. That\u2019s what\u2019s so unique and exciting about the opportunity. And Craig, that\u2019s where I spend my time. I\u2019m thinking about that piece. I know we\u2019ve got a very strong network. I\u2019m adding a lot of 600 megahertz, a new spectrum to the asset that we have. So a lot of confidence there, but the excitement and the thing that we long for and look forward to is this combination of the Sprint. Craig Moffett : All right. Very clear, thank you. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Jonathan Chaplin of New Street Research. Vivek Stalam : Hi guys, it\u2019s Vivek Stalam on for Jonathan. Two if I could. First, how do you think about a potential deal structures where it\u2019s really focused on the network side and maybe the separate retail assets continue to exist? And then on the standalone company, I mean, how low can churn go? And should we still think about you guys eventually reaching those old Verizon like 70 basis points churn numbers or is there some other benchmark you\u2019re looking at? John Legere : I can start with the second one. We don\u2019t guide on churn, but I can tell you in the context of the New T-Mobile, we have \u2013 there\u2019s no reason to believe that ultimately when you have a superior network to Verizon, better customer service than Verizon and lower prices than Verizon, that we shouldn\u2019t be able to ultimately achieve churn below Verizon. And this quarter, we were four bips away from them and below AT&T for the second quarter in a row. And that\u2019s just where we are today as standalone T-Mobile. So we\u2019re really excited about the prospects. We see an ongoing improving trend here as the network continues to be built out as well as we may continue to progress in underpenetrated segments, some of which churn at lower rates like older Americans, like large enterprises. And so there\u2019s room left to go. And on your first part of your question, it\u2019s hard to be clear. This deal as structured we believe is pro consumer and pro competition and as the regulators continue and finish their review process, that will be approved. So you\u2019re referring to alternate universes are structures that I have no reason to think about at this point in time. I feel very good about the deal as its structured and as its being reviewed. Vivek Stalam : Got it, thanks. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Brett Feldman : Thanks for taking the question. You obviously had a pretty strong phone net add number in the quarter. I think what was interesting, not just that you cheated on cash flow churn, but obviously you didn\u2019t need to have as high a level of gross adds in order to hit that. And I wonder if you could sort of talk through around that mean could you choose to be less aggressive in the market, because your churn had come down so much. And you said this is a great opportunity to grow, but to do it with more offering leverage or was the opportunity in the market just a little less attractive to you and it just sort of worked out that you still ended up having a great add number if you understand what I\u2019m trying to get to. Mike Sievert : Sure, Brett. Our strategy all along, Braxton said this for years I think, and so I\u2019ll just repeating something he\u2019s probably told you in the past, which is on every quarter since we\u2019ve done this, we could have grown at a faster rate than we actually grew. What we always do through the quarter as we make real time game day calls as to what do we need to do to be able to deliver on the aspirations in our business plans. And we always keep growth and profitability and balanced, because we\u2019ve been at this long enough that we believe that we need to be making financial progress at the same rate we\u2019re making customer growth progress, so that our shareholders are benefiting from all this growth. And so that\u2019s different than saying we were deliberate or thoughtful in advance and/or held back or something like that. It\u2019s just saying day in, day out, we certainly have levers we could do that would grow faster, but we\u2019re achieving our business plan, which is balanced, financial results and customer growth results. John Legere : I think we\u2019ve said it many times, when you look at six years of adding more than a million customers all the time rooted in a brand that\u2019s unparalleled right now. The brand, the people, the network, the customer care experience, the value proposition, it\u2019s sort of like if you look at each quarter, we\u2019re able to step up to the plate and it doesn\u2019t matter if they throw a curve ball or slider or a fastball, we adjust and we not that ball out of the park. And I think we\u2019re very proud of the various ways that the markets have been described by our competitors yet that are focused on our customers in our business consistently delivers with the right shareholder value. So we\u2019re very proud of that. Brett Feldman : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll take the next question from Ric Prentiss of Raymond James. Ric Prentiss : Thanks, good afternoon, guys. I wanted to go back. John, you\u2019ve mentioned the California Emerging Technology Fund had signed on with the deal. Can you talk to us a little bit about what they found interesting in the deal and what they wanted to see from you guys as far as what the deal might entail to help make California see success in it? John Legere : Is there any content you\u2019re saying that, Mike. Mike Sievert : Yes, we were \u2013 anybody can tell that we were able to reach agreement with them some weeks ago, and they\u2019re looking at the public interest in the state around issues like, will you really built this network. Are we going to make investments in underserved communities in the state? What\u2019s the picture look like on jobs in the state? So they\u2019re trying to take a broad lens on public interest benefits and make sure that we put our money where our markets. And so we\u2019re able to reach agreement about making investments in the state that benefit particularly less advantaged consumers in the state, and we also made firm commitments about what kinds of investments we would make in the network in order to accomplish the public good that this merger talks about, which is a broad and deep 5G network, it has more capacity and therefore serves California and better in drives prices down. So those are the general topics that we covered. John Legere : I think it\u2019s been fascinating year and you\u2019ve talked about California but the discussions with California very similar to the discussions that we\u2019ve had with every constituent, including the Senate and the Congress, you enter an environment where the strongest proponents of the deal or those opposed to the deal are talking about the exact same issues. And they\u2019re relative to \u2013 will you build the network out? What will the 5G network deliver for the country? What will happen with prices? What will happen with the offers that have on rural America? Will you really enter in home broadband? What will happen with jobs? And all of these are things that in our filings, in our business plans under oath and testimony, we have clearly stated benefits and in some cases, with the states, we\u2019re working individually with them on the items that are very important for them. So the lot of constituents involved, but all of the questions and all of the concerns are easily answered by a transaction like this that has so much pro-competitive and pro-consumer output and something it\u2019s just a matter of explaining that. And if need be, which we\u2019re perfectly willing to do in many fashions commit to it. Neville Ray : I just have one dimension just underlying the statement on rural and that\u2019s clearly been something of intense interest on how this deal can better serve the rural Californians and bring really great wireless service and through how broadband competition that\u2019s been an area of in tensed our login. I think, we\u2019re \u2013 as we\u2019ve said, very excited about those opportunities and not just California, but across the nation. John Legere : I like the fun part, Neville, I would say what we have the opportunity to not just talk about the full integrated New T-Mobile, but what we have an opportunity to discuss pieces of it, to discuss with rural America specifically about them and their pieces, discuss with the state of California. This is truly the most exciting thing that they could hope for and so it\u2019s not a matter of trying to hide anything, it\u2019s such a compelling proposition for every component of this country and for the country in general, the compensations have all been not just good, they border on exciting. Ric Prentiss : Great. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Amy Yong of Macquarie. Amy Yong : Thanks. Maybe two questions if I could. First on service revenue, which grew nicely this quarter. How do we think about that trend going forward? I think, industry wide, it seems like that number is decelerating, throughout the year. And my second question is back on the bundle. Can you talk about TVision Home and your eventual plans for it? I think the price points that came outward a little bit high versus the comments that you just made. Thanks. Braxton Carter : On the service revenue, Amy, again, it\u2019s a testament to the fantastic momentum this business has from a gross standpoint. Any seasonal quarter, be it an intensely competitive quarter, be it a quarter were certain people aren\u2019t quite as intense. We day in and day out deliver significant growth in service revenue, which is one of the few key foundational principles of the strategy that we\u2019re driving. And that\u2019s when the contacts of the ARPU guidance that we\u2019ve given generally stable a plus or minus 1%. And that trend will absolutely continue in all expectations. And you also have to remember that when you\u2019re looking at as a percentage increase, we\u2019re not comping periods, where you had significant decreases. It\u2019s an ever growing \u2013 ever increasing amount of service revenue that we continue to lead the industry in quarter-after-quarter for many, many years in revenue growth. That\u2019 s one of the rural differentiated things about a T-Mobile. And with the strategies that are being deployed with the growth adjacencies, T-Mobile for business, we\u2019re just hitting it on all cylinders. And when you \u2013 yes, that\u2019s before we get to the promise of 5G and IoT and the amazing things that are going to come on that. So yes, our expectations are significant sustain long-term service revenue growth. Mike Sievert : I was just intrigued by part of the question that was about industry decline in service revenue growth, when the industry outside of T-Mobile has been declining for three or four years. So they probably have one quarter of something positive, but there is no other player that has sustained revenue growth outside of T-Mobile. Was there a second? Neville Ray : Yes, you were asking about TVision. We\u2019re really happy to get the journey started last month. And we are now in eight of the biggest cities across the country, San Francisco, Philadelphia, New York, LA, Chicago, Dallas, et cetera. With a full cable replacement product, it\u2019s sort of where we\u2019ve starting the journey. And that\u2019s 275 channels of high def cable and 4K content and on demand content, personalized DVRs for each person in the family. Amazon, Alexa and Google Voice integration, social media integration, et cetera, et cetera, and it\u2019s priced below what typical people at cable and satellite pay, when they\u2019re beyond that first promotional year. They\u2019re in year two of those multiyear contracts, where you sign up for something and it\u2019s low at first and then you get slammed. And we come in with fair, rational pricing from day one, it saves the money right away versus year two and beyond in those crazy contracts. But it\u2019s the beginning of the journey. And we have a lot more coming in this space, work in the integrated broadband space, because as I said, we\u2019re going after broadband and big way and people need an integrated TV product in that space. So we\u2019re moving down that path and you\u2019ll see more working in concert with broadband. And then mobile and we think there\u2019s a lot of room in mobile in the OTT space, fall through partnerships and through first party offers from us. And we\u2019re very excited about that space. And as I said last time, we\u2019ll have more to say about it later this year. Mike Sievert : So those are the next question, operator. We have a board here, full of questions that are coming in Twitter. And I would just say two things about those. One, is that there is a question from Mike Dano, who said, John and Braxton, would you mind keeping the call today to now, they\u2019ve got some tough schedule this afternoon. So I thought I\u2019d hit that one right off the bat. Thank you for your depth of journalism there. And then I bring that up only because 80% of the rest of the questions are all from Walt Piecyk. So, unfortunately for us, he\u2019s next in the queue, but he\u2019s also dominating our boards. So I would say we take the next question operate and then we wipe this full board of Twitter questions off and move to the next. So operator, next question. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Walter Piecyk of BTIG. Walter Piecyk : John, I\u2019m just trying to help everyone else with their questions so we don\u2019t get another ForEx question on this call. John Legere : Do you want to add [indiscernible] stick with humor? Walter Piecyk : Just I want to go back to the gross add question, which is you can get churn lower and look, obviously service revenue growth accelerated, you\u2019re trying to do this profitably. I\u2019m sure, you can go lower as you pointed out. I think Mike pointed out, but I mean it\u2019s questionable how much lower it can get. So at some point, you have to look at the gross adds right in part of this 600 investment in terms of the spectrum and the network. Again, we didn\u2019t see the network expense this quarter, but I assume Braxton talks about this on the call about network expense going up. Shouldn\u2019t we expect some type of return on those investments in the form of gross add growth. And if not, and we\u2019re kind of diminishing marginal returns on churn, isn\u2019t this going to impact your ability to do exactly what you did this quarter, which was accelerate your revenue growth. That\u2019s the first question. The second one\u2019s for Neville. Neville, you said in the comments you\u2019re bullish about millimeter wave spectrum. I\u2019m just curious if you can give us a little bit more color on that. What applications are you bullish? How far do you think this signal travels and when specifically do you think dynamic spectrum allocation can occur? John Legere : So TV is good, Walt. I think what you meant to say is $0.88 for churn is absolutely incredible. And pay huge dividends, but I\u2019d also like to ask a question about gross adds, I\u2019ll turn that to Mike. And secondly, you have to be careful because Neville simultaneously said he\u2019s bullish on millimeter wave, but bullshit on millimeter wave as an overall 5G strategy. So as to clarify those two. Mike Sievert : The essence of your questions, Walt, was where\u2019s the return on all these investments. And you asked in the context of gross adds, I\u2019d answered in the context of EBITDA, cash flow and profitability. This is another quarter of just blockbuster results on the EBITDA, cash flow and profitability front in excess of what people were expecting of us. And there\u2019s a reason for that, because these investments that we\u2019re making translate into a brand that\u2019s strengthening and strengthening with customers that are more and more satisfied telling their friends at increasing rates, staying longer to the premise of your question. And that\u2019s great for us financially. And that gives us optionality. And what we mentioned earlier to the \u2013 response to the earlier question is, we\u2019ve got a plan that demands a certain amount of growth and we go chase it. And we get together every day and every week and we look at are we trending to that? And if not, we do some doing. And that\u2019s how we make our game day calls. And generally speaking, our quarterly game plan, it\u2019s tuned to the kinds of results you\u2019ve been seeing and we go execute that plan. And with lower churn, we don\u2019t need the same number of gross adds in order to deliver those kinds of blockbuster financial results. Neville? Neville Ray : Let me pick up. So real quick, on millimeter wave, so if you look at where 5G ends up, right. You\u2019re going to need millimeter wave, you\u2019re going to need mid-bands, you\u2019re going to need low-band spectrum. And where does millimeter wave play well, because of its limited propagation and it sure is limited, right. It doesn\u2019t penetrate walls, windows very well. It doesn\u2019t go very far. I mean, we\u2019re deploying, we\u2019re seeing, you get much more than 500, 600 feet away from a small cell. You ain\u2019t really see in much, right. But that said, when you look at the capacity and the types of opportunities we\u2019re thinking about delivering with 5G, millimeter wave can play well in those dense urban environments and places within those dense urban environments. But it doesn\u2019t solve the 5G story, especially not, in the 3 million-plus square miles of the U.S. and that\u2019s where the need for mid and low-band spectrum comes in. That\u2019s critical to set out around the rest of the world is really looking to figure out. Now how do we get out to this mid-band thing as we are with Sprint super, super fast? Because it\u2019s way, way more economic to deploy mid-band 5G spectrum on existing cell grid. Then it is to try and deploy literally hundreds and hundreds of thousands of millimeter wave small cells to give you some form of contiguous coverage and experience. So millimeter wave, we starting to mature horizons just launched, way too early. I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s up with those guys. They did the fixed thing, the WTF stuff we call it, last year, it\u2019s been consigned to the trash kind of history almost before they\u2019ve even launched it. So now they\u2019re back with 5G and R too early on millimeter wave. And we\u2019re all seeing the awful propagation that comes from software and spectrum that\u2019s launch too early for real customer uptake and using. And it will get somewhat better, right, as new loads of software come in and the beam forming those capabilities are established and real. But they\u2019re not real yet. So that\u2019s part of the compounding problem. So real quick on dynamic spectrum sharing. So what is that allows us in a fixed block of spectrum to not just dedicate that spectrum to LTE or say 5G as we have to today. It will allow us to have a mix of customers supported in that block. So super cool feature, something the industry has been working on for awhile. It\u2019s coming next year and obviously, I paid close attention to the Verizon CEO\u2019s comments on this, on that call earlier in the week. But the fact of it is what, it doesn\u2019t create any new spectrum. So there\u2019s no magic capacity comes out the dynamic spectrum sharing. You have the same spectrum at the end as you started with, so trying to pitch the dynamic spectrum sharing was how you would address, the depth of spectrum you have for mid and low band 5G rollout. Those two things just don\u2019t compute, and the technical folks understand that fully. I don\u2019t get me wrong\u2026 Walter Piecyk : But Neville, would not let them then deal with the coverage issues that they have today in terms of 5G and R, where they wouldn\u2019t need new mid-band spectrum, they could theoretically just flip it back and forth, use the mid-band to get the coverage that they\u2019re lacking with this millimeter wave deployment. John Legere : Well, they have to make a start somewhere on 5G, right. And the interesting piece is to get a dynamic spectrum sharing, you\u2019ll deploy new radio. So I am yet to hear anybody in Verizon declare that they are deploying new radio in low band or mid band. There\u2019s some very limited backwards compatibility on very recently deployed radio for DSS. And if you want to use DSS, you are effectively committing in the same breath to rolling out 5G in mid and low band. I haven\u2019t heard that yet as a declared strategy for a Verizon. I think it\u2019s the minimum and best set that they need to start with. Yes, it\u2019s going to help the introduction of 5G services for everybody, especially those that don\u2019t have spectrum and volume like we do, but in no way does that offset or match what we\u2019re looking to do with new T-Mobile. We are going to dedicate tens into hundreds of megahertz of spectrum in mid-band towards 5G that does not exist in the Verizon portfolio and dynamic spectrum share and believe me does not get you there. Mike Sievert : Also I\u2019d like to add \u2013 thank you for asking an open ended network question. Walter Piecyk : Sorry. Sorry, thanks guys. Mike Sievert : One takeaway I take from all that discussion is that it doesn\u2019t matter if the new technology is there that lets you aggregate 4G and 5G. The experience just isn\u2019t going to be great unless the mid-band layer is at 5G. And that\u2019s what\u2019s so differentiating about the new T-Mobile strategy. John Legere : Okay, operator, we\u2019re going to take one final question, please. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll take our last question from Mike McCormick of Guggenheim Partners. Mike McCormick : Hey, guys, thanks. And John, I love the biker jacket, we need to sell those in the stores. Anyways, Braxton, could you just sort of reconcile the sub-guide improvement versus the non-EBITDA guide improvement? Is that just reinvestment is being conservative? How do we think about that sort of conversion into EBITDA? And then secondly, I guess for Neville, maybe just reconcile your comments on the spectrum side because you made it sound as though the primary and secondary markets won\u2019t come soon enough for you. And yet in the write up there is a comment about looking at both of those avenues. And then lastly for Neville just on the 600 megahertz build out, what\u2019s the experience sort of the number of towers or nodes required and certainly comparing that against what 2.5 might require? Braxton Carter : Yeah, so to start out, our playbook and we are conservative in our guidance. We have a history of stepping into higher and higher growth guidance as a year goes by. And the deeper we get into the year, there\u2019s certainly opportunity and potential to step into higher EBITDA guidance. From a pure reconciliation standpoint, we\u2019re not guiding by quarter. We\u2019re giving you an annual outlook and when you look at the acquisition costs associated with bringing those net adds on, anything you do in the tail end of the year, you\u2019re not going to get paid back. So it\u2019s actually going to be decretive or dilutive to EBITDA. Now compare \u2013 on the other side, over performance at the very beginning of the year certainly pays back during the year. So it\u2019s really the timing of when that happens. And again, we don\u2019t take it down to that level of granularity, but I\u2019ll just go back to the same statement I started with. We\u2019ve played a conservative playbook, everybody knows it, states in and watched the further progression of development with the T-Mobile as we go quarter by quarter. John Legere : Okay, Neville? Neville Ray : Yeah, super, super quick. So on 6 \u2013 reverse order Mike, so 600 megahertz deployment, I mean we\u2019re not quite doing a one on one overlay, but we are deploying pretty heavily. So, there\u2019s literally tens \u2013 and tens of thousands of sites that will receive 600 megahertz, not all this year obviously. But we are doing a very heavy deployment on 600. On spectrum, my comments are looking at \u2013 if you look \u2013 again what we can do with Sprint and T-Mobile combined and the new T-Mobile and how quickly we can commit very large volumes of mid-band spectrum to 5G. There\u2019s nothing on the primary secondary markets that can match that. If you look at the auction environments, yes, the FCC is working hard on new mid-band spectrum, the CBRS coming, but it\u2019s got it sharing issues. It\u2019s a small volume of spectrum. Rest of the world is pushing in 300 megahertz plus across three carriers, 100 megahertz a piece open now, right. If you look at Chinese market, Korea, that\u2019s a lot of spectrum. And the only thing that comes close to feeding that would be the C-band and \u2013 as we all know that\u2019s several years out. So, the real opportunities \u2013 the massive opportunity with our deal is to fill that spectrum gap, especially over the next two to three years and bring material 5G with that breadth and depth of experience that mid-band can deliver that can\u2019t get delivered with the other assets. Mike McCormick : Great, thanks guys. John Legere : Okay. Operator : Sure. John Legere : I want to thank everyone for tuning in today for another great quarter at T-Mobile and we very much look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Have a great evening. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the T-Mobile Us first quarter 2019 earnings call. If you have any further questions, you may contact the investor relations or media departments. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect and have a pleasant day.",

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Nils Paellmann, Head of Investor Relations for T-Mobile US. Please go ahead, sir. Nils Paellmann : Yes. Thank you very much. Welcome to our second quarter 2019 earnings call. With me today are John Legere, our CEO; Mike Sievert, our President and COO; Braxton Carter, our CFO; and other members of the senior leadership team. Let me briefly read the disclaimer. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements that include projections and statements about our future financial operating results, our plans, the benefits we expect to receive from the proposed merger with Sprint and other statements that are not historical facts. Such statements are based upon the current beliefs and expectations of our management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties outside of our control that could cause our actual results to differ materially, including the risk factors set forth in our annual report on Form 10-K and our quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Reconciliations between GAAP and the non-GAAP results we discuss on this call can be found in the Quarterly Results section of Investor Relations page of our website. In addition, in connection with the proposed transaction on July 30, 2018, we filed a registration statement on Form S4 with the SEC related to the merger. The registration statement became effective on October 29, 2018 and is available on the new T-Mobile website. It contains important information about T-Mobile and Sprint, the merger and related matters. With that, let me turn it over to John Legere. John Legere : Okay. Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to T-Mobile second quarter 2019 earnings call and twitter conference coming to you live from Bellevue, Washington. We certainly have a lot to talk about today, and I'm going to start with some big news regarding our merger with Sprint, then I'm going to take you through our second quarter earning highlights before handing it over to CFO, Braxton Carter, to jump into financials and guidance. After that, we will certainly take some questions. I'm sure you all saw the headlines out of the Department of Justice today that we took a huge step forward in our efforts to gain regulatory approval for the new T-Mobile by entering into a consent decree with the DOJ and by announcing several agreements with DISH. Let me just take a moment and give you a little color on this truly monumental news. First, the consent decree with the DOJ removes a huge hurdle for this merger to proceed while delivering on the key benefits of the merger that we announced in April 2018. We are going to create a bigger and bolder competitor with a transformative 5G network, while delivering an unprecedented $43 billion in synergies. It's important to point out that the target synergies, the profitability and long-term cash generation have not changed for the new T-Mobile. I want to say that while this process took longer than we had hoped, our goal was to ensure that the DOJ's concerns were addressed and make sure that we still deliver on every aspect of the synergies we promised to unlock, and we did just that. I've been spending a lot of my time in Washington, D.C., and I want to personally thank the teams at the DOJ and the FCC. We also announced today that we have reached agreements with DISH to divest all of Sprint's prepaid businesses at close, including Boost Mobile, Virgin Mobile, and Sprint-branded prepaid customers, as well as Sprint's 800-megahertz spectrum licenses after a 3-year period for aggregate proceeds of $5 billion. Importantly, we are going to keep Sprint's entire 2.5 gigahertz and PCS spectrum, which is so important for fully realizing the 5G efficiencies promised by the merger. Additionally, upon the closing of the divestiture transaction, new T-Mobile will enter into commercial arrangements that will support the transferred prepaid customers and provide DISH wireless customers access to the new T-Mobile network for 7 years. DISH will also have an option to take on leases for certain cell sites and retail locations that are decommissioned by the new T-Mobile, and both parties agreed to discuss how we would get access to some or all of their 600-spectrum to use on our T-Mobile network. The transaction with DISH are contingent upon the successful closing of our merger with Sprint. Now, this is an incredibly important step forward for the new T-Mobile. We're ready to bring this supercharged Un-carrier to consumers and businesses across the country, and this milestone brings us much closer to making that vision a reality for customers everywhere. As a reminder, we already got approval from CFIUS and Team Telecom back in December, and we have received favorable outcomes from 18 of the 19 required state utility commissions, with only the California PUC still outstanding. Very importantly, our commitments to the FCC have resulted in statements of support for our merger by FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, and commissioners Carr and O\u2019Rielly. These commitments include : covering 97% of the U.S. population with 5G in 3 years; and 99% in 6 years; leveraging our 5G network to offer fast and reliable alternative for in-home broadband, including in rural America where it's most needed; divesting Sprint's Boost prepaid business to a serious and credible buyer; and in addition, we affirmed the pricing commitment that ensures the same or better rate plan for the first 3 years following the merger. We remain confident and optimistic about the remaining regulatory steps. We are continuing to work the process with the California PUC and continue to be willing to engage with state AGs who have weighed in on both sides of this transaction, including the state AGs that are party to the recently filed lawsuit. The completion of our merger with Sprint remains subject to the remaining regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. We expect to receive final federal regulatory approval in Q3 and currently anticipate that the merger will be permitted to close in the second half of 2019. Our goal has remained consistent throughout, to continue to share the pro-consumer and pro-competitive benefits of this deal with the American consumer. Now, let's dive into our incredible Q2 results that we put out yesterday. As you've probably seen from the materials we've put out, T-Mobile had another very impressive quarter. We remain focused on driving our business, and we set even more records in Q2, record low churn and record financials, while achieving our best second quarter customer results in years. I am particularly proud of the team's ability to maintain our incredible momentum, while working to complete our merger with Sprint. Most companies would be distracted and take their eye off the ball. And I know there's been a lot of speculation around whether we can get all this done and drive our business. Our Q2 results are the strongest proof yet that this team really can execute. In the interest of time, let's dive right into the details. I've said it before and I'll say it again, this business is all about our customers. 1.8 million total net customers joined the Un-carrier movement in Q2. That makes it a monumental 25 quarters in a row that we've had more than 1 million net adds per quarter. And we added 710,000 branded postpaid phone customers, our best Q2 in 4 years, and we continue to lead the industry, taking two-thirds of expected industry postpaid phone growth, including cable. And we delivered nearly 3.5x more postpaid phone additions than Charter, the next closest competitor. And our growth in postpaid phone net adds accelerated year-over-year and sequentially in what is typically a seasonally slow quarter. These wireless customers are coming and staying longer than ever before. In Q2, we had an all-time record low branded postpaid phone churn of 0.78%, down 17 basis points year-over-year. Not only is this an all-time record low, we're also beating AT&T for the third quarter in a row. This is a real testament to the power of our brand and our achievements in terms of network improvement and providing the best customer care in the industry. We had strong total branded postpaid net additions of 1.1 million, our best ever. Branded prepaid net customer additions were 131,000, the best Q2 in 3 years. This was driven by a great prepaid churn of 3.49%, down 32 basis points year-over-year. Next, I've got to highlight our record financial results. Total revenues increased 4% year-over-year to $11 billion, a record high for Q2. Service revenues hit record highs, reaching $8.4 billion, growing 6% year-over-year; and branded postpaid revenues grew 9%. Net income was a Q2 record at $939 million, up 20% year-over-year; and fully diluted EPS came in at $1.09, up 18%, also a Q record. We hit a record high adjusted EBITDA of $3.5 billion, up 7% year-over-year. Now, we're also taking major steps towards nationwide 5G, while continuing to expand our 4G LTE network coverage and delivering industry-leading performance. Our engineering team is hard at work, aggressively deploying both 600-megahertz and millimeter wave spectrum. Our 600-megahertz spectrum will be the foundation for America's first real nationwide 5G network, which we expect to be ready next year. Almost 6,600 cities and towns in 46 states and Puerto Rico are live with LTE on 600-megahertz today, covering 1.2 million square miles and 156 million POPs. Already, more than 22 million devices on our network are compatible with 600 megahertz. We plan to launch 5G on 600 megahertz on a broad footprint as soon as we have compatible smartphones later this year. And yes, we introduced a 5G on millimeter wave spectrum with our first 5G in 6 markets, big markets, at the end of June, including New York City. And unlike Dumb and Dumber, we published coverage maps for all 6 cities. We also successfully participated in recent FCC millimeter wave options in which we spent $842 million to more than quadruple our average nationwide millimeter wave holdings. We think this spectrum will be a critical ingredient in the 5G layer cake, combining wide channels of low, mid, and high-band spectrum will be a key differentiator for new T-Mobile. Okay. To wrap it up, I couldn't be more excited about our performance in Q2 2019. The pending combination with Sprint means that we'll be able to create a future that is even more exciting for American consumers everywhere, and we're pleased with the agreements announced today. We remain very confident in our outlook for 2019, and that is reflected in our increased guidance, which Braxton will talk you through now. Braxton, take it away. Braxton Carter : Thanks, John. What an incredible time to be a shareholder, stakeholder or employee of T-Mobile US. Net income amounted to $939 million, and diluted earnings per share were $1.09, up 20% and 18% year-over-year, respectively. Net income benefited from higher operating income and lower interest expense. The effective tax rate amounted to 24.4%.  For 2019 as a whole, we now expect an effective tax rate in the range of 25% to 26%. Note that net income and EPS were fully burdened by the Sprint merger-related costs of $175 million and $0.20 per share after tax, respectively, in the second quarter. These costs, $222 million before tax, are excluded from adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA amounted to a record $3.5 billion, up 7% and included leasing revenues of $143 million versus $177 million in the prior year. The adjusted EBITDA performance is a reflection of strong cost management. Cost of service as a percent of service revenues increased by just 30 basis points year-over-year, despite the rapid rollout of 600-megahertz spectrum. As expected, there was a significant sequential ramp in cost of services, due to this rollout, which we expect to continue in the second half of the year. SG&A as a percentage of service revenues increased by 180 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the Sprint merger-related costs, SG&A actually decreased by 20 basis points year-over-year, despite the headwind of $80 million from the amortization of commissions from the new revenue recognition standard relative to last year. Free cash flow increased 51% year-over-year due to $1.2 billion to a 70% increase in net cash provided by operating activities, partially offset by a 10% increase in cash CapEx to $1.8 billion. Free cash flow in Q2 included $151 million of merger-related cash costs. Excluding these merger-related costs, free cash flow would have been $1.3 billion. Branded postpaid phone ARPU amounted to $46.10 in Q2, down 0.9% year-over-year.  We continue to expect full-year branded postpaid phone ARPU to be generally stable, defined as plus to minus 1% relative to last year. In terms of customer quality, our results in the second quarter continued to be outstanding. Total bad debt expense and losses from the sale receivables were $99 million or 0.9% of total revenues compared to $102 million or 0.96% in the second quarter of 2018. Now, let me come to our 2019 guidance. We expect branded postpaid net customer additions to be between 3.5 million and 4 million, up from our prior guidance of 3.1 million to 3.7 million. This guidance takes into account our long-term strategy to balance growth and profitability, a continuation of the lower switcher volume we've seen in recent quarters and our pursuit of growth adjacencies. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $12.9 billion to $13.3 billion, narrowed an increase from the prior guidance range of $12.7 billion to $13.2 billion. This guidance takes into account leasing revenues of $550 million to $600 million in 2019, reduced from our prior guidance of $600 million to $700 million. It also takes into account our network expansion, in particular, the 600 megahertz and 5G rollouts. Pre-close Sprint merger-related costs before taxes are expected to be $150 million to $200 million in the third quarter. These costs will be excluded from adjusted EBITDA but will impact net income and cash flows. We target cash CapEx of $5.4 billion to $5.7 billion, excluding capitalized interest, which is expected to be approximately $400 million in 2019. This is unchanged from our prior guidance range, but we do now expect to be at the very high end of the guidance range. We continue to expect free cash flow to increase at a 3-year CAGR of 46% to 48% from full-year 2016 to full-year 2019, unchanged from the prior range. Our free cash flow CAGR guidance does not assume any material net cash inflows from securitization going forward, and it excludes payments from merger-related costs. Now, let's get to your questions. Please note that we cannot answer any questions related to the upcoming millimeter wave auction, Auction 103, due to the quiet period around this auction. You can ask questions via phone or via Twitter. We will start with the question on the phone. Operator, first question, please. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Brett Feldman : Thanks, and congratulations on the news today. Two quick questions about the deal. The first, it looks like DISH has proposed new build-out conditions on their existing spectrum with the FCC. I'm curious whether any element of your agreement with DISH is contingent on them actually getting those modifications? And then the second is, do you intend to support the Sprint MVNO agreement with Altice on the new T-Mobile network? Thank you. Mike Sievert : Sure. And Brett, I'm not sure I understood your question about what's contingent upon the DISH build-outs. Maybe you could go back to it. Obviously, part of this arrangement is that DISH has new requirements placed on them to build out against the spectrum by the FCC and the DOJ. They're a party to this consent decree. And I think that's really great news for consumers that they're going to get after building out a network using all that spectrum. That entire arrangement was and is contingent upon this announcement that was made today. Is that what you were asking? Brett Feldman : That's it \u2013 you answered the question. Thank you. Mike Sievert : Okay. Great. John Legere : I might just say on that, too, Mike, DISH's press release and their filings were very comprehensive. So, if you get a chance to look through those. One of the ways I look at this is, if you look at the full utilization of the 2.5 that we're acquiring from Sprint, as well as the unused spectrum of DISH, this is a great day for American networks. It'd be about 150 megahertz at least of spectrum that will now be put to use that, before these sets of agreements, were not going to be. And certainly, DISH's commitments, which have penalties associated with them, are a big part of it. So, I'd read those filings and certainly, DISH can comment on those. Mike Sievert : And Brett, your second question was about the Altice arrangement, yes, all of the existing MVNO agreements from both companies are going to be inherited by the new company, and we're really pleased to support all those. So, they'll carry forward carryforward. We won't be killing or canceling any MVNO deals. And one of the things we've said all along is that this new company is a bigger friend to MVNOs than the standalones. I mean, the massive capacity that we are creating with this new network creates the incentive for us to want to be a provider to MVNOs. Now, those arrangements, each have different durations and they have different pricing aspects to them, we'll just carry those forward through to their expirations. And then, obviously, a piece of this is that there will be an opportunity for them to go forward throughout the 7 years. John Legere : Yes. And we've said throughout the process, too, when you invest in the network and you have an eightfold increase in capacity, you have a stadium that's got a lot of empty seats, and we are \u2013 we therefore cherish the relationships with MVNOs as a way to have the utilization of our network continue. And there's been questions already today, I can tell you that the agreements that we struck in our current network are easily handled with a small percentage of our network. And as the network grows over the next 3 years, they become a de minimis part of our overall broad network capability. And we're very careful about that. Everything we've done, everything we've negotiated has been hinged around ensuring that the build commitments that we made to the FCC and to the country can be attained. And I can reinforce strongly that, that's the case. Brett Feldman : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question of John Hodulik of UBS. John Hodulik : Okay, great. Again, thanks. Congratulations on the news today. My question is about the MVNO agreement. John, I did read the 8-K that came out at DISH. Was there anything else you could tell us in regard to a couple areas of that MVNO? First of all, it mentions a phase approach for both the MVNO and MNO. So, what that's referring to? Anything regarding sort of pricing or percentage of capacity, which you were just referring to? And then a little later in the document, it talks about restrictions on DISH's ability to wholesale or bundle that service. Just specifically, is that \u2013 are those restrictions related to cable companies? Thanks. John Legere : Yes, John, we're going to carefully wade through some of these answers. I mean, it's not to be evasive. It's only that we're only able to speak today about items that were part of the filings that people have made in the last two-hours. And it's unclear how much of that is actually covered. We won't be discussing pricing on the MVNO. We won't be discussing in too much detail any of the restrictions, only to reinforce that we're very comfortable with the pricing and its accretive effect to our business and that the protections associated with it, again, are part of what's necessary for us to make sure that we move forward with the real ambition that we have. But I don't know, Mike, do you want to comment on any of the other piece? Mike Sievert : Yes. Only to agree with what you just said. A couple of things. One is, yes, this is a complex arrangement that's going to be in place for 7 years. So, we really had to design it carefully to meet the needs of everybody involved. It definitely does great work to set up DISH to enable their use of all that spectrum to enable them, while they're building a network and to give them a very competitive access to our nationwide network, to your question in two forms, through a nationwide MVNO and unlike other MVNOs, as they build out their own network to be able to access ours through a roaming arrangement as well. So, that's a terrific enablement for them as a new competitor. On the other hand, it's also designed to make sure that there's nothing in it that thwarts our ability to meet the commitments that we've made to the FCC and to our investors about building out and leading the 5G revolution in this country. So, we're very excited about what we're able to do. As Braxton pointed out, every aspect of our business plan and our synergy plan is intact because we've designed these agreements to do that. As John said, this is also an arrangement that will be accretive to our business because the pricing allows us to monetize DISH's access of our network. You asked about capacity. I'll just tell you that the arrangement has been designed with certain safeguards to make sure that T-Mobile's commitments that we've made around the amount of capacity that we will have out there for our customers is in place. Our customers will be able to experience nationwide speeds for 99% of Americans in excess of 100 megabits per second. Every aspect of the commitments that we've made to the FCC are still our plan and have been safeguarded with the arrangement that we've made with DISH. At the same time, it enables them to be a competitor and to pursue a very, very ambitious growth plan. So, we're pleased with that. John Legere : Yes. And John, I'm not usually the one, especially in the last year, I've been rather quiet, to be positive on others' capability. But I would say, it's very clear that with the spectrum that DISH has, with the acquisition of Boost, with the MVNO arrangement, that the transition services agreement while they build out their network, with the ability to get some of the decommissioned towers and stores, DISH has a real significant opportunity to be a very credible disruptive fourth wireless carrier.  And that certainly is something that I'm sure AT&T and Verizon should keep an eye on. But it's not to the detriment of our ability to achieve our ambitions. So, but I do see them having all of the tools in the toolkit, including, from what I see and hear and watch, the motivation as a company, and Charlie himself, to really become a disruptive player. John Hodulik : Alright. Let\u2019s hope the states agree. Thanks guys. John Legere : Thanks, John. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Drew FitzGerald of the Wall Street Journal. Drew FitzGerald : Hi, guys. Two questions. So, what agreement, if any, are in place now on whether the deal will close or not during state litigation? And John, if you could just tell me a little bit more about how this came together when you first talked to Charlie about putting this together? Potentially, I think you'd said earlier in the year that \u2013 well, you had some choice words for DISH and what it was doing. Thanks. John Legere : I'm pretty sure I've had choice words for everybody, including you. I'm not sure. Do you want to handle the first part of the question on any agreements in place? Like 100% sure I understood the question. Mike Sievert : I was muted, Drew. Can you just \u2013 can you try that first part one more time? Drew FitzGerald : Sure. Do you and Sprint have any agreements in place with the state plaintiffs, the Democratic state AGs, to either close or not close while the litigation's ongoing? Mike Sievert : I see. Right. No. No, our intention is not to close while the litigation is ongoing. So, we've agreed, made a set of agreements with plaintiffs around how the trial will proceed and when it will proceed. There's another proceeding next week where we'll be meeting with the judge. So that process is unfolding. But no, we don't have an intention to close while it's pending. John Legere : And Drew, we certainly have had conversations with many of the states involved. I think it's very important for people to understand that the suit filed by the attorney generals happened before the knowledge of the actions that the DOJ were going to take, which certainly will solve many, if not all, of their concerns came out. So, today's information is very pertinent input to them, and we'll be working very closely with them. Before their suit, we had already started working quite aggressively with many states on what are the things that are important to you and to your state. And frankly, they have urged us to continue that process even up through now. So, that will be next course of business. I'm very confident that what we're going to do, especially if you think of some of the big concerns that they had. For example, with today's announcement, there is no consolidation of share in the prepaid industry, which was a big concern of theirs. And then the buildout commitments are very important to many states, and they want to understand what's important to them, this lifeline issue. So, we'll continue those conversations. And I'm very confident that we will find what is necessary for them to join in. As you probably also saw, a number of state attorney generals joined as a party to this DOJ action today, which is just a start. As far as the conversations go, you know we know DISH and have for years. So, there's not really ever a start to conversations with DISH. We've had conversations before. We had conversations just in passing after the deal was announced. But this process has been one of a tremendous amount of work, first with the FCC, getting closure, making commitments, and then with the DOJ. And in the DOJ process was where we more rigorously got involved with DISH. And then we had agreements pending with DISH and then had further conversations with the DOJ, which culminated today. So, a long process, but very thorough. Somewhat building on each other as each entity had significant things that were important to them. But to have now the two main federal agencies after the FCC files their order, approving and supporting, including the expert agency, I think that's an unprecedented level of support that bodes very well for ultimately the finalization and approval of this deal and it being permitted to close in the second half of this year. Mike Sievert : And we've not seen examples, anywhere in recent history, where, to John's point, the expert agencies have weighed in the way the federal agencies now have where a deal has not ultimately closed, even if there were objections at the state level. So, the fact that we now have federal support is a major, major milestone for this deal. John Legere : And it hasn\u2019t been time today, Drew. But certainly, the messages we're going to have to get back to that are important to the constituents are the jobs are going to go up every day in this new company. The prices will not go up, competition will go up, the buildout will be comprehensive and on time and cover 99. So, those are the messages we have to get back to, and those are the messages that were of concern to many of the states that were party to this. And they can all be answered. Drew FitzGerald : Okay. And one more question. Just at some point though between you and DISH, you guys went from merger opponents in this proceeding to at least exploring a potential partnership. How did that conversation go? John Legere : Again, it's a continuum, and life brings strange bed fellows. So, remember, we're not partners with DISH here, right? There are things that we've agreed to, arrangements and a deal that is mutually beneficial that helps enhance the competition and allows this deal to go forward. So, it's far different than a merger. It's an agreement to divest to a serious and credible buyer, which DISH was concluded to be. It happened to be simultaneous with other discussions DISH was having with the FCC that this enhanced. We've both made significant commitments with financial penalties around this. And then, of course, we're going to help support the transition with an MVNO for DISH and a transition services agreement. So, it's a business arrangement and one that I think took a long time to get through, but we're quite pleased with, and I'm sure they are as well. Drew FitzGerald : Okay. John Legere : You want to take one of these questions here on the board? Anybody have a favorite? We have Philip, Roger Cheng and Walter Piecyk. Anybody want to pick one? Mike Sievert : So, we can take a couple of them in succession. So, Roger Cheng asks, hi, John and T-Mobile, can you better define what robust access to your network means when it comes to DISH? I'm sure he's talking about the MVNO deal. Will it have full access to your 4G and 5G network? I don't know, Neville, do you want to talk about the approach that we're taking? Neville Ray : Yes, I mean, the answer is quick and easy on that one. Yes. So, DISH and other MVNOs obviously will have access to not just the great LTE network that we have in the ground, but the great 5G network that's coming superfast. So, yes, DISH will have full access to 5G capabilities. Mike Sievert : Well, Piecyk asked, there's also reference to T-Mobile in the release to the T-Mobile possibly leasing 600-megahertz spectrum from DISH. Does this also mean the FCC is okay if DISH leases spectrum to others? On the second part, you'll have to talk to DISH about that. I think there is some flexibility there. But this is an actually really interesting topic. We weren't able to conclude it during the talks that led up today, but both parties are interested in this. DISH happens to own 600-megahertz spectrum that they're not using. They're going to be building out against it, but it's going to take them some time. Meanwhile, as John reported today, we have 22 million handsets already on our 600-megahertz spectrum that's been rolled out to more than 150 million POPs already. So, it's a nationwide availability. And so, we obviously do have some interest in leasing that from them for a period of time, maybe a few years, that would help accelerate our network transition from Sprint over to T-Mobile. So, that's of interest of the parties. We agreed to sit down and roll up our sleeves and talk about it. But there wasn't anything that came to conclusion in the agreements that were announced today. John Legere : Yes, and I think these are questions that will get fully vetted over the coming weeks. There were a lot of \u2013 this went on for so long. There were a lot of rumors and speculations about what might be happening. I think we dispelled one already, which was that we did not divest any of the critical 2.5 spectrum that's core to our network. So, we got that one down. There was a lot of talk about us doing a network hosting or sharing arrangement with DISH, and we're not. What this simply means is, DISH has 600-megahertz spectrum that's not being used. And for a period of time, it would sit there and not be used and provide no benefit to customers or value to them. What we've agreed to do is see if there's a mutually agreeable arrangement, price, through which we could lease on our network for our use, their spectrum, which would be beneficial \u2013 it would enhance our network transition process. So, this is a \u2013 if there's something that's good for you and you agree, then you will lease their spectrum for a period of time at a price that's beneficial to you and accelerate your ability to do your network migration. That's all that is. And certainly, it's almost a who wouldn't agree to have that conversation? So, there's no hidden backstop here about us standing up their network for them in this case. Neville Ray : Can I take Bill Ho's one there? So, Bill Ho is asking about millimeter wave. What are your thoughts of putting your millimeter wave portfolio into service? What's the fixed wireless access for you, timing, clearing challenges, if any? So, just try and tie some of the comments you've heard all through the call today. I mean, our goal and ambition with new T-Mobile is to combine low, mid, and high-band assets together. That's always been our story. We think that's absolutely critical for the type of 5G service that customers can use on a ubiquitous basis, both in urban, suburban and rural environments. And you need all those elements, all of those pieces of the puzzle to come together the right way. So, we had a very successful recent auction outcome, primarily on 24 gigahertz. We are already \u2013 we have deployed 28 gigahertz. You've seen that. We are the first wireless carrier to put out millimeter wave coverage maps. Pretty exciting what you can see with millimeter wave in Manhattan. But I think everybody understands now that you cannot take a millimeter wave portfolio across the 3-plus million square miles of the U.S. It just doesn't work. It's not economic. I mean, you can absolutely use millimeter wave where there are large concentrations of people, where the population density exists. And that's always been part of our plan. The 24-gigahertz we\u2019ve recently assumed is going to take some time to work through the dialogue on power limits and some other pieces, but radio needs to come, handsets needs to come. It's going to take a little bit of time. But clearly, we have assets we're already utilizing and deploying and bringing 5G service to customers with. Super excited for me and my team about what's happening on 600. You've heard the stats and numbers from both John and Mike. The 150-plus million customers that we now cover \u2013 or not customers, I should say, I wish they were, the POPs, future customers with our 600-megahertz, that's a 50% improvement quarter-on-quarter. So, when you think about the pace at which we are moving and rolling out our low-band 600-megahertz footprint, it's truly exciting. And we are going to bring 5G service, not fake 5GE, not millimeter wave in a few hotspots, we are going to bring large, very large-scale coverage on 5G to the U.S. this year and nationwide as we move into 2020. So, super exciting and putting all the spectrum together is an absolute dream for me and my team and we look forward to bringing all the power and capability that the new T-Mobile network can bring to the U.S. consumer. John Legere : So, there's a gigantic amount to cover today. Well, let's just capture one important part that Neville said. People have said that we trash millimeter wave as an alternative for 5G, and that's absolutely not true. We have made fun of a millimeter wave-only strategy. It won't work. Verizon's strategy will not work. It's fake. It was a first mover play. It would cost $1.5 trillion to do, and they're kind of dead in the water without a strategy right now. I think the world's starting to catch on. AT&T on the other hand at least gets the template. So, if you look at the template that we're working on, which is you have a combination nationwide of low-band, the 2.5 mid-band and millimeter wave in highly concentrated areas, do we believe in it? We just spent over $840 million to quadruple our millimeter wave spectrum in the latest auction. When you put all of those three together, you get true nationwide capability that this country needs that nobody else has. The difference for AT&T, although they get the vision, they don't have the mid-band, right? So, there's a hole in their strategy. But at least I think they get the template. Verizon, clueless, no strategy, nowhere to go. And AT&T, not clueless, lying, confusing people about 5GE, which is really just 4G advanced and a big hole in their template, which is the middle, and where are they going to get the mid-band to lay this out? So, since we had a moment on that, I thought we'd take one. Let's go back to the messages \u2013 the questions on the phone. Operator : Yes, sir. Our next question on the phone comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Simon Flannery : Great, thanks very much. Just congrats on getting the approval. Following up with Neville on the spectrum angle. You've previously talked about a $2 billion spectrum spend envelope. You've spent almost $1 billion already. Is that still the status after this agreement, particularly around the 800 megahertz? And then another strong net add quarter, you raised your guidance for the full-year. So, perhaps just give us some color. Where are you seeing the most momentum? What are the contributors to both the strong Q2 and the outlook for the rest of the year? Is it rural? Is it enterprise? Is it veteran, 55? It would be great to get some color on that. Thanks. Braxton Carter : Let me start, Simon, and thanks for the congrats. Our $2 billion envelope is absolutely intact, and what we've previously communicated stands there. Mike, do you want to handle the second part? Mike Sievert : Yes, I'll start, and just kick it over to Matt. As you can probably see, Simon, the business is firing on all cylinders right now. This is one of the things we're most proud of is the fact that churn, as John and Braxton reported, hit an all-time record low. And that's not just a record low for us. It\u2019s a record low as you look across anything anyone's ever done in the industry, but for a couple of exceptions. In the history of this U.S. industry, there've only been four churn reports lower than today's churn report by T-Mobile. In its history, all four of those were Verizon's. That means today churn report is lower than even Verizon's throughout almost all of their history. So, it's a big, big piece of momentum for us. But it's not the only thing working. Matt, if you'd like to amplify. We have Matt Staneff, our Chief Marketing Officer, with us here today, who's close to the competitive situation. Matt Staneff : Hi, Simon. Thanks for the question. In terms of where we're seeing strength from going forward. I mean, I think continuing what Mike said, it's coming from all the different places we have all our segments in the market. 55 plus remains strong. We've seen Verizon and others respond to our actions, again, being nice and competitive in the marketplace. The military is another place. But when you step back and look at it, it's the total value that we have in the market. When you look at the price, we have in our new Magenta plan, what we're putting down with the network and the quality of the network, backed by our outstanding customer service. We're seeing it from Team of Experts. Our customers are talking. By-and-large, this is a momentum business, and you see it growing and moving forward. Our churn continues to go down, while the others are ticking up. We like to see that in the marketplace, and we're going to keep on that, not to mention another great quarter with growth on T-Mobile for Business. We continue to win new accounts, move up market, small businesses, big businesses. This is just getting started and going to continue to be a driver for us as well. John Legere : And Simon, I have two small announcements to make : One is, I officially want to let you know that Matt Staneff is the smartest person in T-Mobile. People thought it was Mike Sievert. But no, it's not. And secondly, secondly, it should be noted that for the foreseeable past, Mike and I have spent every day in Washington, D.C. only briefly calling back to Matt to see how the business was going, and the business had all-time record results. So, we'll just let that speak for itself. Simon Flannery : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Michael Rollins of Citi. Michael Rollins : Hi, thanks. Two, if I could. First, could you give us an update on how you're approaching the integration process and some of the steps you'll take once you're able to close? And then did that integration process get impacted by any of the divestitures or agreements with the DOJ? And then separately, can you give us a little bit more detail of how the potential transfer of cell sites and retail stores to DISH could work post close? And if there's any financial impact or cost avoidance for T-Mobile? Mike Sievert : Got it. I could start with the integration piece. We're really pleased with how it's going. I'll tell you that we've had a little more time to plan this than we would have expected when we launched our integration plans. And that's generally speaking been frustrating, but on the other hand, it's given us a fantastic chance to be very, very thoughtful and get out of the gates quickly. As Braxton and John reinforced in their remarks, what we have today is a plan that is fully intact versus all of the goals and ambitions for long-term profitability, enterprise value and synergy attainment that we laid out for you in April of last year. And we're very, very pleased with that. What's different now versus April from last year is that, that's backed by detailed operational plans in every function of this company. And so, we're planning to get out of the gates very quickly and hit the ground running. Some ask us, well, how is that going to look? And you even have \u2013 I've got a Tweet here from Roger Cheng asking, \u2018Hey, some are talking about this deal giving some price stabilization. But does that mean that the era of lower rate plans, aggressive BOGO offers and other perks are over?\u2019 in his Tweet? And these are the kinds of questions, and I know he asked it for almost to get this reaction. These are the kind of questions that dumbfound us as management team leading the Un-carrier. We are the competition. We're planning to take these capabilities of enhanced capacity and lower cost and go right after AT&T and Verizon like they've never seen before. I think anybody who supports this merger is going to be very proud of what that looks like in the early months and throughout the entire period. Because we can do that and hit these goals that we laid out for you last April simultaneously. And that's because of the unique set of capabilities that we have by bringing these two companies together. You asked the second question about the transfer and how that would work. Think about it this way, our plan, Neville's plan for synergy attainment has always involved, as we laid out for you over a year ago, turning down tens of thousands of cell sites as we integrate these two networks into one seamless network. And what we're doing is saying, look, any site that we are planning to abandon anyway, it's just in our plan to abandon anyway, that site is something that we'd happily make available to DISH. And we also said there'd be at least 20,000 of those. And so not all of those have assignable leases. If they are assignable, then we'll happily assign them. If not, we will sort of get out of the way. But it's a great enablement for a company to move very quickly, and that was certainly the government's goal, was to enable DISH to move quickly. But it's a pretty straightforward thing that involves us getting out of the way on the tens of thousands of sites that we were planning to decommission anyway. John Legere : This, Mike, this aha moment and decisions about what we're going to do about it started several times sitting, testifying in the Senate and Congress and being surrounded by people that were just dumbfoundedly not listening to the fact that jobs are going up and prices will go down and competition will go up. And if it wasn't clear to me then it's painfully clear to me now that we will, early and often, make it clear what the behavior of the Un-carrier will be post this transaction. When this transaction closes, we will waste no time making it very clear what this network capability that will going to be built is going to be used to do, and there'll be no doubt about it. And it is, as Mike said, it's a bit dumbfounding to think that we've decided to go and build this network and go through this merger so that we can become the basic, lazy, fat, dumb and arrogant players that we were born to teach how to behave. We want to continue their education in a major way. And that's core to what we're going to do with the 5G capability. Braxton Carter : Mike, one thing on your question on the financial impact, we've been very clear, synergies are fully intact. The financial and cash flow components that we communicated at the beginning of the merger, fully intact. But there's a silver lining here on the divestiture, and that's we're going to have lower gross debt, lower net debt, and lower leverage going into T-Mobile. Our current modeling now shows on a reported EBITDA standpoint, max peak leverage of 2.5x. And that's a significant improvement by about 0.4 turn of leverage then we would have been, and there's a couple of factors there. The prepaid divestiture is cash up front. Certainly, the spectrum piece of it is deferred for 3 years, so that's not an immediate impact. But we've also significantly over performed at the T-Mobile level on cash generation, point to the results of the quarter, just astounding increases in the cash flow of the business. And all that combined is resulting in a very, very healthy capital structure and leverage profile for the new company, so a real silver lining there. John Legere : Yes. And I think, Braxton, putting a financial lens on this, I see a few questions already in the lead up when you can \u2013 when you have leaks for 5 months, a lot of people have a lot of pent-up questions. I saw one of them in the last couple of days. When they started to hear that the synergies would be intact and they were trying to answer how did we shift where the synergies came to keep the synergies intact? And very important to note is the synergies, the $43 billion, are the same $43 billion exactly intact as they were. They were not coming from the areas of the business that were in this transaction. Another way to think about \u2013 so you've got the synergies, 43 billion, you understand how to execute against them. Then you've got several things : You've got a transaction where Boost becomes an MVNO stream to us, which certainly has positive financial implications for us. You have a transaction on spectrum that will either be at that value or if it doesn't take place, we'll have an option later on to sell at that price or to keep it. And you've got a \u2013 yes, so you've got DISH, spectrum and MVNO that are all in and of themselves, positive to the financials of the company. So, I think that's a very important analysis that Braxton's pointing out. Michael Rollins : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Sheila Dang of Reuters. Sheila Dang : HI. So, can you talk about any concerns that you might have about other companies that could come in after the fact and partner with DISH to help them become a really competitive rival? Are there any limitations in place to kind of prevent that? John Legere : Want to start? Mike Sievert : Sure. Sheila, yes. This whole set of arrangements was designed to be for DISH. And DISH has committed to not only build the network, but launch services in support of that network right away. In fact, one of their commitments is to launch \u2013 not just to support Boost prepaid but to launch postpaid service. So, there's plenty of robust competition coming from DISH, and it's been designed to be DISH. And that's important for us because as I said earlier, this has been also simultaneously designed to make sure that there isn't increased risk to T-Mobile being able to live up to its commitments, particularly our commitments to build this high-capacity network that results in the kinds of speeds and capabilities for our customers that we've not only promised our customers but now promised the federal regulatory agencies.  And so, it's been designed to have both, protect our network while enabling the competition. And that doesn't mean it's designed for that counterparty to turn around and resell it or to bundle it with other company services, et cetera. It's to enable them as a competitor. That said, we're interested in wholesaling directly to other parties. As we've said all along, this is a company that will be strategically very aligned with the idea of enabling partnerships with MVNOs, but we will be doing that directly. John Legere : So, this is one of those tricky areas where there hasn't been enough filing or disclosures on this topic for us to give specific details. So, I'll stick to details to this, your initial question, are you concerned? The answer is no. The transaction was defined in a way where we have protected our ability to run our network for the sake of our customers without any potential disruption. We've protected ourselves for this to be for DISH. DISH has been protective in the fact that there are ways for them to raise financial capital, but we don't fear because there's tremendous protections for somebody entering a back door in a way that could be seen to turn this transaction into something other than it is. And the details on that, I'm sure, at some point, will follow. But for today, I can just tell you, those are some of the latest items in the deal, and we feel very comfortable and all of our concerns were met in how we cut the transaction. Nils Paellmann : Should we go back to the phone? Operator? Operator : We will take our next question from Philip Cusick of JPMorgan. Philip Cusick : Hi guys, thanks. First, if I can, a clarification on the DISH deal you alluded to it earlier, but can you clarify that DISH's letter today to the FCC reflects what is already in the consent decree? And then on the fundamentals, Mike or I guess Matt, can you give us an update on your regional distribution expansion? What you're seeing in penetration? And how does the opportunity change as you get scale with Sprint? Thanks. John Legere : Miller, you want to take the first one? David Miller : Yes. Thanks for the question. Is this on? Thanks for the question. The obligation that DISH has in terms of buildout, those are in the consent decree. They're referenced in the consent decree. And the consent decree has some additional obligations as well that are in there. But yes, there's cross reference. Mike Sievert : Yes. To the second part of the question, it's going really well. We've gotten into this a little bit each quarter, Phil. And we've now reached 265 million people with our distribution footprint for our networks. We've also made some changes to how we operate our business in distribution this quarter. I think you may have noted that last year, we rebranded Metro to become Metro by T-Mobile. And then this quarter, following that, we've been able to realign our operations. We've asked Jon Freier to become the EVP of Consumer Markets and take responsibility for all the distribution looking across Metro and T-Mobile as we start to operate that more. Matt Staneff, our CMO, is leading marketing, pricing and all the commercial operations for both brands as well. So, we're much more integrated now in how we go after an expanded footprint of distribution that now reaches 265 million people that just 2.5 years ago, reached about 230 million people. And that footprint is really performing. Anything to add to all that? Matt Staneff : Yes. I'll just say that when we look at what we did with the 55 plus, with the Military and veterans, we saw great success and progress in coming behind the network in the distribution buildout to break into the more rural areas with a very compelling pricing strategy. I think that formula is probably going to be one that we continue to lean on as we move forward. When you look forward to the combination with new T-Mobile, I think what you'll find is a supercharging effect of that and really going harder and being able to expand faster into these areas. Philip Cusick : Thanks, guys. John Legere : Operator? Operator : We will take our next question from Jonathan Chaplin of New Street Research. Jonathan Chaplin : Thanks. Two quick ones. First for \u2013 a quick one for Braxton or maybe Matt, the smartest man at T-Mobile. Are these record levels of churn as good as it gets? Or are you still seeing the factors that drove churn drove it lower from here? And then a longer-winded question for John. So, I get that there's no network sharing deal. But I'm curious as to why? Was this a redline for you? It seems to us that the biggest issue and the core case is going to be how real DISH is. And the network sharing deal may have gone a long way to alleviating the concerns that the states have. So, that \u2013 yes, so that was the second question. Thanks. Braxton Carter : Let me start Jonathan. So, first, you have to look at what's really the driver for the just massive decrease in churn that we're seeing year-over-year. And it's, bottom line, number one is our network. It's always the number one reason for churning off. And our network continues to fortify and get better every day. And the rollout of the 600, where Neville and his team are performing just amazing results, and you can see it in our capital intensity, is just truly outstanding.  And then you apply on that very, very cutting-edge and focused customer service with Team of Experts. And you look at the very innovative marketing that we're driving into the marketplace. This is all goodness. I mean, certainly, there is a terminal level of churn that's going to happen in any environment. But those factors do bode well for the future as we continue down the evolution of the Un-carrier and how we are addressing the pain points and the quality of our service in America. Jonathan Chaplin : So, it can go lower, Braxton? Braxton Carter : We're not going to give the actual churn guidance. Matt Staneff : We don't guide on churn, but the other thing I'll just reiterate on Braxton's, we all fundamentally knew that when we put together a network that's at the same bar as the best ones out there, you have the best customer service and you have the best value, meaning, the best pricing and the most amount of goods for that, that we would be among the best in churn. And I think what we\u2019re seeing is the realization of that finally occurring on the heels of the 600-rollout, on the penetration of getting these phones on our customers' hands. The caveat I'll add to Braxton's and others is that as we continue to expand into these new areas and new markets, it's not \u2013 we're not as strong as we are in the core. And so, you can expect to see a little bit of upward pressure on that in the newer areas as we move forward. And so, we're working to kind of stabilize our growth plan against what we're seeing in the existing base. John Legere : Let me add a moment \u2013 a possible moment of humility, if I can muster it somewhere in my human being. I think it's important to note that where we are with churn could be even slightly ahead of where we thought we'd be at this time. Not that we were shocked to see. But on the other hand, what most excites me about it is it's being driven by a set of variables that are only getting better. So, we knew that the network deployment and the quality of our network would have a significant impact, and that's going to get better and better. We knew that our care experience and Team of Experts was going to have a significant impact on churn, and it has. And we know that the Net Promoter Score and the relationship that customers have, not just in our retail stores but our business side, is off-the-charts positive. All three of those things are getting better. So, the fact that they lead to churn of levels that even impress us suggest that they could lead to churn levels that stay that level or go to places that people have never gone before. Mike Sievert : Well, think about the math behind that, right, the math behind what John just said. We're thrilled that there's 156 million now covered with 600. That's great. On the other hand, that means more than half our network is not yet covered by 600, and there's potential there. We're thrilled that 22 million phones have 600, but that means two-thirds of our branded customers don't have it yet. And so, there's exciting potential here as this continues to unfold once you combine it with the value and the customer experience. John Legere : Right. And so, you asked for a long-winded answer. That's generally Neville's department. But let me just say this. And I think there are as many opinions as to what the state's issues are that will be going forward. And I have to tell you again, I believe that the information that the DOJ has come out with today is important input that was not part of the decisions they made when they decided to create the lawsuit. I would also say that we've met and spoke with many of the states, and many of the concerns are the same. Originally, there were concerns about consolidation in the prepaid segment and competition in the low end of the market, especially for the low-income consumer. There were always concerns on pricing that we have made very strong commitments on, buildout commitments, state-level buildout commitments that we continue to engage on and jobs, all of which we know are stories that we can answer. Also, on the DISH side, the question of that next marginal thing that would make people feel more comfortable with DISH. I think you need to understand. DISH has a tremendous amount of spectrum and now has a very fortified buildout commitment and a plan to do so. You have to assume that, that's going to take place. They'll have 9.3 million customers. They'll have a tremendous MVNO and a transition services agreement to go along with their other \u2013 they have a good marketing engine and prowess, and they have ability to raise capital. So, they're a real player. Let's just be clear. Whether another item would make them stronger, those are things that they can do on their own somehow. But DISH is a viable, real, full, facilities-based wireless company at the end of this transaction, and nothing should be taken away from that. I think that will be important input. I remain very confident that in discussing with the states, the things that are of concern to them, we either have answered or can answer them. And that will be job one as we start to move from here. Jonathan Chaplin : Thank you. John Legere : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson. Craig Moffett : Just a clarification on the DOJ approval. Is the approval with the full support of the full staff of the DOJ to your knowledge? Or is this an approval directly from Bureau Chief Delrahim? And I'm just wondering what, if anything, the staff has done? And what the role of the staff was in the final agreement? John Legere : Yes, two things, Craig. I have to tell you, it's been a very tense week or weeks, and one of the few times that I burst out in laughter was reading your report from yesterday. I mean, the combination of your knowledge about the business and the creative writing skills, I have to tell you, it was very, very well done. So, thank you for a brief moment of laughter. Secondly, I'm sure you know the answers to the question that you're asking. Obviously, for the entire time that we've been working with the DOJ, the staff has been totally involved, in detail involved in every piece of what we've done. And ultimately, how they get to a decision in the DOJ is very clear. Ultimately, the staff gives tremendous amounts of input, and then the antitrust head of the DOJ makes a decision based upon all those attributes. But yes, the \u2013 every component of the DOJ was greatly, greatly involved in all aspects of not just discussing this deal, having opinions on it and putting the decisions together. I'm not sure it's a place where they take a vote, but neither is T-Mobile. So, I don't think I answered your question. Craig Moffett : I think it probably answers it to the extent possible. There were reports, as you probably know, and we've never really known what reports in the press were true and which ones weren't. But there were reports early on that the staff remained opposed initially after the FCC resale suggestion. And so, I was wondering if the staff had come around to fully agreeing that the current structure of the deal satisfies all the concerns that they had. John Legere : Yes. And I certainly don't have any information on that. I would also say; this has to be the most leaked-about deal ever in the history of mankind. And since I was sitting in the DOJ so many of the days where the leaks came right out of the DOJ, I would tell you, if you are a baseball hitter and you were hitting the average of how right these rumors were, you would clearly be down with team TiVo and not playing in the major leagues. They were just \u2013 people were clutching at straws, and it was clear that most of the time, the rumors were coming out of the DOJ. They weren't. They were coming out of other parties that were trying to influence the process and cause unrest. Maybe that will be a fun book someday. With your writing skills, I'm sure you can do it justice. Nils Paellmann : Thanks Craig. Should we go back to the phone? Operator? Operator : We'll take our next question from Ric Prentiss of Raymond James. Ric Prentiss : Congrats, guys. As an ex-M&A guy in the industry who went to the dark side 23 years ago, I know how work this has taken to get here, but no work is ever done. Can you update us on the California piece and status? Do you think you'll get a decision from them here in August? Mike Sievert : Thanks, Ric. We can turn to Dave for some details. But generally speaking, that process was on a pace and then that pace was changed at the time that the state lawsuits were filed last month. And so, my expectation is that they'll be worked out on similar time frames because the pace that we were on was changed pretty significantly when the states filed their lawsuit, including the state of California. David Miller : Yes. Just to reiterate \u2013 this is Dave, yes, the administrative law judge in California had indicated that they would \u2013 that he would rule by the end of June. And of course, events sort of superseded that. And we hope that the action occurs quickly, of course. There's no specific time. Ric Prentiss : Next question, I want to come back to one question that Rollins had about the cost to achieve. If I'm reading it right, DISH can take over some of your Sprint leases. Can they take them over as early as like the first, second or third year? And so, could you actually exceed and do better than what your cost to achieve is then if they take on the leases sooner? John Legere : Braxton? Braxton Carter : Yes, first of all, we have to support the migration of the Sprint customers to the new T-Mobile network in a quality manner, in a way that doesn't impair and actually delights those customers as they come over on the network. Maybe we've previously said that it's going to take 3 years to get through that process. So, there's very little opportunity on the cell sites in the early part of this process. It would be definitely more back ended. And very perceptive question, absolutely. I mean, ultimately, and it's impossible to quantify at this point. But if Charlie does assume some of the lease liabilities, we've modeled full payout of the lease liability, and it would be net upside. But there's no way to really quantify or model it at this point. John Legere : Well, there's a way to quantify it. There's no downside, right? Because importantly, when you sit there and you have a plan, which we have, a very specific plan for our network migration and certain times at which we will be decommissioning sites and turning them down, and you do or you don't have transfer rights associated with those, but you have visibility into those and you, in effect, share that visibility. And/or if you've got transfer rights, you share that with Charles. It can't hurt you. It can help him. On the retail side, you either have lease transfer rights or you don't. And if you do, you make those visible. But it's all while executing our plan for our synergies exactly the way we've outlined them and letting, if possible, DISH get the benefit of some of that, that they need that we will no longer need. And yes, the intersection of some of those can be a cost benefit to us if, in fact, there is a piece of that will be beneficial for them to take up payments that we have a right to transfer instead of canceling that. So, yes, it's actually a win-win, and it will be up to them as to how much of it they choose to take. There's no downside. Ric Prentiss : One last quick one. Have you found any concessions that you had to move into the merger? I think there was $7 billion of potential concessions included in the merger agreement. Doesn't look like you've had to give up any concessions. John Legere : When you say concessions, I mean you're kind of asking about quantification of the impact of this set of divestitures. And as we look at the impact of the set of divestitures, as well as the impact of a year of outstanding execution by this company going into the close. We look at the plan, as Braxton said very clearly. We see a plan that has every bit of the long-term profits and cash generation and every bit of the EBITDA still intact. And that gives us a lot of confidence that we've got something here that's got a lot of momentum behind it. Ric Prentiss : Makes sense. Thanks guys. John Legere : And if your question was aiming towards anything associated with the business combination arrangement with Sprint, we have updated that today, and there's been disclosures associated with the changes to that. So, I think that speaks for itself. But when you say concessions, concessions in general can be anything that's a deviation from what you had anticipated to take place in the transaction. We never anticipated to divest spectrum, for example. And although we get a good price for an optionally, that could be seen as a concession, et cetera. But we're quite comfortable with that, and we've got a good-forward arrangement with the changes in the BCA as well. Ric Prentiss : Thanks guys. Nils Paellmann : Yes, we'll take \u2013 I think we take one or two more? Does that make sense with everybody here? Okay, let's keep going. Operator? Operator : We'll take our next question from Colby Synesael of Cowen. Colby Synesael : Great. Thank you. Two questions, if I may. In the Public Interest Statement last year, you had indicated that it was your goal to reach 9.5 million in-home broadband subs by 2024. Just curious if that's still the expectation. Just some color on your strategies as it relates to in-home broadband. Really haven't heard too much about that lately. And then secondly, I know you reiterated the $43 billion in NPV synergies. Just looking back to your previous disclosures, you mentioned about 4 billion coming from network, about 1 billion from sales, service and marketing, and another 1 billion from back office. Is that still the breakout that we should be expecting? Thanks. Mike Sievert : Yes, it's interesting, the Public Interest Statement just sounds like it was 100 years ago and certainly was the fundamental basis through which all these discussions took place. And in a smaller ramped-up version were the commitments that we made to the FCC. And when you look at the FCC commitments about coverage and 5G coverage and in-home broadband, you'll see these notes... John Legere : And the answers are yes and yes. I mean yes to the 9.5 million and yes to the synergy breakdown, as Braxton was saying, being as we presented it when we launched the deal last April. Neville Ray : Absolutely. Let me just double down and say that I think there's incredible excitement about what we can do in the in-home broadband space, especially in rural environments. I think that's something that, through the discussions we've had with the FCC and obviously some of the state folks, that's a huge win from this combination, a transformational impact from this 5G network in rural America and in-home broadband space. Super exciting. John Legere : I think the question is a really good one. It's something that we're going to have to revamp up our communication about. If you look at the FCC's decision process and the things that were extremely important to the FCC and to the country about this network build and about the in-home broadband competition, about the rural competition, not just rural coverage but rural in-home broadband, the commitments we made, those are the most exciting parts of this. But for a number of months, we kind of took a left-hand turn where the DOJ certainly had a different set of issues that they were focusing on and trying to answer the question of can that exciting thing for the country happen without harming the competitive environment? And \u2013 but all the items that are being announced today by the DOJ, as you look past them, then you have to go back and see, okay, this sets the stage for that. And now you start to remember what happens when you unleash this network, you invest $40 billion in three years, you increase jobs, you increase rural penetration, you really go after the in-home broadband market and attack competitively one of the most uncompetitive markets in the country. So, that's an exciting piece that I think will now resurface a bit. And together, I'm hoping and believing that those two things together now are the answer as to why I believe the regulatory approval processes from here, focusing on those, I'm confident that we'll get this done. Colby Synesael : Great. Thank you, and congrats on today\u2019s news. John Legere : Thank you. Let's take one last question. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from Ana Goshko of Bank of America. Ana Goshko : I think most of this is probably for Braxton. But Braxton, you've got to raise the money to close this deal. So, I think you originally had cited $26 billion of investment-grade-rated secured bank debt and bonds. So, wanted to confirm that's still plan? Two, with regard to timing, a lot of that needs to be done by the time of the deal close for refinancing. So, what is your plan on timing? Had you wanted to wait until you potentially get through a court process? Or might there be a plan to put the debt \u2013 proceeds into escrow in order to raise it in advance of the close? Braxton Carter : Yes, Ana. So, first of all, my comment earlier, we've got the proceeds from the disposition of the prepaid business, as well as outperformance at the T-Mobile level in the last year-and-a-half, since we put the targets out. So, we do not need to raise $26 billion at this point. What I would just look at as a rule of thumb is about a 10% overall decrease in that or just round it to 3 billion, and then we'll just determine on market conditions what market that comes out of. Remember, the primary funding mechanisms are term loan B and IG secured bonds. But no, that number is definitely coming down. And I kind of gave the new entry peak leverage targets earlier in this call. So, the second part of your question, would we prefund some of this versus just really handle it with the bridge? We will have to ultimately make that determination depending on market terms once we really work through the \u2013 in the upcoming months with the states. I can tell you that the intent is not to draw the bridge. That adds additional costs to the overall funding here. But the actual timing and how we do that certainly would precede close. Exactly when is yet to be determined, and we'll had to make a real-time call relating to that. The actual proceeds would be pre-funded and would be held in escrow you \u2013 up to closing of the transaction because we need to attach all the collateral, a lot of details as you are aware of there. But we'll had to make game day call exactly when and how we're going to go to market and then what the respective buckets of what we raised. But overall, great news from a credit standpoint. John Legere : And Braxton, just a footnote. As you've said, in your investigatory rounds and times looking at the funding environment, you've seen tremendous enthusiasm around this transaction. Braxton Carter : Yes. We did a three-week global roadshow, and the reception was amazing. We're really looking forward to getting it out. We're going to have a very, very successful fundraise with this. Ana Goshko : That\u2019s very helpful. Can I have one follow up? On this prepaid subset that are going to divested to DISH, what is the EBITDA associated with that so we can get a correct pro forma? Braxton Carter : Yes. You would really have to address that with Sprint. We're not in a position where we can comment on their business. Okay. Well, hey, everybody, what a great quarter. What a great day for all of us. We thank you for tuning in, and we're very much looking forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Operator? Ana Goshko : Okay, well, thank you and good luck. John Legere : Hi, everybody. What a great quarter, what a great day for all of us. We thank you for tuning in and we\u2019re very much looking forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Nils Paellmann : Operator? Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the T-Mobile US second quarter 2019 earnings call. If you have any further questions, you may contact the Investor Relations or Media Department. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Nils Paellmann, Head of Investor Relations for T-Mobile US. Please go ahead, sir. Nils Paellmann : Yes. Thank you and welcome to T-Mobile third quarter 2019 earnings call. With me today are John Legere, our CEO; Mike Sievert, our President and COO; Braxton Carter, our CFO, and other members of the senior leadership team. Let me just read the disclaimer. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements that include projections and statements about our future financial operating results, our plans, the benefits we expect to receive from the proposed merger with Sprint and other statements that are not historical facts. Such statements are based upon the current beliefs and expectations of our management and are subject to significant growth uncertainties outside of our control that could cause our actual results to differ materially, including the risk factors set forth in our annual report on Form 10-K and our quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Reconciliations between GAAP and the non-GAAP results we discussed on this call can be found in the quarterly results section of the Investor Relations page of our website. In addition, in connection with the proposed transactions on July 30, 2018, we filed a registration statement on Form S-4 with the SEC related to the merger. The registration statement became effective on October 29, 2018, and it's available on the New T-Mobile website. It contains important information about T-Mobile and Sprint, the merger and related matters. With that let me turn it over to John Legere. John Legere : Okay. Thank you for that rousing opening, Nils. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to T-Mobile's third quarter 2019 earnings call and Twitter conference. We we are coming to you live from Bellevue, Washington. We've got a lot to cover today. You can see from the results that we just put out that we have not skipped the beat. We delivered another blockbuster quarter in Q3. We maintained our incredible momentum and posted record service revenues. In addition, we delivered a number of Q3 records, including record low branded postpaid phone churn, total revenues, adjusted EBITDA, net income, and free cash flow. We'll talk about these incredible Q3 results in a minute. But first, let me give you a quick update on our merger with Sprint. We are very pleased that after an exhaustive review of the facts, the Federal Communications Commission voted to approve the merger on October 16. Now both expert agencies, the FCC and the DOJ have validated the merits of a T-Mobile and Sprint combination. As we work through the final steps of closing our merger, we remain convinced that the merits of the deal are even truer today. It's important to point out that the target synergies, profitability, and long-term cash generation have not changed for New T-Mobile. We continue to expect that the merger will deliver more than $43 billion in synergy, while almost tripling our total spectrum holdings in low and mid-band. This positions New T-Mobile to become a nationwide leader in 5G, leapfrogging the competition in network capability and customer experience. This network capability will enable us to supercharge the Un-carrier strategy and aggressively take share from the predatory incumbents. New T-Mobile will support the creation of thousands of new jobs across America, net positive from day one, and deliver lower prices and unrivaled value on the nation's best network, transforming our customers' lives in ways we can\u2019t even imagine. Now, while the deal closing -- closing the deal has taken longer than planned, the silver lining is that we have had more time to prepare for the coming integration. We have detailed integration plans and we are preparing to start deploying Sprint's 2.5-gigahertz spectrum soon after closing. We're working hard to complete the final steps for the merger, and we remain confident and optimistic. In addition to the majority vote from the FCC, we received clearance for the merger from the DOJ in late July, upon entering into a consent decree that included the divestiture of all of Sprint's prepaid businesses and Sprint 800-megahertz spectrum assets to DISH, as well as supporting DISH's rapid entry into the wireless market. The DoJ consent decree is still subject to the final Tunney Act review, as most of you know. Earlier this month, the State of Florida joined the DOJ settlement, and Mississippi and Colorado came off the state AG complaint. In total, 19 State governments, state AGs, governments and/or PUCs have now expressed their support for the merger highlighting benefits such as increased competition, rural coverage, jobs, affordability, and new wireless competition for fixed broadband access. On that note, 18 of 19 PUCs have given this deal the green light. We have a lot of leaders that recognize the benefits that this transaction will deliver for consumers in their state and beyond. Now, as you know, the state AG trial is set to begin on December 9. In the meantime, we continue to be open to and are having many discussions with the state AGs. We now expect the merger will be permitted to close in early 2020. Now, let me dive into these blockbuster Q3 results. First, let's talk customers. 1.7 million total net customers joined the Un-carrier movement in Q3, up 117,000 year-over-year. That makes 26 quarters in a row that we have had more than 1 million total net customer adds per quarter. We added 754,000 branded postpaid phone customers, and continue to lead the industry in postpaid phone growth by a wide margin. We delivered these great results despite this being another competitive quarter in the marketplace. Wireless customers want to do business with the company that treats them right and changes the rules of the industry in their favor. And this shows up clearly in our churn numbers as customers are coming and staying longer than ever before. We had a record low Q3 branded postpaid phone churn of 0.89%, down 13 basis points year-over-year. Not only is this a record low for Q3, we also beat AT&T for a fourth quarter in a row. Our overall postpaid churn was 1.04%, which was also a record low for Q3 and was the best in the industry. In fact, we beat Verizon for a third quarter in a row and AT&T for a fifth quarter in a row. We had strong branded postpaid net customer additions of 1.1 million, supported by continued strong growth in postpaid other customers. Branded prepaid net customer additions were 62,000, up from 35,000 in Q3, 2018. Next, I've got to highlight our record financial results. Service revenues hit all-time record highs reaching $8.6 billion, growing 6% year-over-year, and branded postpaid revenues grew 10% year-over-year. Total revenues grew 2% year-over-year to $11.1 billion, a record high for Q3 despite lower equipment sales. We hit a Q3 record high adjusted EBITDA of $3.4 billion, up 5% year-over-year. Net income was $870 million, a Q3 record high, up 9% year-over-year and fully diluted EPS came in at $1.01, also up 9% year-over-year. And net cash provided by operating activities was $1.7 billion, and free cash flow was $1.1 billion both Q3 record highs, up 91% and 27% year-over-year. Okay, let's talk network for a moment. If you may have heard the news that Neville announced last week that he and his engineering team have been running at an incredible pace building out our initial layer for 5G. In fact, we announced that we are accelerating the build-out and plan to launch our foundational layer of 5G nationwide this year. Our 600-megahertz spectrum will be the foundation for our 5G network, and it's live in nearly 8,300 cities and towns and 48 states in Puerto Rico. This deployment covers 1.4 million square miles and 200 million POPs today. We now have thousands of 5G ready towers and cell sites capable of lighting up 5G on our 600 megahertz spectrum, and no other 5G signal will be a strong or as reliable. More than 26 million devices that are 600 megahertz compatible are already on our network today. We plan to launch 5G on 600 megahertz on a nationwide footprint of more than 200 million POPs with compatible smartphones, including the recently announced exclusive One Plus 7T Pro 5G McLaren later this year. This network will be the foundation of 5G coverage layer for New T-Mobile, part of the overall layer cake of available low, mid and high band spectrum for 5G that will be a game-changer for consumers. New T-Mobile's nationwide 5G will be able to cover more people in more places and work indoors and out unlike Verizon and AT&T's current 5G networks, which can be blocked by things like walls, glass, and leaves, and this is all while we continue to expand our 4G LTE network coverage and deliver industry-leading performance. We've caught up to AT&T and Verizon, and now have 326 million Americans covered with 4G LTE, nearly 99% of the U.S. population. And we now have 311 million Americans covered by low band spectrum, both 600 megahertz, and 700 megahertz combined. So needless to say, we continue to make great progress on our network and can't wait to get 5G into the hands of consumers. We spent the better part of the last seven years changing wireless for good. And with the network capabilities of New T-Mobile, we're going to take on carrier to an entirely new level. So I think it's time we start sharing some of what we mean by next level. I won't say any more today, but please mark November 7, on your calendars, because we are going to announce our first Un-carrier move for the New T-Mobile, sharing some of our plans and commitments for the future. That's right, New T-Mobile, Un-carrier 1.0. November 7, stay tuned. Okay, to wrap up; I couldn't be more excited about our performance this quarter. We continue to work towards closing our merger with Sprint and do so without skipping a beat in our business performance. Q3 2019 was another blockbuster quarter for T-Mobile and our unprecedented momentum continues as we gain postpaid phone share and deliver record financial results. Our increased guidance shows that we remain confident in our outlook for 2019. Circle November 7 on your calendar. You won't want to miss it. Okay, time to ask CFO, Braxton Carter, to take us through the financials and our guidance for the remainder of the year. Braxton? Braxton Carter : Thanks, John. I continue to be so excited about the prospects for New T-Mobile as well as our continued operational excellence. Let me get into some of the financial details of the quarter. Net income amounted to a Q3 record of $870 million and diluted earnings per share was a $1.01, both up 9% year-over-year. Net income benefited from higher operating income and lower interest expense. The effective tax rate amounted to 27% for Q3. For 2019 as a whole, we continue to expect an effective tax rate in the range of 25% to 26%. Note that net income and EPS were fully burdened in the third quarter by the Sprint merger-related costs of $128 million and $0.15 per share after-taxes, respectively. These costs $159 million before taxes are excluded from adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA amounted to a Q3 record of $3.4 billion, up 5% included leasing revenues of $142 million versus a $176 million in the prior year. Recall that adjusted EBITDA in Q3 2018 benefited from a $138 million of hurricane-related reimbursements net of costs. The adjusted EBITDA performance is a reflection of strong cost management, especially for SG&A. Cost of services as a percentage of service revenues increased by just 50 basis points year-over-year despite the continued rapid rollout of 600 megahertz spectrum. As expected, there was a significant sequential ramp in cost of services due to this roll-out. SG&A as a percentage of service revenues decreased by 30 basis points year-over-year despite the increase in merger-related costs. Excluding the Sprint merger-related costs, SG&A decreased by 150 basis points year-over-year despite the headwind of $83 million from the amortization of commissions from the new revenue recognition standard relative to last year. Free cash flow increased by 27% year-over-year to $1.1 billion due to a 91% increase in net cash provided by operating activities, partially offset by an 11% increase in cash capex to $1.5 billion. Free cash flow in Q3 included $124 million of merger related payments. Excluding these merger-related payments, free cash flow would have been $1.3 billion. Branded postpaid phone ARPU amounted to $46.22 in Q3, essentially flat both sequentially and year-over-year. We expect branded postpaid phone ARPU in full-year 2019 to be down approximately 0.7% to 0.9% compared to full-year 2018 within our generally stable envelope. This implies a sequential and year-over-year decline for Q4 2019. This decrease was driven in part by a reduction in the non-cash, non-reoccurring benefit related to data stash as a majority of impacted customers have transitioned to unlimited plans. In terms of customer quality, our results from the third quarter continued to be outstanding. Total bad debt, expense, and losses from sales of receivables were $102 million or nine -- 0.92% of total revenues compared to $128 million or 1.18% of total revenues in the third quarter of 2018. Bad debt in the third quarter included certain one-time benefits and we expect a seasonal uptick in the fourth quarter. Now, let me get to our 2019 guidance. We expect branded postpaid net customer additions to be between 4.1 million and 4.3 million, up significantly from the prior guidance of 3.5 million to 4.0 million. This guidance takes into account our long-term strategy to balance growth and profitability, a continuation of the lower switcher volume we've seen in recent quarters in our pursuit of growth adjacencies. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $13.1 billion to 13.3 billion, increasing the midpoint from our prior guidance range of $12.9 billion to $3.3 billion. This guidance takes into account leasing revenues of $550 million to $600 million in 2019, unchanged from prior guidance. It also takes into account our network expansion, in particular, the 600 megahertz and 5G rollouts. Pre-close Sprint merger related to costs before taxes are expected to be between $125 million to $150 million in the fourth quarter. These costs will again be excluded from adjusted EBITDA, but will impact net income and cash flows. We now target cash capex of $5.9 billion to $6 billion, up $200 million to $300 million from the high end of our prior guidance range. This includes capitalized interest, which is now expected to amount to approximately $450 million in 2019. The higher capex guidance reflects our rapid rollout of 600 megahertz setting the foundation for our accelerated plans to launch the first nationwide 5G network with more than 200 million POPs later this year. We continue to expect free cash flow to increase at a three-year CAGR of 46% to 48% from full-year 2016 to full-year 2019, unchanged from the prior range, even with the step-up in cash capex. The CAGR for the underlying net cash provided by operating activities is now expected to be 36% to 37%, up from 33% to 35%. Our free cash flow CAGR guidance does not assume any material cash inflows from securitization going forward and it excludes payments from merger-related costs. Now, let's get to your questions. Please note that we cannot answer any questions related to the upcoming millimeter-wave auction, that's Auction 103, due to the quiet period around this auction. You can ask questions via phone or via Twitter. And we'll start with the question on the phone. Operator, first question, please? Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Michael Rollins of Citi. Michael Rollins : Thanks, two questions. First, can you talk a little bit more about the sales productivity in the quarter, and if you're seeing anything different in terms of where the customers are coming from or what types of plans they're taking? And then secondly, with regards to the process with the state AGs, are there a couple of common pushbacks or concerns that you're learning about across the states that are involved with the litigation? And is there an opportunity for the Un-carrier 1.0 for the New T-Mobile to potentially address some of those questions or concerns? Thanks. Mike Sievert : Sure. I want to take the productivity question first, and then the -- absolutely, I'll jump in with just a quick overview, Mike. No big changes here. What's going on is you're seeing our continued progress into the suburbs, into the prime suburban families, into greenfield towns, and into segments like older Americans like military. And that has been a trend for the last two or three quarters, and you saw that continue. You also saw a record low Q3 churn. And as John said in his comments, this quarter, we were not only at the best levels we've ever seen for Q3, our overall postpaid churn when you look at the whole postpaid business which is not something we normally disclose, we focus more on phones, was the lowest in the industry, again, lower than Verizon, lower than AT&T. So that takes some pressure off the activation engine and you can see that start to translate into efficiencies in our business, which is terrific to see. This morning, we doubled down on that same strategy, this time with a breakthrough new offer for first responders. And it follows our very successful mold of really focusing on military, which we've been at for quite a few quarters now and really winning hearts and minds, and I think doing great work for military families and saving them an incredible amount of money. Today, we turned our attention with that same kind of value proposition that can really make a difference for families for first responders. And we're really excited about that and continuation of our strategy of doing well by doing good. So that's the first one. John Legere : Yes. On the second question, I can tell you, it's been a fascinating year and a half whether it's been in Congress or the Senate or FCC and the DOJ, and now the state attorney generals. We violently agree on all the things that are important -- all the things that are important to the states and violently agree of what the New T-Mobile can do. So, if you think about the federal agencies, they've now approved -- the expert agencies that have approved this deal, it's been about ensuring 5G investment and 5G build and rural coverage and broadband competition, concerns about pricing, concerns about the low end of the market. And what we've been able to do as you've seen recently with both Colorado and Mississippi is once you speak to these individual attorneys general about their state and the things that are important to them, they see that what they are concerned about is committed to nationally and can be tailored for them, so have been very good discussions and we continue to have those. They continue to center around 5G, and the build and pricing and around DISH as a competitive player, which certainly we have been very aggressive with the consent decree on positioning for that. So, we feel very good about the conversations and where they're headed. And we feel very good and confident either in the process of a settlement or even going to trial and having the case seen well. And to your point, certainly the kinds of things that the New T-Mobile will signal that we will do, whether it'd be an Un-carrier move or the plans that will start to unveil, they are very powerful items of discussion with the states as well, because they answer the main question. So, it's all coming together in that fashion, stay tuned, good discussions continue, and as I said, we may -- we remain very optimistic and confident about the creation of the New T-Mobile. And yes, I think, November 7, might add a little bit to the conversation. Michael Rollins : Thank you. Mike Sievert : Thanks, Mike. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Simon Flannery : Great, thanks very much. A question on the 600 build-out, I'm not sure if Neville on, but just you've done $200 million, I think, Braxton had referred to capex being front-end loaded, so what's the pacing from here to get to $250 million and more over the next few quarters? Is this something where it's going to be slower to go and how should we think about the expectation there? And then Mike coming back to your comments on the first responder, could you just size that opportunity for us, what you have today and what you think the opportunity there is? Thank you. Mike Sievert : Doesn't Neville at least get an attaboy for the $200 million\u2026 John Legere : Already it's $250 million. Mike Sievert : [Multiple speakers]\u2026in Miami, yes. I know. Simon Flannery : Yes. Congratulations, Neville. Yes. Mike Sievert : Obviously, we're very pleased with the progress we've made on 600 megahertz. And it's really adding to this phenomenon low band footprint that we've assembled over the last three to four years. I mean, John referenced it 311 million people now covered with low band and then we continue to grow that number as we like that more and more of the 600 megahertz. And 26 million customers now with the 600 megahertz phone in their hands starting to really reap the benefits of a lot of new spectrum that we can bring to the U.S. consumer, both in LTE and 5G. As we said many times, this is the foundational layer or the layer cake, with the New T-Mobile. As we combined with Sprint, it's critical to what we plan to do. With that fabulous combination, super excited about what we can bring. And so, to your question, yes, no slowdown on 600 megahertz. As we move into 2020, we obviously look to continue to build out that footprint across the nation. And remember, we have nationwide, I mean, fully coast to coast spectrum here that we can leverage, and it's a key part of the commitments that we've made to the FCC and many others in terms of our build-out of 5G services and LTE. Big, big push on rural for us within this footprint. We've been building this thing almost from the outside in, because we have to clear broadcasters in the major metros that are sitting on that spectrum. With much of that work done now, we're ahead of the schedule materially compared to the original schedule that was put in place in partnership with the FCC three years ago, and so real great benefit coming through not just in metros, but across the country and specifically in rural. So, we're on it. We're building. We are building now, we're building through the quarter, and we'll be back at it again in 2020. John Legere : And Simon, Matt Staneff is here our, Chief Marketing Officer. Maybe, Matt, you can talk a little bit more about the first responders. Matt Staneff : Yes, great. Hi, Simon. So the way I like to think about the first responders' offer is that we're approaching this, the same way that we approach 55+ Unlimited Military. They're both segments in the marketplace that we don't have large share coming in; in fact we haven't had as robust an offering for first responders as we do now. Like we did with military, we came in with a very aggressive offer to serve those consumers in the marketplace, a way stronger and more compelling than what competition has. So we expect to see similar results on it. But I will say, there are less first responders in America than military and veterans. We won't see quite the same degree of business result on the whole, but to the segment, we expect to see similar outcomes. Simon Flannery : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Phil Cusick of J.P. Morgan. Phil Cusick : Thanks. Maybe we can talk about the network build, a little further, Neville. The -- some of the tower companies have been saying that you guys have been pulling back, which doesn't seem to fit with the speed of your deployment and the higher capex. Can you try and square that for me, first of all? And then can you give us any update on discussions with DISH around leasing that 600 megahertz, how should we think about that going forward? Thank you. Neville Ray : Somebody want to take the DISH lease? John Legere : Yes. You do the first part. Neville Ray : Yes. So, Phil, on 600 megahertz, I mean we're ahead of plan, and we're very clearly ahead of the goals that we had at this point in time for the year. And any activity that's modifying or modulating in the field is just us working towards that capital envelope. You heard from Braxton, I mean we are above plan on cash capex for the year. So we've done a lot more than we plan to do inside 2019. And it just makes sense for us not to keep running at 1,000 miles an hour when we have these other considerations to take into account. I said, we're still building, delighted to be ahead of plan and delighted that we can light up what will be the first nationwide 5G network here in the U.S. before the end of the year. That's a key opportunity for us as part of what we're going to do with the New T-Mobile here. Mike Sievert : Yes. And let me add, Phil. You know, our long-term philosophy is that we deliver on the commitments that we make to all of our stakeholders. And threading that needle on a year-after-year basis, while also trying to bring the goodness of the rollout of the 600 megahertz as quickly as possible has resulted in more of a front-end loading a capex. You'll see similar trends next year. We are super excited, and we'll roll out our full guidance for 2020 on our year-end earnings call. But I would expect similar types of patterns just as we are deploying 5G and getting all the goodness of that $8 billion we have invested in the 600 megahertz. John Legere : Yes. On the second part as the consent decree and the items have been disclosed cover, we are having discussions with DISH about potential leasing of some of the 600 megahertz spectrum. And frankly, it's a real opportunity for a win-win, or almost call it found money. And so it's a chance potentially for a revenue stream for DISH before their spectrum is used. And for us it can have a significant positive impacts to us if the price is right, especially from a standpoint of migration. So never say never, one thing that we become experts at in the last year is negotiating with DISH, and it's difficult process, but I think in this case, there is a real win-win possibility for both sides. And with that said, we're not done yet, so we'll keep you posted. But it's a good opportunity that we're both interested in. Phil Cusick : Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Jonathan Chaplin of New Street Research. Jonathan Chaplin : Thanks for taking the question. John, I think if you put your learnings or negotiating from DISH into a book, it will become a best seller. I think that'd be -- there'll be lots of other readers of that [ph]. A question for Braxton, actually. The -- with cost of service without the network investment you're making have been relatively flat. And what's driving the increase in cost of service? is that -- are you increasing your site count, is it more cells, or is it amendments you're making on a -- on existing sites as you put 600 megahertz up? And then finally, what's the trajectory of that over the course of the next sort of two to three years? Is there another increase similar to what we've seen next year if you do 5G, and then it flattens out, or there on a growing trajectory like this for a few years? Braxton Carter : Yes, it's a great question. And the answer to your question is a little bit of all that. What we've done over the last couple of years and this isn't a new phenomenon about the absolute dollar increases in the cost of services. We rolled out the full geography of the U.S. and got to equivalency with AT&T and Verizon on geographical footprint. And now we're rapidly rolling out the 600 megahertz. Remember that Neville was visionary here once again and push the OEM and the ecosystem to develop a dual-banded radio that could boast -- address the 600 megahertz and address 5G with a software download as he was deploying the 600 megahertz. We certainly have more work to do. You've heard the 200 million POPs, which is base for nationwide coverage, but obviously we have the spectrum, we have the wherewithal, and this rollout will continue in the upcoming year. And we'll give a really detailed guidance just as we have on the cost of service on both of the last year-end calls. But it's not a permanent step function change that's going to happen here when you're looking at year-over-year. We're in a period of unique investment, and I think we're doing it extremely efficiently and well thought out. And I want to thank Neville for that too because doing the 600 megahertz and going back and overlaying 5G and climbing those towers again would have been a very, very expensive proposition. John Legere : I just pile on Jonathan, everything Braxton said, I mean, the key areas mainly... Braxton Carter : The visionary partner. John Legere : ...the visionary partner, he mentioned to me -- yes, obviously. So the overlays obviously, we're hanging new radio and so that's a major driver of lease amendments and so on. We continue to do small cell work and material pace there. And the other piece is, we're upgrading a backhaul. We are building connectivity here for a 5G world. And so we've done a lot of work to get ourselves ready multi-gig circuits, I mean, making sure that our backhaul is there as the radio comes on board. And as we combine with Sprint and create this enormous traffic and supply capability into the market, we need to make sure it's not just a radio story, it's also that we have the end-to-end capability. And so backhauls another piece of after play, and making sure we're fully ready for the opportunity that we can bring now in 2020. Jonathan Chaplin : I'm glad you explained all that Braxton, because I thought I heard somewhere in the original question towards I've never heard used together, Neville and slow down. And I don't think we'll ever hear those. Braxton Carter : For everyone [ph]. Jonathan Chaplin : Thank you, guys. Mike Sievert : Thanks, Jonathan. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Brett Feldman : Yes, thanks for taking the question. I mean, you're obviously racing ahead of your competitors in terms of deploying 5G coverage. I'm curious how do you plan to message the benefits of 5G to consumers? How is that going to change as you start to incorporate Sprint's deep spectrum portfolio? And then ultimately, are you willing to offer consumers incentives to try 5G on T-Mobile? Thank you. John Legere : Just wanted to clarify, you said, we are racing ahead of our competitors in deploying 5G coverage. Was that -- can we just -- did I hear that right? Brett Feldman : Correct. Mike Sievert : Yes. Brett Feldman : Yes. John Legere : Actually, we've come up with a few ideas. First of all, we've decided to label it 5GE, and we've decided that no matter where we deploy our 5G, we're refusing to show it in maps. So outside of those two innovative ways. But yes, Mike, now would you want to? Mike Sievert : Well, I'd say a couple of things. One is, I think you saw the power of when you can get your partners with the mainstream devices to adopt your technology as we were just talking about responsibly to the last question, how quickly that can benefit consumers, and you're seeing that right now with the 600 megahertz. We're delighted that our major partners with the big flagship devices, were able to get our 600 megahertz LTE technology on the devices last year, and as a result, we now have 26 million people with that technology in their hands. And I think that bodes very well for us as we think about our future in 5G, which again we have a big opportunity to get the ecosystem aligned. And I don't think it's going to take incentives to get people to try T-Mobile 5G. They're going to move to it very enthusiastically. Our strategy is going to look -- so as John was just saying, our strategy is going to look so different from our competitors. They're doing -- in particular, Verizon is making a bet that people will want versions of 5G that work in some places, very limited places and don't work in most places versus a 5G that works nationwide and that were willing to back with maps. And that's the beginning of a journey to the premise of your question. When you combine it with where we're going in the New T-Mobile, the journey towards the only 5G network that is both broad as we're talking about at nationwide and everywhere, and deal with transformational capacity and speeds that really can change the use cases for our consumers in very profound ways. It's a little early to predict all the applications and innovations. But I can tell you one thing as somebody that's been close to software, innovators are going to choose the network that's both broad and deep, that relies on having 5G everywhere. You're going to see use cases that are designed more to our way of thinking than to Verizon's way of thinking, which is that some people want 5G in a few places to be very high capacity and everywhere else, you'll be relegated to LTE. I don't think that will inspire the same kind of mobile innovation that we're going to see the T-Mobile -- the New T-Mobile network inspire. John Legere : I'm going to take one or two of the questions that are coming in and -- because it's still -- one of them steering in the -- right in the face. And Walter [ph], I have to say, I don't know why, but I'm looking at your new Twitter handle @WaltLightShed, and I just keep thinking of at @BuzzLightYear. I mean -- it's something I don't know why. I think that's kind of cool. But I'm going to kind of touch on one of your questions. There is a question came in, no comment about extension of Sprint merger agreement in TMUS press release that expires on Friday. And I would give you this feedback, Walt, that Sprint and we are currently focused on working very diligently to complete the last remaining steps to be able to close the merger in early 2020. And I think that says everything that we need to say about that date. Let's see. Do you want to take Bill Ho's -- Bill has been a diligent center in -- of questions, and it's -- last time we take one is, interesting question about prepaid, maybe. Yes. So one of the questions that Bill sent in is, for many quarters, prepaid seems to have lost its competitive edge and big growth, talk about the landscape and any changes in prepaid strategy. I'll just say something brief and Matt, if you want to pile on. It's not so much that prepaid has lost something. It's -- I think that postpaid has been growing at the expense of prepaid and that's probably great for the industry overall. So these things aren't really two different things. They are just two parts of one industry that has very positive trends that are fueled as much as anything else by the strong economic conditions that we're seeing. More people are qualifying for postpaid and therefore you're seeing postpaid grow at the expense of prepaid. The other dynamic is we've seen over the last year and a half cable entrants have come in and they have also chipped away at the prepaid market and added to the postpaid side. Two years ago, there were no cable net adds. Now, when you take cable and you add up the three major players, they had more net adds reliably than Verizon, the second most of anybody, except T-Mobile. So that's another dynamic that has caused postpaid to grow at the expense of prepaid. Matt, anything to add there on industry dynamic? Matt Staneff : Yes. The only thing I'll add on that one is, we've been pretty consistently growing our prepaid business in the face of these things, Mike talked about, our strategy is one of competing in every market segment and consistently taking share there. The other thing that I'll expand on is that -- the other thing that's been occurring is this long credit expansion. Credit scores are at record highs. We know customers are continuing to seek things like device financing etc. So I believe we're well positioned to continue to compete in this environment, as well as the environment changes in the prepaid space and postpaid. John Legere : Okay. Operator? Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson. Craig Moffett : Yes, hi. The Sprint was found by the FCC to be -- to have a large number of [Technical Difficulty]. A \u2013 Mike Sievert : Craig, we lost you. I don't know if you're still there. Operator : Mr. Moffett, are still with us? Nils Paellmann : Okay, let's go to the next one. We can come back to Craig, if\u2026 A \u2013 Mike Sievert : And I was really hoping to complement Craig that before I even get my second cup of coffee out this morning, he had already come up with the tag line for AT&T's earnings, which is hope is not a strategy. And I found that to be amazing. And I am hoping that there is a similarly positively cynical thing that he has got in store for us. And I would bet $50, he was on an AT&T phone [indiscernible]. Okay, we'll come back to -- and, operator, I fear the next participant, but let's take the next question. Operator : Yes, sir. We'll take our next question from Walter [ph] of LightShed. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks, John. I'm going to start with Neville. The deal obviously has taken a bit longer than we all had hoped, I guess. So Ray, -- and this time, I think we're all expecting to be investing in that huge swap of 2.5 spectrum. So if this thing continues to drag on into early 2020 or perhaps you have to look at a plan B, if the deal isn't approved, where does that money go, which spectrum bands do you think will be first up versus the 2.5 spectrum? Obviously, you're going to continue to invest in the 600 megahertz, but which other spectrum should we'll be looking at in terms of your mid-band investments? Neville Ray : I'm not sure my head even floats there, Walt, so it's all about -- there's only one plan and that's combining with Sprint. And as you said, -- I mean time -- in some ways, he has been our friend here because my team is more prepared than ever to rapidly roll out the 2.5 gigahertz radio and spectrum the Sprint has. And long pole in the tent was going to be jurisdictional processes. So we are in a position with deal closure, where we can start to rapidly deploy that spectrum. 600 megahertz as we said is the others -- the foundational layer. We've continued and we'll continue to work on our millimeter-wave story. But you know our spectrum mix, and as I said, it's all about combining with Sprint. That's all that sits in my head. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. And then Mike, -- 2014 was obviously a huge year, and then if you go back to kind of the gross adds, the ebb, and the flow in terms of some years you're growing, other years it's churn. And obviously, in the last year, there has been this great churn improvement, getting your churn below T, obviously, you'll probably be under Verizon soon, but there is obviously some diminishing marginal returns and getting that churn lower. I mean, they're going to get it so low. So should we look at 2020? I mean you talked about this New T-Mobile Un-carrier thing. Should 2020 be a bigger gross add year? Or should we think about lower postpaid phone net adds as far as the trajectory going forward, just given that you kind of pull the lever on churn as far as we can? Mike Sievert : Well, we'll guide on 2020 at the appropriate time. But just a couple of the broad trends, right. One, you're right, we've had some phenomenal tailwinds on churn. I mean, we now have churn that's better than AT&T's. Our churn is in line with Verizon's. If you look at total postpaid, it's actually below Verizon's. So we're arriving at that industry best. And that's not to suggest that the tailwinds are necessarily epic, but we have to be aware of we are arriving at industry best. Neville said $200 million on 600 megahertz, that leaves $100 million -- some million [ph] to go. And a lot of customers, 26 million have the handsets, a lot of customers don't. So there's lots of benefit on the network side, lots of benefit on the customer experience side that we can continue to bring to the fore. The other piece is that we're experiencing structural low industry churn, which is both good and bad. We see the good side of it and that we don't have to spend so heavily on activations as many activations, but on the other hand, it decreases, our opportunity. And the good news is that we have the chance to win one way or the other. Take a potential 2020 with a 5G super cycle of phones and elevated switching and elevated upgrades versus today, if that were to happen, there'll be more gross adds in the market. And as you know, we are the net share winner in this market. And so, if there aren't structural reductions in churn next year, we can look to other parts of the growth equation like activations because the two happen to go hand in hand. So the real question is, how do we compete in the competitive millimeter [ph]; and as you saw, we took 48% of postpaid phone net adds this quarter. And as long as we can continue to manage both sides of the equation, churn and activations, then we'll be able to thrive, whether it's a low structural churn a quarter or a higher structural churn a quarter. John Legere : By the way, I just want to point out that while he's asking multiple questions on the call, whilst typing in more questions online. Operator? Unidentified Analyst : John -- again one on the line, John, because I want to sneak one last one on CPUC. If let's say, you get, New York and California on board, onboard, are you going to wait for the CPUC, or just before waiting for them? John Legere : Go ahead, Dave Miller. David Miller : It's my mic on here. Thanks for the question. No, we're confident that the CPUC approvals will be obtained in a timely fashion. Unidentified Analyst : That was such a great loyal answer, thanks. I'm not sure relates to the question, but okay. All right. Thanks. David Miller : All right. John Legere : The timelines do look like they sort of line up. Mike Sievert : Okay. I hear that Craig Moffett is back. Operator? Operator : Yes, sir. Our next question from Craig Moffett. Craig Moffett : Verizon wireless call dropped, sadly. I wanted to ask about Sprint. Sprint was found by the FTC to have a large number of fraudulent lifeline accounts and that could be as much as a $5,000 per account or per line penalty if it is found to be fraudulent, which I think could be up to about $4.5 billion. Have you learned anything new about the disposition of that inquiry at the SEC, and how might in -- and how might that in anyway affect the merger if there is in fact a significant liability? John Legere : Yes. I think, Craig, what I'm going to have to say is that I'm not going to comment on another company's ongoing investigation that's not closed yet. Craig Moffett : Can you just say in the -- as a hypothetical in the event that there is a liability would it affect the merger in any way? John Legere : Yes. I think I'm not going to comment on this topic. Apologize for that. Craig Moffett : Okay, fair enough. Mike Sievert : Okay. Operator? Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Kannan Venkateshwar of Barclays. Kannan Venkateshwar : Thank you. I guess a couple, first, when we look at the 5G go-to-market strategy, I mean there has been a lot of action recently around bundling video. Verizon this course announced the deal with Disney+. I think you guys have a deal with QB and Netflix, and you signed deals with Viacom. So when you think about video as a part of your overall strategy, could you just expand on how you're thinking about it, the plans with layer three going forward and how that fits broadly into your 5G strategy? And secondly, from a deal perspective, is there something that would cause you to renegotiate the price outside of the question that Craig just asked, I mean, are there other variables we're thinking about from a price perspective when it comes to the Sprint deal? Thank you. John Legere : Let's do a couple of things. I'll start that first comment and then Mike can give a more substantive discussion about video. I mean, I'm glad you brought that upfront because I would just -- I would start by saying there is absolutely no comparison for a offer of one year of Disney versus a lifetime Netflix. Length isn't the same, value isn't the same and certainly, the substance of the offers isn't the same. So I think it's not exactly a something other than the vice president of copy and paste at Verizon looked over at our Netflix, on us success and did a horrific job of creating it. And I don't know, last time I checked nine out of 10 people that watch Disney cartoons don't make wireless decisions. But the Little Mermaid will be a good one. But flattering nonetheless, we've seen this all throughout the Un-carrier journey, where we do something authentic, something bold, something permanent, it makes a big difference to people's lives. And then you see our competitors scramble to copy it. And that's certainly what you saw last week with Verizon. By the way, we think Disney+ looks like it's going to be a great service. This isn't a statement about Disney, this is a statement about how Verizon took something we're doing and did such a poor job copying it. Mike Sievert : Or just by me. John Legere : Yes. And -- so we'll have to see what happens there. But for us, it does indicate as people start to copy our moves, it shows that they understand that our moves are working. Since we made Netflix on us, one of our most famous Un-carrier moves a year and a half ago, it's been terrifically successful. And it's something that our customers love and that they believe we have a role in their video live and in their mobile video subscriptions, and in their consumption. See, at the premise of your question, that has emboldened us as we think about the next steps in the strategy. We announced a strategic partnership with Quibi, the initiative formed by Jeffrey Katzenberg, and led by Meg Whitman, and we're very excited to be partnered with them. You mentioned our Viacom partnership, and they're plenty more opportunities, because in this world as it's changing, consumers are faced with an exciting world of OTT video, but a confusing one. And we have shown through Netflix on us that there is a role that they trust us to play in helping them choose, helping them authenticate, helping them pay for their video choices. And we think we've got a great strategy here. It's going to be mobile-focused. It's based on taking our T vision brand and really helping customers make great choices in this area and bringing them great value. And you see that right from the beginning of the strategy with Netflix on us itself. Mike Sievert : Yes. And on the second part, not being invasive, but I'm sure you probably didn't expect us to really answer some of these questions. A couple of things are important with Sprint. We've been partners in this transaction for a long time, working side-by-side and in a very cooperative way. And we really are working diligently to close these final issues and get across the finish line and create the new T-Mobile. I would say that any of these items that pop up, any of these deadlines, any of these issues that come up as a partner, we have and will have discussions on the fairness associated with handling those. But that's certainly not anything that we'll kind of report on publicly. But they've been a great partner and if there are issues that we need to work together, we'll work together with them to solve those. And if we do have any items to announce, you'll be the first to hear. Kannan Venkateshwar : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Colby Synesael of Cowen. Colby Synesael : Great, thank you. Just one. Some of your competitors of late have been focusing on ARPU lift, whether that's come through other fees or it's come through the variety of different unlimited plans to which they offer. And when I look at your ARPU, really the last few years continues to come down. How important or a big of a focus is driving ARPU growth over the next year so for you, and how might you be able to go about doing that? Thank you. Braxton Carter : Yes. You know Colby, it's -- the right way to look at this and we've talked about this numerous times in the past is we're pursuing a strategy of generally stable ARPU. And that's defined as plus to minus 1%. For the last two years, that's been minus 1%. We just gave guidance today that we're going to be less than minus 1% for this full-year. But it's a deliberate strategy, when we're doing things like segment penetration, that might be dilutive to ARPU, but increasing a higher CLV an MPV into the business. That's a trade-off well worth making. And I think we've demonstrated over the years that our consistent balance between growth and profit -- profitability in the generation of true significant ramping cash is really what drives the value here. If we were a scale predatory duopoly, yes, that's probably what we'll be doing. That's not what we're doing. We have amazing unlock from a margin potential coming with continuing to scale this business organically or inorganically, and we're not going to stop. I mean it's long-term stated philosophy and I'm very pleased and proud of the team, how they are executed this year. John Legere : I think Braxton, we've made a brand on providing more or less, and very -- we are in the wireless industry, I believe we are the reason why the duopoly are not consistently raising price in ARPU at their leisure as they always did. Some of the things that you refer to we will not do. We will not go add aimless taxes and fees simply to raise revenues or ARPUs, no trickery like the big guys are doing. And I think if you look at the cable industry is an example of what happens when an industry is unchecked with the Un-carrier of the industry like we are. Pretty clearly if you look at the results of those players, what they're doing is they're losing video customers, buying wireless customers and gouging broadband customers because, in the broadband, they have no competition. That's what it looks like when you play that game. We look forward to going into that industry as well. But our role in this industry here is to make sure that AT&T and Verizon just can't indiscriminately decide to raise ARPU, and that's a role we'll play, a much more focused on that. Okay. Operator, I think we probably have one more. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Mike McCormack of Guggenheim Partners. Mike McCormack : Hi, guys, thanks. John, maybe just a quick comment, you mentioned the cable operators had pretty good results this quarter, [indiscernible] very little price point. How you sort of view them as a competitor? And then I guess also on the competitive front, Verizon seems to have turned up the engine a bit in 3Q, and best we can tell 4Q, it seems like it's off to a pretty good start for them. Do you expect any change there; is there pricing going to create an impact on any other player in the marketplace to react to that? Thanks. John Legere : Yes. I mean there's a lot in what you said, right. And then certainly the market responded well to some of what they saw from the cable players. But just to point out a number or two, right. So Charter had 276,000 net additions. They gained $192 million of revenue. But their EBITDA loss on that was $145 million and the free cash flow loss was $256 million. So that's what happened in their wireless. But of course, they were able to raise price on the broadband because of the lack of competition. All thesis too early to know, right? Their plans are targeted towards Optimum and Suddenlink customers, all 100 of them. And it -- so there is a price associated with that customer base slightly higher. So we haven't seen that yet. Certainly, we have a partnership in the New T-Mobile with Altice that Sprint does has as well. But I think it's too early to call. One thing, it's not too early to call, is that both Comcast and Charter and I assume Altice have become significant factors in the wireless industry. And probably more so at the height of Verizon thus far. And you can see, if you really dug deep into Verizon's earnings, most of their increase in revenue came from a wholesale, which was probably driven by the success of their MVNO partners, the cable companies. So it's an interesting item. We ran right through this quarter. We take them very seriously. We think we've got some competitive advantages. And on Altice, too early to tell, but we'll certainly keep an eye on. Anymore \u2013 anything, Mike? Mike McCormack : That's great. John Legere : Okay. Mike Sievert : Okay. Well, thanks, everyone for tuning in. We very much look forward to speaking with you at the end of next quarter in our full-year earnings, and we'll talk to you then. Thank you. Operator? Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the T-Mobile US Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. If you have any further questions you may contact the Investor Relations or Media departments. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect and have a pleasant day.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Nils Paellmann, Head of Investor Relations for T-Mobile US. Please go ahead, sir. Nils Paellmann : Thank you very much. Welcome to T-Mobile's fourth quarter 2019 earnings call. With me today are John Legere, our CEO; Mike Sievert, our President and COO; Braxton Carter, our CFO; Neville Ray, President, Technology; and other members of the senior leadership team. Let me just read the disclaimer. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements that include projections and statements about our future financial operating results, our plans, the benefits we expect to receive from the proposed merger with Sprint and other statements that are not historical facts.  Such statements are based upon the current beliefs and expectations of our management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties outside of our control that could cause our actual results to differ materially, including the risk factors set forth in our annual report on Form 10-K. Reconciliations between GAAP and the non-GAAP results we discuss on this call can be found in the Quarterly Results section of the Investor Relations page of our website.  In addition, in connection with the proposed transactions on July 30, 2018, we filed a registration statement on Form S-4 with the SEC related to the merger. The registration statement became effective on October 29, 2018, and it's available on the new T-Mobile website. It contains important information about T-Mobile and Sprint, the merger and related matters. With that, let me turn it over to John Legere. John? John Legere : Okay, well done, Nils. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to T-Mobile's fourth quarter and full-year 2019 earnings call and Twitter conference, coming to live from beautiful sunny Bellevue, Washington. We've got a lot to cover today and we're going to do it a little bit differently. So, first, let me start with what everyone is curious about, and that's the deal. The state AG trial has concluded and our team did an incredible job making our case and backing it up with the facts. We are 100% convinced that this merger will result in a more competitive market with lower prices and a better network for customers. As New T-Mobile, our plans have not changed. We plan to build a transformational 5G network that will unlock a massive amount of capacity, 14 times more than T-Mobile today. Now, we're waiting the judge verdict and we remain confident in a positive outcome. We firmly believe that the facts are on our side. And while I'm sure there are questions around the remaining steps in the process, including financing, outstanding regulatory approvals and the final resolution with Sprint and the business agreement, we are actively working those decision points as appropriate, but we don't plan to answer specific questions related to the deal process on this call. Now, as you all know, Mike Sievert and I have been working on the CEO transition as he prepares to take over the reins on May 1. I've said it before and I'll say it again. This company will be in great hands with Mike and the rest of the senior leadership team we had so carefully assembled. This CEO transition is the culmination of a comprehensive multiyear succession planning process that I've worked on with the Board of Directors. As you can see from our results today, we continue to fire on all cylinders and will absolutely remain a disruptive force, solving pain points and delivering value to customers.  So, today, I'm going to hand the call over to Mike who will take you through the results of Q4 and the full year. But before I officially hand the mic to Mike, I couldn't pass up the opportunity for a quick teaser. Yep, that's right. we're working on another Un-carrier announcement. Our team of evil geniuses are hard at work on plans to announce our next Un-carrier move that should come later this quarter because you know we'll never stop changing this industry for the better. Stay tuned for more and let the speculation games begin. All right, Mike. And turn it over to you. Mike Sievert : Thanks a lot, John. As John mentioned, it's an incredibly busy time here as we continue to work on our merger and clearly continue to simultaneously deliver outstanding business results. As you all know, we pre-released our incredibly strong customer results in early January, and once again led the industry with over 1 million branded postpaid phone net customer additions in Q4 despite continued strong competition, particularly from Verizon and big cable. For the full-year 2019, we reported 3.1 million postpaid phone net adds and total postpaid net additions of 4.5 million, well ahead of our increased 2019 guidance range of 4.1 million to 4.3 million. And I'm proud to let you know that the financial results that we're reporting today are just as strong, beating our guidance range for both adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. Our team continues to stay focused and deliver all-time record financials quarter after quarter, all while working on our pending merger. So, let's dive into those amazing Q4 and full-year results. First, let's start with our financial since that's newly reported for all of you today. Service revenues hit an all-time record high, reaching $8.7 billion in Q4, continuing to grow by more than 6% year-over-year. Total revenues increased 4% year-over-year to $11.9 billion in Q4, also an all-time record high.  We hit a Q4 record high adjusted EBITDA of $3.2 billion, up 9% year-over-year. For the full year, adjusted EBITDA amounted to $13.4 billion, up 8% percent year-over-year and comfortably beating our increased 2019 guidance range of $13.1 billion to $13.3 billion. We also delivered strong net income of $751 million in Q4, up 17% year-over-year. Free cash flow, excluding payments for merger-related costs, was a record high, $1.5 billion, up 21% year-over-year. For the full year, free cash flow, also excluding payments for merger-related costs, amounted to $4.8 billion in 2019, up 31%, yet another record high. The best part is that we posted always these strong financials along with great customer results. We gained share and we're the only one to beat expectations for service revenues and adjusted EBITDA during Q4.  We always said that customer growth would lead to revenue growth, which would lead to growth in EBITDA and ultimately free cash flow, allowing us to continue to invest in our customers and our network. These results reflect our success in exercising financial discipline to bring growth and profitability as always, and show that our winning formula continues to benefit consumers and shareholders alike. 1.9 million total net customers joined the Un-carrier movement in Q4. That makes 27 quarters in a row we've had more than 1 million total net customer adds per quarter. We added over 1 million branded postpaid phone customer customers in Q4, well ahead of our competition in a very competitive quarter. We continue to make inroads into our growth adjacencies. T-Mobile for Business is now present in over half of Fortune 500 companies. And in 2019, we added over 2,000 new logos across enterprise and government. Also in Q4, we announced, if you'll recall, Un-carrier 1.0 for New T-Mobile where we outlined not one, but three major initiatives focused on utilizing the tremendous 5G capacity of the New T-Mobile network, to deliver 5G for good, including the Connecting Heroes initiative where we've committed to providing free services to all state and local law enforcement and EMS agencies. And I might add, we've already seen a tremendous response, with over 2,000 agencies nationwide signing up for more information. And this Project 10Million, which is designed to eradicate the homework gap over five years. And of course, T-Mobile Connect, slashing our lowest price plan in half. We're immensely proud of these groundbreaking initiatives and can't wait to bring them to the market with the New T-Mobile. So, turning back to our results, in a seasonally busy and competitive quarter, we reported branded postpaid phone churn of 1.01%, up just 2 basis points year-over-year. This 2 bp increase in churn compared favorably to all of our peers and our postpaid phone churn was better than AT&T for the fifth quarter in a row.  The slightly higher churn was more than offset by higher branded postpaid phone gross adds, which were up 5% year-over-year in Q4 in, again, a very competitive climate. And we grew both sides of the business, with branded prepaid net customer additions of 77,000 in Q4. This momentum brings us to 68 million total branded customers and 86 million total customer connections, including wholesale as of Q4 2019. That's approximately 53 million more total customer connections since the launch of the Un-carrier. Underpinning all of this is our best-in-class care team. Since Callie Field and team launched Team of Experts, T-Mobile has won the J.D. Power Award for Customer Care every single time. And this morning, we announce we've done it again, earning another record-breaking score in the latest J.D. Power US Wireless Customer Care Full Service Study. This marks the 19th time T-Mobile has ranked highest, more than anyone in the industry of the study, and T-Mobile has done it again, the third time in a row, setting a new record-breaking score. I have to reiterate this point. These results further demonstrate our ability to aggressively compete and take share, while continuing to execute on our long-term strategy to balance growth and profitability. Okay. Let's talk network for a moment. As you know, Neville and team launched America's first nationwide 5G network in early December, covering more than 200 million pops and more than 1 million square miles right out of the gate, a stark contrast to Verizon's fragmented 5G strategy to sprinkle 5G connectivity across 20 some square miles in select American cities. Having already launched three 5G capable smartphones last year, including two in December, that can tap into our nationwide 5G, we anticipate offering an industry-leading smartphone portfolio built to work on nationwide 5G this year. These new devices, including 5G smartphones from major OEMs, are expected to operate across multiple spectrum bands, giving us an advantage over Verizon which is focused almost exclusively on millimeter wave 5G. We're looking forward to a potential 5G device super cycle given our lead in nationwide 5G coverage.  And let's not forget, this is all while we continue to expand our 4G LTE network coverage and deliver industry-leading performance. Our coverage reach is at parity with AT&T and Verizon, with 327 million Americans covered with 4G LTE as of Q4 2019. Our low-band spectrum investment, both 600 and 700 MHz combined, continues to deliver for consumers with 316 million Americans covered by low band as of Q4 2019. We have more than 33 million devices that are 600 MHz compatible already on our network today, which is live in nearly 8,900 cities and towns in 49 states and Puerto Rico. We've made tremendous progress on the rapid deployment of our 600 MHz spectrum over the last year, more than tripling the number of cities and towns we cover. This deployment covers 1.5 million square miles and approximately 248 million pops. And you know we won't stop. Okay. So, to wrap up, I couldn't be more excited about our performance this quarter. I hope you can tell. We continue to work towards closing our merger to create the New T-Mobile and we're doing so without skipping a beat in our business performance, much to the frustration of AT&T, Verizon and big cable. Q4 2019 was another competitive quarter for T-Mobile and our unprecedented momentum continued as we gain postpaid phone share and delivered record financial results yet again. And for the full year, we beat our guidance for 2019 in terms of total postpaid net adds, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow, while continuing to balance growth and profitability.  Our guidance for 2020 that Braxton will talk about shortly shows that we remain confident in our standalone outlook. But, of course, it'd be that much more exciting to successfully close this merger and begin rapidly delivering those vast benefits of the merger to America's consumers. Well, okay. It's time to ask the magenta cowboy himself, Braxton Carter, to take us through the financials and our guidance for 2020. Braxton? Braxton Carter : Thanks, Mike. I really appreciate that. First of all, I just want to say I'm so excited about the future prospects of T-Mobile. We've got an amazing team of winning combination and we're here to create continued value over the long run. I'm super proud to report the wrap up of 2019, but more importantly to give you a view on 2020 on a standalone basis, which is very, very strong guidance. First of all, strong net income, amounted to $751 million in Q4, up 17% year-over-year. And diluted earnings per share was $0.87, up 16%. The effective tax rate amounted to 22% in Q4. For 2019 as a whole, the effective tax rate amounted to 25%, at the low end of our 2019 guidance range of 25% to 26%. For 2020, we expect an effective tax rate in the range of 26% to 27%. Note that net income and EPS were fully burdened by the Sprint merger-related costs of $105 million and $0.12 per share after taxes respectively. In the fourth quarter, that was the impact. Please note that. These costs, $126 million before taxes, are in fact excluded from adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA amounted to a Q4 record of $3.2 billion, up 9% and include leasing revenues of $153 million versus $168 million in the prior-year. For the full year, adjusted EBITDA amounted to $13.4 billion, up 8%, beating our updated and increased 2019 guidance range of $13.1 billion to $13.3 billion. The adjusted EBITDA performance reflects strong cost management, especially in SG&A. SG&A as a percentage of service revenues decreased by 70 basis points year-over-year in Q4 despite the increase in merger-related costs. Excluding the Sprint merger-related costs, SG&A decreased by 100 basis points year-over-year in Q4 despite the headwind of $93 million from additional amortization of commission costs relative to last year from the adoption of a new revenue recognition standard in the prior-year. Cost of service as a percentage of service revenues decreased by 10 basis points year-over-year despite the continued rapid rollout 600 MHz spectrum. Reported free cash flow increased by 15% year-over-year to $1.4 billion in Q4 due to a 61% increase in net cash provided by operating activities, with cash CapEx relatively flat year-over-year at $1.2 billion in Q4, including capitalized interest. Free cash flow in Q4 included $133 million of payments from merger-related costs. Excluding these merger-related payments, free cash flow would've been $1.5 billion. For the full-year 2019, reported free cash flow amounted to $4.3 billion, up 22% year-over-year. Excluding payments for merger-related costs of $442 million, free cash flow would've been $4.8 million, well ahead of our 2019 target range of $4.5 billion to $4.6 billion. Therefore, the actual three-year free cash flow CAGR was 49%, beating our guidance range of 46% to 48%. Branded postpaid phone ARPU amounted to $45.79 in Q4. For the full-year 2019, ARPU amounted to $46.04, down 0.8% year-over-year, right at the midpoint of our 2019 guidance range of minus 0.7 to minus 0.9.  As mentioned last quarter, this decrease was driven in part by a reduction in the non-cash, non-reoccurring benefit related to data stash as the majority of impacted customers had transitioned to unlimited plans by the third quarter. For 2020, we expect ARPU to continue to be generally stable in the range of plus to minus 1% compared to the full-year 2019. In terms of customer quality, our results for the fourth quarter continued to be strong, with total bad debt expense and losses from the sale of receivables of $128 million or 1.07% of total revenues compared to $118 million or 1.03% of total revenues in the fourth quarter of 2018. For the full-year 2019, total bad debt expense and losses from receivables were 0.97% of total revenues, down 8 basis points year-over-year. Starting in Q1 2020, we plan to report average revenue per postpaid account or postpaid ARPA, in addition to the existing ARPU metrics, reflecting the increasing importance of non-phone devices to our customers.  We also plan to discontinue reporting wholesale customers and instead focus on branded customers and wholesale revenues, which we consider more relevant than the number of wholesale customers, given the expansion of M2M and IoT products. Now, let's come to our exciting 2020 guidance. Since we don't know the outcome of the deal yet, this is our standalone guidance for 2020. And I'll comment \u2013 you know our playbook. In seven years, we have never not hit or exceeded our guidance. And over the last several years, in addition to consistently increasing our growth guidance on a quarterly basis, we've also done it with other key financial metrics. We expect branded postpaid net customer additions to be between 2.6 million and 3.6 million. This guidance continues to consider our long-term strategy to balance growth and profitability and the continuation of the heightened competitive environment we have seen recently. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $13.7 billion to $14 billion. This guidance takes into account leasing revenues of $450 million to $550 million in 2020. It also takes into account our continued network expansion, in particular the 600 MHz and 5G rollouts. Pre-close Sprint merger-related costs before taxes are expected to be $200 million to $300 million in the first quarter of 2020, which does include approximately $150 million of consent fees payable to Sprint if the merger does not close. These costs will be excluded from adjusted EBITDA, but will impact net income and cash flows.  I'm really excited about this. We target cash CapEx of $5.5 billion to $5.8 billion. This excludes capitalized interest, which is expected to be approximately $400 million in 2020. All in, our cash CapEx guidance is $5.9 billion to $6.2 billion, which leads to a very strong free cash flow picture. Free cash flow for 2020 is expected to be in the range of $5.4 billion to $5.8 billion in 2020 excluding payments for merger-related costs.  The underlying net cash provided by operating activities is expected to be in the range of $7.9 billion to $8.5 billion excluding payments for merger-related costs. Our free cash flow guidance does not assume any material net cash inflows from securitization. Also note that we are expecting 2020 to have a similar seasonal development of free cash flow as in 2019. With a lower free cash flow in the first quarter, ramping in later quarters based on a cash CapEx profile that is heavily weighted to early in the year, similar to 2019. Now, let's get to your questions. Please note that we cannot answer any questions related to the millimeter wave auction due to the quiet period. You can ask questions via phone or via Twitter. We'll start with the question on the phone. Operator? First question please. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from John Hodulik with UBS. John Hodulik : Great, thank you. Maybe a couple of questions on the guidance for Braxton. Looks like the guides for EBITDA at the midpoint gets you to about 4% growth for the year. And I think that's versus about 8% what we saw in 2019. Is that just some conservatism built-in or is there some extra cost built-in for the super cycle maybe that Mike referenced in the call? And maybe, if so, what that might look like? And then, similarly, on the CapEx side, it looks like the network CapEx is being guided for down slightly on a year-over-year basis. It was sort of our belief that, on a standalone basis, you guys would need to ramp up the expenditures on small cells and additional capacity. So, I'm just wondering if that number is the number on a standalone basis going forward or something else. That would be great. Thanks. Braxton Carter : Yeah. Great question. So, first of all, my intro into the guidance, I talked about our playbook. We have always approached our guidance to the Street in a conservative manner. And on a quarter-to-quarter basis, as we execute and perform during the year, we step it up as appropriate. For last two years, there hasn't been a quarter that we have not stepped up adjusted EBITDA. But there are other things that you need to consider. First of all, the headwinds from the new revenue recognition standard where you have the amortization of the commissions over time. That affects the year-over-year comparability. So, you have to take that into account. Next, we are continuing a very aggressive rollout. It's amazing what happened during 2019, what Neville and the team accomplished on the 600 MHz rollout in 5G. We have very large aspirations for this during the year, which does drive more OpEx into the question. You've got to build it [indiscernible]. So, that's all embedded in your guidance. So, as to your question on the super cycle, we are the only carrier who didn't have a dip in upgrade rates in the fourth quarter, and that's a really good thing because upgrading is reinvesting in the value proposition. And we have sized what we believe will be the upgrade outlook for the upcoming year in our guidance.  When it comes to the cash CapEx, yes, there is a slight dip. But remember that a lot of what we do is project oriented. And now that we have rolled out the extent of low band tops, we're shifting those dollars into 5G and continued rollout of the 600 MHz. There's a baseline spend, but every year we've had a project and those projects roll to other areas. We believe that we've adequately designed this cash CapEx guidance as it's similar to last several years, will be at the very high end of that guidance, and I think that's an appropriate way to look at it. But we do believe we can accomplish everything we need to do with that guidance. Great questions. And glad to provide the additional detail. John Hodulik : Thanks, Braxton. Operator : And our next question comes from Phil Cusick with J.P. Morgan. Philip Cusick : Hi, guys. Thanks. Two if I can. Typically, your promotional in Q1 when others are quiet. Can we assume that the new Un-carrier announcement could play into that? And then, Neville, what do you see an average 5G versus 4G experience for customers so far? Can you talk about utilization of the 5G network today and how customer experience should change if that network fills up? Thanks a lot. Mike Sievert : I can start on the first one and maybe see if Matt wants to add some color. What we like to be when it comes to our promotions is unpredictable. And you're right, if you looked in the past, there had been some 1Qs where we've come out swinging because we know other people aren't and that's worked out very well for us. But here we said almost half time, I don't want to lay out for you the rest of the quarter owing to the \u2013 the main part of the strategy being, we like to be unpredictable. We did teaser an Un-carrier move.  And I will say that, if you looked at the broad picture of our Un-carrier moves, they don't always signal price. What they signal is solving pain points. Sometimes there's promotional intensity involved with that. Sometimes there's not.  But we're really excited about this one. Pain points in this industry are far from solved and we'll be demonstrating that yet again before the quarter's out. Anything to add, Matt? Matt Staneff : The only thing I'd add to that is what you saw in Q4 and what we did is, when the market heats up, competition gets bigger, we end up doing what we do every day, which is winning the market share and take share as we go forward.  What we've done with the network where we're poised and positioned with 600 MHz and our nationwide 5G, we absolutely want to take advantage of that. And if that means stirring the pot and getting competition going, then we're going to keep doing some of that in Q1. John Legere : Now, we dare to turn to Neville Ray to discuss the comparative 5G experiences that he sees. And for those of you that need a short break, I would suggest now would be a good time. Neville Ray : And all the other people that wanted to ask a question, thank you for [indiscernible]. Philip Cusick : Neville, this is the last time you're going to get that from John. So, take it in a friendly way, right? Neville Ray : I doubt that, Phil. So, no, I'll be super quick. Obviously, we're incredibly excited about launching the first nationwide 5G network in the US. Gives me great pleasure every day to hear about AT&T and Verizon trying to catch us at some point this year, maybe next. But we've gone and laid down that first nationwide layer of 5G. So, huge accomplishment. We had to do an incredible amount of work to open up kind of the FDD kind of door on deploying 5G in sub 6 GHz. So, kudos to the team that made that happen and super important for our business to position ourselves there. What's coming through with that, Phil, is new spectrum, right? This isn't just about rolling out 5G at T-Mobile. We're rolling out all of that 600 MHz spectrum that we secured in an auction not too long ago. So, we're adding new spectrum, new capacity.  Back to the capital question, all of this 5G rollout, we're deploying and future proofing this network. So, we've come a long way right now with the 5G experience. Everything we do is incremental, right? With dual connectivity on top of our LTE layer. So, when we add that 5G goodness on top of what we have in LTE, bringing in some markets 30 MHz, 40 MHz of spectrum coming in now with 600 MHz deployment. So, a lot of that going into rural America, places that have been traditionally badly served, never got 4G until 10 years after the New Yorks and LA got it. So, we're spreading the 5G goodness all over the US.  So, super excited. The incremental experience is good. But we're just getting started and we have a long, long way to go. Obviously, with the closing of the transaction, the hopeful closing with Sprint, you're going to see an incredible layer of depth of spectrum, especially in metro and urban areas to start going in on top of what we've done with 600 MHz 5G.  So, [indiscernible]. It's way too early to talk about how much utilization there is. We're seeing good pickup on the two devices we launched in December, but it's very early days still, Phil, for the industry. Mike Sievert : Can I say one more thing, Phil, while we're on this topic. You're bringing together two interesting topics \u2013 network and promotional intensity. And I want to point out one thing, which is these results that we announced for Q4, a million postpaid phone net adds, leading the industry significantly, again, we're in an environment where what we were talking about with all that competitive intensity out there was these topics that Neville just talked about. We were talking about the network, much to the credit of Matt and Janice and their marketing and communications teams. We spent a higher percentage of our dollars and our energy on network than I can remember. And yet, delivered in-quarter results in a promotionally intensive period when we weren't talking about the other topics, the promotional topics as much. We're laying a foundation and telling people about this differentiation that we have and the fact that we've caught up with the competition on network and are poised to spring ahead of them in 5G. So, that's very exciting. John Legere : What Mike really meant to say is, Matt and Janice did that, while he and I were in Washington and in court for the entire quarter. So, we really do mean it was led by them.  The last thing I'd say is, I like the talk about the Un-carrier move. And Un-carrier moves always signal one thing, which is a really bad day for Verizon and AT&T. To me, that's in and of itself worth every single moment. Nils Paellmann : Wade Philpott [ph] wants to know what's up with Neville's shirt. Neville Ray : Nothing's up with this shirt. That's the future, right? John Legere : Wade, we'll send you one. I really feel like we should take one of Walt's questions because if we don't, he's going to just keep putting them up there. We can wait. Any of these Walt questions you want to take or should we wait? Okay. All right. Well, keep typing away. We'll go back to the phones. We'll get to you. Operator : And our next question over the phones comes from Michael Rollins with Citigroup. Michael Rollins : Hi, thanks. During the opening comments, you referenced competition from big cable and Verizon during the quarter. And I was curious if you could frame the competitive impact that you saw them have and how your strategy is evolving, whether it's geographically or customer verticals that keep the subscriber growth going? And just secondly, on the subject of content bundling, can give us an update as to what the content bundles are doing for your base and for your economics, whether it's with Netflix or Amazon Prime? Thanks. John Legere : I'll start and throw it your way, Mike. Let me say, the simplest way to think about it is Comcast and Charter had good strong quarters, spending shit loads of money to take customers from Verizon. And I think that's \u2013 at the highest level, you can see \u2013 when you pay $160 million of loss in your wireless business to gain about 270,000 customers that are coming mostly from Verizon, certainly not from us, there's a lot more to it. But, Mike, you want to pick up? Mike Sievert : Yeah. They seem to be duking it out. Over this journey of seven years, we've seen every circumstance of competitive intensity. And I will say Q4 and Q3, to a certain extent, these were highly competitive periods. And you see, as John says, Verizon responding to cable, cable responding to Verizon, you see the prepaid kind of floundering except T-Mobile's where we grew yet again. And what's interesting is, while there have been changes over there, there haven't been changes over here. And we've been saying pretty consistently that our model flexes for more competitive periods than less competitive. In a less competitive period, you have falling churn. And we lead the pack in falling churn. In fact, even in this competitive period, we had the best year-over-year churn performance relative to our prior year.  But when it's more competitive and switching picks up, that's an opportunity for us because we have more jump balls to go after. So, we don't hear competition. You saw Verizon posting at great expense to their EBITDA, by the way, some of the best growth numbers that we've seen from them in years on customers. And yet, our numbers were as good as ever. So, it's not coming from our side, but they're all duking it out over there. I'm curious about Verizon's approach. They've definitely got the pedal down on growth and they're spending a lot of money to get there and missing expectations on EBITDA, all while loading up a network that's out of capacity. To us, that's fascinating. Love to see what becomes of all that. But one thing you should take some assurance of, it's not coming from us and doesn't affect our approach really much at all. John Legere : It's important remember too is, if you look at the overall results of the big cable players, they're bleeding video customers. So, they certainly, in a portion of their business, understand the concept that they haven't had to learn about yet in wireless, which is churn. This is pretty much low-hanging fruits, subscribers coming in, bleeding video customers, skimming off some wireless customers. But once churn comes back around the block, customers won't forget who the most hated companies in America were and still are. So, we look forward to that. Mike Sievert : It's another learning. There's the churn for cable companies and then there's the consequences of Pogo Palooza [ph] that I think will have to figure out what happens in the market. Verizon definitely led the way with Pogo. Some of the rest of the industry responded. We do those promotion sometimes. But over the years, we've learned through a variety of different things that we do, what kinds of promotions cause sticky customers that last, that are real and fundamental and what kind are kind of round trippers. And a lot of this stuff that we see happening led by Verizon and the Pogo Palooza does raise real questions as to how real are those added customers, how long will they be around, will there be a bounce back phenomenon, if some of the \"market growth\" on the postpaid side of the equation really just that artifact. And those are unknowns. But, again, it doesn't affect our strategy. We've been down some of those roads in our past and we're very focused on what we're doing, which is taking legitimate share from AT&T and Verizon. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Simon Flannery : Thank you very much. Good evening. A couple of questions for Mike on the subscriber projections. How are you thinking about the key verticals around things like regional expansion, enterprise segments, 55 and over? Where do you see the opportunities to drive that? Is changing from what you did this year as well? And then, for Neville, how does CBRS play into your strategy and dynamic spectrum sharing? Thanks. Mike Sievert : Yes. Simon, on that customer front, you're going to see a continuation. And by the way, the strategy that we've been outlaying for you is really working well. You didn't mention it, but T-Mobile for Business is firing on all cylinders. We saw the biggest quarter in our history in the enterprise segment. And there's been a change too in how enterprises are engaging with us. First, it was small and medium where we had a right to win. Then we started a couple of years ago wedging into enterprise discussions. But, honestly, our role was more as a price cut. We were getting a little piece of enterprise business in exchange for offers that really police their main contracts with AT&T and Verizon. Suddenly, over the past year, and particularly the past couple quarters, there's been a change. We shared a couple of the numbers with you in our remarks. Big enterprises, strategic engagements out of the corner office, are partnering with us across the enterprise. And that's really exciting for us. It's a testament to the network progress that we've made and the solutions that we've developed and our team's tenacity at working our way into more strategic relationships. That's something we're very excited about. You mentioned suburban and rural growth. Obviously, very important. Over 55, military continues to contribute. So, these adjacencies, if you will, have been part of the strategy now very clearly for over a year-and-a-half. And one of the reasons why we have a business that's able to deliver a million postpaid phone nets in an environment where some of the competitors like cable and Verizon are duking it out with each other, we're able to generate more growth than their past. And it shows the resiliency of our model. So, thanks for asking that. Neville Ray : So, Simon, two questions. You had the CBRS. So, obviously, the unlicensed stuff is moving into \u2013 we can freely deploy that now with some of the sharing mechanisms out in the market. The auction on the license segments, so the 70 MHz coming up for auction mid-year, so we know a lot about CBRS already. We see it as primarily a small cell spectrum layer. It has some material limitations. Not so much from the sharing, but from power limitations, but there's something there. And so, it joins the toolbox, so to speak, and we have unlicensed, other opportunities we continue to explore and expand upon. So, it's in there. I don't think it's going to be transformative. I think we all know that. But it can be helpful. Your second question was on dynamic spectrum sharing. So, that's the ability to share both LTE and 5G on a common radio. We've been a key proponent and driver of that technology, but it's late. Clearly, for us, we are in a position where we can deploy 5G as we demonstrated on our low band spectrum because we have new spectrum today. We've not had to wait for DSS to mature as Verizon is, for example. Verizon is stuck today. They don't have the ability without DSS to really deploy. In low band, they don't have enough spectrum to go do it. What we're seeing, unfortunately, as you know, we are seeing some vendor delays there. There's a lot of information coming through as we start to fully test software and capability in the future. And it's to be a tough year on DSS. We'll keep pushing. The industry will. But, certainly, there's of the major vendors right now that's very late on delivering that capability. The good news for us is that we clearly, as we've demonstrated, don't have to wait for DSS for our low band deployment. John Legere : Okay. I'd like to take one of these questions that came in from one of our favorite fans, Kyle Romanoff [ph]. And Kyle \u2013 fascinating question. He said, even win the Super Bowl past, Verizon is continuing to spend heavily on their ad campaign, pitting their LTE network against T-Mobile 5G. You guys plan to keep responding. Could it potentially be a promotional response from T-Mobile? We can probably talk about this on multiple different layers. One is, let's not just go past the Super Bowl because it was a huge embarrassment for Verizon. The amount of money that they spent and how badly they failed to show anything in their 5G and the gratuitous commercials they tried to run which flopped miserably and, of course, we came right back with a lot of information in a blog, pointing out the fallacy of what they're talking about, but also talking about \u2013 and maybe even Matt can show his t-shirt because he had a very good fight with Verizon and knocked them out. Yes, tell your mama is a feat. You guys want to talk a little about this at all that, Matt. Matt Staneff : I think, first of all, isn't it so amazing that Verizon feels the need to try and poke at T-Mobile for being the leader in coverage \u2013 in 5G coverage and what we have on a nationwide basis. It's a great question about a potentially promotional response. I don't think there's anything promotional in nature in doing what we've done with our 600 MHz network in 5G and having that nationwide. We're going to continue to do what Mike said, which is tell the story to everyone across America that T-Mobile is here, our coverage is amazing, significantly better than I thought it was. And when you couple that to our industry-leading \u2013 for a very long time \u2013 customer service and value proposition, there is no other choice but to come to T-Mobile. So, that's going to remain a consistent piece to how we go at this. Neville Ray : But one last thing for me. It would be fun to run around the country and show where Verizon's 5G doesn't work. That would be, I think \u2013 it would be millions and millions of square miles compared to maybe the few hundred thousand square miles, if that where they have coverage today. We're proud of where we are on 5G. And fool can run around and find somewhere where wireless are low on a network. We beat Verizon on LTE speeds today with our LTE. And with our 5G on top, we're even better. Them is the facts. If they want to find a street corner somewhere where that they can navigate something different, so be it. John Legere : I think Neville's been doing a very good and responsible job helping the country understand what 5G is and what it isn't. It didn't take long for people to not fall for the 5GE debacle from AT&T. And the more that Verizon doubles down on their position that 5G is millimeter wave, the time is going to come \u2013 you can poke fun at a nationwide layer of 5G in low band, but when that's combined with the mid band capability and millimeter wave and you start to see the applications that require a full capability of all three, that's when you realize that they're playing a different game and they're stuck and just keep asking them, please explain to us how millimeter wave alone can deploy 5G capabilities. Super Bowl is fun, but there's a serious dialogue taking place.  And I think last thing I saw was Verizon stock has been downgraded because people don't see any catalyst for where they're headed. We're very clear that what we're doing with the low band, it's a start and it's a piece of a puzzle. But when the puzzle is done, we win and consumers win and it's going to be huge. So, thanks, Kyle. We just used your question to say whatever we wanted about Verizon. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Brett Feldman : Thanks for taking the question. Braxton, if I look at the standalone guidance you've given for this year, even if it is conservative, this is an outlook for a company that would be organically de-levering to EBITDA growth and material cash generation. Obviously, plan A for you guys right now is to close the deal with Sprint, but I'm sure as a contingency you've thought about how you would allocate and prioritize that capital going forward if you were to remain standalone. How do you think through the right calls in that capital under that scenario? In other words, does it make sense to sustain dry powder, to evaluate whatever spectrum opportunities could evolve? You had previously had a capital returns program. Is that something investors should be thinking through? Anything you can do to help us think through the way you and the board prioritize, that would be very helpful. Thank you. Braxton Carter : Really good question. First of all, we're going to win this deal. And remember, with New T-Mobile, we're fully funding a business plan to get us through the three-year period where we're unlocking $6 billion run rate of synergy, which is going to be a massive value creation. We did pause $9 billion board approved buyback when we entered into the transaction with Sprint. But we've been very clear about $9 billion. We're only $1.5 billion into it, in that very unfortunate for America situation that we would return capital to our shareholders. Our focus has totally been on closing the merger. We have not finalized any phasing or reallocation. That was a multi-your program. Remember, it was a $2 billion, $3 billion, $4 billion program. And right now, it's academic as again we believe that we're going to close it. But if that fact does come to fruition, we will certainly be out to the Street with guidance and how we're looking at it. You're right. We're going to be looking at spectrum opportunities on a standalone basis as part of the equation. We have to explore. There's numerous potential opportunities. It was nice to see some of the C band stuff out today. But there's a lot developing in this area and more to come if that's where we end up. John Legere : I'm going to take one of the write-in questions, one of the 72 that Walter Piecyk has sent in because I think there was some confusion on this point by a number people. He says the merger agreement \u2013 meaning with Sprint \u2013 was never updated. Does that mean that any change in deal price is off the table? A number people were confused. When the long stop date of the business combination arrangement agreement came on 11/1, the BCA was still in effect. We have a fully in effect BCA. But at 11/1 without an amendment, either party has a walk away right. So, in effect, the partnership is still strong, we just have not updated it to remove the walkaway ability.  And, no, it doesn't mean that we can't. We've had a very strong partnership with Sprint. We've had very good discussions. And if there is a need for an amendment to the BCA, including possibly a price, we would handle that very swiftly after the deal was approved. So, I hope that explains the nuance there.  Okay. I think we've got some more time. Operator? Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson. Craig Moffett : Hi, thanks. John, in the event that the deal is not approved, would there be room for you and Sprint to do a spectrum sharing type of deal? It seems like the $2.5 billion has obviously been a very big part of the appeal of the transaction. I can imagine there's a lot that Sprint would need if the transaction didn't happen. John Legere : I made two points. One is, the deal will be approved. Point number two, the deal will be approved. But, obviously, to your question, if the deal was not approved, there are certainly a myriad of things that Sprint and we could consider doing to harbor some of what would've taken place when the companies come together. But point four is that the deal will be approved. Craig Moffett : Given that the deal will be approved, then I want to ask a different question. AT&T talked about possibly joining the negotiations for an MVNO agreement. Would you ever do that? And under what circumstances for cable, I mean? After you having bashed cable, would you accept them as partners? John Legere : Yes, we would. In the New T-Mobile, we've been pretty clear on this, I think, which is the New T-Mobile has \u2013 is all about capacity, just an unprecedented expansion in network capacity. And so, our job is to build that network up economically. Already we have a pretty lucrative wholesale business, but in standalone, we have diminishing capacity and our best use of that capacity is with our branded business. So, growth aspirations are more modest there. In the New T-Mobile, we have a real interest in growing the wholesale side and the retail side of the business. So, we'd entertain it. Absolutely. And we've indicated that as well through the process. Craig Moffett : Okay, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Peter Supino with Bernstein Research. Peter Supino : Hi. On the subject of SG&A, the long arc of T-Mobile has included terrific margin gains, but has been driven more by cost of sales, cost to serve in SG&A leverage. This year, I guess, with the merger expenses, I think there was a little bit of leverage for the year and more for the fourth quarter. And I'm wondering, as you look forward, on your current trajectory, is there a more significant SG&A leverage opportunity as the company matures? Braxton Carter : I think the answer is absolutely, yes, there's opportunity. First and foremost, when you look at SG&A, you have to understand that, in our business model, where there is a cost to bringing the subscribers on. And I know you very much appreciate that the level of growth that you're obtaining has a direct correlation to the selling expense intensity associated with the business. And if we were more a mature, slower growing business, you would actually see an explosion of margin and significant scale in the SG&A line. But we are and have been a very significant growth company, the only significant growth company in wireless other than the cable guys who are now coming into the space. But when you put that aside, there are other efficiencies, and it's just part of our DNA to look and evolve the process and never be complacent and comfortable with the status quo. And there are other opportunities even in a high-growth area. It's one of the great things about the Sprint merger is the inorganic scale that we get is a massive unlock. But even without that, there are certainly an expectation of margin expansion as we continue to grow and scale organically with the business. And your point on the efficiency of our cost to service, our network expenses, in the early years, we were selling great efficiency there. But remember what we're doing right now, we have fully edged out and have a nationwide geographically equivalent area in the US, and that took a lot of additional OpEx to do so. We did it with the low band spectrum. But now we're rolling out the 5G. And I think this is a phenomena you were going to see with a lot of carriers, with some of the scale efficiency on the network side the equation in this transition period will be somewhat impacted. But even with that said, you saw scale from a cost of service standpoint. So, bottom line, yes, expect continued margin progressions. And that's one of the things we're super excited about with the New T-Mobile, is there is a massive unlock of margin protection. And my final comment there is, you look at the difference in the margins between AT&T, Verizon and T-Mobile, it's all scale. I can guarantee you we're more efficient at what we do and what they do and that's the power of that inorganic scaling opportunity that we have [indiscernible]. Peter Supino : Operator : And moving onto Rick Prentiss with Raymond James. Ric Prentiss : Good afternoon. Two questions, guys. First one, when will the judge let us know what you already know that the deal will be approved? When are you expecting a notice from the judge? John Legere : Just to be clear, we know we are going to win, we just don't know when. And we really done. We could guess and speculate, but we are hoping it's imminent. But it could be whatever the judge decides. So, we don't have any inside track at all as to when it will be. So, we'll keep you posted and pretty sure you will hear us loud and proud when it is, but I guess it is not today. Ric Prentiss : Okay. Second question, more media is, obviously, a lot of wireless has to do with getting spectrum, building a network, opening stores and getting the customers. You talked about your 600 MHz and your low band. Looks like about 75% of the population covered with 600 MHz, but about 50% of the geography of continental US. Help us to understand, back to John's question about CapEx and Simon's about market share, what should we think about happening with the network and the stores in 2020 and 2021 in that low band area? Neville Ray : Yeah. Thanks. Good question, Rick. Obviously, we talked earlier and Braxton talked about the major investment we are going to make from a capital perspective into the network this year and we continue to push on that 600 MHz footprint. So, as we pointed out, $200 million pops, about a million square miles. We can readily take that number up 30%, 40% in 2020. So, that footprint is going to expand materially. A lot of that reach will expand into a broader swath of the US including rural and we have a plan to go do it. It's great benefit for us. We're spreading out 600 MHz. We're getting more 5G footprint and we're adding capacity into the network. So, it's a great win for us on all dimensions. And the plan this year is all about continuing the march that we started in 2019. And I love that because I want AT&T and Verizon to be chasing my tail on nationwide 5G and what we do in 2020 for the next few years. If they get to nationwide this year, we're going to be past them. So, that's not where the line is drawn for us. We will continue to expand the reach of that network and we funded and very capable to do it. Mike Sievert : Distribution is pretty simple. Right now, we have distribution convenient to about 265 million people. We told you that number before. That's up from 230 million a couple of years ago. So, we've seen a nice expansion. And so, obviously, there is more opportunity. There's a big difference between 265 million and 327 million, which is our current network coverage. We don't have an announcement today about an expansion plan, but I would tell you just from a color standpoint, I wouldn't expect a big distribution expansion. What I might forecast is a realignment into more suburban areas and greenfield areas in small town and rural. There may be parts of this country where we are over-distributed. There is certainly an opportunity for us to go after continued expansion and making our distribution convenient to more and more Americans. And so, when we're ready to talk to you about that, we'll have some more facts. John Legere : All right, operator. So, I would say there is \u2013 we don't have the schedule yet, but there is at least a greater than 0% chance that this would be my last earnings call. So, there's nothing I'd rather do. If it is, then take the next question being the last question from \u2013 I'm not sure who it is, but let's just see if it's who I think it is. Operator : And that question will come from Walter Piecyk with LightShed. Walter Piecyk : John, I wish I could give you really something very salty for your last call, but I don't have anything for you on this one, but thank you for answering that. John Legere : We are out of time now. Walter Piecyk : Thanks for answering the one on the BCA, though. That was definitely very helpful. Mike, on the gross adds, I understand the playbook, right? But just curious, is 2019 a gross add growth year. You've talked a lot about the replacement cycle kind of maybe not extending further and 5G and assuming the merger closes, is this going to be organically another gross add or a gross add growth year for you guys? And then, I've got a follow-up on DSS for Neville? John Legere : Yeah. Walt, it depends on what happens in the competitive environment. And one of the things we've \u2013 it sounds a little bit arrogant when we say it, but the summary way I'd say it is, we'll deliver as many gross adds as we need to deliver the net add growth that our business plan requires. And we've proven over and over again we can do that. There were times through the last 18 months when churn was rapidly falling across the industry and switching was decreasing. And in order to gain the nets, we didn't have to spend your money on gross adds, we didn't need to deliver the operating performance of this business. Braxton has been very clear for years. That's all about a balance of growth and profitability and we keep that balance. And in every quarter, there is growth we could have gotten and didn't. But what happens in a period of rising churn and rising switching, that's a great opportunity for our business model because we are the net share taker and we know how to go get those adds when we need them, and those adds can get more efficient as well when there's more jump balls. And so, it's a better time to grab the growth because there is more people in the market. And so, that's a nice opportunity too.  And the truth is, we don't know, we don't know, which circumstance we're going to see, but we have a model that's confident and ready to execute whichever way it unfolds through the year. Ric Prentiss : Got it. No, John. I've got to get the DSS one because, obviously, Verizon is highly reliant on it. Neville, you're are pretty negative on DSS. Mike Sievert : You're right, Walt. That's a disappointment. You're saying the last big question for John is going to be about DSS. Ric Prentiss : Right. I'll ask John about \u2013 I'll ask him about WeWork, LightShed is in a WeWork, so we want you to come visit us since \u2013 that CEO position that was rumored. You can have some fruit water at our WeWork. But, Neville, can I ask about DSS please? Neville Ray : Yeah, sure, Walt. Walter Piecyk : You've been pretty negative on your comments here, saying it's late, it's a tough year. Are there any issues in terms of \u2013 like, one company indicates that it's just \u2013 they're waiting for it to be in a phone, is it an infrastructure issue, is it a phone issue? When is it going to be available and does it have any impact on the amount of \u2013 when it gets deployed, does it take away any capacity from the spectrum that it's getting deployed on? Neville Ray : Well, it's in the radio software, Walt. So, that's the primary area of concern right now. So, the radio vendors that supply the infrastructure will be put up on our towers, that's where the problem sits in the software there. And we're seeing as we learn more that, as you deploy DSS, it kind of eats away on the net capacity of the shared radio. And if you rush into that now, some of the early roll-outs and workarounds and pieces that we've seen are pretty corrosive and they would suck up capacity just by rolling out the feature. So, the benefit you might gain outside of saying, I've got some 5G out there, the capacity loss could be pretty brutal. What we've been working pushing on this feature, we were one of the first in the industry to drive this. So, I'm not being super negative about it. I'm just saying it's got challenges. And for Verizon, it's a big challenge.  I think you more than anybody have highlighted some of the spectrum and capacity challenges that Verizon has. I think that was a great piece you put out. And DSS is not going to materially help them. It's just going to enable them to put something out there, so they can talk about 5G coverage because, let's be honest, they have nothing on millimeter wave in terms of 5G coverage. They need something. So we'll see. Walter Piecyk : Got it. All right. Neville Ray : Right now, what we see, February of 2020, it's tough road this year. Walter Piecyk : So, what's the next gig, John? What's your next job? John Legere : It's going to be a place called LightShed. Walter Piecyk : We'd love to have you. Come have some fruit water. John Legere : Hey, thanks, everyone, for tuning in. We look forward to speaking to you again next quarter and another great quarter for T-Mobile. Thank you for your time. Operator : Thank you. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes the T-Mobile fourth quarter and full-year 2019 earnings call. If you have any further questions, you may contact the investor relations or media departments. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect and have a pleasant day.",

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jud Henry, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations for T-Mobile US. Please go ahead sir. Jud Henry : Welcome to T-Mobile's First Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. With me today are Mike Sievert, our President and CEO; Braxton Carter, our CFO; and Neville Ray, our President Technology; as well as other members of the senior leadership team. Please note that, any comments on this call related to Q1 2020 results are referencing standalone T-Mobile prior to our merger with Sprint Corporation and all forward-looking statements refer to the combined post-merger company. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements that include projections and statements about our future financial and operating results our plans, the benefits we expect to receive from our recently completed merger with Sprint, our business and operations in light of COVID-19 and other statements that are not historical facts. Such statements are based upon the current, beliefs and expectations of our management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties outside of our control that could cause our actual results to differ materially, including the risk factors set forth in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed today. Reconciliations between GAAP and the non-GAAP results we discuss on this call can be found in the quarterly results section of the Investor Relations page of our website. Let me now turn it over to Mike. Mike Sievert : Well, thanks a lot Jud, and thanks to everybody for joining in. Welcome to our first quarter earnings call coming to you live mostly from our living rooms and home offices and maybe a few kitchens across the country. And let me just start by saying, what a crazy quarter this was, and I think a really proud moment in history for our team. Over the last couple of months, we've closed one of the largest telecom mergers in history, after fighting for it for over two years. And we started by making immediate progress on our integration work to unlock the value of this combination. We transitioned our CEO office, we established a new leadership team for the company and we completely reinvented how we serve our customers, all during a global pandemic and all at an incredibly fast pace. And through it all we did it while posting some pretty fantastic business results, which is what we're here to talk with you about today. Okay. We've got a lot of ground to cover. I plan to share some early insights and thoughts about the New T-Mobile touch on the impacts of COVID-19, cover some highlights from Q1 and of course brag about some of those early wins that Neville and his team are already delivering on our network, including some really fast work the team has done to roll out our 2.5 gigahertz spectrum from Sprint in Philadelphia and in New York onto the T-Mobile network. Then Braxton will unpack the financials and we'll share some guidance for Q2. Amazingly, it's been just five weeks since finally closing our merger with Sprint and let me tell you, we're incredibly fired up about the opportunity ahead. While the process took way longer than anyone could have imagined, we took advantage of every moment during the approval process for this deal to plan for a rapid integration of these companies and we've hit the ground running. As we dig into our combined businesses, we see an opportunity to move even faster and potentially to unlock even more synergies from this combination than originally planned, opportunities like the acceleration of our retail rationalization and network integration. And we'll likely see additional upside from our increased scale in areas like procurement and potentially faster improvements in the churn rate of Sprint subscribers than planned. There's been a lot of talk about the changing landscape that we all find ourselves in right now. And I can say this about it. The value proposition and unprecedented network that we'll deliver will position New T-Mobile incredibly well to serve even more customers, particularly as the economic environment continues to change. I've said it before, and I'll say it again today, customers are not going to have to choose between a better value or a better network. With the New T-Mobile customers will finally get both. Before we dive into the results, I do want to highlight, how our company has navigated the impacts of COVID-19 so far. The way our people and this team has responded to support customers has been nothing short of heroic. And I couldn't be prouder of each and every one of them. The crisis has highlighted how crucial connectivity has become to our daily lives. And as it's unfolded in front of us, we took immediate steps to ensure our customers would continue to stay connected, while working hard to simultaneously protect the health and safety of our employees. We were one of the first to take bold steps to do our part to help mitigate the impacts of COVID-19 with wide-scale temporary store closures and transitioning employees to work remotely, including 14,000 U.S.-based care employees from T-Mobile and Sprint. We utilized our digital capabilities to enable things like virtual retail, and we introduced curbside and mobile fulfillment. Through all this transition, our frontline employees have stepped up big to support our customers and continue to deliver the industry-leading customer service that makes us different. And that has translated into record-high NPS satisfaction scores. Right out of the gate, we knew that our network would see increases in demand and changes in usage patterns. So we took immediate action to increase capacity, including temporarily doubling our 600 megahertz capacity and expanding roaming for Sprint customers. Our network has performed phenomenally, delivering excellent reliability for our customers. In fact, according to OpenSignal average LTE download speeds on our 600 megahertz spectrum actually increased significantly even during this crisis, after we layered on the additional 600-megahertz capacity. We're also a proud supporter of the FCC's Keep Americans Connected Pledge, and I really appreciate the work the Chairman, Pai and the FCC have done to bring the entire communications industry together during this crisis. As a result of our commitment, we've waived late fees and maintained service for our consumer and small business customers impacted by COVID-19, regardless of their ability to pay. Additionally, in the early phases of the crisis, we chose to lift smartphone high-speed data caps made additional smartphone mobile hotspot data available and accelerated the launch of T-Mobile Connect to support our customers, as they navigate the impacts of COVID-19. We've also donated millions of dollars through a number of initiatives to support our communities from support for Feeding America to the Boys & Girls Clubs of America, local schools and programs for our frontline health care workers. I'm really proud of what this team is doing to help across the country. While this pandemic is definitely not over, we'll continue to take the necessary steps to support our customers and do what's right for our employees and communities as things start to reopen. This will result in some continued near-term impacts to our business. Stores that have been closed temporarily obviously reduced our store traffic and subsequent retail volumes. And that impacts customer additions, service revenues and equipment revenues in the very short-term. We also introduced some operational changes to help with business continuity, which has impacted our overall performance in the latter part of the first quarter and will likely continue in the second quarter. As the nation starts to emerge post COVID-19, customers across the industry will likely be looking for better value in a tougher economic environment and we'll continue to be there for our customers when they need us most. It's who we are and it's what our Un-carrier brand stands for. I expect that AT&T and Verizon customers will most certainly be looking to get out from under their high monthly bills in search of a better value. And it's likely there will also be an increase in churn from today's low levels as the carriers won't be able to keep themselves from squeezing customers who are already budget constrained. These factors will likely mean more switching across the industry as things change, and we will be there to help. We know from the past that T-Mobile does disproportionately well in an environment with larger pool of switchers. We're a proven share taker, and I intend to keep it that way. We will be there for our customers with prepaid and postpaid products that are geared to their needs, particularly in a time of constrained budgets. And we expect to consolidate our marketing and new offers under the T-Mobile brand later this summer, just as this switching opportunity starts to come to life. Okay. Time for a few T-Mobile stand-alone highlights from Q1. Let's start with our main business driver, branded postpaid phones, where we once again led the industry in growth with 452,000 net customer additions in Q1. Not that I'm counting, but that's 25 quarters in a row of leading the industry, this time with about 70% of the combined industry growth, which is approximately double the sum total of the rest of the industry combined including Big Cable. Total branded postpaid net additions were 777,000. And prepaid net losses were 128,000, yielding 649,000 total branded net adds for the quarter. One of the things I'm most proud of is our customer experience obsession at this company, which in part shows up in our branded postpaid phone churn numbers. We posted a record Q1 low of 0.86%, down 2 basis points versus last year and down 15 bps versus last quarter. I'm also really proud of our team's ability to deliver our financial results, while simultaneously taking care of our customers and employees during these difficult times. We've said it for years, investing in customers leads to customer growth, which leads to revenue growth, which if we run the company well leads to EBITDA and cash flow growth, which we invest right back into our customers and their network experience, which is what started the success cycle in the first place. Our financial results in Q1 show that this winning formula continues to benefit consumers and shareholders alike. Service revenues in Q1 hit an all-time high of $8.7 billion, up 5% year-over-year, more than twice the growth rate of the next best big provider. Adjusted EBITDA also hit an all-time record high of $3.7 billion, up 12% year-over-year despite the environment created by COVID-19. Free cash flow, excluding payments for merger-related costs, was $893 million, up 37% year-over-year. Now let's talk about the foundation of our New T-Mobile growth story, our network. Despite COVID-19, Neville and his team are hard at work expanding the network footprint and quality and continue making incredible progress. Our network continues to perform. And that's being amplified as we integrate Sprint's spectrum, putting us on our path to build the world's best 5G network. The whole process will take about three years to complete, but our team was able to take advantage of the extended approval cycle to get moving on a lot of the site leasing and permitting work ahead of time. Combining the spectrum holdings of T-Mobile and Sprint, the New T-Mobile controls 319 megahertz of combined low-band and mid-band spectrum nationwide, 319 megahertz. New T-Mobile's combined low and mid-band spectrum is nearly double that of AT&T and nearly triple that of Verizon. It's no wonder they spent the last two years fighting the merger behind the scenes. And while AT&T and Verizon are depending on millimeter wave spectrum for their 5G strategy. Well, we have that too with over 1,000 megahertz of millimeter wave spectrum more than AT&T. We're ready to leapfrog the carriers and network capability. And you know what? They know it. In fact, we've already started deploying our 2.5-gigahertz spectrum on the T-Mobile network and Philadelphia is already live with peak speeds of over 600 megabits per second in our tests. And just yesterday we went live in New York City as well. And there will be many more other cities we'll light up in 2020 and beyond. For Sprint customers, we're delivering an enhanced network experience by significantly expanding access to the T-Mobile network to improve coverage as well as 5G availability. More than 80% of the Sprint postpaid phone base has compatible handsets today, and we are seeing a big increase in weekly roaming on the T-Mobile network as a result. Finally, we remain hard at work on all the network projects, you heard us talk about over the past year. Recall that, we launched America's first nationwide 5G network on 600-megahertz spectrum in early December, covering more than 200 million people right out of the gate. We have 215 million people covered with 5G today, recently lighting up 5G in Detroit, St. Louis, Columbus, Ohio, and just this week we turned up the Bay Area of California as well. So before I hand it over to Braxton, let me just say this. In the face of unprecedented adversity, we delivered another record setting quarter while simultaneously driving changes across our business to deliver for our customers and close one of the largest telecom mergers in history. We rose to the occasion and hit the ground running in our first five weeks as the New T-Mobile. We feel more confident than ever about our ability to unlock the massive synergy potential of this transaction and we already see opportunities for upside to our plans. Our passionate, fired-up workforce is focused on one singular mission being the absolute best at serving customers. The success of this business depends on it, and we're moving rapidly to drive innovation in this industry and supercharge competition. As we start to emerge from COVID-19 and look ahead, T-Mobile is a brand that's the best positioned to stand up for customers and deliver a great value combined with an amazing network right when they need it most. And with that, it's now time to ask our CFO, Braxton Carter to take us through the financials and guidance. Braxton take it away. Braxton Carter : Hey, thanks Mike. And yes, so I am proudly wearing my magenta hat out here in Washington wine country. The opportunity that lies ahead for New T-Mobile is significant. And as we look to unlock the massive synergy potential, I couldn't be more excited for what the team will deliver in the future. Let me get into some of the financial details of the quarter to best explain why. Record Q1 net income amounted to $951 million in Q1, up 5% year-over-year. And diluted earnings per share was $1.10, up 4%. Note that net income was fully burdened by the Sprint merger-related costs of $117 million as well as COVID-19-related costs of $86 million in the first quarter. Similarly, EPS was impacted by $0.14 related to the Sprint merger and $0.10 related to COVID-19. These costs $250 million combined before taxes are excluded from adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA amounted to a record $3.7 billion, up 12% year-over-year. The increase was primarily due to higher service revenues and lower equipment sales, partially offset by higher cost of services and SG&A expenses. Cost of services as a percentage of service revenues increased by 10 basis points year-over-year in Q1, as we continued the rapid rollout of the 600-megahertz spectrum and investments to transform our 4G LTE network to 5G. SG&A as a percentage of service revenues increased by 70 basis points year-over-year in Q1 as we invested in our people and customers during this difficult time. Excluding the Sprint merger-related costs of $143 million and $117 million of supplemental employee payroll third-party commission and cleaning-related COVID-19 costs, SG&A would have been down 90 basis points year-over-year. Free cash flow increased by 18% year-over-year to $732 million in Q1, as net cash provided by operating activities increased 16% and cash CapEx decreased 9%. Free cash flow in Q1 included $161 million in payments for merger-related costs. Excluding these merger-related payments free cash flow would have been $893 million. Branded postpaid phone ARPU amounted to $45.80 in Q1, which was generally stable sequentially and year-over-year as an increase in our promotional activities including the ongoing growth in our Netflix offering, a reduction in regulatory program revenues from the continued adoption of tax inclusive plans and a reduction in certain nonrecurring charges were offset by the growing success of new customer segments and rate plans. We also reintroduced branded postpaid ARPA or average revenue per account this quarter, as we focus on growing total revenue per account, which is the real customer relationship. Branded postpaid ARPA was $129.47 in Q1 and was essentially flat year-over-year. In terms of customer quality, our results in the first quarter were impacted by the macroeconomic impacts of COVID-19. Total bad debt expense and losses from sale of receivables was $138 million or 1.24% of total revenues in the first quarter of 2020, compared to $108 million or 0.98% of total revenues in the first quarter of 2019. However, excluding the adoption of the new credit loss standard, which now recognizes lifetime expected credit losses upfront, bad debt would have been flat year-over-year in Q1. We are watching bad debt very closely given the current economic backdrop, which may put pressure on bad debt in the next few quarters, but we feel we are well prepared to manage through these economic conditions. One reason we feel well prepared is that subsequent to the end of the first quarter, we raised $23 billion in debt financing. I am super proud of what we achieved. When you think about it, we literally hit the market the day we closed the merger when the markets have basically been closed for weeks and we're able to issue $19 billion in investment-grade notes. Even in that market, the confidence and excitement to invest in T-Mobile led to an order book of $74 billion. And despite it being our first issuance in the investment-grade market, our 10-year notes have recently been trading inside where AT&T notes are trading. In addition, our recent merger loan syndication with another strong showing from investors effectively reopened the leverage loan market, which had been quiet since the inception of the COVID crisis. Just a remarkable execution by our team and that support from the market gives us confidence in our liquidity and our ability to go full speed ahead on the integration of Sprint and T-Mobile businesses. So let's get to guidance. Due to uncertainty around the ongoing impact of COVID-19, purchase price accounting, accounting policy alignment work we are providing guidance for the New T-Mobile for Q2 2020 at this time. We expect to provide full year 2020 guidance on our Q2 earnings call when we share the combined quarterly results of New T-Mobile and hopefully have better visibility into the COVID-19 and economic conditions for the back half of the year. For Q2, we expect postpaid net customer additions between zero and 150,000. This reflects the ongoing impact of COVID-19, including retail store closures and lower gross adds, partially offset by lower churn. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $6.2 billion to $6.5 billion in Q2. Our adjusted EBITDA target includes leasing revenues of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion. Cash purchases of the property and equipment including capitalized interest of approximately $100 million are expected to be between $2.3 billion and $2.5 billion for Q2 2020 and will ramp substantially as we get into the outer parts of the year. In Q2 2020 merger-related costs are expected to be $500 million to $600 million before taxes. These costs are excluded from adjusted EBITDA but will impact net income and cash flows. These amounts are before any incremental opportunities to accelerate synergy realization through a potential pull forward of additional spending into Q2, such as severance-related restructuring, store rationalization and network build expenses. COVID-19-related costs not included in adjusted EBITDA are expected to be between $450 million to $550 million before taxes. Net cash provided by operating activities includes payments for merger-related and COVID-19-related costs and including $2.3 billion in gross payments for the settlement of interest rate swaps is expected to be in the range of $0.7 billion to $1 billion. Free cash flow including payments for merger-related and COVID-19-related costs but excluding $2.3 billion in gross payments for the settlement of interest rate swaps is expected to be in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. We will continue to monitor developments regarding COVID-19 and evaluate appropriate steps we need to take as a business to align with guidelines from state, local and federal government agencies to do what is best for our employees and customers. We expect our business liquidity and financial condition as well as operating results to continue to be adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic for the remainder of 2020 and potentially thereafter. The full impact of COVID-19 on our business is difficult to predict and is subject to uncertainty. Potential impacts may include lower net customer additions, equipment revenues and cost of equipment sales; and higher bad debt expense; continued cost to protect and support our employees and customers, which will increase from the costs incurred during the first quarter of 2020; and potential disruptions to our supply chains. In addition, we are in the process of reevaluating our spending across various operating areas. We are taking actions to adjust our spending given the significant uncertainty around the magnitude and duration of any recessional impacts arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. The uncertainties related to COVID-19 may also adversely impact the Q2 guidance we provided. Now let's get to your questions. You can ask questions via phone or via Twitter. We will start with a question on the phone. Operator first question, please. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Simon Flannery : Hey, thanks very much. Good evening. Thanks for all the color. Mike, perhaps you could just give us a sense of what the integration, where you are so far, you've had a few weeks now to work with the Sprint team, obviously in difficult circumstances but any color around what the positives have been so far? And what are the areas where maybe you need to -- you're finding things taking longer whatever. And then for Neville, good to see the 5G lighting up. Can you give us a little bit more color on what to expect from the fixed wireless initiatives during 2020 and beyond? Thank you. Mike Sievert : Well, sure. Yes Simon, I have to say that one of the things we're most excited about is as I said in my remarks upfront is that after five weeks as one team, if anything we see more potential to go faster and to go bigger on synergy attainment and growth than we had been expecting. And there's a number of reasons for that. Among them the fact that we see opportunities to move faster on certain things like network. We had a long time to prepare for this merger. And we lift a lot of track when it comes to permitting and leasing and we're moving fast. And as we start to knock this down, it does appear that there's going to be a pace to this that may be able to stay ahead of schedule relative to our now two-year-old plans that calculated up all these synergies. Retail rationalization might go faster than expected. We had always expected to get after marketing one brand pretty quickly but getting the retail fleets rationalized due to systems issues and people issues, et cetera was something we always thought would take a little bit more time. We may be able to move faster and that could accelerate synergies. Procurement looks like an area of possibility to exceed plan. On the customer side, the churn level of Sprint customers is one of the most financially sensitive things. And we certainly have hopes that we can see faster movement there as we tackle this network integration at a faster pace. Already we've lit up more roaming for Sprint customers than we had expected to be able to do and we're starting to see how they respond to that. And you know what? They like it, which is great. So we're not in a position to guide on it or to give you anything concrete yet. I can just tell you that, five weeks in we're really optimistic. And you saw from our print today that, standalone business is very strong. You saw our Sprint subscriber numbers a couple of days ago. Those were better than most people expected. So we also walked into this with some momentum. Now as Braxton pointed out, COVID took a bite out of that for everybody. And there are temporary impacts on our business. But you know what? They're just that temporary. And our view is that if anything there's opportunity in the environment that we're going to see when social distancing lifts. As I said in my remarks, people are going to be looking for value. They're really going to be hungry to make sure they've got the right value. They're not going to drop this category. I mean, no way. This category is so important, but they might be asking if they've got the right carrier. And if switching comes and is elevated versus these low levels, we will be prepared to stand up and give customers what they're looking for. So we're feeling very optimistic. Even though it's the premise of your question, look, there's some aspects to it that have knocked everybody in this industry off their stride. Comparatively speaking, we feel very good. And over the mid and long-term, we perhaps feel even better than our deal model that we contemplated two years ago. Your second question, I think was for Neville and I might follow-up too about the network conditions and as it relates to broadband, right? Simon Flannery : Sure. Neville Ray : Yes. I'll pick it up. So, great to see Simon, and as you referenced I mean the 2.5-gigahertz rollout is absolutely key, right? I mean, that's the material spectrum advantage we now have in this mid-band 5G space. Mike outlined north of 300 megahertz of sub-6 gig spectrum for T-Mobile and nobody and the team is more eager than me and my team to get this stuff rolled out. So we didn't sit on our hands during the pendency of the deal. We've got stuff into leasing and zoning activity. And we were building 2.5 in Philly parts of New York before the deal closed actually. And so we were able to turn some of that stuff up immediately on close and that we just referenced New York and 2.5 rollout coming online this week. And to your question on broadband and fixed, I mean that 2.5-gigahertz spectrum is the critical piece. As we start to ramp that rollout that's going to build capacity specifically great 5G capacity for us to start serving our customers not just with the traditional mobility and wireless service that we're killing it with, but also one in this broadband space. And it takes some time. Obviously, we're not rolling out -- I wish we could roll out 2.5 overnight. It's going to take us months and into years to get that program fully complete across the nation. But as we do that and as capacity becomes available then we'll start to look at delivering that broadband capability to our customers as we've outlined in our deal advocacy and our business plans. It's a very material part of how we see shaping the competitive landscape as we move forward. Probably not too much this year, but I'm hopeful that we'll be making some inroads next year and beyond. Mike Sievert : Simon the cable companies are good companies. They're good people, but it's the least competitive market in the history of man. I mean, everybody knows that. And so to us as you know you know how we're wired. I mean, we're competitors. And as Neville says, we're itching to get in there, because we've got a value proposition that I think is going to resonate with millions of people to be able to bring 5G-based home Internet access to people that have never had a choice, never one single choice for many of them. And man, that's going to be fun. So we've got to get the network in condition. As Neville said, it's more next year and beyond than this year, but we're rearing to go, and we see a very big opportunity to change that landscape in that market forever. Great. Thanks a lot. Mike Sievert : Okay. Jud Henry : Hope another one is coming from the phone operator. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Brett Feldman : Thanks. I actually want to follow-up Mike Sievert : Hi, Brett. Brett Feldman : Hey, guys. I want to follow-up something Mike you were just talking about the ability to bring Sprint churn down maybe faster than you initially hoped. You alluded to one tactic, which was more rapidly making roaming onto the T-Mobile network, which has superior coverage available to them. But what else do you have to do? Is there a lot of outlets you need? Are there certain vulnerable customers who maybe aren't on the right rate plans and legacy Sprint churn on the phone side was twice legacy T-Mobile churn. I mean, what's the bogey here? Can you get it down to T-Mobile levels? What's realistic? And then just a quick one for Braxton. I don't know if you have it or not, but do you know what the pro forma cash position of the company was at closing net of all the closing fees and so forth? Thanks. Mike Sievert : Well, I'll take the first one. And yes, Brett. As you know the number one driver of churn for any carrier and particularly for Sprint is network. And that's what drives people away more than anything. Network. And then the second one is value. And then you bump those two key drivers of churn up against the value proposition that we're building, we're building the best network at the best value. No one's ever been able to offer that before, the lowest prices and the best network. And those are why people churn bar none. That's it. Those are the top two out of two. So I can't predict for you how fast that will dawn on Sprint customers, as we start to give them at their incredible rate plans, the best network in the country. But they're going to turn out, because of this merger to be some of the smartest shoppers this industry has, because we're not going to force them to change their rate plans. We're going to honor those rate plans. And yet we're going to serve them up the best network that this industry's ever seen. And so we're starting to see some benefits of that already and people like it. So that's great. But we've got a lot of work to do. To your point about rate plans, we don't think we have all that much tuning up to do. It turns out that the differences between Sprint ARPU and T-Mobile ARPU, don't have much to do with the fact that Sprint's prices are higher. It has to do with artifacts like, T-Mobile has more lines per account, and therefore more added lines on average than Sprint does, and a different penetration of business, and different numbers of unlimited customers, other artifacts, but not really a dynamic that would suggest that Sprint's prices are higher. So I can't wait to get at it. As we talked about, we're going to start to unify this summer under one T-Mobile flagship brand with an integrated retail fleet and integrated brand that we're going to do everything we can to get that network experience tuned up for Sprint customers faster than they expect. And I think we're going to like what we see from all that. Braxton Carter : Hey Brett on the pro forma opening cash or the actual cash for New T-Mobile we had $7.5 billion after paying all merger-related expenses on 4/1 we have a $4 billion undrawn revolver fully in place five year. So, a total of $11.5 billion of liquidity. Amazingly two years -- two and a half years ago, when we modeled the opening balance sheet, we modeled $11 billion of liquidity including a $4 billion revolver. So, we're actually $0.5 billion ahead. And I want to point out it's a great question. With the financing in place and the opening liquidity we have a fully funded business plan to do everything that we need to do to get to run rate synergies. And you heard Mike talk about our enthusiasm about acceleration of synergies which also means some acceleration of cost to achieve but getting those unlocks quicker. And especially in COVID-19 we are laser-focused on acceleration of these synergies to offset some of the impacts that we're seeing just given this unprecedented crisis for the world. Mike Sievert : Thank you. So, let's go over to Twitter since this is a Twitter conference. And again you can send us questions #TMUS or @MikeSievert. Neville let's bring you into the conversation. Walt Piecyk has a question. Actually there's two questions you might address simultaneously. Walt says what percent of macro have 2.5 gigahertz in the city Neville. I assume he's talking about New York. And then Ronald @ronald_809, I love this one because again we launched last night. Okay. We launched last night in New York City the first example of our full-layer cake. Hey Neville when will the new T-Mobile layer cake expand to fully cover NYC like the Bronx and Queens and Staten Island didn't you leave out parts of Brooklyn? So, how about it Neville? Neville Ray : I wish I could say it would all happen this week. But yes to both questions I mean we're just getting started but we're delighted to make this start. I mean we are literally as Mike said earlier on; we're five weeks into this combination with Sprint. And we're already deploying. So, I think coming out -- we were determined to come out of the blocks super quick. I don't think many folks anticipated we would be deploying the 2.5-gig spectrum so quickly but we have made a start and we're starting in big cities. Here's a fun stat for you all. If you look at the square miles of just what we launched in Philly and we built and put that on air inside really the 30 days of March through the deal. But if you look at the square miles of that footprint in metro Philly, it's approximately two, two and a half times the entire footprint of Verizon's millimeter wave 5G on a nationwide basis. So, they've been rolling this 5G thing out they say for I don't know two years. But in a month I mean we more than doubled the footprint. And yes, I mean mid-band 5G versus millimeter wave we're just going to kill it from a coverage perspective. So, we're moving. We're moving quickly. I mean we're in the key markets in the Northeast that's a big focus for us. I'll give a shout out obviously to my team to the Ericsson guys who've done a great job making this happen. And more importantly, as we look forward, we will launch and build out and lay 2.5-gigahertz spectrum across thousands of sites in 2020. We're off to a great start benefiting from that work from last year which we did at risk. And the rollout of 2.5 is going to move super super-quick. So, we've managed through COVID to deal with permitting delays et cetera. Obviously our teams are working with safety and their health as a paramount and primary concern. But the federal air cover we have as a critical service provider has been key. We actually built over 1,000 sites this last month of April rolling out new spectrum onto those sites. And our plan is to ramp very heavily as we move into this month of May and on through the year. So, lots of 2.5 gig coming. New York, Philly all of the northeast markets very much in our sights as are most of the major metros across the U.S. So, a lot more moves to come and we'll keep everybody posted. New York just turned up as Mike said and Ronald asked. And there were folks running around in New York looking and testing of that I assume observing social distancing and shelter-at-home protocols but I saw some stuff on social with 600 even 700 megabit per second speeds. And so this is with a very limited volume of 2.5-gigahertz spectrum rolled out at this point in time 40 to 60 megahertz. And remember we have secured with the combination with Sprint about 150. So, we have a long way to go in terms of the performance capability, but what we have on the ground is just incredibly exciting. So, key to our deal and key to that consumer experience that we're going to roll out aggressively as we move through the balance of this year. Mike Sievert : And Neville while you're on a roll I ask this at some risk and peril because I know you're enthusiastic. But I responded to Brett's question a little bit by discussing the roaming situation and we're getting questions now on the site. Could you tell us more about what's the roaming experience like for Sprint customers how much of it is happening? And roaming itself is kind of a funny turn because they're all our customers. But we're essentially using roaming technology while we operate two networks. Can you just very briefly touch on the day-to-day experience that Sprint customers are experiencing now that we've turned that up so extensively? Neville Ray : Yes absolutely. And again Mike in terms of momentum and integration work I mean kudos to John Sore [ph] and Prasad [ph] and the team I mean we turned up nationwide LTE roaming across all of our sites effectively on 4/1 data clubs. So, all the work ahead of time to make sure that could happen. And what does that mean? It means that the Sprint postpaid customer base when they -- wherever they fall off the Sprint network be that in a rural geography or in building location in Manhattan or wherever it may be, they can now see the T-Mobile network. We know that that network churn was a key driver of the overall churn within Sprint and we're seeing big uptake. I mean on a weekly basis, we're seeing approximately around 10 million unique roamers. I don't like the term roaming, but Sprint customers now leveraging the T-Mobile network. So that's more than one-third of the postpaid phone subscriber base that we have with Sprint. So a lot of uptake. And then just within the last week or so we've activated and provided access for nationwide 5G on our low band. And that footprint is growing every day 250 million pops. We just launched the Bay Area. I mean so that footprint which is the foundational layer to the layer cake of our 5G strategy that's growing like a weed. I mean the teams have been knocking it out of the park building out 600 and our Sprint customers with a 5G-capable phone and now getting access to that footprint too. So lots of dimensions very, very focused on making sure that all of our Sprint customers are getting the best they can from that combination of the Sprint and T-Mobile network. Mike Sievert : Well, thanks everyone. That's all the time we have. Thanks for joining us today. Operator let's take the next question from the phone queue. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Rollins with Citi. Mike Sievert : Hi, Mike. Michael Rollins : Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. Curious, if you could just provide some additional color as you're approaching the midpoint of the quarter just in terms of this environment. A little more of what's happening to sales activity and maybe the customer payment behavior. Some companies have disclosed the number of pledges their customers have taken. And you mentioned earlier a cost for COVID-19 that will be excluded from EBITDA. I think it was about $450 million to $550 million for 2Q. Could you just expand on what would get incorporated into those expenses? Thanks. Mike Sievert : Braxton, let's start with you on the -- what's included and how to think about the cost. And then maybe Matt and I can tag team on what we're seeing in the marketplace. Braxton Carter : Yes, absolutely. So Mike with really busting down the COVID guidance you have about $350 million-ish of supplemental pay and paid time not worked. And we were paying hazard pay for some of the critical infrastructure that we had to put up. It's an amazing accomplishment of what happened in customer service. At the start of this crisis, everyone reported to a call center. Callie has now well over 90% of our customer service reps fully connected in the home and not working. But during that time period, we absolutely were paying hazard pay as well as supplemental pay to support and keep our team intact. That also happened in the retailer and dealer community. So that $350 million is really dissipating at this point. As Mike said, we're significantly opening up distribution as the country steps out of this. And that won't be a significant reoccurring item. The second item is facilities and cleaning and PPE. And that's roughly a $50 million ticket. Very extensive protocols in place, extremely important to protect our people and to protect our customers, and a very understandable and worthwhile expenditure. The final item on here is a range on bad debt, specifically, related to the FCC pledge. All other bad debts, of course, aren't included in here nor regular pay for people who are working. And that bad debt range is going to be somewhere in the $75 million to $125 million. What's happening is the inability to disconnect you're building up multiple layers of payments that need to be due. And at this point, this is our best estimate that we've seen that we were able to come up with about the ultimate cost of this pledge, which has now been extended through June 30 on our business. We are certainly taking mitigation items. We got a significant number of customers that are paying. But we do have customers who aren't paying and thus we anticipate that additional bad debt. So that's really the breakdown for you on that. Any other questions before we go to the other part of your question? Michael Rollins : That's very helpful. Thanks. Braxton Carter : You\u2019re welcome, Michael. Mike Sievert : Yes. The second piece, we're a share taker. And a share taker likes a competitive environment with a certain amount of churn. Everybody's been home and churn itself has fallen quite a bit. And so obviously, we like an environment where people are able and have less friction to being able to switch providers. And notwithstanding that we've been competing very hard and finding really innovative ways to get that done. So we were killing it in January and February. And then, of course, things came to a pretty fast stop in March. We were quicker to execute slowdowns and shutdowns of our retail in March. We felt it was very important to be decisive. We're based here in Seattle where the whole thing started and we took it probably more seriously than others did. So we moved faster. And we may have been more effective in March than some. All that has equalized now. But Matt, why don't you give us a little color on what you're seeing? And then very briefly I may ask Jon to talk a little bit about virtual retail and curbside and some of the things happening to mitigate market environment from Matt Staneff. Matt Staneff : Yes. Thanks, Mike for the question. As Mike Sievert just said, we saw a pretty rapid slowdown in our business because we took these proactive measures around retail stores for the health and safety of our employees and customers in general. And the market had a pronounced decline right off the gate. And what you're seeing what we're seeing in the marketplace right now is generally consistent with what you're hearing in the news and in other places is that things are starting to rebound and things are starting to turn a corner. It was closed down and slowed for quite a while in the first part of the month. We're seeing generally speaking some of the categories that you naturally would expect to react in a marketplace like this so it's to rebound faster interpret that as the prepaid market is starting to rebound a little bit more. There's stimulus money in the marketplace. Consumers are coming out and starting to shop again and switch. And as Mike said, we really enjoy a marketplace where there's a lot of industry switching and that's important for us to continue to grow our net adds as we move forward. So we're starting to see some signs that the marketplace is rebounding in the areas I've talked about, but we've got a long way to go to get back to normal levels of industry switching and consumer buying behavior as we see this thing out throughout the quarter. We've also seen some particular strength in some of the other areas public sector is an example. Lots of students need connectivity on learning and things of that nature. So we've been pretty active in participating in those parts of the markets as well. Mike Sievert : We're not waiting for the market to just return to normal. We're changing how we operate. Jon Freier just very briefly about the rapid work we've done to change what retail means in this company. Jon Freier : Yes, Mike. Thank you. And yes on March 16th as most of you know we took this big bold decision, one of the quickest decisions in our space to close the majority of our retail stores about 80% of our company-owned stores. And rather than just kind of sit there on the sideline and just let nature take its course, we went into action to take a number of our retail employees and convert them to virtual retail mobile experts, meaning that when you go to tmobile.com, you can chat from a -- click a button chat with an expert and be able to learn more about T-Mobile, be able to add lines to your account. We had a lot of people that, of course, in a remote learning environment and a virtual learning environment a number of people had to take action to support those learning environments for children on that home. So we wanted to continue to be there while our stores were closed. We saw a 500% increase in the number of people that we typically have in virtual retail by converting our mobile experts that typically work in stores to that virtual retail environment and continue to serve customers in that way. And then also from a curbside delivery perspective we didn't have that capability prior to COVID-19 and working with Toni Stanford [ph] and his product and technology team, we were able to kind of stand up this curbside delivery capability within all of our company-owned stores that we have up and running today. And that is, okay, I can continue to talk to T-Mobile through the app through chat and be able to walk through a transaction and be able to pick that up at a store in a contactless kind of a way. So I couldn't be more proud of these capabilities that got turned in a rapid fashion to continue to serve customers. And I got to tell you our team in all of our stores, Callie Field's team and all of customer care, we've said this once and probably million times, but let me just say million and one times. We just had the best frontline teams in the entire country maybe even on the face of the planet. I just couldn't be more proud of the heroism of our teams to move fast continue to be there to serve customers and keep the business continuity of this company going. Jud Henry : Well, terrific. Well, operator, let\u2019s go back to the phone for next question. Operator : Certainly. Our next question comes from John Hodulik with UBS. Mike Sievert : Hey, John. John Hodulik : Great. Hey, how are you doing Mike? Thanks for the question. I guess, first on that postpaid net add guidance for 2Q for New T-Mobile zero to 150,000. Typically postpaid phones are a subset of that number. So I know you don't typically guide to phones, but should we understand that how the stores are closed that you guys might actually lose postpaid phones in the second quarter? And then maybe if there's sort of some background in terms of what are your assumptions within that number in terms of bringing those stores back online? And then question for Neville. Could you talk about the deployment of the 600-megahertz spectrum you guys are to grant from DISH? I'd imagine that you'd deploy that with your LTE network. What kind of performance, are you getting from that extra spectrum? And any thoughts on outlook in terms of your ability to secure that on a longer term basis? Thanks. Mike Sievert : Okay. I'm going to try to hit those pretty fast. So first of all on the first piece, no, we expect postpaid phones to be positive, not negative. And we're seeing nice trends develop. So we gave the guidance that we gave. I'm very hopeful that we'll see strength through the rest of the quarter. And it does assume that we continue to see some increasing momentum slowly happening through the quarter as social distancing ebbs a bit. But it doesn't assume a wholesale change in customer behavior. We would assume that June would have more going on than May and May more than April, but not step changes. And Neville, do you want to hit the second one very quickly? Braxton Carter : Let me just add really quick too. John, you know our playbook. And our playbook has not changed. We're conservative in the way we position to The Street. We got an impeccable track record of doing what we said we were going to do and nothing has changed about that. Neville? Neville Ray : Yes. So thanks John. We doubled our speeds. I mean, I think the additional 600 was great the kind of country and our customers needed it during COVID-19. We've, obviously, extended our pledge commitment. We are working with many of those 600 providers to see if they will extend. I'm hopeful they will and continue to enable us to better serve our customers during this period. So more capacity and more speed is exactly what was needed and allowed us to deal with a lot of peaks and increases in traffic that we saw on the network during a very difficult time. So big shout out and thank you to the FCC and Chairman Pai and also the holders that loaned us their spectrum. And as I said, we're hopeful they'll extend a little longer with us as the pledge continues. John Hodulik : Thank you. Jud Henry : All right. Let\u2019s go back to the phone, operator. Operator : Certainly. Our next question comes from Philip Cusick with JPMorgan. Mike Sievert : Hey, Phil. Philip Cusick : Congratulations again on getting the deal done and Mike on your promotion. Great. First Braxton assuming your EBITDA was stable from 1Q to 2Q at T-Mobile, the guide would imply Sprint EBITDA ex-leasing of about $1.4 billion to $1.55 billion. So about $6 billion run rate, which is about what we expected maybe a little lower. Do you expect to restate EBITDA that Sprint's doing from this methodology? Or is this guide a good way to look at the run rate going forward? Braxton Carter : Yes. It's a great question Phil. We are in the process of aligning over 200 accounting policies that are disparate. And you can be informed on the significant items in the pro formas that we put out. So, we know the material ins and outs and those are certainly embedded in here. But there's a lot of miscellaneous stuff that we're working through. We also have the very significant exercise of the purchase price allocation. And what assets, how do we value the assets are going to create differences that are not known at this point throughout the geography of the income statement. We don't anticipate any material deviations from the purchase price accounting on the EBITDA numbers that are already baked into this guidance. But what we haven't worked through is all the valuation of the assets including capitalized lease devices things like the wireline business, so on and so forth. And that can create some issues when it comes to what the valuation and what the depreciation run rate is. But we're not providing net add or EPS, but there will be changes that come out of this. We also have a significant KPI alignment to the T-Mobile policies. And in our disclosures, as you pour through everything, you will see that we have specifically mentioned that there will be significant adjustments to the Sprint subscriber base. And until we finish that work, we're not in a position to quantify it. It will be significant. It will be reductions in multiple categories. And of course that will have impacts on various KPIs as we're looking at the business. Hopefully that's helpful. Philip Cusick : That is helpful. But as I -- just to go back to the guidance, since you're putting out guidance on total EBITDA and then ex leasing is it fair to say that any of the changes that you mentioned wouldn't be enough to push it outside of this range that you've given? Braxton Carter : We got an impeccable track record here and we're conservative in the way that we guide. And -- but we fully believe that its material representation or we wouldn't have given it. Philip Cusick : Great. And then just last thing quickly, I didn't hear you quantify the number of subscribers in the FCC pledge category. Can you give that to us? Mike Sievert : Yes. We did -- yes, I was just going to jump in. We didn't quantify it but that's because we work with every customer. A big piece of how we operate is -- and this may be different for us than some of our competitors because part of our core competency is working with people on very tight budgets and who occasionally have difficult circumstances. And a part of our normal is having to deal with every customer and find a way to meet their needs and we've carried on doing that. Callie Field and team have carried on doing that while having to move 15,000 people to work from home, 92% of our workforce. And so we're honoring the pledge and it's costly. I'm not trying to say it's not incremental. It is costly. But it's hard to count every individual customer because a big part of this is you treat those customers. And we're not going to disconnect them but we are going to encourage them not to stack up bills that they can't afford and to make sure they're on a product and service that they can afford. And our team of customer care heroes are just fantastic at that. And they've stepped up and found new ways of working under Callie's leadership. I'm so proud of them. But it's very difficult for us to quantify in those kinds of numbers. What we have done is make sure you understand the total potential financial tally. Let's go to Twitter and then two more from the phone. And just fair warning for everybody, I will have to step away for the last few minutes of the call. Braxton will be emceeing for us. But I don't want to ignore Twitter. And for example Bill Ho is asking about enterprise, looking ahead to integrating and ramping up T-Mobile Business Group. Mike Katz, Mike Sievert what's the thinking on Enterprise segment growth and competition? Is it low-hanging fruit? By the way we keep talking about day one being mid-summer. We're talking about consumer for that part. Mike Katz and his enterprise team have already achieved day 1 integrating an entire combined Sprint and T-Mobile selling force behind one value proposition under the T-Mobile brand. That was achieved just this week. We're getting off to the races. I'm really proud of what the team's doing and how fast they're forming to capture this opportunity. And Mike I don't know if you want to very briefly give a little bit of color on what you're seeing. Mike Katz : Yes. Thanks Mike. Yes I think one thing that's important is at stand-alone T-Mobile we already had a lot of momentum coming into the integration. We had record quarters in enterprise and large government for the last couple of years every single quarter, so a lot of momentum. So now this larger now integrated team has a lot to work with. And this trade-off that Mike talked about at the beginning of the call customers historically having to trade between great network and great price and service experience that is as important to enterprise customers as it is to consumers. And what we're seeing so far is we interact with enterprises. And they're really, really responding to that. And I think the timing for it couldn't be better as we're in the middle of COVID and big macroeconomic impacts as a result of COVID. We're seeing many enterprises going through big cost transformation exercises including what they spend and how they structure their spend in this category. And we think that positions us for a lot of opportunity considering that AT&T and Verizon control 90% of the revenue in the enterprise space. So, we think it's a big, big growth opportunity for us and we're really well positioned post-merger. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jonathan Chaplin with New Street. Jonathan Chaplin : Thanks for taking the questions. Braxton, is this the last earnings call, we get you on? Braxton Carter : Mike, are you still on? That's a question... Jonathan Chaplin : That's why I asked. Braxton Carter : Okay. Let me tell you -- let me put it this way that I was supposed to retire two years ago. I've extended three times. We have nothing to announce today. Ultimately whatever capacity, I love this company. I'm not going anywhere. And in some form, I will definitely be part of the future. Just stay tuned for future announcements. Jonathan Chaplin : Rooting for a fourth extension. Just very quickly, on the -- if you guys are getting the retail integration done by sometime in the summer, does that mean there's about $1 billion in SG&A synergies that you should have captured by the end of the year? Braxton Carter : We're not prepared at this point to really do quantifications. If you really listen to what we were saying about guidance, we are right now operationalizing accelerations of what original plans were, specifically driven by COVID. And quite frankly, Jonathan, we just need some time to work through it and then we'll be able to provide color. And that color, we plan on providing in the second quarter earnings call, which will be the first New T-Mobile earnings call and we're just going to have to wait at this point. I don't want to give you an estimate that's not fully baked, but we're very focused on that, as we are on acceleration of other synergies and that's all good news. I want to reiterate, we are extremely confident that the opportunity is actually more than $43 billion. And some of our acceleration moves at this point is only part of that. I mean to the extent that we can accelerate during this time period, it's going to increase the NPV. But, quite frankly, we got pressures because of COVID, as you're saying. And we're super focused on addressing those pressures and making up for them and we've got a lot of material here to work with. Jon, do you want to add anything? Jon Freier : Yes. Braxton, I will just reiterate exactly what you said. We're working this really hard. And I think Mike Sievert had an opportunity to say that, the last couple of calls that, one of the benefits of this transaction taking a little bit longer to finally getting approved and to cross the finish line is that, we've had a longer runway to plan. And that's exactly what we're seeing. We've had a number of discussions with independently owned and operated operators around store closures. We're working through that, have been working through that, have gotten through them very very quickly. Also we have a lot of integration, internal integration efforts that we're doing that we once thought would be impossible, because we're not physically together. We're having to do all of this work virtually, but I've just been incredibly pleased about the amount of interactions that we can do with the team virtually. We've got tens of thousands of employees across the country in retail between the two legacy companies that we're bringing together. And that's just gone incredibly well thus far, in terms of having people do the necessary training, getting people up to speed on installing our systems into the legacy Sprint stores, taking legacy Sprint systems installing them into legacy Magenta stores. So that we can say, yes, we can help you no matter if you're a T-Mobile customer or a Sprint-branded customer, regardless of the store that you visit. So we are in a really good place, call it six weeks, not even six weeks, five-and-a-half weeks into this integration after close. So we're very confident. We're moving fast. We're ahead of schedule in terms of the discussions that we've had. We're very bullish on realizing our distribution-related synergies this year. And we're looking forward to showing you some results here very soon. Jonathan Chaplin : Thanks, guys. Braxton Carter : Okay. Next question, please? Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Jennifer Fritzsche with Wells Fargo. Jennifer Fritzsche : Thank you taking my question. Braxton Carter : Hey, Jennifer. Jennifer Fritzsche : Hi, guys. Thanks taking the questions. I wanted to ask -- maybe this is more in Neville's category. We've all been programmed to believe wireless needs wires and with that is a strong fiber element. So I think you said you're going to connect thousands of 2.5 sites this year. That requires fiber and significant backhaul. How confident are you in partners? Or would you do what one of your competitors are doing and taking on an organic fiber build? And then, if I may, just your current thoughts on DSS capabilities, it didn't seem like you were that positive last time we spoke on one of these calls. Has that changed at all? Neville Ray : So I'll hit these quick, Jennifer. So our model has been a leased fiber model. We generally do not build fiber to our sites. We let others do that and we get great prices from them for the services we need. And we've been scaling our backhaul for a 5G world for some time. And the performance we're seeing out of these sites we're upgrading with just limited volumes of 2.5 spectrum today are all supported by multi-gig backhaul. And so, we're in a very strong place on that and our providers will continue to drive a lot of intense competition in that space with our model. So that looks to continue on. On DSS, yes, I think, my comments last call seem to -- was there a big discussion in the industry on DSS. And do I feel a lot better? Not really. I was very clear on that call that one vendor is trailing and they're still kind of trailing. So I think the sum of it is, DSS is going to happen. We've heard from our competition and similar to us something will happen this year. But the key message Jennifer is, we're not dependent on DSS for our 5G rollout. And our nationwide footprint is there already. And it's growing at a tremendous pace, as I mentioned earlier in the call. And that's the way to rollout 5G with fiber spectrum not having to share the spectrum with LTE users of between LTE users and 5G users. And our position our wealth of spectrum provides us a wealth of that cover in terms of not having to be reliant on DSS. Now that said, we will deploy the technology. But it's still bumpy. Jennifer Fritzsche : Great, thank you. Mike Sievert : Okay operator. We will take one final question here. Operator : Thank you. And our final question today will come from Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson. Craig Moffett : Hi. I don't know whether we've still got Mike or not. But Mike since you mentioned it, on CNBC a little while ago, I'm wondering if you could just walk through the walk so to speak of how you get to mid-40 -- sorry mid-50s margins over the long-term in the merged company. Sort of where are the sources of the difference between your margins and say Verizon's or AT&T's today? And then how you close that gap to get to the mid-50s? Braxton Cart : Yes. Unfortunately Craig, Mike had to leave. That guidance that Mike was talking about was really the same guidance that we rolled out and talked about during dependency of the merger. And there are multiple aspects there. The first aspect of course is scale. When we look at the leverage on the fixed cost in this highly capital-intensive business and analyze our cost structures versus whatever transparency we can get on AT&T and Verizon, which quite frankly has been reducing with some of their changes. We believe a huge part of that is scale driven. We believe that we're actually much more efficient in many parts of our cost structure. And that scale piece of it is super important. Of course, with the completion of this merger, we just had a significant increase in our scale. And this is a growth company. And even though, we're in this crazy pandemic time period, we will continue being a growth company. And our Q1 was on fire, until we hit the early part of March, in social distancing and everything that went in place just drove all the traffic to an essential stop. But as Mike said, this will be temporary. So we will continue to organically scale with the combined assets. And then the second part of the equation, it is really the efficiencies that we gained from the merger. By shutting down the duplicate network, having a significant reduction in the overall fixed costs associated with this business, is the second major component for massive margin expansion. And you've heard us have extreme confidence on this. And you've also heard on this call that we're doing everything we can to accelerate that. I mean, I'm just amazed that Neville has been able to make the progress that he's made with his team so quickly. And we'll be giving you a lot more color and readouts as time goes on, about how much focus and aggressiveness, we're chasing these synergies. And that's ultimately going to create a lot of goodness there. Craig Moffett : Thank you, Braxton. Braxton Cart : You're welcome. Jud Henry : Okay. I want to really thank everybody for tuning in. I hope everybody's families are safe. Our thoughts are with you during these very, very difficult times. And we very much look forward to the first New T-Mobile earnings call for the second quarter, and sharing with you the first set of results and results of a lot of the things that we're working on here. And it's going to be very, very exciting, Operator? Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the T-Mobile U.S. First Quarter 2020, Earnings Call. If you have any further questions, you may contact the Investor Relations or media departments. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. And have a pleasant day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon. Welcome to the T-Mobile Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jud Henry, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations for T-Mobile US. Please go ahead sir. Jud Henry : Good afternoon and welcome to T-Mobile's Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. With me today are Mike Sievert, our President and CEO; Peter Osvaldik, our CFO; Neville Ray, our President, Technology; Matt Staneff, Our Chief Marketing Officer; and Janice Kapner our Chief Communications Officer; as well as other members of the senior leadership team joining us remotely. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements that include projections and statements about our future financial and operating results, our plans, the benefits we expect to receive from our merger with Sprint, our business and operations in light of COVID-19 and other statements that are not historical facts. Such statements are based upon the current, beliefs and expectations of our management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties outside of our control that could cause actual results to differ materially, including the risk factors set forth in our filings with the SEC. Reconciliations between GAAP and the non-GAAP metrics we discuss on this call can be found in the Quarterly Results section of the Investor Relations page on our website. Also, I want to point out that our comments related to Q2 2020 reflect the combined results of new T-Mobile\u2019s unless otherwise noted. The prior period results and earnings materials that accompany our Q2 results represent the standalone T-Mobile prior to the merger with Sprint. While we do provide some unaudited pro forma historical financials on a supplemental basis, they are not directly comparable with the actual results for new T-Mobile in the second quarter and going forward, nor are they directly comparable with the previously provided pro forma financials that were prepared prior to the completion of final purchase price accounting and policy alignment issues. We are not providing pro forma historical customer base metrics due to the inability to repose its historical activity under all new T-Mobile subscriber policy. As such, we will focus our comments on future results and the comparable forward-looking guidance as the best way of looking at the business moving forward. With that, let me now turn it over to Mike. Mike Sievert : Okay. Thanks Jud, and hi to everybody listening in or watching online. We are coming to you live and socially distanced from here in our Bellevue headquarters. So I am pleased that nice to be back in the office for once given if we are behind this huge flexi glass panels and sitting 10 feet apart. First of all, let me just say, thanks in advance for your patience, because my upfront remarks will be just a few minutes longer than usual today given that this is our first quarterly report for the new company and there is a lot to cover. I promise I am not filibuster. Q2 was our first quarter together and what a quarter it was. I am incredibly fired up about everything this new combined team has accomplished since we last spoke in May and I am more excited than ever about the future of T-Mobile.  We have already hit major milestones in record time and made significant progress on integration and we did it while achieving incredible business results for the quarter. We know, that very quarter our competitors were telling you we\u2019d be too distracted by the merger to execute, yes, that\u2019s what. So let me start by saying this, we kicked off the quarter by achieving something nobody really thought possible just a short time ago.  Our total branded customer accounts surpassed AT&T, making us the number two player in wireless at the beginning of the quarter. This monumental milestone in U.S. wireless history was a historic achievement for all of us at T-Mobile. And even better we haven\u2019t looked back since. We have no intention of slowing down.  Our lead versus AT&T is even wider as we talk to you today. In Q2, T-Mobile once again led the industry in total branded customer growth for the 22nd consecutive quarter firmly establishing new T-Mobile as the leading growth company in the industry. Now with over 98 million customers at quarter end, we are steering down Verizon, but our site sat on the number one spot. Despite the significant challenges we all face this quarter, in T-Mobile\u2019s case including combining with a much slower growth company in Sprint and continuing to deal with the global pandemic that led to a lower switching environment, this team adapted and delivered.  We didn\u2019t skip a beat that. In fact, we moved faster. We again led the industry at adding 1.2 million total branded customers across postpaid and prepaid in Q2, four and three times AT&T and Verizon combined. Total postpaid net additions were 1.1 million, also leading the industry and over three times more than Verizon who was the closest competitor. We actually got something of a formulator when trying to divide by a negative number for our AT&T comparison. And believe we grow that.  Needless to say, we are still competing aggressively and our team is having fun with it. And while we are on this topic, I do want to take this opportunity to recognize our T-Mobile core business team for really stepping up in a big way to help schools and businesses adapting to new remote learning and work challenges that are needed.  Most of our overperformance this quarter versus guidance on postpaid was in this area. We also delivered 253,000 postpaid phone net adds, beating the national carriers again for the 26th quarter in a row. And this is after taking a 90,000 unit postpaid customer disconnect approval related to the FCC\u2019s keeping Americans connected.  And not to be forgotten, we also delivered Q2 postpaid phone churn of 0.8%, prepaid churn of just 2.81%. I am particularly proud of the churn progress as we integrate the traditionally higher churning Sprint business.  Now lets\u2019 talk about how all of our teams\u2019 hard work and real-time adjustments to the rapidly changing market resulted in incredibly strong Q2 financial results. This includes adjusted EBITDA of $7.0 billion, which exceeded our guidance.  Our new CFO, Peter Osvaldik will share more on our financial results in a moment, but I\u2019ll just remind you that our formula is pretty simple. Investing in customers leads to customer growth which leads to revenue growth, which if we run the company well leads to EBITDA and cash flow growth, a lot of which we invest right back into our customers and their network experience.  It\u2019s a virtuous cycle that delivered all of our early success as the un-carrier and it will continue to propel us to our goal of being number one in customer choice and number one in customer starts. While delivering these accomplishments, we kicked off a huge list of accomplishments that positioned new T-Mobile to win. Peter will share more details about our work in the market, but I just wanted to mention three big milestones. First, our team executed the largest dual tranche secondary offering in U.S. history, the sale of SoftBank\u2019s shares in T-Mobile and actually created a positive trading dynamic in our stock with the transaction.  We also fulfilled a major merger commitment when we closed our transaction with DISH to divest the Sprint Prepaid business. And we issued $4 billion of senior secured notes a weighted average interest rate of just 2.16% all three had super successful outcome. On the customer side, we launched Connecting Heroes providing free smartphone service and 5G access to state and local non-profit first responder agencies nationwide. This was the second initiative in our 5G for good un-carrier announced this from last year following T-Mobile Connect the low price plan we launched ahead of schedule in Q1. The final part of that move, Project 10 Million will be coming very soon, so stay tuned.  And we unveiled our latest un-carrier move Scam Shield. Scams and robo calls are a huge customer pain and in fact they are the leading FCC complaint. So we put together the industry\u2019s most comprehensive solution for customers to help stop distributes. With Scam Shield we are helping protect T-Mobile natural by T-Mobile and Sprint customers \u2013 they can scammers for free, while AT&T and Verizon make customers paid for it by requiring a certain plan or phone or premium add-on.  This move clearly mattered to consumers, because this announcement drove massive social media engagement and the most press coverage we\u2019ve received since our first un-carrier move way back in March of 2013. Unlike all un-carrier moves, Scam Shield is designed to change wireless for good. So I hope that AT&T and Verizon will step up to our challenge and join us in taking this problem a lot more serious. And I can\u2019t forget to mention that T-Mobile\u2019s care team continues to break record. We just recently received the highest ever score recorded in our industry on the J.D. Power2020 Customer Care Survey taking home our sixth win in a row and the 20th time we\u2019ve ranked highest among full service providers. Our team loves our customers and it shows.  Okay. I really just scratched the surface on what this team accomplished this past quarter, but I know you are all really interested in our talk books and that\u2019s of course integration. And the work we are doing to build big and build fast on synergy attainment.  Let\u2019s start with the network. This is a huge piece of our synergy realization. Neville and his team are full steam ahead. We\u2019ve talked about the fact that our \u2013 that the biggest block of our synergies come from the network and that it\u2019s a three step process as we first light up the available Sprint spectrum on the new T-Mobile anchor network which second, creates the capacity to migrate the Sprint traffic over.  And then third, allows us to finally decommission the sites that aren\u2019t in the go forward. That of course takes time and amazingly decommissioning, the third step, our initial sites is already under \u2013 The network teams working and overdrive to migrate Spring postpaid traffic on to the T-Mobile network and it shows.  In fact, as of today, we have already moved more than 10% of this traffic before we\u2019ve even started the customer migration. This is possible, because we now have more than 85% of Sprint postpaid phone base with devices that work on the T-Mobile network, something we made fully available right out of the gate. So now, over 10 million Sprint postpaid customers on average are using the T-Mobile network every single day, plus the Sprint base historically had limited access to VoLTE, voice-over-LTE. But we already have roughly 75% of the Sprint postpaid base now enabled on VoLTE. So they are enjoying a better voice experience with simultaneous data. I hope those stats straight you as surprising and unprecedented, was they are.  We also officially unveiled our retail operations and unified our retail operations and rebranded thousands of Sprint stores to T-Mobile stores last Sunday. This is an important milestone for our business and while we did it, we also rolled out the needed tools and systems across our distribution footprint to allow us to serve both legacy bases of postpaid customers in all T-Mobile stores.  Let me be clear, this was a massive lift. I just can\u2019t say enough that how our team flawlessly nailed this effort and executed incredibly fast. This would have been a major accomplishment even outside of a pandemic, it was really amazing to see all of that come to life during these complicated times.  And since the bringing two big brands like T-Mobile and Sprint together only comes around once we want it to market in true un-carrier fashion by doing something really big for our customers. So we launched four for hundred. Yes, four lines of the industry\u2019s best unlimited for $25 each per month. This is possibly our most ambitious consumer promotion ever and it includes 5G access.  Remember, the other guys maybe charging extra for 5G, ours includes it. Now to be clear, this is a limited time promotion to celebrate and build awareness for the newly integrated brand but even after it\u2019s done. We\u2019ll find out our ways to compete. We said we bring the competition with this merger and I hope we\u2019ve addressed any lingering questions on that front.  I\u2019ve said it before and I\u2019ll say it again. We are here to show customers that they no longer have to choose between the best value and the best network with T-Mobile, they\u2019ll get full. Our teams also been working hard to rapidly deliver T-Mobile benefits to legacy Sprint customers and they are loving all the un-carrier goodness like having access to the same great unlimited plans without future step ups. And perks like T-Mobile Tuesdays.  Well the synergies we are starting to see are not just for our investors, our customers are winning big too. At the same time, we are focused on evolving our organization structure and design to become one team that will be more efficient and more effective with clear roles and responsibilities for our employees that will help us all move faster and deliver results for the business.  This was a process that we originally expected to take 12 to 18 month, but we nearly completed in just one quarter and we felt it was important to do so. And, we are hiring. We\u2019ve double down in areas that are focused on better serving our customers today and in the future by kicking off our un-carrier jobs initiative, add 5,000 new positions in just the first 12 months alone.  We also accelerated the rationalization of hundreds of retail stores, work that we originally planned to do over several quarters and we consolidated and began to adjust our marketing spend well ahead of schedule. These actions in Q2 alone are beginning to unlock significant synergies now, setting us up financially to be able to make investments throughout 2020 and next year and ultimately unlocking future synergies on a net basis.  Last time I told you I was even more confident in our synergy plans than I was before the merger. I just \u2013 I hope now you understand why. We are executing lightening fast. We said we would, but now we\u2019ve laid down a ton of track, thus, based on the quick action we\u2019ve taken, I am confident in our ability to not only deliver $43 billion in synergies like we previously talked about, but potentially unlock even more than originally planned and to do it all faster than planned.  Now let me just say a few words about one of my favorite topics, our rapidly expanding network. In the 5G race, T-Mobile is pulling way ahead. In the past few years, we\u2019ve heard a lot of competitive \u2013 in marketing speak when it comes to 5G, all talk, and most of it is just higher. AT&T and Verizon don\u2019t want you see what\u2019s becoming so painfully obvious. T-Mobile is miles ahead of both of them and we are quickly pulling away from the past.  But instead of taking my word forward or Verizon\u2019s or AT&T\u2019s for that matter, let\u2019s just take a look at few actionable facts. Nobody disputes that we have America\u2019s largest 5G network and the competition isn\u2019t even close. Just this week, we had a major breakthrough when we launched standalone 5G. Now, our 5G network reaches over 250 million people, and 1.3 million square miles.  We now offer coverage across all 50 states and Puerto Rico on 5G. This geographic coverage is roughly double AT&T\u2019s and exponentially higher than Verizon. But it\u2019s not just our reach that matters. It\u2019s the experience our customers have on our network too that differentiates T-Mobile\u2019s 5G from the other wireless players. Verizon, as you know, likes to spend a lot of time telling you that they have a real 5G, but its 5G is all about ultra wide band or a millimeter win. But again, let\u2019s put the facts on the table. T-Mobile customers with 5G handsets already have faster average speeds in more places than Verizon customers with 5G handsets. And we are just getting started lighting up our mid-band.  We are already lighting it up in 2.5 GHz in major metros including New York, Houston, Los Angeles, Dallas, Washington DC and Atlanta. And by the end of the year, customers will find mid-band 5G in thousands of cities and towns across the country.  At the end of this year, we are currently seeing average speeds north of 300 megabits per second, better than most home internet speeds and eight times faster than 4G LTE, but peak speeds of a gigabit. It will be even faster as we exit the year, plus a massive footprint. But even today, we have the advantage.  Take a look at open signal plays. T-Mobile customers have the best 5G availability meaning that un-carrier customers get a 5G signal more often than customers on any other network, that\u2019s two times more than AT&T\u2019s 5G and it is six times more than Verizon.  Not to mention, we go found that T-Mobile customers get a 5G signal in nearly four times more cities than Verizon and AT&T combined. By the way, Verizon would also like to excitedly tell you that in that same Ookla test, they have the fastest 5G speed scores, but they often forget to also mention that you can only find their 5G 0.4% of the time.  And maybe they\u2019ll deliver nationwide 5G coverage some day, but they\u2019ll beg, borrow and steal from their LTE networks to claiming the tools like dynamic spectrum sharing will overcome their spectrum shortage. When you get to what\u2019s real about 5G, T-Mobile\u2019s network is demonstrably ahead of the competition even as we just start pouring on the gas. And it\u2019s now clear to most observers that it takes all circumvents to build a real 5G network, and our strategy to use 600 MHz low band as the foundation for 5G, something we had planned for years in advance was the right move to make. But it also shows just how well positioned we are to take share in the 5G era that everyone is now talking about.  T-Mobile controls 319 MHz of combined low and mid band spectrum on average nationwide. That\u2019s more than AT&T and Verizon combined. We also have more millimeter wave spectrum than AT&T and get this, we already have as many 5G devices on our network as AT&T and Verizon combined. This is a huge advantage for us as 5G becomes more prevalent for businesses and consumers.  All of our brands will benefit from a robust 5G network and according to the facts on the ground, T-Mobile customers are already taking advantage of how quickly we lit up that 600 MHz footprint. And the work we\u2019ve already begun to do to rapidly increase capacity and boost speeds with the second layer of our 5G layer gig, our deep 2.5Ghz spectrum Honestly, I don\u2019t think I could be more excited about the progress we\u2019ve made on this network and what we are building every single day. The fastest President Neville will tell us more about all of this when he gets his first question almost regardless of the question he actually gets asked.  As the gross leader in wireless, we are poised to bring an even more capable un-carrier to even more customers in more places. We are building the best network and offering the best value and that\u2019s what\u2019s super charging the un-carrier is all about. We\u2019ve set the stage for a strong second half by delivering powerful Q2 results.  But as you know, we are not stopping there. I really believe that as the 5G era finally gets underway at scale later this year, this is our moment. We are way ahead. We have the strongest assets and we have what will very quickly become the demonstrably superior network in the U.S. combined with the un-carriers brand DNA. That\u2019s a powerful combination that our competitors will struggle to match and that will translate into results.  Okay. Now I am going to ask our new CFO, Peter Osvaldik to take us through the financials and our guidance. Most of you know Peter. Prior to taking this role, Peter was already a huge contributor to our outstanding results. He serves for years as our Chief Accounting Officer and number two Financial Officer, participating in every major financial decision that we make.  And like me, he knows what it\u2019s like to have big shoes to fill and his transition to the CFO role has been seamless. It comes at an important time for our business. So I am thrilled to have him in the role and Peter, take it away. Peter Osvaldik : Alright. Thanks, Mike. I couldn\u2019t be more excited to lead as CFO during this critical time for the business. We have an incredible all star leadership team and I feel privileged to be working alongside each of you. We\u2019ll continue to execute on our proven playbook and unlocked incredible synergy potential of this merger for the years to come.  Before we get into the financial details, I wanted to cover off on a few points which lay the ground work for our reporting. First, we aligned the legacy Sprint and T-Mobile subscribers to our go forward new T-Mobile policies.  The net impact of these changes as outlined in more detail in our investor fact book and 10-Q resulted in a net reduction in total branded customers 14.1 million as of April 1, as compared to the standalone balances previously reported for Sprint and T-Mobile as of March 31.  The biggest adjustment was the removal of $9.2 million customers associated with the DISH divestiture including 963,000, which have been classified as postpaid phone customers in the previously reported Sprint figures. The adjustments also included approximately 40 million subscribers associated with reseller arrangements which were reclassified from postpaid to wholesale.  And recall, that we no longer report wholesale subscribers rather focusing on wholesale revenue. It is important to remember that these adjustments have more net impact on profitability. In addition, we are providing disclosures around the various impacts from purchase accounting and policy alignment in our 10-Q, but in the interest of time, I won\u2019t get into too much detail right now.  Okay. Now let\u2019s get into some of the financial details of the second quarter. Note that during this quarter, our pretax financial results were impacted by merger-related costs of $798 million, COVID-19-related costs of $341 million, as well as non-cash impairment charges of $418 million related to changes in our postpaid billing systems strategy and a strategic shift in product transport division enabled through the merger.  These costs are combined $1.56 billion before taxes are excluded from adjusted EBITDA. Q2 net income of $110 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.09 were negatively impacted by these combined factors by $1.25 billion and $1.01 per share. Adjusted EBITDA amounted to $7 billion, exceeding our guidance range. Total service revenue of $13.2 billion was primarily driven by the merger, as well as continued customer growth, partially offset by a customated 1% to 2% headwind from COVID-19 related events. And note for the reported service revenues excluded this which was reflected in discontinued operations. Next quarter, the revenue from these customers will be reported in our wholesale service revenues.  Net cash provided by operating activities was $777 million, which includes $370 million for merger-related costs and $243 million for COVID-19 related costs. This includes the one-time impact of $2.3 billion in gross payments for the settlement of interest rate swaps on merger financing. Cash purchases of property and equipment, including capitalized interest of $119 million amounted to $2.3 billion. Free cash flow, excluding the settlement of interest rate swaps that I just mentioned was $1.4 billion, and recall for the swap, the net cash outflow was only $1.1 billion, as there was an inflow of $1.2 billion in cash flows from investing activities for the return of collateral previously provided.  Postpaid ARPA or Average Revenue Per Account amounted to 130.57 and postpaid phone ARPU was 47.99. In terms of customer quality, our results in the second quarter were impacted by the macroeconomic requirements of COVID-19.  Total bad debt expense and losses from sales of receivables was $263 million or 1.49 of total revenues. This includes approximately $46 million of incremental expense related to the FCC pledge that was excluded from adjusted EBITDA. If we normalize for this amount attributable to the FCC pledge, bad debt would have been 1.23% of revenues, in line with last quarter.  As we monitor the impacts of COVID-19 and the FCC pledge in our business, we are encouraged by some of the early trends. 95% of all accounts that took advantage of the pledge have made some form of payments since going on the field.  Notwithstanding high customer engagement and solid payment performance thus far, there is a small subset of FCC pledge customers that likely will not recover. As a result, our postpaid results for Q2 reflect an accrual of approximately 110,000 deactivations, including 90,000 postpaid phones as Mike mentioned, for customers that were still with us at the end of the quarter under the FCC pledge, but whom we expect will likely not pay off their remaining balances.  Shifting gears to our capital markets activity, in just one quarter as a combined company, we raised $27 billion including $4 billion of senior secured notes issued in June at an average yield of 2.16%, a debt neutral refinancing transaction in which the proceeds will be used to retire high yield debt in Q3, with an MPD benefit of approximately $400 million and record low average yield for our company, this deal was extremely well received and is a testament to the strength of our business and balance sheet.  And also, we delivered $20 billion secondary sale of SoftBank shares to the public and T-Mobile received a $300 million fee for facilitating the transaction in addition to being reimbursed for all expenses, just remarkable execution by the team in transactions that I am extremely proud of.  Okay. Let me now turn to our guidance, which we wanted to provide as we continue to prioritize transparency during uncertain times and when others across the industry have opted to provide little or no guidance compared to normal practice. We are not immune to uncertainty either, but we recognize our unique situation as we provide you with the first set of combined results this quarter including the impacts of purchase price accounting and policy alignments and therefore we felt it was very important that we combine with best efforts guidance for the back half of 2020.  As always, we will continue to closely monitor consumer behavior, as well as economic environment related to the pandemic and how it may impact our second half results. New T-Mobile aspires to continue to lead the industry in postpaid growth and expect postpaid net customer additions between 1.7 million and 1.9 million, just a double click here of it, this guidance assumes higher postpaid phone net adds in the third and fourth quarters from what we saw in Q2 also while there was a tremendous opportunity to move quickly and win share of postpaid other devices as businesses and schools adapted during environments of remote working and learning, we expect to see a more balanced mix of postpaid phone versus other additions in the back half of the year.  We expect higher gross adds as industry churn levels increase both from typical higher seasonality and the muted churn effect in Q2 as a result of COVID-19. And we see this as an exciting opportunity as net share taker. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $12.4 billion to $12.7 billion for the back half of 2020 and includes leasing revenue of $2.4 billion to $2.6 billion.  We expect higher SG&A expenses in the second half, driven by higher selling expenses due to increased gross adds and the impact of close to $319 million of COVID-19 related costs which are excluded from adjusted EBITDA in Q2, moving back into normalized selling expenses.  Cash purchases of property and equipment, including capitalized interest are expected to be between $6.5 billion and $6.9 billion as we continue to build out America\u2019s largest 5G network, we expect CapEx to be relatively flat from Q2 to Q3 before ramping significantly in Q4. For the second half of 2020, merger and integration-related costs not included in adjusted EBITDA are expected to be $800 million to $1 billion before taxes and subject to our ability to go faster on integration.  While expenses in Q2 were primarily driven by severance and merger deal fees, we expect merger and integration-related cost in the second half to be primarily operational in focus. Net cash provided by operating activities, including payments for merger and integration-related costs, is expected to be in the range of $5.3 billion to $5.7 billion.  Free cash flow, including payments for merger and integration-related cost is expected to be in the range of $300 million to $500 million, impacted by the aforementioned merger cost and increased capital spending on the network.  And lastly, in the back half of 2020, our expected effective tax rate will be in the range of 31% to 33%, due primarily to certain non-deductible and merger-related cost incurred in the first half of the year that continue to impact the tax rate throughout 2020. However, we anticipate our future rate to be more in line with historical levels.  Now let\u2019s get to your questions. You can ask questions via phone or via Twitter. We will start with a question on the phone. Operator, first question please. Mike Sievert : And operator, I would like to just point out that in honor of Rich Greenfield and everybody at light shed, we will only be taking questions this quarter from people that begin their question with a phrase, great quarter guys. Just kidding. Operator. Operator : [Operator Instructions] First we\u2019ll go to Phil Cusick from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Phil Cusick : Hey guys. Thank you. A lot of things to ask about, but I think the number one as I am talking to people here is on the second half guidance. The $12.4 billion to $12.7 billion, can you help us bring that back to what I would have considered a \u2013 like a historical T-Mobile cash EBITDA without EIP benefit and submitting out of a lease benefit? Mike Sievert : Peter, why don\u2019t you start? And it\u2019s really, it\u2019s really about backing out the lease revenues. If you want to look at what kind of \u2013 what we call core EBITDA, not so much for yield. Phil Cusick : I am sorry. Peter Osvaldik : Yes, yes. Absolutely. And let me begin with, obviously, the second half guidance is also reflective of increased gross adds from SG&A, right. And that\u2019s both from a seasonal uptick that we expect as an industry in turn which is typical from Q3 to the second half, but also as a result of the COVID-19 cost, $300 million that were excluded in Q2 that again will become part of the normal runrate. And then, you have the leasing revenues, as you said, if you wanted to the core adjusted EBITDA. Phil Cusick : Okay. So that $10.1 billion to \u2013 or $10 billion to 10.1 billion or so, that\u2019s what you would consider to be sort of a cash EBITDA number the way T-Mobile used to operate? Mike Sievert : Yes, the way we use to operate, right. Nothing has really changed in terms of how we think about this stuff, right. So, we have adjusted EBITDA and then you have leasing and lease revenues get backed out, to get to this more operational view, adjusted EBITDA is what we focus on and guide on those. So it\u2019s important that you understand that and obviously bringing in Sprint, there is a much bigger leasing component. And so the differences between the two are greater, now that we\u2019ve merged. Phil Cusick : Yes. And that\u2019s the second thing I wanted to ask was, historically, Sprint did a lot of leasing. T-Mobile tried it and it didn\u2019t seem like you guys liked it very much. Should we \u2013 it looks like from the guidance we should expect you to continue to be leasing the phones in a pretty substantial way at least through this year, how do you think about that offer? Mike Sievert : Yes, I mean, I\u2019ll start and I\u2019ll ask Matt Staneff to jump in. Phil, it\u2019s not that we didn\u2019t like it. It\u2019s that our view is that, it hasn\u2019t always been demonstrated to add to enterprise value. And because the customer satisfaction isn\u2019t there and then you cost later on as a result. So, but it\u2019s a tool in the toolkit. We\u2019ve always done some of it.  I think, it depends on how it\u2019s done and we are open to it. The guide doesn\u2019t necessarily imply any big change, obviously. So, leasing revenues come from the runrate that is informed by the customers already in the base. But, Matt, other thoughts about financing in general and how we think about it? Matt Staneff : Yes. That\u2019s great. So, as Mike said, we are going to continue with past day one. Right now, we\u2019ve got our new proposition in the market largely it\u2019s T-Mobile the way it was before. The one thing we do that we have a Sprint customer base and we are very aggressively taking care of those customers, now watching and managing their churn helping us. A lot of them are on lease upgrade offers. And so, what you can expect over time obviously is we are not going to take away seeing some customers that could potentially increase churn. We are going to continue to serve them. And so, that\u2019s part of what you see in the leasing mix as we got options available, the T-Mobile options that we are still going to take care of for customers. And so it will be kind of more of a gradual change in the total mix versus what we are doing for new customers with that. Phil Cusick : I appreciate. Thanks. Mike Sievert : What we\u2019ll do over \u2013 but right now, as you know, we ask a one and therefore our main go to market for us to center ground. But we have all these tens of millions of Sprint customers and a lot of them make like leasing in one another lease device and we are happy to provide that. So, see that level. Phil Cusick : Yes, got it. Mike Sievert : Thanks, Phil. Phil Cusick : Thanks guys. Operator : And we\u2019ll go to our next question, John Hodulik from UBS. Your line is open. John Hodulik : Okay. Great quarter guys. Actually I got two questions. First of all, the 80 bps I am sure that that was particularly sort of a bit of a surprise especially as Sprint a year ago had, I think 1.8% churn. So, what are you doing to bring that down so quickly, especially given all the integration efforts of the store closings and that kind of things?  That\u2019s number one. And then, number two, given the availability to 600 MHz spectrum, and the pent-up demand for new phones, are you guys looking at the launch of the iPhone in the fourth quarter as an opportunity to take share?  And is that baked into the guidance in back half because I\u2019d point out that you had $7 billion in EBITDA for the quarter but just expecting sort of $12 billion, $12.5 billion for the rest of the year. So, obviously, it looks like you are expecting that\u2019s not necessarily to be the runrate, especially as we look out to the fourth quarter? That would be great. Thanks. Mike Sievert : Understood. Matt, do you want to start on churn? Matt Staneff : Yes. I\u2019ll start on churn. 80 bps that\u2019s a great number. It\u2019s a great number to have in the first quarter. Now that we are together and the comparison is accurate. T-Mobile was among the leaders in the category and as you said, Sprint was in the high ones. I think the last 42 close to 106 and down 180 basis points. One thing to consider is, this was done in Q2 when covered with the Q. And we said the switch in flows were down. We were taking care of customers and then a collection - we\u2019ve accounted for all of that. But Q2 is a bit of an anomaly and you\u2019ve seen that across the industry in terms of what churn has done. We have been very hard at work. We\u2019ve been talking about what we\u2019ve done, getting the Sprint customer base access to the network. We\u2019ve got 10 million customers kind of on a daily basis using the network. We could provide VoLTE with a much better experience and we\u2019ve been hard at work giving value to the Sprint customer base. And taking un-carrier principles and deploying them pretty broadly across the base. So we are not predicting where churn will go. And like just Peter said, seasonally it\u2019s going to be up a little bit and in the third quarter and we\u2019ve put that into our guidance.  And I can\u2019t predict where churn will go, but what I can say is that things we need to get to where it was at 0.80 last quarter, we are going to keep doing and more of as we move forward. Mike Sievert : And not to mention in addition, but the legacy T-Mobile side of things, which will be increasingly difficult for us, I am back for you because we are past day one now and where business going forward. But, the legacy T-Mobile\u2019s side had a blockbuster low churn number. And so, blended in that also helps. So this is really gratifying. We have tailwinds on churn over the medium and long haul, because we know what drives it. We have seen this journey on the T-Mobile side from some of the highest churn in the industry to some of the best churn in the industry in its network. And where, I just got done talking at length about how no one is going to be able to catch us on network. So we are really excited and to Matt\u2019s point, seasonally this year, there are going to be two dynamics.  One, COVID-19, we think the impacts of it will start to abate which brings some normalcy back into the suppression this quarter, as well as what\u2019s normal T-Mobile which is a seasonal uptick in the second half, all in against the backdrop of real exciting tailwinds. So, that\u2019s the first piece. And the second piece you asked about was, kind of how to think about the second half and I will say, we have burdened our plan with the activations, we think are necessary to deliver the growth that we guided. And that means, we know that gross activations will up in the second half, why I just told you that seasonally and due to COVID, churn will be up and we\u2019ll outrun that churn and the other guy\u2019s churn will be up and that\u2019s an opportunity for us.  When the other guy\u2019s churn goes up a little bit, that\u2019s when we compete. You asked about phones. I don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t comment about phones. I really hope there is a well rounded 5G phone portfolio as we exit the year. And so, I\u2019ll just leave it there and if there is, that would be a great competitive moment for us. So, hopefully, that helps, John. John Hodulik : Yes. Thanks, Mike. Operator : And next we\u2019ll go to Mike Rollins with Goldman Sachs. I am sorry, Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. I apologize. Your line is open. Brett Feldman : Hey. Thank you for squeezing in. Hopefully Mike come next. I think, you need call this a good quarter. So congratulations on that. I want to talk about the integration. You expressed your confidence and the synergy targets that you had outlined in the release. All the commentary sounds like, you are just moving faster than I think we would have expected, when you first now at the field two years ago.  And one of the questions will be, do we think we can start seeing the synergies come into your numbers more quickly, that would seem like you would be accretive to the NPV and also the integration spending that you outlined for the second half of this year, actually looks pretty modest considering that you had previously talked about spending $15 billion through the integration.  So, that\u2019s when you are going to win much more significantly as we move past this year, what would drive that, or are you actually at the point where maybe you are realizing there greater efficiencies associated with the integration as you get closer to execution on it? Thank you. Mike Sievert : Yes. Let me start and then ask Neville to comment. First of all, I love the fact that some of the tower companies that are out there sort of spreading some disinformation about our pace. I just got them tell you we are in all the biggest cities in the country with 2.5Ghz 5G already. And we will be in thousands of cities and towns across this country as we exit this year with that layer gig. So, we are \u2013 that\u2019s what where we\u2019ll be running really fast. Reason it feels tough over there at the tower companies is because both standalone T-Mobile and Sprint were planning on lots of new sites. Sprint for coverage and T-Mobile for capacity. New T-Mobile has synergies, that\u2019s called site avoidance and I know that\u2019s tough, if you are a tower company, because millions and billions of dollars of site avoidance are just the kinds of comments you are now hearing.  That doesn\u2019t affect our rate and pace we are going like crazy. And you are right, there is not only speed potential which is NPV accretive, but look, the faster we get out in front of the pack on the demonstrable customer provable network leadership, the more of the operating results start to give us the potential to start talking to you about the magnitude of synergies as well.  And the enterprise value created from outgrowing our competitors. So, Neville, why don\u2019t you tell us a little bit about the rate and pace, because I know that\u2019s on everybody\u2019s mind? Neville Ray : Yes. I mean, thanks, Mike. I mean, we are moving at an incredible pace. I mean, I could not be more pleased with the progress that we\u2019ve made in what\u2019s a few short weeks since we combined with the Sprint team. And it\u2019s on two fronts, I mean, we\u2019ve been rapidly accelerating the breadth of this network, if I talk to the 250 million people now covered the T-Mobile\u2019s low band 5G, 327 million of people covered with LTE too, right, and we are closing in on that opportunity for in our 5G footprint.  So, that gives us the breadth. The depth comes from the 2.5 Ghz spectrum, the mid band slice that\u2019s so important. And all I can say is, we are baking that cake super, super fast. So, to give you some idea and dimension that for you, I mean, as we get to the second quarter, every week, we were starting up great activity on about 600 sites per week.  In the last month, that number has gone to 700 sites per week. So, you can all do that math that thousands of sites in a month and in the quarter and we are running very, very hard of having that mid-band layer of the network to this great opportunity. Mike outlined the experience and the speeds.  To the earlier question about, 5G phones in fourth quarter, and we have a great line-up today, lots of great phones, great news from Samsung just the other day announced and we want to make sure that there is really only one 5G network that you would love to put a 5G phone on. And it\u2019s from T-Mobile.  The coverage is spotting your best from AT&T, nascent from Verizon and when you can combine great coverage with great performance and speed with mid band inside the fourth quarter, that\u2019s going to be a complete game changer. So, great quarter. Great numbers.  But we are only just getting started with this network roll out and the pace is phenomenal. Mike outlined, obviously, we are not building in all the places, but standalone T-Mobile and Sprint would have planned to and that\u2019s good for this business, right. We are starting to generate those cost avoidance, site avoidance synergies at pace, real pace in the second half of this year and we\u2019ll talk to those numbers more as we close out 2020. But tremendous progress underway and I couldn\u2019t be happy of.  Tower guys not so happy. We could be doing some more with the tower guys, but there is a competitive process in play right now and we have choices that we can make. So, I would fully anticipate that we will start more tower build as we move into the second half, but to be seen. That doesn\u2019t slow us down. We have lots of options to build and we are building furiously. Mike Sievert : And Peter, just very briefly on Brett\u2019s last part, he was asking about the operational spend and it was maybe, it sounded like it may have been a little less than he was expecting given the Q2 spend. Do you want to unpack that a little bit? Because I think that\u2019s some point people will understand. Peter Osvaldik : Yes. Absolutely, Brett. And as we said, what you saw in Q2, while there was an elevated amount of merger-related cost, there was a lot of transaction and then restructuring and severance, right from acceleration of some of those synergy opportunities. When we fled them to the second half, it is primarily, what I would call operational synergy capture now. So, that\u2019s when you think about the pace, that\u2019s an element to consider in there. And of course it\u2019s subject to us identifying ways to prudently go faster, which we are going to continue to do, just like you saw in Q2. Mike Sievert : But in other words, operationally, it\u2019s rapidly growing in the second half. The operational component of our cost to achieve in Q2 is actually quite small. Most of it was deal-related transaction cost and so the \u2013 and it\u2019s all operational from here on. So, it\u2019s a big, big uptick in actual cost to achieve going through the system in the second half. Mike Sievert : Brett. Thanks a lot. Brett Feldman : Is the $15 billion still the budget \u2013 sorry is this $15 billion still the budget in the outlook for integration? Mike Sievert : Yes, nothing really has broadly changed in our aspirations and at some point by the way, you raised a good question, at some point I know what, we\u2019ll owe you an update on all that. We keep saying and I hopefully we backed it up with actual evidence and reasons why we are saying it today by giving you something to chew on.  But we keep saying, hey, we are more confident now. This two year old plan, we think it may be a little conservative. I know we owe you some more color on that, but let\u2019s say, we have one \u2013 exactly one data point for this company so far and that\u2019s today\u2019s report. So, we are going to get a little bit more a line established for you and then we\u2019ll give you a different updated way to think about the future. So, I know we owe you that. Brett Feldman : Great. Fair enough. Thank you. Mike Sievert : Okay. Thanks. Operator? Meanwhile Operator : And next we\u2019ll go to Michael Rollins. Sorry go ahead. Mike Sievert : Sorry, operator, who is next? Operator : Next we have Michael Rollins from Citi. Your line is open. Michael Rollins : Hi. Good afternoon and thanks. Well, thanks for squeezing me in. I appreciate it. Couple quick questions. First, when the deal was originally announced, the management teams talked about in the pro formas, there were some expectations of revenue headwinds of Sprint plans migrate into T-Mobile plans and as you now finish this process of bringing the Sprint metrics and measures over to T-Mobile, how do you look at any potential headwinds from repricing to T-Mobile plans over the next few years?  And then, secondly, I was just curious if we can get an update on distribution and distribution presence, as you\u2019ve integrated \u2013 still managing through the pandemic and maybe some observations of customer behavior is changing upon store reopening staying more digital or it\u2019s reverting back to the historical get into the store and have a hand holding that the reps in the store deliver to the customers? Thanks. Mike Sievert : Yes. You bet. And by the way I got so enamored with the second part. Tell me the first part again, what was the management Michael Rollins : Revenue. Mike Sievert : Yes. So, listen, on pricing, revenues and ARPU and all that, one of the things you got, I think from our report was that we see a relatively stable outlook in the near-term. For competitors, I guess, didn\u2019t guide or give you much to go on, we felt with the new company it was important to us to just do a best efforts view and we don\u2019t see catalysts in the near-term for big changes one way or the other in ARPU.  Separately, you heard Peter start to talk about ARPA. And that we\u2019re looking at this at a household level, because we think there is, in the 5G era, there is all kinds of opportunities to develop deeper relationships with households that would be accretive to ARPA without necessarily affecting ARPU.  Thirdly, I\u2019ll say, our plan all along has been to bring a intense level of competition to this market like we have always done as the un-carrier, but now in a sustainable way backed by the long-term network plans that we have. And that\u2019s obviously going to be to the benefit of consumers and we funded that fully in our model. How that relates to ARPU specifically and how that will unfold over the years, again, I know we have a two year old set of spots and at some point need to update that. But a few things to say. We are bringing competition into the market.  That\u2019s who we are. We\u2019ve got the capacity to do it. It would be crazy not to leverage that capacity advantage to compete hard and grow top-line revenues through competition. So, that\u2019s number one. Number two, in the very near-term, we see no real catalyst one way or the other for ARPU changes. So we see it generally stable for the second half as we commented on. And then, Matt, do you want to jump into the second half? Matt Staneff : Yes. I\u2019ll tackle that, Mike. I think the question was a little bit around distribution look like and then what we are we seeing with COVID-19. So, the first thing I would say is, what we have shown in this quarter is a great ability to execute. Our plan had always been to get to day one, within 90 days or so from close and we effectively did that.  And so it\u2019s a little bit out. But we in all the adversity, we had to relearn a lot of things, many companies did and we\u2019ll still pull this off. And today, a vast majority of all distribution points already are cobranded or branded as T-Mobile and we are often running going forward. Like many retailers, there wasn\u2019t a issue, right, when our retail sat down and we had to keep our employees safe, keep consumers safe and put the right protocol in place.  Our team has well worked very, very quickly to be fixed and take care of customers. And we saw some changes in buying traffic, switching from retail into digital. Now historically T-Mobile hasn\u2019t relied heavily on digital. Sprint relied a little bit more and then number increased a lot, but it was a very small percent and increased by lot and it\u2019s still a relatively small percent.  I\u2019d say those numbers have been generally stable as well, as we recovered we\u2019ve gone and been able to open the vast majority of the stores in a safe way to serve customers and the communities and the market is open back up. The trends has, what I\u2019d say generally stabilized. We do intend over time like many folks to serve customers where they want to get served, that\u2019s digital, that\u2019s full digital. What we\u2019ve seen a lot of at times, is customers start digital and then fulfill on retail and we are fully set up to support that and we are going to continue to support that as move forward. Mike Sievert : Another way of saying that and one of the reasons why we don\u2019t break down digital is that, and I know it sounds a little cakey, Mike, but, all of our customers come in through digital. And all of our customers nearly come in through retail. So, in other words, their hybrid approach is almost everyone deeply researches a rate plan and many start a cart, some finish a cart.  Even the ones that come through pure digital, the majority of those get some kind of human touch shortly thereafter. So it\u2019s a hybrid model and that hybrid model to your point is changing. It\u2019s not changing in a way that\u2019s going to bring material changes to our financials any time soon, because, right now anyway customers expect a human interaction at some point in the process and I hope that changes over time.  But as long as they do, that\u2019s where our people shine. And our people are just we won J.D. Power again. We just won the highest scores ever in the history of J.D. Power for customer care. So human interactions are real source of strength of ours and even digital customers benefit from it.  The last part of your question was about retail rationalization, about the store counts, about our reach. I can tell you that, I\u2019ll go to Jon Freier, if he is on the audio line just for a quick comment because he really engineered our Head of Consumer Markets engineered this day one with so much coordination with our communications group, our marketing group, our product and technology groups, our engineering groups. But Jon has led the go to market approach and we\u2019ve simultaneously reached more people as T-Mobile now with a deeper population reach of retail than ever before. While going faster on store rationalization that people expected. Do you want to share a couple of those stats, Jon? Jon Freier : Hey everybody. Yes, it has been an incredible last 90 to 120 days and like Mike said just a few moments ago, we got a unified operation behind the T-Mobile brand. And what that really means guys is that, no matter if you are going into a legacy T-Mobile store or a legacy Sprint store, the answer is, yes, we can help you. And what we did here is, we took the legacy T-Mobile systems and installed them into our legacy Sprint stores and then we took the legacy Sprint systems and installed them into our legacy T-Mobile stores. We rebranded everything. So if you are driving around and public see these banners, that say Sprint now part of T-Mobile, so we got the Sprint exterior signs down, the new banner is up and there will be permanent T-Mobile signage that we will be following over the next several weeks and months.  But what we wanted to do is, be able to put customers in a position to say, yes, we can help you. No matter if you are coming into the store that you\u2019ve always come into or maybe you are coming into a store that\u2019s more convenient to you now. And we are in a position where, yes, we are not sending it from this store to that store, but we can help you at all of that.  So, we\u2019ve done an extraordinary amount of training, lots of system work, from a product and technology teams and our team has been in a great spot to do that. And like Mike said just a few moments ago, not only simultaneously reducing some overlap stores, as you guys know, we talked about this that we\u2019ve had stores that just have really run on top of one another and of course you are going to rationalize that, optimize that, as you need to.  But at the same time, we have exceeded presence. We actually have 10 million more covered parts across the country that we are expanding to. So that 275 million people that we are distributing to, prior to close, that was about 265 million. And so, there were places in the upper Midwest and the Great Lakes for example, where our distribution reach wasn\u2019t as great, but the Sprint distribution reach was really \u2013 was really there.  And so, we\u2019ve been able to dip those synergies and get all that behind this, get more locations to serve more customers, but our team is in position to be able to help new customer advance on the T-Mobile platform and then also take care of our Sprint branded customers until they migrate to the T-Mobile platform over the next sort of years.  So, I am super proud of what our teams accomplished. It\u2019s been an amazing \u2013 I am not of working like both what Mike and Matt said us few moments ago in this environment. It\u2019s really thrilled with what our teams have done. So, appreciate the time, Mike. Mike Sievert : It looks to us at the beginning of this, like we reach about 275 million people with our distribution now, while going faster than expected on retail rationalization. So it\u2019s a win on both fronts, really terrific. Congratulations, John. Operator, let\u2019s go back to the phones. Operator : And next we\u2019ll go to Simon Flannery from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Simon Flannery : Great. Thank you very much, Good evening. Mike, I think, at last call you talked about some early wins in enterprise. I wonder if you could just pull back more broadly and just think about where you see the biggest sort of themes of opportunity.  You had a lot of color around the areas where you saw you could make progress as a standalone T-Mobile. Now you are combined with Sprint. Where do you think the best opportunities to take share are over the next couple of years with the new network? Mike Sievert : Yes, terrific. I love the fact that we are a wireless pure play with the highest capacity in the history of the wireless industry in our plan. And because that\u2019s ultimately to our advantage. Enterprises, they have a complex know you solution providers from the biggest companies in the world and what they want from our industry is a high capacity connection at a great value and to surround around that with an easy to manage set up.  And we need to be the best at doing business within this category. So we are very focused on being the winning pure play. Mike Katz and his team have done a phenomenal job. Mike got out of the gates very quickly in this merger and had his day one weeks ago with our T-Mobile for business team integrating our go to market against enterprises, public sector opportunities, et cetera.  I mentioned in my remarks that, T-Mobile for business led the way. We had to update you mid quarter on our guidance and then we just updated you again that we beat the high end of the range of our guidance. Both of those were largely, but not entirely due to some outstanding opportunities to serve businesses public sector and schools for example in this rapidly changing landscape. Customers have reached out to us and said, hey we need help. We need a great deal. We need a high capacity service for kids. But we talked a lot in our Project 10 million about the home work gap that you recall. But that\u2019s translated. Now it\u2019s a school work gap. And it\u2019s all day, it\u2019s not just home work and T-Mobile has the capacity to serve and that\u2019s just phenomenal.  So, Mike, if you are on the line, would you want to say anything else about the opportunities ahead? Mike Katz : Yes. No. Thanks, Mike. Yes, I think you are exactly right. I know I mentioned last earnings that we are in this really interesting time in the middle of COVID and then as we come out of COVID, as companies are doing their long-term planning and maybe even thinking about possible recession that we are seeing buying happening in this category at a faster rate than we typically would have seen, rather for then companies waiting three, four, five years to buy this category.  It\u2019s happening faster. The timelines are too pressed. And that\u2019s created huge opportunity for us where in many enterprises we are not the incumbent and our teams have just done an incredible job finding that demand from customers and backing it. But at the end of the day, like Mike said, it really is about the network and the network that we have in the ground today and the things that we are doing that Neville and Mike talked about a second ago, really are going t be the difference maker for us because, businesses and government agencies first look at the network.  They look at our technical compliance we all fit to their standards and then they pick us based on all the other things that we do. And right now, we are able to meet all those demands from customers and we are now differentiating the network, not just a me too proposition like our competitors. So\u2026 Simon Flannery : COVID will close customers who may be look to switch carriers more aggressively to get a better price performance. Mike Sievert : Yes. I think and we\u2019ve seen some signs of that. Many companies out there are looking at their long-term customers and they are going to do cost transformation programs as they prepare to maybe weather the post-COVID storm. And we\u2019ve seen lots of examples that companies \u2026. I mean, this marks kind of hiding the dynamic going on in American companies, which is everybody is looking for dollars and looking under every rock to find them.  And here we are and just that moment, with the best value and the highest capacity service. So that\u2019s really exciting. The last word I\u2019ll say, on this which is also a little bit COVID-related is, the CL, corporate liable part of our market is kind of been flat lined for a long time. And I actually think that post-COVID, there is an opportunity that the changing work styles will cause us to see growth again in that sectors, just at the time we are arriving with hyper competitiveness and able to lead the pack.  So, and the reason for that is simple, some form of home work and home officing is going to continue and some amount of that will carry on and companies will feel more of a need than in the past to take responsibility for some of the home connectivity and personal connectivity of their employees. That means enterprise corporate liable lines maybe positively responsive to this environment. That\u2019 always been a castle of AT&T\u2019s and Verizon\u2019s. But it\u2019s us to take and we are scaling the walls. Simon Flannery : Right. Thank you. Mike Sievert : Thanks, Simon. Operator : And next we\u2019ll go to Craig Moffett from MoffettNathanson. Your line is open. Craig Moffett : Hi, thanks. You reported in the release that you\u2019ve converted about 10% of customers over to the T-Mobile \u2013 Sprint customers over to the T-Mobile network and that\u2019s really sort of brings back memories of the way you manage the metro PCS merger some years ago.  I wonder if you can just contrast those two, maybe particularly with Neville and talk about what\u2019s different this time in trying to integrate particularly the 2.5 Ghz spectrum what you did in the metro PCS merger which was effectively running off a network and then moving over this spectrum. And just how that should inform the way we think about the cadence of the synergy realization here? Mike Sievert : Neville, do you want to jump in? Neville Ray : Happy to take it. Hey Craig. So the situations are comparable, but they are different and favorably, so, I think the biggest \u2013 the other is that, as we look to metro PCS, I mean that was primarily a CDMA customer base. And so, we have different technologies and we knew we have to retire and move all of those customers out of the CDMA phone effectively.  Here we are with combining our traffic and our customer bases across Sprint and T-Mobile. On the update today Mike mentioned in the opening remarks 85% of the Sprint customer base have a compatible phone with the T-Mobile network.  So that 10% traffic number which is remarkable in a very short period of time. It\u2019s there because we can start open a network customer just on LTE, our Sprint customers have access to that great nationwide 4G now too. But because they have compatible LTE handsets and we\u2019ve activated and we are moving through VoLTE very quickly, which is the primary voice bearer for us.  It\u2019s not we are competing on different technology, as it was with metro. We can move those customers at much faster pace. And so, I am always hopeful and confident now that we can move through the migration of traffic and ultimately spectrum and then move to decommissioning at a faster pace. I mean, that\u2019s the game plan.  And as I said earlier we are furiously building out the network capability to house that spectrum, the 2.5 Ghz that we have a huge volume of, as you know, Craig. And as we do that, we can support more and more traffic and start to ultimately migrate these customers across. Very similar playbook in many ways in terms of how we approach it, but we are in a much better place to move faster, because of the handset compatibility. Craig Moffett : One follow-up to the previous question about the enterprise segment. What do you plan to do with the wire line network from Sprint? Mike Sievert : The competition and post- integration \u2013 are there any strategic acquisitions you are interested into accelerate though. Obviously, and I knew this asking, it\u2019s not that I can address directly, but I can tell you this, and I said it a little bit earlier, I like being a pure play. I like being, we are focused and we are disciplined. And that\u2019s going to be one of the ways that we win. Wireless is where things are going. You\u2019ve heard us say, John Ledger said for years, you\u2019ve heard us say over and over, all content in communications of all kind of leading their linear forms and going to the internet and the internet is going mobile. Mobile is heating the internet. And so, as a mobile pure play, that\u2019s a great place to be. Now, on the other side of it, I\u2019ll just say, while we are focused and disciplined we have a fantastic balance sheet. And an incredible source of Sprint and so, we won\u2019t be at choose to strategic opportunities if they make sense in our business model. But I think you are investing in this company, because you see that we have an opportunity to win in this huge market and we intend to focus and to do just that. And operator, why don\u2019t we do go to the phone? Operator : Thank you. And it looks like our next one is from Jonathan Chaplin from New Street. Your line is open. Jonathan Chaplin : Thanks. Thanks guys. Great quarter. One for Mike and one for Neville. So, Mike, or maybe if Peter. Were there any synergies captured in 2Q or is it too early? And then, how much of this is \u2013 what are you assuming for synergy capture in the second half guidance? And this one is definitely for Michael.  The $43 billion, you said a few times that you expect it to be higher, is that just from acceleration or the synergy number or the EBITDA number in year would be larger than you initially thought it would be? And then for Neville, when you get to fulfills on the 5G deployment, how many \u2013 where does that 700 sites per week goes to? Thanks. Mike Sievert : You heard \u2013 I\u2019ll have Peter comment on the first one. You heard in my remarks that, we moved faster than expected on so many elements of integration in the second quarter and you saw us flow the cost through for some of those things. And then, yes, that does allow us to start to see some runrate synergy impacts from those moves.  I also said that that sets us up well to invest in the next round. So, you have to kind of keep it in balance, because the bigger pieces to the earlier discussion are still in front of us. The actual operational integration spending was pretty light in Q2. You will see benefit of it flow in, but that benefit is really allowing us to move to the next base in the round of bases and swing again. And so, in 2020 and 2021, these are big investment years and it\u2019s important we start to get some of that runrate to flow in, because that actually helps to fund us as we go along. So, I think I kind of captured that in my remarks, but, Peter, why don\u2019t you add to that and then tackle the other? Peter Osvaldik : Yes, absolutely, Mike. So, there is no doubt, right, with the long incumbency of the deal, as well as COVID-19, right, it\u2019s a differential that\u2019s put out there almost two years ago, but we do remain highly confident in our ability to exceed and to your point, Mike, yes the moves that we made in Q2, you saw us accelerate and diligently do things and we put the 8-K out there both from organizational design acceleration, this phone rationalization acceleration.  You see what the pace of the 2.5 rollout did, which is again the first step of the three and ultimately leads to the decommissioning which is the biggest part of the synergies \u2013 avoided site builds already, that\u2019s already something that we are capturing. And so, yes, in the second half of the year, we are already going to be capturing some synergies and that\u2019s then only build them through the investment periods. And again, as Mike said, I think we are quarter into this journey. It\u2019s a multi-year journey where a quarter in we are already seeing optimistic signs and we are moving quickly what\u2019s prudent to do so. And we do owe you an update on that as soon as we can we will. Mike Sievert : And I hope you hear us saying, and we are laying down some facts to back it up now that our aspiration is to go faster and bigger. And, look, I think ultimately you are going to measure our team, based on three simple things. Did we outgrow the competition through this first timing cycle as a new company? Did we unlock the synergies bigger and faster than we promised and translate that to enterprise value? And did we set up the company for long-term success? And this management team is laser-focused on all. Neville Ray : Jonathan on the back-end of your question there on the runrate, obviously we are going to do better than the 700 per week. But I am delighted with that ramp during the pandemic. So, the great news is, we\u2019ve got great resources out there working very safely and with health and safety paramount. Our supply chain is actually really robust. We had a few scarce in the early days of the pandemic, but as things are moving really well. And I want to get into a nice robust steady state and go build this network out as we said over the next two years. I will really want to break of the back of the 2.5 deployment over the next 18 months.  I mean, that\u2019s the plan and we have a runrate and a production rate that network factory now is rolling out operates and incremental site activity on a very, very strong site. So we are in a good spot. Jonathan Chaplin : Thank you guys Mike Sievert : I am going to step out right now. But we are going to take one last question and then, Peter will wrap us up. So, from my part, thank you for this great discussion. This was a phenomenal quarter and operator, the last question please? Operator : Our last one comes from Peter Supino from Bernstein. Your line is open. Peter Supino : Hi. Thank you. I was wondering if you had any insights on Sprint subscriber churn and I know that COVID-19 makes it hard to separate the drivers of changes in churn. But do you see anything about the way Sprint subscribers are interacting with the network that gives you a quantitative sense of how their experience might be changing? Thanks Matt Staneff : Hey, Peter. It\u2019s Matt. I\u2019ll start and then if Neville wants to jump in on any other factors there. So, we haven\u2019t seen anything that surprised us and we feel great of what we have in Q2 in terms of subscriber churn for Sprint. We\u2019ve seen lots of positive signs.  We\u2019ve been able to rapidly enable roaming and the ability for Sprint customers to get access to the T-Mobile network and we\u2019ve seen noticeable declines in churn rates from those customers who have gotten on the network, which is partly why we are going very fast at getting a build out done, or we are very happy about the handset compatibility and why we are aggressively moving fast at bringing those enhanced coverage experiences to Sprint customers.  We\u2019ve also seen great participation from the Sprint customer base into some of the offers and programs that T-Mobile traditionally have like T-Mobile Tuesdays or we have that for a number of years. It\u2019s a massive, it\u2019s a great platform for customers to just could thank every day for being a customer. It\u2019s an example of something we\u2019ve rolled out to Sprint customer base and we\u2019ve seen great adoption of that new customer and that\u2019s a very positive sign.  So we have an engaged customer base. Very excited about being a part of the T-Mobile company and what we have in front of us. And so, we are feeling very positive about where things are headed. All that said, we don\u2019t know how that\u2019s going to look when we come out of the suppression in Q2 from COVID.  We are watching that. Again, as Mike said earlier, we are planning for a highly competitive back half of the year. We are pushing forward getting to normal. We need to buy systems. So we can really take share in the marketplace. Neville Ray : I just add to [Indiscernible] this access to the T-Mobile network for the Sprint customer base is absolutely key. I mean, we know the coverage churn was a major concern in the Sprint base. And you\u2019ve heard our numbers today. I mean, 10 million customers every day are now accessing the T-Mobile network and that\u2019s everywhere, right. It\u2019s not \u2013 this isn\u2019t kind of a roaming thing where it\u2019s just geographic expansion into rural environments. This is happening in building in Manhattan and Seattle. It\u2019s happening in urban cores, it\u2019s happening in suburban environments, as well as rural. Only about 35%, 40% of that traffic is actually in rural environments.  So, Sprint customers are already seeing a dramatic improvement in the coverage. We did that that they have closed. We opened up the networks for Sprint customers with compatible handsets which is the vast majority as we cover it. And so, big improvements in \u2013 that coverage experience has been a key. We are already starting to move towards looking customers over completely to a T-Mobile network experience.  We\u2019ve been very targeted without to make sure that customers on the Sprint side that had very difficult and challenging coverage situations, we\u2019ve moved some of those already completely over to T-Mobile network and there will be more of that obviously as we now ramp up our build spectrum migration and all of the activities we talked about today. So, very pleased with the progress there and very positive signs in terms of the uptake from Sprint customers using rather T-Mobile network. With that I am going to.. Peter Supino : That\u2019s helpful. Thanks very much. Peter Osvaldik : Well, thank you, Peter for the great question and thank you everybody for tuning in and we are really looking forward to continuing on this journey and speaking with you again next quarter. Operator? Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the T-Mobile U.S. Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. If you have any further questions, you may contact Investor Relations or media departments. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. And have a pleasant day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon. Welcome to the T-Mobile Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jud Henry, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations for T-Mobile US. Please go ahead, sir. Jud Henry : Thanks for joining us for T-Mobile's third quarter 2020 earnings call. With me today are Mike Sievert, our President and CEO; Neville Ray, our President, Technology; Matt Staneff, our Chief Marketing Officer; and of course, Peter Osvaldik, our CFO, as well as other members of the senior leadership team. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements that may include projections and statements about our future financial and operating results, our plans, the benefits we expect to receive from our merger with Sprint, our business operations in light of COVID-19 and other statements that are not historical facts. Such statements are based upon the current beliefs and expectations of our management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties outside of our control that could cause actual results to differ materially, including the risk factors set forth in our filings with the SEC. Reconciliations between GAAP and the non-GAAP results we discuss on this call can be found on the Quarterly Results section of the Investor Relations webpage. I also want to remind everyone that the results prior to the second quarter of 2020 in our earnings materials represent the historical results of standalone T-Mobile prior to our merger. I would also like to note that we are currently in a quiet period for Auction 107 and we'll, therefore, be very limited in any comments that we can make related to that. With that, let me turn the call over to Mike. Mike Sievert : Thanks, Jud. Great job. Hi, everybody. Well, for obvious reasons, and hopefully, you can tell by now, we are so excited to share our Q3 results with you today. Today's report shows that T-Mobile's momentum has continued to accelerate quarter after quarter as we profitably take share and outpace the competition. We surprised the skeptics and the optimists yet again, with strong results across the board and increased our financial guidance across every metric for the balance of the year. I'm proud to say that this quarter, we delivered the biggest subscriber growth in our history, in our history, with over 2 million total net additions. This is our 23rd consecutive quarter leading the industry and this quarter, we delivered more than AT&T and Verizon combined. We've now surpassed 100 million total customers, and we're pulling further ahead of AT&T as the nation's number two wireless provider. We did all of that and delivered the strongest financials in our history. ARPU and ARPA went up from last quarter. Churn went down with the best year-over-year churn performance in our industry for postpaid phones when you look at estimated pro forma combined from last year. Our $7 billion of adjusted EBITDA beat expectations and by a lot. We delivered over $14 billion in service revenue, also beating estimates handily. And importantly, we also accelerated CapEx spending, as Neville and team are running at full speed ahead on our synergy-driven network build. Even with all of this outsized growth and accelerated network investment, we're actually increasing guidance today on operating cash flow and free cash flow for the balance of the year. Big steps forward in growth and profitability at the same time. All that is possible because these results begin to reflect the benefits of operating in a synergy-backed model, allowing us to pursue both simultaneously versus the age-old trade-off of filling after growth versus preserving margins in a given period. Our operating momentum didn't just delivered growth and profitability, it delivered amazing progress on our network. I will share more with you in a moment about all that, but the country has never seen anything like this network build, which is tracking well ahead of schedule and is clearly beginning to differentiate T-Mobile as the bona fide network leader of the 5G era. I'm just so proud of the team for being able to execute at such an incredible level in a highly competitive marketplace, while simultaneously driving integration faster and better than expected to capture our merger synergies and deliver value for both shareholders and customers. We're working hard to go big and go fast, and we expect to realize over $1.2 billion of synergies in 2020, way ahead of our plans and we're only a few months in. Breaking it down, we expect to achieve more than $600 million in network synergies, primarily from avoided site builds and early decommissioning. And at the same time, we expect to realize about $500 million from streamline marketing efforts under one flagship brand and with expedited retail rationalization. And we're now done with the initial process to evolve our organizational structure to become one team that's organized to deliver results for the business, which is expected to enable about $100 million of back office synergies this year alone. Last quarter, I told you I was even more confident in our synergy plans than I was before the merger and that continues to hold true. These early results in 2020 demonstrate our focus on lightning-fast execution. I'd also like to announce, we plan to host an Analyst Day in the first quarter shortly after we report our year-end results, where we're going to share with you more details on synergies and our outlook for the business in the next few years. And just to leave you with a little bit of a teaser, we expect synergies in 2021, including cost-avoidance synergies, to be more than double what they were in 2020. So stay tuned for more. Coming back to our strong customer results for [indiscernible]. I also want to add some important context to what we delivered. First, the industry continued to feel the impact of COVID-19 in Q3, with a much slower switching environment than a year ago. As a share-taker, that is a clear headwind to growth and yet, we still lead the industry in postpaid gross adds for phones and net adds. This is particularly exciting when you consider that we also essentially retired the Sprint brand for new customers at the beginning of August, which immediately shut off in certain flow of gross adds. So, our Q3 results reinforce this team's execution and the growing strength of the T-Mobile brand to capture what we did in the market during what I would describe as a transition quarter. We continued to see very strong growth in postpaid other devices, including continued traction in T-Mobile for Business this quarter. This reflects how we were the most responsive carrier to the needs of school districts nationwide, as they've increased availability of digital learning solutions due to the greater demand for remote learning this fall. We also saw particularly strong growth in enterprise and government and recognition of our amazing customer service just continued to roll in. For four years in a row now, businesses of all sizes have ranked the Un-carrier number one in wireless satisfaction in the annual J.D. Power US Business Wireless Satisfaction Study. We think we have about an eight or a nine share in this market among enterprises, large enterprises and governments, so that's a lot of share-taking potential. It's going well and like the saying goes, we're just getting started. Next, I want to touch on our investments to expand our 5G network leadership. As you know, we are miles ahead of the competition at the dawn of the 5G era, and we're well-positioned to stay ahead. There are really two things that matter when it comes to unlocking the potential of 5G, and I'll tell you now, T-Mobile is far and away the clear leader on VoLTE. The first one is coverage. Having reliable 5G service where you live, work and play, coverage is king. We have America's largest 5G network that covers 270 million people across 1.4 million square miles. Did you know we provide more geographic coverage right now than AT&T and Verizon combined on 5G? To be more precise, our 5G coverage is double AT&T and 3.5 times Verizon's. They claim to be nationwide, but they really only cover a fraction of the geography that T-Mobile does. Verizon is showing up late to the party by using dynamic spectrum sharing to avoid being the only carrier without \"nationwide 5G coverage when the iPhone 12 launched.\" But because they're sharing spectrum between LTE and 5G, their 5G median speeds and availability overall are the lowest of the big 3 and not much better than LTE. Well, our 5G speeds on low-band extended range 5G are twice as fast as LTE, thanks to our dedicated 600-megahertz spectrum. Okay. The second element that really matters is the high-capacity, high-speed capabilities enabled by bigger channels of spectrum found in mid-band and high-band. This ultra-high-capacity 5G is where exciting things can happen. And that's why our 2.5 gigahertz mid-band spectrum is the real Goldilocks band for 5G because it has both massive capacity and it has reach, measured in miles from our towers, not meters like the other guys. We now have 2.5 gigahertz deployed in over 400 cities and towns, covering over 30 million Americans. And we're targeting more than a 1,000 cities and towns, covering 100 million people with our mid-band high-capacity 5G coverage by year-end, that's just two months away, with plans to have nationwide 5G on 2.5 gigahertz by the end of next year. This high-capacity 5G is delivering average download speeds of around 300 megabits per second and gigabit peak speeds and that will continue to grow. For all the crowing that Verizon has done around their high-capacity solution, Ultra Wideband, one analyst recently estimated that it only covers an estimated 2 million people. This aligns with the recent Ookla report which shows that Verizon customers only connected to the Ultra Wideband 5G less than 1% of the time. Said simply, our fast 5G reaches 15 times more people than Verizon's today and could reach 50, 5-0, 50 times more people by the end of this year. Our 5G network is well ahead of the competition and it's just keeps getting better. Lastly, as you know, we're expanding our Un-carrier strategy to leverage our leading 5G network and brand and scale to capture new market opportunities, and we're doing it without losing sight of our core focus. We are continuing to expand our home Internet pilot, delivering broadband service at better prices to households across the US, with a special focus on small towns and rural America. We just expanded our pilot to parts of 450 cities and towns that were somewhat abandoned by AT&T, and we continue to lay the groundwork for our wider launch of 5G wireless broadband service for homes and businesses very soon. And lastly, we had some exciting and long-awaited news with the nationwide launch of TVision. We are all about solving pain points and serving customers, and this latest Un-carrier move showcases that yet again. While there are just so many pain points in the TV arena. Customers are so tired of being forced into contracts with exploding bundles, and massive unadvertised fees and huge overpriced packages just to get live news and sports. We're providing customers with the content and -- that they want at an incredible value, which highlights the benefits of being with T-Mobile in the first place. This is all about driving our wireless business and it serves as an important enabler for our emerging home Internet business that I just talked about, as satisfied customers rely on T-Mobile more and more for their connectivity services. So what should your main takeaways be? Just make sure you do a mute check. So, what should your main takeaways be from all of this, you guys? This was a stellar quarter, really buttressing the thesis that so many investors have about T-Mobile. We showed we can deliver incredible growth, in fact, the highest subscriber growth in our history, while simultaneously beating expectations on service revenue, EBITDA and EPS, and increasing guidance across the board, including for cash flow. Simultaneous growth and profitability, fueled by the rapid and faster-than-expected unlocking of synergies, a gift which will keep giving for years to come. Far from being distracted by the merger, we're already putting the results of our integration to work as a source of strength. We did it all while pulling away from the pack on what really matters, network and the customer experience, setting the stage for T-Mobile growth leadership in this market for the duration of the 5G era. Only one company will be positioned to provide the best network and the best value in the 5G era, and that's T-Mobile. The benefits of all of that to our stakeholders, it's just an exciting story that's rapidly unfolding. Okay. Now, I'm going to ask Peter Osvaldik to take us through the financials and our guidance. So Peter, take it away. Peter Osvaldik : Thanks, Mike. As you can clearly see from our results, we delivered a quarter with record-setting customer growth while simultaneously posting strong financial results. And this profitable growth sets us up for an even stronger second half than we originally expected. So, as Mike mentioned, we're raising guidance across the board as we continue to execute on our proven playbook of delivering growth and profitability. All right. Let's go ahead and jump right into the financial details for the quarter. Total service revenue grew to $14.1 billion on continued growth in postpaid and an increase in wholesale revenues as a result of the MVNO Agreement with DISH following the sales of the Sprint prepaid customers on July 1. Recall that the revenue attributable to the Sprint prepaid customers was reflected in discontinued operations in our Q2 results and, therefore, you see a sequential increase in reported wholesale service revenue in Q3. Cost of services of $3.3 billion increased sequentially, driven by higher site cost due to the volume of upgrades we have completed, as well as higher merger-related costs, partially offset by additional synergies captured. Looking into Q4, we expect the full quarter impact of increased non-cash lease expense from a tower agreement signed in September, which will impact cost of services by approximately $150 million sequentially. Again, this is non-cash and is partially offset by continued synergy realization. SG&A expenses of $4.9 billion were down sequentially, primarily due to lower merger-related costs as much of those costs were severance and transaction-related in Q2. Additionally, we also had lower bad debt and sales expenses along with additional synergies captured in Q3. We expect seasonally higher sales costs in the fourth quarter related to the iPhone launch and holiday promotional environment. Q3 net income of $1.3 billion and diluted earnings per share of $1 were impacted by $208 million and $0.17 of merger-related costs, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA amounted to $7.1 billion, which increased sequentially, primarily due to higher postpaid service and equipment revenues, partially offset by higher cost of equipment sales and cost of services. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $2.8 billion, which includes $379 million for merger-related costs. Cash purchases of property and equipment, including capitalized interest of $108 million, amounted to $3.2 billion as we accelerated the build-out of our nationwide 5G network and ramp network integration activities. Free cash flow was $352 million, already achieving the low end of our second half guidance even with higher capital spending. Postpaid ARPA, or average revenue per account, amounted to $133.03 and postpaid phone ARPU was $48.55. The sequential increase in postpaid phone ARPU was primarily driven by higher premium service revenues, and we expect Q4 to trend closer to Q2 levels with promotional activities. And I have to mention the ongoing work done to significantly improve our capital structure and strengthen our balance sheet. Last month, we issued nearly $9 billion of secured notes with an average rate of 2.99% and an average tenure of 23.4 years. Collectively, since the merger closed, we have more than doubled the average maturity of our debt portfolio from 4.3 years to 9.2 years, and lowered the average cost of debt from approximately 5.7% to approximately 5.1% excluding the non-cash amortization of swaps. Okay. Let me come to our guidance, which we are raising across the board as both growth and profitability were much stronger than originally anticipated. Again, we wanted to provide this guidance and prioritize transparency even during these uncertain times. While ranges for Q4 can be inferred, we are updating our guidance in the context of our previously provided second half of 2020 outlook. We had originally guided to 1.7 million to 1.9 million postpaid net adds in the second half of 2020. Well, we checked that off the list in Q3 alone. So, in a Q4 exclusive, we're providing postpaid phone guidance. We'll look to continue to lead the industry in postpaid phone growth and expect postpaid phone net customer additions between 600,000 and 700,000 in the fourth quarter. Also for Q4, we expect a more balanced mix of postpaid phone and postpaid other net additions relative to the extended educational opportunities that we saw in Q3. Adjusted EBITDA is now expected to be in the range of $13.6 billion to $13.7 billion for the back half of 2020, up $1 billion original second half guidance and includes leasing revenues of $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion. The implied Q4 guide reflects our expectations for seasonally higher costs related to the iPhone launch and holiday promotional environment, as well as the non-cash straight-line lease expense impact from our recent tower agreement. Cash purchases of property and equipment, including capitalized interest, are expected to be between $6.7 billion and $6.9 billion at the high end of our prior guidance, driven by strong momentum on our network deployment. For the second half of 2020, merger-related costs, not included in adjusted EBITDA, are unchanged from our prior guidance and expected to be $800 million to $1 billion before taxes. You will notice that this implies an increase from Q3 levels as we continue increasing momentum across operational integration activities. Net cash provided by operating activities, including payments for merger-related costs, is expected to be in the range of $5.9 billion to $6.1 billion, up from our original guidance of $5.3 billion to $5.7 billion. And free cash flow, including payments for merger-related costs, is now expected to be in the range of $700 million to $900 million, also increasing from our original guidance of $300 million to $500 million. And our effective tax rate for the second half of 2020 is now expected to be in the range of 20% to 23%. This is a lower rate than our previous guidance, primarily due to higher pre-tax book income. And as Mike mentioned, we are looking forward to an Analyst Day in Q1 following year end results to provide updated color around synergies and long-term guidance, as well as a strategic overview of the business. We know this is an update you've all been waiting for and our entire team is excited to share with you all that we have going on. Okay. Now, let's get to your questions. You can ask your questions via phone or via Twitter. We will start with a question on the phone. Operator, first question, please. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jonathan Chaplin with New Street. Jonathan Chaplin : Thanks, guys. Mike Sievert : Hey, Jonathan. Jonathan Chaplin : Just a quick question on your --. Hey. Mike Sievert : If you didn't jump in there with a question after that operator said that four times, I was just going to thank everybody and end the call. Jonathan Chaplin : My question is about your 5G go-to-market strategy. So, I think you guys have a phenomenal advantage with 2.5 gigahertz as you articulated. And I think everybody on the call understands that advantage, and I'm wondering if the consumer market understands that -- the advantage that you have. And how you drive that message into the market over the -- as we sort of enter the 5G era post the launch of the iPhone? Mike Sievert : Yes. So, they don't. And that's a real tailwind for investors because perception by definition lags reality. And so, to me that's a big exciting part of this story. We've done such a great job over the past seven years, eight years reinforcing with innovative breakthrough Un-carrier moves our value proposition. But to your point, we haven't trained those same engines to the same extent on our network story. And now, we have a network story, it is just phenomenal and it's about to get a lot better. As I talked about, right now we've got 30 million people with our highest-capacity, highest-speed 5G, 270 million overall with 5G, but that's going -- that 30 million is going to 100 million. At the same time, the other guys are nearly standing still on their highest-capacity 5G. It's just going to be such a stark reality that consumers are finally going to have to pay attention because millions of people are going to have one of these iPhone 12s and they're -- with T-Mobile, they're going to actually find high-capacity 5G and get hundreds of megabits per second, and their friends are going to be jealous and not only that, they're going to be seeing our story unfold on TV. As you know, synergies mean a cut in advertising and marketing, but that's versus pro forma combined. Right now our CMO, Mark Staneff, is investing more in the T-Mobile brand than ever before in our history. Even net of those synergies and those network equities, well, mostly a tailwind for investors, mostly an opportunity for improvement. We're confident in our ability to market around here, but by the way, there is already some progress. Matt, do you want to talk about how the brand is doing? Matt Staneff : Yes. The brand -- that's a great question, by the way. I love the fact that you're asking about how we're going to get credit for the network we have. It's such an amazing place to be in a number of years, since we've been so set up for success in the marketplace. I just want to remind you as well, sequencing is important. We're just coming off our quarter where we folded two brands into one in the postpaid market and delivered these great results. We've been hard at work at getting that right. The other thing I'll remind you was, in the early days of 5G messaging, we weren't out there bragging about something that didn't exist, right? We've been going out for a year with our nationwide 5G with extended coverage, and Neville is building a phenomenal network. So it's coming. It's coming very soon. And as Mike said, we are set up more than we ever have been to really communicate the message clearly in the marketplace, both the network we have, as well as the incredible prices and value customers get from us. We've seen great success. Early indicators are showing good progress -- very good progress in network [indiscernible]. All the leading indicators you want to see are already moving and we haven't even gotten started yet telling the story, I know you all are waiting for us to tell. I won't surprise everybody, and I'll remind you as well, we have a long legacy and history of disrupting the marketplace being innovative with our marketing, and it's coming, so stay tuned. Jonathan Chaplin : Great. Thanks, guys. Mike Sievert : Cool, Jonathan. Great to hear from you. Operator, why don't we go back to the phone for the next question? Operator : Certainly. Our next question comes from Phil Cusick with J.P. Morgan. Phil Cusick : Hey. Thanks, Mike. I thought I was -- maybe missed my queue there for a minute. Maybe if you could just -- thanks for the guide, which says a lot about your view of competition in the fourth quarter, but talk more about how you see the market following some more aggressive promotions this year than last? Do you worry about the rationality of the industry from here? And then can you talk about churn as well in the Sprint customer base? What has that done versus the T-Mobile base over the last few months? And how are you doing with nailing those customers down? Thank you. Mike Sievert : You bet. It's great to hear from you, Phil. Yes. I -- first of all, if you look at -- and I'll ask Matt to pile in on this. If you look at the promotions in the industry, actually to us they look a lot like last year's. There's some -- obviously, some changes around the margins. Look, the phones underlying are a little bit more expensive from Apple, but generally speaking, we see a promotional environment a lot like last year's. It feels really intense but that's because it's the fourth quarter and it's because there is a big iPhone here. So, generally speaking, I don't see a trend line there that's at all concerning. As it relates to churn, now there is a trend line I'd love to talk about. We believe we have the best year-over-year churn performance in the industry by far. When you look at pro forma combined, remember this is a blended 0.9% postpaid phone churn that we delivered, last year we had 0.9% without Sprint and Sprint was churning at about 2%. So, we blended it all together and delivered that kind of performance, it shows you one thing, Sprint customers are starting to benefit very significantly from this combination. And of course, on the T-Mobile side, although we blend it and we don't disclose it separately, man, that's a great underlying performance there as well, like really good. So, we're delighted. And I have to say, even though we have the best year-over-year churn performance down to 0.9%, I also see churn as a tailwind thesis for investors because we have room to run. We delivered all of this financial performance : $7.1 billion in EBITDA, simultaneously doing that and delivering our best growth quarter in history with 2 million net new additions with that 0.9% churn that you know we've shown with our T-Mobile brand we know how to get down. So, I think it's a great potential tailwind on our story. But let's talk about promotions because I know you're not the only one that's going to want to talk about what's happening out there, and it is a bit of a misnomer, I think, what's happening. But Matt, do you want to share what you're seeing as the quarter is unfolding? I know everybody is curious about the view from the marketing seat. Matt Staneff : Yes. Thanks, Mike, and thanks for the question, Phil. Just to reiterate on a couple of things Mike said, the iPhones -- it's a different cycle this year than it has historically been. There is a couple of things. One, it's more spread out. It's happening later in the quarter. As we all know, Q4 tends to be back-end loaded and the offers tend to get a little bit more competitive when customers show up to shop for Black Friday and to Christmas. And so, what you're seeing is a little bit of a compressed dynamics on the schedule and you're seeing the more expensive phones launch first. And we've already seen changes in the offers that were announced and have been announced. We have a new pre-order starting just even tomorrow on the iPhone. So, it's an evolving dynamic in the marketplace. But as Mike said, when you look at it apples-to-apples and you look at the true comparison of the phone and the plan and the network experience, we think, largely speaking, the offers are about the same with one caveat. There's more aggressive base offers and retention offers out there in the marketplace, and I just got to ask why is that the case when you look at the marketplace and the dynamics. We're here -- we're very positioned to succeed like we always are. And I'll just remind you again, it's -- the quarter Q4 is a bit more back-end loaded, typically speaking, versus at the early days of an iPhone launch. We're very well set up to succeed and we think we've got a very good game plan, a disciplined game plan to continue to -- our momentum and win share. Phil Cusick : I think the fear has been that some aggressive retention offers are --. Thank you. Matt Staneff : No, that's okay. Keep going. Mike Sievert : Yes. There is a latency, but you were going to pile on a little bit. Phil Cusick : I was going to say the fear was that some aggressive retention offers would nail down the sort of porting opportunity in the industry and you would grow more slowly. Clearly, that's not what you see. Have you seen less sort of porting opportunity in the last couple of weeks? Mike Sievert : Well, switching is muted. I mean, if you look across the span of Q3, as well as what's happening in Q4, switching is down. You see that because churn is down. But what Matt was just saying, I just think is important to underscore. We've seen environments like this. We've seen highly intense environments with lots of switching, and our team has got a flexible model and we find a way to post the growth and we're just really proud of that. We've been at this for a long time as a share-taker. We invest with discipline. We try not to overdo it. But in a muted switching environment, very muted, we delivered the highest growth in our history this quarter. And it really shows, I think more than anything, two things. One, how our team executes. Every company is something. Our company is great at execution. And two, that being executing against a synergy-backed model is a real benefit because we're able to unlock the value of those synergies and invest them in growth and still deliver the financial performance and period, as I said in my prepared remarks. Phil Cusick : Thanks, again, Mike. Mike Sievert : Cool. All right. Operator, we're on a roll. Let's just keep going to the phone. And meanwhile, I'll ask Peter to scan across Twitter and see what he sees. Operator : Our next question comes from John Hodulik with UBS. John Hodulik : Great. Thanks, guys. Two if I could. First, maybe Mike on the new TV service. Could you just talk a little bit about the positioning of that virtual product? What do you expect it to do for your sort of economics of the business? Is if for churn reduction? Do you think it could be profitable? And then a couple of the media companies today sort of expressed some push back around the packaging and suggested that those offers may change. So if you could comment on that, that'd be great? And then, I don't know if Neville is on, but I thought the comments around synergies for next year. Based on how we had it modeled out suggests a bit of a pull-forward. It sounds like you really getting into the meat of the network integration in '21. And then if he's around, if he could talk about how that's going and how you expect that to ramp next year would be great? Thanks. Mike Sievert : Sounds great. Well, we'll start with the second one on network and then circle back and I'll answer your TVision question, but you're on to a great point. I mean, this is a critical year for us in '21. You want to talk about it, Neville? Neville Ray : Yes. I'll cover it quickly, John. So tremendous progress. I mean, the pace and acceleration of our plans inside 2020 has been pretty remarkable. So, the start -- the main start that I'd focus on for you in terms of progress we're making on migration first, 15% of the Sprint postpaid traffic already on the T-Mobile network. So, we're building out that capacity. You heard Mike talk about all of the work we have ongoing upgrading the network. Migration is in full swing and what follows on migration, of course, is decom and synergy acceleration. So, we've already scored some decom activity inside 2020, but we will start to really ramp and accelerate that in '21 and that is ahead of our original plans. The primary kind of decom years were really '23 and '24, and you're seeing that move forward in a material way from a timeline perspective. So super, super pleased with the progress. We want to get every customer on that one final T-Mobile network with all that 5G goodness that Mike talked about. We're going to be famous for network in this Company. That's our goal and our ambition, and we want all of our customers on that network enjoying and exploring that 5G capability as fast and as soon as we can, whilst delivering on that synergy ambition and we're very confident on both fronts. Mike Sievert : That's obviously going to be a big part of our story next time we talk when we release earnings and give you some more in-depth guidance on '21, but we're so excited about the potential because we're just way ahead of schedule. It is mostly network-driven, and Neville and team are running faster than we had expected in our model. So that's really exciting. TVision, also really exciting. We -- I'm so happy we got this out. As you know, we've been talking about TVision for a long time. We sequenced it to be sure it was here -- despite all the merger and other distractions, be sure it was here in time for our 5G broadband launch. And to your question, that's a big piece of what it's about. We're coming soon with home broadband. We're serious about home broadband. It's going to be an important way that we grow this business and make money, and you have to have the full suite of services to really be able to serve customers there. And to your question, I also think there is potential benefits on the mobile side. Customers count on us for their connectivity. They love our brand. We're able to deliver in this product a great, simple, elegant solution that we're investing in because you're a T-Mobile customer, so they get a great value and we're just smashing a bunch of the pain points in this industry and this industry is so full of them, again, as we talked about it at our launch. So, we're very excited. We're just getting started. One of the other things I've talked about for a long time is, we also intend to be a great partner to media companies and an ally because we're not a media company. We're a pure play network and connections company. And so, that's obviously got a big future for us as we -- as this world just continues to move towards an OTT future. To your very specific question, yes, we are complying with all of our media contracts and at the same time, we're working with them because we're open-minded. Some would like to see changes. And if those changes are great for customers and help us continue to smash customer pain points, we're open-minded. This is the very beginning early innings. This is a business that isn't really a business, it's an Un-carrier move, we're in it for the long haul, but we're doing it to delight customers and we're doing it to set up a home broadband business, which is going to be where a big piece of the profit pool is. Hope that clears it up. John Hodulik : Yes. That was great. Thanks, Mike and Neville. Mike Sievert : You bet. Did you find some ones online you wanted to hit? Peter Osvaldik : There is a great one from Cameron Berkshire around, when will the home Internet be able to use your guy's awesome 5G network? Mike Sievert : All right. Yes. Soon is my answer. I don't think we said, but it's coming soon. So right now, we're in a pilot. It's all 4G LTE. By the way, the 4G LTE customers love this thing. So that's really great. This is such -- as I was just saying in response to the last question, this is such an important business for us. We want to get it right. So, we've taken our time, we're piloting it, we're learning how to serve customers and delight them. But you think about the capacity of this network that Neville is building, and the fact that all of the capital for that network is paid for by the mobile business, that means we have an ability to serve customers with 5G home Internet really cost-effectively because the network is basically already built. And there are places all across this country where no normal amount of mobile usage will soak up all of that massive capacity and that's where we'll be able to offer incredible deals on 5G-powered home Internet. And you don't need a ditch dug to your house, you don't need to use old DSL copper wires, you're going to be able to experience 5G, which is many times faster than, for many people, in today's home Internet connections even in well-served neighborhoods. So, I'm really excited about it. It's coming soon. Can't tell you the date. Sorry for the non-answer. You want one more on Twitter or should we go to the phone? Peter Osvaldik : I think -- there's just a lot of congrats. People want some T-shirts, Mike. So we'll have to figure out how to\u2026 Mike Sievert : Yes. We'll take those great quarter guys tweet and stay long, but I think -- all right, we'll go back to the phone. So, operator, who's next? Operator : Next will be Michael Rollins with Citi. Michael Rollins : Thanks. A couple of quick questions. First, curious because you've now had the Sprint assets in your possession for, I guess, over six months now. Have you seen any opportunities to monetize some of the assets inside of Sprint that may not be core or strategic to what you're doing in the future? And then secondly, if you could talk a bit about what's happening with device leasing? In your new marketing plans how customers are responding? And your progress to moving customers over to a more traditional EIP program? Thanks. Mike Sievert : Sounds great. Well, we'll start with Sprint and device leasing and everything happening with financing, I'm going to turn to Matt Staneff on that, and then we'll answer your question about the -- about Sprint assets. Matt Staneff : Yes, Mike, thanks for that question. So, in early August -- I think it was August 2, when we retired the Sprint brand, but what we also did is converted the value propositions in the models within the Sprint base to match that of what we're used to at T-Mobile and we're seeing great success with that, by the way. Great success with customers continuing to come in and upgrade. It's actually opened up a lot of opportunities as well in terms of access to offers and promotions, and the ability for Sprint customers to upgrade a phone when they want to and not be beholden to other issues with the legacy products. We're still using a blend as we do at T-Mobile and as we have done at T-Mobile, but the progress we're making is really good. And over time, it's going to blend and match that more closely to what we're used to on the T-Mobile side as we continue to manage the Sprint customer base and be there to serve them for and when they want to upgrade. Mike Sievert : Okay, and great. On the other piece -- thanks, Matt. On the other piece, it's early days. I can't announce for you any great insights on that question, but I'll say two things. One, the capabilities that we inherited and that we see in this Sprint team and some of the know-how is fantastic. You really can't evaluate this team and its capabilities by the former business results of standalone Sprint. That was a company with lots of structural challenges financially. And so, it was easy to kind of side-eye that operation and assume that it didn't have much to offer. That's totally wrong. Now that we've gotten into it, there's so many best practices that we've been able to begin to adopt into the combined blended total. So that's very exciting, including the team. But to your question, there are also some businesses and capabilities. For example, a wireline capability that standalone T-Mobile never had. So we're taking a great look at that and plenty of other things. So, unfortunately, I can't sort of give you a lot of color on that process because we're looking at it, but when there are stuff to report, we'll be sure to bring it. I appreciate the question, though. Michael Rollins : Thank you. Mike Sievert : Okay. Go back to the phones. Operator : Next will be Walter Piecyk with LightShed. Walter Piecyk : Thanks. Mike Sievert : Hi, Walt. Walter Piecyk : The first question I guess is for --. Hey, what's going on Mike? First question I think is for Neville, just in terms of the synergies overall. And when you're all done with this and, hopefully, it all happens sooner than later, how many of those Sprint sites will ultimately survive? And how quickly can you get that 15% in traffic up to -- I don't know, pick a number, 60%, 80%? Like what should we think about timing on that? Mike Sievert : My favorite number is a 100%, Walt, that's the goal. So please don't reduce Neville's goals. Walter Piecyk : So how quickly can you get to 100%, Neville? Neville Ray : I can't see you but hear you. So, how have you been? Walter Piecyk : Good. Neville Ray : So, on the coverage and capacity opportunity with the Sprint sites, we are on this target to deliver about 35,000 sites that would be decommissioned over the coming years. And that would leave 12,000, 13,000 Sprint sites that we would bring into the T-Mobile network effectively for capacity and/or coverage. And we're doing a lot of work across both networks now. I don't see those numbers materially changing, Walt. The target network, obviously, we're over -- well over 100,000 sites today, but the target networks in kind of the 80,000 range, 80,000 to 85,000 sites. So, we're going to decom a bunch. We're going to add some too, right? We've still got areas where we want to add some new investment, but target range 82,000 to 83,000 sites. That's where we are today. So, very confident. We're doing a lot of work to make sure we fully understand the coverage growth and capabilities that we need to deliver along with everything obviously this 5G. In terms of the traffic number, I mean, I'm really pleased, Walt, we're six months in and we're already at 15% on that postpaid traffic base. And so, that's pretty remarkable. I didn't anticipate we'd have made that much progress in a short number of really weeks and months. So, you look at that run rate, where will we be this time next year? I hope to be in the numbers that you talk about. I'm not going to commit and say we'll get it all done in, say, 2021. It's going to run clearly into 2022. But the goal and ambition of the team here is to really drive all of this goodness on 5G and LTE capacity into the customer base of the Sprint and the T-Mobile customers in '21. And Mike talked about this huge plan and execution phase we're in to bring mid-band 5G to 200 million people in '21. And that's a massive goal, we're well on track, feel very confident about delivery on that as we'll get to 100 million this year alone. And that capacity and capability is going to be foundational to that migration opportunity. So, all things are moving very well. I'm just delighted with our progress that we've made in a short number of months, and I'm very confident in beating the targets that we put out there whenever that was, a year or so back. So things are going very well and that migration volume on traffic will continue to grow at a real pace. Walter Piecyk : Got it. And then just a similar -- on a similar topic\u2026 Mike Sievert : As a follow-up, we probably give you the quarter-by-quarter site count. Walter Piecyk : I was going to -- Mike, just follow that onto -- if it's only 15% of the traffic, but you still got the churn down to T-Mobile levels, even though there's Sprint customers in there. I mean, why is that happening? Is it just -- is customer service more important than network? Because if those Sprint customers are still 85% of their traffic or so is still on the Sprint network, like how are we supposed to think about that if we traditionally have thought about network being such an important element of churn? Mike Sievert : Yes. I mean, obviously, both elements are important. A couple of things to unpack for you. First of all, we didn't sort of disclosed for you the T-Mobile brand versus Sprint brand. We're just putting it all in there blended. But I can tell you directionally that a big piece of the year-over-year beat isn't just the Sprint, it's over on the T-Mobile side to some just fantastic unprecedented number, so you have to factor that in. And then secondly, yes, it is the big picture. First of all, there's a lot more going on in network than just that 15%. So that's important. The network experience is improving across the board, not just by carrying some of the traffic. But secondly, it's a bigger equation than that. We're now starting to provide them with fantastic offers, we're treating them great. Do you know that we did on care NPS? Just the Net Promoter Score of the care experience, it's tripled since we -- over the past seven months. That's fantastic. The way our care team has started caring for Sprint customers the T-Mobile way and they're responding. So, the network circumstances are improving, the value is improving, the customer experience is improving, and of course, there is a lot more to it than just that 15% of carried traffic. And then over on the T-Mobile side, a big part of our year-over-year beat sits right there. Hopefully that helps. Walter Piecyk : Yes. Thank you. Mike Sievert : Okay. Yes. Let's go back to the phone. Operator : Our next question comes from Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Brett Feldman : Yes. Thanks for taking the question. I want to follow-up on a point that Mike made earlier, the yield being asked about, the iPhone promo [ph], as you said, ultimately you think that this was the lot typically you would see. And that's actually sort of remarkable because this is not a normal year. And so, the TV, the industry and to yourselves, approach the market this time of year like you normally would during the season following a device launch in a normal way is very interesting. So the question is, have consumers responded to these promos in the normal way? And you said that switching is still a bit muted, again clients are meeting it, we're not quite back to normal from the customer activity standpoint. And then just as a follow-up on that, to the extent that they are responding and increasing their engagement with you, are they doing it the old-fashioned way? Or are they walking in the stores? Or do you think that maybe you're starting to see evidence that there is a permanent shift towards digital transactions that might yield more recurring cost benefit over time? Thanks. Mike Sievert : Thanks, Brett. Well, I think certainly there is more willingness from consumers, and I think that's important, because on digital, one of the things that has been so stubborn for all the carriers in the US has been that digitalization has been slow, not because we haven't invested in great capabilities. If you go to our app it's phenomenal, what you can do in it. It's because customers have been slow to adopt it in wireless, specifically. My theory is, it's because of the complexity of what we offer, and all the phone trade-ins and the financing, etc., they want to be somebody in that store to be accountable for sending them out happy. And so, that's happening. In terms of the competitive environment, I -- yes. It looks pretty much like last year to us. And with the exception of the dynamic you mentioned, centered around COVID. And overall switching is muted in Q3. It's muted in Q4. And you saw our guide, we were a little cautious just because it's -- in terms of the way our Q4 unfolds, it's early days. I know it's early November right now so you'd say we're well into the quarter, but not the way Q4 normally unfolds. It's a very holiday-centric quarter. COVID uncertainties with cases on the rise and consumer sentiment unknown, so we gave you a little bit of a cautious guide because we're watching it. But I go back to -- we've got a team that's nimble and confident, it has a great game plan and so far, consumers are responding really well to what we have to offer. So, I can't give you too much more color than that because it's a quarter that's unfolding, but to us, the overall competitive environment doesn't look materially different than last year. Brett Feldman : Thanks for that. Mike Sievert : You bet. All right. Let's go back to the phone. I do see a couple popping up online now. So we'll do that next. Operator? Operator : Certainly. Our next question comes from David Barden with Bank of America. David Barden : Hey, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. Really appreciate it. I guess, maybe for -- this follows up on, I think, Mike some of the things you just said around the guidance for the fourth quarter. So, the implied postpaid phone additions is going to be roughly flat for the fourth quarter. The adjusted EBITDA is going to be down approximately $500 million for next quarter. Obviously, there is about $150 million of the straight-line adjustment for the tower deal you guys did. But can you kind of give us some color about what the puts and takes are about what makes that quarter happen because it sounds like it's going to be a lot better than this guide? Mike Sievert : Well, thanks, Dave. It's great to hear from you, by the way. Glad to have you on the call. Why don't we just go straight to Peter Osvaldik for that? Peter Osvaldik : Yes. Perfect. Thank you, Dave. And I'll give you a little color and then I think I'll ask Matt just to give a little bit of sense around how the quarter typically shapes up in Q4, which as he says, is relatively back-end loaded. But you're right, on adjusted EBITDA, the implied guide is down sequentially, which as I mentioned earlier, a couple of factors in there. One, you see typical seasonality, right, with the iPhone promotion cycle, with the holiday cycle that typically does show a seasonal progression from Q3 to Q4. And then as you mentioned, the other big aspect there is the non-cash straight-line lease expense of $150 million. So that's going to put pressure on Q3 to Q4. And then the other factor of this, then I'll turn it over to Matt to really talk about is, how typically Q4 shapes up, right, which is very a back-end loaded from a customer acquisition perspective. So, Matt? Matt Staneff : Yes. Peter and Dave, and this kind of goes back to even some of the iPhone questions we keep getting. I'll just remind everybody, we're just getting started in this. So, we're not fully through the pre-order window for the iPhones. Q4 is traditionally an often a back-end loaded quarter. There are some shifts to digital purchases from retail, and we do anticipate -- Q4 is always the heavy device buying quarter for us and some of that's been there. The entirety of the iPhone launch is in Q4. We intend, as we have shown historically, continue to lead the market. Lead the market in net add growth in the postpaid phone business and postpaid phone growth overall. So, our guide is consistent with that in terms of how we see it playing out, and we absolutely expect the competitive intensity to what I call maintain through the MPI cycle, which in prior years might have looked a little different as it builds through Q4. And so, while this one might have come off on some appearances as a stronger, our point of view is from a year-on-year when you look at the quarter as a whole, it's exactly there. And we're very well positioned to succeed in this thing, and we think we're going to see some great outcomes, especially when customers get these iPhones in their hands and see the experience that you have with the amazing network we're building. Mike Sievert : That's great, Matt. Thanks. I'm going to go to Twitter next because there are some great questions developing. By the way, I'm so happy to see all the interest in T-Mobile for Business. Bill Ho, always great to hear from you on every report. Bill says, at T-Mobile Business has increased share, what areas have performed well? And how did the integrated Sprint legacy products and services and sales force contribute? Which verticals are offering the best traction? So that's a great question. And let's kind of also throw it -- let's do the one Roger Entner. Haven't heard from you in a while, Roger. Great to hear from you. Could you -- Roger says, at Mike Sievert, could you break down subscriber growth between consumer and business government? Also, have you started with Project 10Million? And if yes, how many households are using it now? So the short answer is, yes. Not only have we started on it but we've recrafted it. It was originally conceived as a totally free program to invest in the homework gap. What we find this year instead is a schoolwork gap. So, we added an actual paying service. Highly subsidized -- still accretive to contribute to revenues and profits, but highly subsidized to make sure that school kids can benefit from Project 10Million, even if they have increased needs versus what we originally anticipated, up to and including unlimited plans at a very attractive price. And that's actually really contributing. It was a big piece of our numbers this quarter. Our team was faster and more nimble than I think the rest of the industry at seizing a way to really meet this unmet need of public sector and school districts. So very proud of the T-Mobile for Business team. But for a little color on that, plus just how's it going, I'm going to toss outside the room. Maybe, hopefully, he's there. Let's go to Mike Katz on the phone for a little bit more on those. I see Mike. I see him starting to talk. Mike Katz : Can you hear me? Mike Sievert : Try it again, Mike. Mike Katz : Can you hear me? Mike Sievert : Yes, now we can hear you. Mike Katz : Okay, perfect. Yes, technology. Awesome. Well, hey, thanks for the question, Bill, Roger. I'll start with Project 10Million. And like Mike said, while we announced the program going live this quarter, we really got started with it in Q2 because the demand from schools and the need to connect kids to their classroom in a fully virtual environment really just caused us to go fast. So, to date, we've worked with over 2,700 school districts across the country. Million -- many, many kids, hundreds of thousands of kids have been connected. And it's also created this really amazing opportunity for us in the public sector space, where some of the most important projects around connecting students, first for big cities, for states, they're trusting T-Mobile with those projects, which is giving us an opportunity to demonstrate both this great network we have and the way we take care of customers. And it's already translating into other commercial opportunities for us across many, many, many jurisdictions in public sector. I think, Bill, to answer your question. You remember us talking last time at this call about how we got started fast with our day one for T-Mobile for Business. And we are absolutely seeing the synergy benefits of doing that. There was this great team at Sprint. An incredible team, really [indiscernible], had a great set of relationships. And we've empowered them with a network now that is second to none, especially as we move into this 5G era. And we've really seen the benefits of bringing this team over, enabling them and unleashing them to sell the T-Mobile network, pay off for us across segments. So, whether it's small business, which is a segment that both companies -- both legacy companies had a lot of strength in. We continue to see a lot of momentum in small business, but particularly in enterprise and government, where Mike mentioned during the call is our biggest opportunity given the share that we have there, we've particularly disproportionately seen growth across those two groups and businesses are starting to see. Their testing us, they're recognizing that the network is better, they're seeing us in action and seeing the service that we can deliver. And service really matters to enterprise and government customers, and we're getting chosen more oftentimes than not when we're getting in front of customers and get the opportunity to tell our story and demonstrate our services. Mike Sievert : Mike, congratulations to the whole TFB team for an all-time record quarter for TFB. It's just amazing. And so, yes, Project 10Million was contributing -- by the way, free product -- Project 10Million also out there in volume helping so many school kids and school districts. That, of course, is not in our numbers, none of that would be reported as a subscriber, but it's just nice to see the difference that our Company is able to make with the size and scale of this network. So, we're so proud of it. Jim Patterson online, no stranger to this Company, by the way. Great to hear from you, Jim. Jim says, at TMUS great report. How will the Company ensure an equal or greater 5G in-building experience for enterprise customers? Will T-Mobile accelerate their in-building deployments or rely on existing towers and small cells to provide coverage? I'll turn it to Neville. I'll just start by saying, first of all, remember, Jim, one of the things that makes this Company so different is that, our low-band is lower, penetrates buildings better, reaches further from towers. Our mid-band reaches miles not meters and can put very, very high-capacity experiences into buildings from the macro network. And that's a differentiator for us. So, we have less reliance on this, but it doesn't mean we're not a friend to it. We certainly are. So, Neville, do you want to talk a little bit\u2026 Neville Ray : Yes, super quick. Good to see you online, Jim. For sure, right? I mean, a big, big part of this 5G experience is in-buildings, not just for enterprise but for consumer. And you heard Mike outlined there how our low-band position that 600-megahertz spectrum really sets us up. I mean, we've got follow spectrum, which we were able to commit to 5G in good volumes and that's really making a difference for all customer experience. But absolutely, we have to do more on the enterprise space. There are tough environments, which we know you have to go after from the inside-out. So, yes, we are ramping that activity, a lot of activity in collaboration ongoing with Mike Katz, who was just on, with Mike's team. We're looking at all the solutions. Those traditional DAS, I'm super interested in applying millimeter wave spectrum. We have a lot of that and we're going to look to use that in-building. And quite frankly, I mean, that's a great opportunity for millimeter wave. Poor old Verizon is out there trying to build an on-street network with millimeter wave and the performance is just quite, frankly, nimble as Mike outlined in the opening comments. We're going to make sure that outdoor experiences is there from deep spectrum on macro sites and small cells and we'll use millimeter wave where it makes sense. And one of those environments is going to be in-buildings and that's a great way for us to attack 5G experience indoors, especially for the enterprise. Mike Sievert : Sounds great. I was nice about it, though. If you give Neville enough time, he'll slay the competition. So, I know we're out of scheduled time, but we'll do two more if we hold ourselves to try and be brief because I want to make sure that we're hitting enough of the people on the phone. So operator, let's go to the phone and we'll do our final two questions. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson. Craig Moffett : Hi. Thank you. I wonder maybe we could stay with the Business services conversation that you were just having. You talked about being in the sales process and getting in front of customers. How much of the sales process decision-making among, particularly enterprise and government customers, is already based on expectations around 5G? And what are the applications, and is it latency or IoT? What are the applications in 5G that you see starting to drive decision-making in the enterprise market? Mike Sievert : Yes. Craig, I'll be brief on this one instead of tossing it out. The answer is yes, but it's not necessarily yet at scale driving our business centered around new applications. That's common. What's driving our business right now is reliable, high-capacity network leadership on smartphone. And there are plenty of other things that we're working with customers on. But if you're asking what's contributing to our results in getting us in the door, it's that unlike consumers -- and this is really interesting because it goes to the premise that we -- I think the very first question was consumer perception of our network. Unlike consumers, businesses test this stuff. They'll check out 100 phones and run them through the ringer for six weeks and then decide. And you know what? When they do that we're winning, especially to the premise of your question, when the question is, who's got the best 5G coverage and capacity and experience? Because it's just -- it's not even close right now and they know it we're pulling further away from the pack. Businesses want their employees connected right now more than they ever have. They need that connection to be reliable and they need it right now especially to be high-capacity and that's what we're able to offer. So, as we just said, Mike and team just posted the biggest quarter in our history for TFB. We're so proud of them, but this is really more than anything a story about network leadership, we've kind of caught up on LTE. But the real story is how far ahead we are for -- on 5G and how well positioned we are, to the premise of your question, Craig, to stay ahead for the duration of the 5G era. Craig Moffett : And so, are customers looking out and I'm really pre-planning for 2023 and '24 when my enterprise is going to need these services and I want to be on the T-Mobile network now in preparation? Mike Sievert : I don't think that's what's driving our business. Yes, of course, they are doing that and with time frame sooner than that. But right now what's driving our business is the dynamic I talked about. And so, a lot of that can be additive when it comes to the low-latency, high-capacity experiences, network as a service for enterprises, automation services, all the things -- augmented reality, virtual reality, all the things that we can deliver with a high-capacity, low-latency network, most of those things are still in our future as it relates to how they can contribute to growth. What's contributing right now is that, they understand our story that we're out in front, and we're going to stay out in front. And I think that's a lot of comfort to somebody picking a partner in the 5G space. Craig Moffett : That's great. Thank you. Mike Sievert : Okay. Great to hear from you. Let's go to what I think is going to be our last question, right? Because the time frame, I want to be respectful we said 2 :30. So, operator, let's go to the last question. Operator : And that question comes from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Simon Flannery : Great. Thanks for fitting me in. Mike, great results, but the whole industry had some pretty robust subscriber numbers both on the postpaid side and on the prepaid side, which was impressive given that there wasn't really a new iPhone cycle in Q3. So, any sense on the sustainability of this and what you see? Is it more second devices? Is it more younger people, etc., maybe using some of the money they are not spending on other things in this environment? So any color there would be great. And any update on the Shenandoah negotiations next steps and timing on that? Thanks. Mike Sievert : Sounds great. Well, on the first one, you have to look underneath everybody's report. When you look underneath ours, you saw postpaid phones again leading the industry very strong performance on the centerpiece that we've always focused on. The prepaid leader, T-Mobile continuing to grow from a leadership position, which is not something you've been able to see postpaid leaders do reliably in the past, so that's great. And then you saw our great outsized performance on postpaid other, driven by a number of different dynamics, including those dynamics you talked about. People adding to their relationships with us, but also new opportunities in TFB, we spent some time on the call talking about. So that's what happens when you double click into ours. When you double click into our competitors, there are some gymnastics. A lot of the big numbers have to do with like reversing accruals from previous quarters that were too conservative, or strange things in the prepaid space having to do with connected cars and accrual reversals that when you really look underneath it, I don't think cricket's crowing at all. In fact, I think they reduced. So, you really have to look through the reports right now because COVID made things so difficult. What you get from us is transparency, lots and lots of it, you got to work a little harder to get underneath the reports of our competitors. But I think you're seeing because of this public sector the dynamic, you're also seeing some terrific category growth. And then you asked about Shentel, so do we want to say anything, give an update on how that's [indiscernible] we can't, right? Yes. I hate to end on no, we have no response. But we're following a process. The original agreement is that we had with a couple of these partners called for us to have the rights to buy and there is a prescribed process on valuation and we're following that process and we just don't have anything to report. So, I'm ending this call on a no comment. That's great. Listen, you guys, thank you for you're in. We're so proud of the results that the Company was able to post. Really look forward to talking to you again when we report the full-year and double clicking with a longer conversation with our 2021 Analyst Day, so stay tuned for all that. Thanks, everybody. Peter Osvaldik : Absolutely. Thank you everyone for tuning in. Operator, go ahead and close the call. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the T-Mobile U.S. third quarter 2020 earnings call. If you have any further questions, you may contact the Investor Relations or media departments. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect, and have a pleasant day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon. Following opening remarks, the Earnings Call will be open for questions. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jud Henry, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations for T-Mobile U.S. Please go ahead, sir. Jud Henry : Welcome to the T-Mobile's fourth quarter and full year 2020 earnings call. On the call today are Mike Sievert, our President and CEO; Peter Osvaldik our CFO; Neville Ray our President of Technology; Matt Staneff, our Chief Marketing Officer, as well as other members of the senior leadership team. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, which involve a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. We provide a comprehensive list of risks factors in our SEC filings, which I encourage you to review. Our earnings release, investor tax book and other documents related to our Q4, and full year 2020 results as well as reconciliations between our GAAP and non-GAAP results, we discuss on this call, can be found on the quarterly results section of the Investor Relations website. Please note that we expect to file our annual report on Form 10-K later this month, final completion of our first year-end audit following our merger with Sprint. Results prior to the second quarter earnings materials represent the historical results standalone T-Mobile. Prior to our merger with Sprint, I will also note, that we will not comment directly or indirectly on the SEC's ongoing C-band auction, C-band spectrum or the post auction market structure. Likewise, we look forward to having a great discussion with you around our merger synergies and future business trends at our upcoming Analyst Day, and we focus today's Q&A on our 2020 results and guidance for 2021. With that, let me turn it over to Mike. Mike Sievert : Thanks Jud. Hi, everybody. We are coming to you live from our Bellevue, Washington offices today, we have some amazing results to cover, and we're going to jump right in. I did plan this call to be a little bit shorter than usual to respect your time, mindful that we're going to be seeing you for a much more in-depth discussion at our Analyst Day coming up just next month, our whole team is really looking forward to being with you. But today, we are so excited to share our Q4 and full year 2020 results. And with results like these, I never get tired of hosting these calls and talking about our business because as it turns out, 2020 was T-Mobile's best year ever across our major customer and financial metrics, not just because we're bigger now after our merger, but because of how our team delivered, and we kept up this year with a very strong Q4, beating expectations and showing that we have momentum on our side. So, our business is well positioned for success in 2021 and more importantly beyond. From network to synergies, to operations and new investment areas, T-Mobile showed again this quarter that we're positioned to win. Those of you that follow us, know that we are focused on three core ambitions. First, continuing to profitably outgrow the competition. Second, delivering bigger than expected merger synergies, faster than anticipated to drive scale and enterprise value. And third, making the decisions and investments to drive the long-term growth and the exciting cash generation potential of this company. As you look at our full year and Q4 results, it's clear that we're doing exactly that. And the thesis for our company has never been more clear. We're very rapidly leaping ahead of the pack on network, with the best assets, the best team and the most loved brand in our space. If we play our cards right, T-Mobile is positioned to stay ahead in the 5G race for years to come. This quarter showcased a few key points, that are important to understand when you look at T-Mobile and when you look at the whole competitive landscape. First, we delivered the highest postpaid customer growth in our history in 2020. Finishing on top of the pack again in Q4, while simultaneously delivering strong service revenue, EBITDA and cash flow. Look across the major players in this industry. And you'll note that only T-Mobile delivered significant growth in customers and profitability. Second point, T-Mobile delivered the industry's best churn on our flagship T-Mobile brand. And we did it by delivering the best-in-class experiences across network, value and customer service. Just let that sink in for just a second, the best churn in the industry. Although we don't normally report on T-Mobile brand specific churn, I did want to make that point clear. T-Mobile went from worst to first on churn with our winning formula. And that formula is only getting better as we pull away from the pack on 5G and more customers begin to care about that. And here's the point, we know how to apply that same formula to our much higher churning Sprint branded customers, creating a big potential tailwind on future performance once this integration is substantially complete. Third key point, our growth and profitability are fueled by the rapid unlocking of synergies, which we are achieving faster than expected, as today's numbers made very clear. And finally, these synergies have helped us deliver the nation's fastest biggest and most available 5G network, which is going to inform the competitive landscape for years to come. So, let's dive into these just a little bit. As you saw in January, when we shared our early customer results, we ended 2020 as the clear growth leader in wireless, profitably taking share again, despite all the complexities of our merger. In fact, we delivered our highest ever total postpaid net adds of 5.5 million, and we grew our postpaid phone base by an estimated 2.2 million and industry best. We did all that and still delivered strong financials building upon our improved scale from the merger, with over $50 billion in service revenue growing year-over-year, when our peers were relatively flat, and growing to $24.6 billion of adjusted EBITDA. In a quarter when Verizon sacrificed growth for profitability and AT&T sacrificed profit growth for customer growth, only T-Mobile delivered customer growth and profitability growth, beating consensus on both. And with our guidance that Peter will share in a moment, it looks like only T-Mobile is expected to deliver both again, in meaningful ways again, this year. Churn, as I mentioned, we also didn't miss a beat on churn. Our total postpaid phone churn across all brands was essentially flat year-over-year for both the full year and the fourth quarter compared to standalone T-Mobile a year ago. This is including the legacy Sprint customers that were churning at over 2% this time a year ago in Q4. And as I said, postpaid phone churn for our branded T-Mobile base was the lowest of all national carriers. And a company record low for Q4, a reflection of genuine customer loyalty that's earned by giving customers the best network and the best value with great customer experiences, something that the Un-carrier is truly famous for. And as we continue to integrate, we're bringing more of that same T-Mobile experience directly to our Sprint customers. As we saw in Q4, others may try to buy customer loyalty, because they see what we see, we're pulling ahead of the pack on network, and we're about to take all their customers. But unfortunately, their results show that it's painfully expensive and ultimately just a band-aid to mask to real drivers of why customers eventually leave. The fact is there are no shortcuts to creating genuine loyalty, and sustainably low churn. And I'm confident we'll see all of this play out down the road. And while we're talking about great customer experiences, just today, J.D. Power recognized T-Mobile for the Best Customer Care in wireless for the 21st time, and the 7th time in a row. Meaning we've earned more top honors than any other wireless provider in the history of their study. As you've heard me say before, T-Mobile now has the scale and the resources to do something that's never truly been done before, offer customers the best value and the best network. Perceived network quality was the moat around the Verizon and AT&T castles that allowed them to overcharge customers for years. But T-Mobile is freeing customers across the country from having to compromise. This evolution creates a path to penetrate further into prime customers and businesses that require the highest quality network experience and it creates compelling reasons for them to adopt more premium plans. One of the reasons all of this works is that only T-Mobile is operating in a synergy backed model, which allows us to simultaneously deliver customer and profit growth, while also investing big in the business. Let me say this, our national capital plan may be ambitious, but it's known, and it's supported by our massive synergies. We'll talk about this more next month, I expect. Let's talk about those synergies for a minute. We delivered $1.3 billion in run rate synergies in 2020. That's more than we guided last quarter and well ahead of our plan. This progress includes the start of our customer migration work, something that's key to unlocking synergies, and we already have over 4 million Sprint customers moved over to the T-Mobile network. I also told you that we expected synergies in 2021 to be more than double what they were in 2020. While we still expect it to double [indiscernible], as we now expect to realize $2.7 billion to $3.0 billion in run rate synergies in 2021. These synergies allow us to make smart investments in the future. And that starts with the network. Only T-Mobile offers the fastest, biggest and most available 5G network in America. The country has never seen anything like this network build. We're tracking ahead of schedule and the results are clearly beginning to differentiate, not just on 5G but on network performance overall. To have the best network you have to win across both coverage and capacity. T-Mobile's extended range 5G now delivers 5G coverage across 1.6 million square miles reaching 280 million people, offering nearly 2.5 times more geographic coverage than AT&T and nearly four times that of Verizon's so called nationwide 5G. And we're also expanding our Ultra Capacity 5G at an unprecedented pace. This is where you see truly game changing speeds and capabilities enabled by the bigger channels of spectrum, found in mid band and millimeter wave. We brought Ultra Capacity 5G to 106 million people last year, 50 times more than Verizon's Ultra Wideband just crushing our goals. And now we're on to our next audacious goal to cover 200 million people nationwide by the end of this year. For a number of reasons, getting to 200 million is a much taller challenge, but we plan to the biggest network factory this country has ever seen. And we're up to the test. This is important. We're now running a huge deployment machine at pace with a proven rollout model, something that takes a long time to ramp, a process we started way back in early 2018. I expect we'll be talking more about this advantage next month also. And third parties are seeing the results. Just last week, new independent data from Open Signal was released and it's based on billions of measurements from real customers. And it proves T-Mobile customers get the fastest 5G download speeds, fastest 5G upload speeds and they get a 5G signal more often than anyone else. And of course, you'll see these advantages in our marketing and messaging, including with our latest Superbowl message this weekend. Actually, I think the perception battle is the biggest one. We're all over. This team operates and executes. And our goal is to not miss opportunities. For example, we're increasing our specialized sales force and building tailored products for large enterprise and government, we see room to run here. We've competed mostly on price in the past if we're honest. And now we have a premium product that's increasingly the catalyst for our wins. On the consumer side, we're planning to add significantly more points of distribution and thousands of sales and service agents to reach beyond urban areas where we have historically had our big success. We have a multiyear expansion plan to bring real competition and a quality service to 50 million U.S. households in smaller markets where our market share is currently only half of what our national market share is. This is a huge opportunity to bring our Un-carrier story to more of America. And we'll soon roll out our 5G home broadband offerings to bring critical connectivity to rural parts of this country and actual competition to the cable operator. All of these opportunities are built on our game changing Ultra Capacity 5G that we are rapidly expanding across the country, further distancing ourselves from the competition every day. So, these are just a few things to whet your appetite. We'll dive deeper into each of these opportunities next month when you can hear directly from the leaders who are driving these growth areas. So hopefully, you get the idea that this team believes T-Mobile is well positioned. We will expand our front in Un-carrier strategy and capitalize on our emerging network leadership, our customer loving brand and our new scale as we tackle the challenges and opportunities that are ahead. As I said earlier, this wasn't just another great year T-Mobile. It was our best year yet, we delivered the highest postpaid customer growth in our history, while simultaneously delivering strong revenue, EBITDA, and cash flow growth. Only T-Mobile delivered significant growth in customers and profitability, fueled by the rapid and faster than expected unlocking of synergies. And only T-Mobile can say that we offer the nation's fastest, biggest, and most available 5G network. And we did all this, while navigating a pandemic that made us rethink how to best serve our customers and protect our employees and in only the first nine months after the merger. Great work by an amazing team. And you know what, we're just getting started. So, let me turn it over to Peter to take us through the financials and our guidance. Peter, take it away. Peter Osvaldik : Thanks Mike. As you can tell we're fired up, we finished the year with exceptionally strong results and there is no doubt we're entering 2021 with great momentum. After writing our second half guidance on our Q3 earnings call, we executed on our winning playbook and beat expectations yet again in Q4, so let's jump right in. Service revenues grew to $14.2 billion driven primarily by our continued growth in postpaid customers. Cost of services of $3.8 billion reflects the accelerated volume of site uprights to support the rapid deployments of our 5G network as well as over $500 million in merger related cost as we continue our network integration. SG&A expenses of $4.8 billion included over a $150 million in merger related cost as we advanced our integration efforts and included benefits from increased synergy realization. Net income of $750 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.60 were both better than consensus expectations and included merger related costs of $506 million or $0.40 per share in Q4 on an after-tax basis. Adjusted EBITDA amounted to over $6.7 billion ahead of our guidance and consensus expectations and included lease revenues of $1.2 billion. Our pretax merger related costs which are excluded from adjusted EBITDA were $686 million. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $3.5 billion driven by our strong operating performance while cash purchases of property and equipments including satellite interest amounted to $3.8 billion as we accelerated the build-out of our nationwide 5G network. Free cash flow which was fully burdened by merger related costs of $583 million amounted to $476 million, an increase over Q3 even while funding our accelerated network investments. Postpaid ARPA or average revenue per accounts amounted to a $133.08 while postpaid phone ARPU was $47.86 as we continue to grow the number of customers per account and ARPU was in line with our Q2 ARPU as we had previously guided. A big shout out to our teams for great execution all around to deliver strong results in a very challenging year. Okay, let's talk about how this momentum carries into 2021 which is a peak investment year from an OpEx and EBITDA perspective while simultaneously delivering on our promise of continued profitable growth. We expect total postpaid net additions to be between $4.0 million and $4.7 million reflecting our continued focus on profitable growth despite the ongoing COVID-19 impact on the switching environment. Going forward, we will focus our guidance and discussion of results on core adjusted EBITDA for improved clarity and transparency, given that we have deemphasized leasing as part of our value proposition. And I know it is how many of you look at our results since the merger already. We expect core adjusted EBITDA in 2021 to be between $22.6 billion and $23.1 billion. This is based on adjusted EBITDA that is expected to be in the range of $26.5 billion to $27.0 billion and includes leasing revenues of $3.8 billion to $4.0 billion. A strong year-over-year increase in core adjusted EBITDA reflects the expected growth in customers and service revenue as well as an expected increase in synergies partially offset by our investments to unlock profitable growth factors and an expectation of decreased switching activity driving higher customer acquisition expenses compared to 2020. Core adjusted EBITDA for 2021 also includes the full year impact of the non-cash expense from our master lease agreement with American tower. We call, this is the straight-line accounting impact resulting from the long-term nature of the agreement, which generates cash savings from day one, while allowing for full flexibility for network deployments. Merger related costs not included in adjusted or core adjusted EBITDA are expected to be between $2.5 billion and $3.0 billion before taxes primarily driven by network activities. Cash purchases of property and equipment, including capitalized interest are expected to be between $11.7 billion and $12.0 billion as we continue the robust pace of our 5G deployment and network integration, while also realizing procurement savings from our increased scale, enabling our investment dollars to go further. Net cash provided by operating activities, including payments for merger related costs is expected to be in the range of $13.0 billion to $13.5 billion. And importantly, this figure excludes proceeds related to the beneficial interest in securitization transactions, which is expected to be approximately $3.7 billion to $3.9 billion and as classified and investing activities for accounting purposes. Together, this results in expected free cash flow, including payments for merger related costs to be in the range of $4.9 billion to $5.4 billion, reflecting its growth in the strong cash flow generation capabilities of this business, even with higher levels of investments, and does not assume any material net cash inflows from securitization. We also expect our full year effective tax rate to be between 24% and 26%. And lastly, we delivered $1.3 billion in synergies in 2020 and we should expect synergies in 2021 to between $2.7 billion and $3.0 billion. Breaking down 2020 we realized approximately $700 million in network synergies primarily from avoided new site builds and early decommissioning. At the same time, we realized about $600 million from streamline marketing efforts under one flagship brand, expedited retail rationalization, and move quickly to evolve our organizational structure. As we look to 2021, synergies are likely to be fairly evenly split between network related and SG&A related savings, with roughly two-thirds coming from cost reductions and roughly one-third from avoided costs that are not reflected in run rate, P&L trends, similar to 2020. Altogether, we expect 2021 to be another year of profitable growth and free cash flow expansion, while continuing to invest in our network and the business to unlock significant expansion and future free cash flow that is so exciting. And I must mention ongoing work done to significantly improve our capital structure and strengthen the balance sheet. Last month, we issued 3 billion of unsecured notes that set a record low yields for five-year, eight year and 10-year tranches in the high yield market, including issuing 10-year secured notes below 3%. We will provide updated color around synergies, mid and long-term guidance, as well as a strategic overview of the business at our Analyst Day next month. And we can't wait to have a great discussion. And before we open it up for questions about our 2020 results and our 2021 guidance, just a reminder that we're currently in a quiet period for Auction 107 and will therefore not make any comments related to that. All right, let's get to your questions. You can ask questions via phone or via Twitter. We'll start with the question on the phone. Operator, first question please? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Philip Cusick with JP Morgan. Philip Cusick : Hey guys, thanks a lot. One for Mike, one for Pete. Mike, can you talk about your customer strategy this year, I see aggressive two-year free line offers in the market and that should help units. How should we think about that going after accounts as well? And then second for Pete. Maybe dig into the EBITDA guide with double the synergies and a similar mix of cost reductions year-over-year versus avoidance. I think people wonder why it can't be better. Thank you. Mike Sievert : Hey Phil, thanks. You're a little muddled there, I think the first part of you're asking about the competitive environment and customer growth and account growth. We really like what we see. And we probably aren't surprised to hear that, because our model is proven over and over again to be flexible. And in times when there's incredibly intense competitive pressure, we find a way. And at times, when there's a more muted switching environment, we find a way. And that's what we're doing. And that's what you see in this very ambitious guide that we put in front of people today, with all the normal and usual caveats. So, we're really excited. And obviously, what we are expecting to see will be the 2021 year that hopefully transitions us back out by the end, some of the dynamics that have dominated the competitive landscape in '20 due to COVID-19, muted switching, challenged payment environments, recessionary circumstances, et cetera. We'll have to see how it goes. But the thing you should take, I think confidence in is that our plan is nimble and flexible. And we're able to call the audibles as we see them. As you saw with three quarters of very, very strong performance that we just kept off since the pandemic began. Now I think you were going to turn to Peter as well, for the second piece. I'll switch over to Peter. Peter Osvaldik : Yeah, thank you, Mike. And yeah, Phil you're a little muffled there. I think you were asking about EBITDA, as well as synergy capture, and whether both could be better is that, hopefully that's right. So, let's start with synergy. And we're [trading] [ph] $2.7 billion to $3.0 billion. Now remember, with nine months ago is when we closed this merger, and to already be delivering much faster than we anticipated $1.3 billion in 2020 alone and the guide of 2.7 to 3.0 in 2021 it's just showing actually the rapid pace of what's happening here. And if you remember, it's a multi-phased approach. And the vast majority of the synergies still come from network and decommissioning of the cell sites, some of the associated backhaul leases, et cetera. And the first step in that just to build the anchor network, and you see the rapid pace that Neville and his team are just dominating the delivery, the ramp up of the machine that's going to flow all the way through 2021. That part is what unlocks then the ongoing migration of customer traffic and customers on to the anchor network. And then of course, we can realize all those synergies on the back end. So, I've got to tell you, I'm fundamentally extremely excited about the $2.7 billion to $3.0 billion in synergies for 2021 as well as the rapid pace on the network piece, which really sets us up for the back end there. In regards to EBITDA, again, let me give you a little more color. First, as you know, we were the only major carrier to show meaningful growth when comparing 2020 to proforma 2019. And our '21 guide highlights our commitment to the three priorities of profitably acquiring the competition, unlocking synergies bigger and faster, and investing in our business to set us up for the long-term growth and free cash flow generation. And the first in context is a couple of things that we want to highlight when thinking about 2020 and 2021. First, as you know, 2020, that's slightly over $500 million of COVID related costs, which were excluded from adjusted EBITDA with the majority of those now being part of the run rate of the business. 2021 also has a higher non-cash straight line lease expense associated with that agreement with American Tower, an agreement that has significant positive NPV cash savings from day one, and operational flexibility for Neville and his team to continue the rapid pace that he's deployed on. We also anticipate, as Mike said, a gradual return to higher switching in 2021, which comes with higher upfront sales expenses, of course, as the share taker in the industry, but also sets us up for that customer lifetime value benefit to the enterprise value of this business. And we're doing all of those things, and growing core EBITDA year-over-year, while we make investments in 2021, to enable their long-term success of the company. We heard about it from the network perspectives, you heard Mike talk about an enterprise as well as distribution expansion to capitalize on the network. So, if you consider all of those factors, it makes the guided core adjusted EBITDA that much more compelling, and highlights the success of a profitable growth and synergy backed model we are executing on, which is also beginning to deliver on the free cash flow unlock promise of the business, as you can see from that element of our guidance. So hopefully I captured all your questions and got that right. Mike Sievert : That's a new strategy. If you come in muddled and we can't hear you we just start talking about whatever we want to say. Philip Cusick : Thanks for all that. All right. Mike Sievert : All right. Operator, let's go back at the queue. Operator : Certainly. Our next question comes from John Hodulik with UBS. John Hodulik : Great. Thanks. Hopefully you guys can hear me better than [Indiscernible] hey. I guess first follow-up, any way you can sort of size each one of those categories that Peter gave [indiscernible], so call in the $500 million for the COVID cost. But just give us some sort of relative important spend on each one of those items, I think will help a lot. And maybe Matt you can talk about how it sets you guys up for maybe better growth in '22? And what we can expect in terms of benefits from that? And then secondly, separate questions. Just can you talk a little bit about the competitive environment and what you expect in '21 the basis or the guidance, especially in the last week we heard Comcast talk about [indiscernible] and leading them to the wireless market obviously [indiscernible] very competitive. Just how do you expect to see the competitive markets evolve as we go through '21? Mike Sievert : That sounds great. I'm going to get Peter in a minute to second to unpack that. So, Peter, think about that EBITDA question and I'm going to go straight to Matt there because I think, John this competitive environment something we really should double click into and there are some things to say about Sprint churn as a tailwind, there's also some things to say about looking at the totality of our competitive environment across Verizon and AT&T. So, Matt why don't you pick up here? Matt Staneff : Yeah, I'll take that. Thanks Mike and John. So, it's interesting you asked about 2021 and I think what the important thing to do is go maybe take a year back and look at year ago. What's interesting a year ago in Q4, you had a competitive environment. You had one competitor taking a lot of nets, one competitor taking not that many nets and we fast forward a year in Q4 and you saw them flipped. But in totality, the amount of nets being produced in the competitive environment more or less the same. And so, to what Mike's been saying what we've been saying it's what we anticipated is a robust competitive environment that's evolving and changing with certain carriers taking more or less share and that's continuing to lead growth through that as we navigate the flexible model to really lead it. The other piece of the question when you look at where we've guided in '21, what the next phase of our integration is with Sprint is really churn. It's a churn story. We've yet to start to get to work. Have really doing what we did on the T-Mobile branded business, going from worst to first on churn with our Sprint business. That's in front of us. We've gotten something taken care with the brand transition, stores and sales and gross adds and we're starting to get into the space followed by the work on the network, delivering the entire value proposition in the Sprint base and so we see that as we start to move forward. It's not going to happen overnight. So, we're really going to get to work and I feel great about our recipe to deliver great churn into this front base. So that's where you're going to see some of that as well. Mike Sievert : It's really important to hear that message. I mean, people had said, what's going on? Isn't somebody moving? What about AT&T, aren't they producing more nets now and what you just heard from Matt is that some total of phone net adds from AT&T and Verizon was the same this past Q4 as the prior year. And so those two kinds of tend to go back and forth. And at any given quarter, there's just dynamics. AT&T is plowing a surprising amount of money, missed big on EBITDA into some short-term customer loyalty things if you want to call them that to be generous. Verizon on the other hand, they didn't spend this much, and therefore, they didn't have the same kind of nets. I don't know what they're doing. And they might have been - they might have blown all the money paying [indiscernible] to tell them they're having the 5G miss. Because it feels good for them. So, I don't know where that money went. But it wasn't being plowed to the same extent into net adds and so they beat on earnings but missed on net. So just goes back and forth. Doesn't change our game plan at all. Our game plan is to continue driving genuine loyalty as you see in our T-Mobile brand being the lowest churning brand in the industry and then reapply that same playbook on the Sprint customers. And that's just such an exciting tailwind for our business. Now before we move on, I know you asked a question about EBITDA from Peter. So, let's switch over to Peter as well. Peter Osvaldik : Yeah, thank you John. I'm not going to be able to guide to every one of those elements quantitatively but we did highlight a couple of them. Again, the $500 million of COVID related cost, vast majority of loans return to run rate of the business. And we talked a little bit about some incremental debt from the key premier connect the pledge in Q2 that was a very small component to lead so the vast majority of those target million are run rate cost in the business now. Now on American Tower, I think we talked about at least a couple hundred million drag from 2020 to 2021. But it's hard, it depends on how quickly and variability builds and what the priorities are there that could create some variability there. But that's how I think about, the least conceptually magnitude survives. And then you get into the other elements, the switching cost, the selling cost as well as the investments. And as Mike said that depends on what the environment looks like in front of us, and of course what we do every quarters, what we do best, best in the industry, we delivered profitable growth and meet or exceed our expectations that we put out therefore you and we adjust and that's what we're going to do here. But I can't breakout the individual components probably further than that for you, John. John Hodulik : Okay, thank you. Mike Sievert : Operator, let's go back to the phones, and then I'll ask my team here for one or two that if you feel like we need to hit, it will be widely appreciated to be heard by others on the call, I will go to Twitter as well. So, take a look at those and see if you want to see one of those. Janice, I'll sign that to you, if you want. Operator? Operator : Thank you, sir. Our next question comes from Jonathan Chaplin with New Street. Jonathan Chaplin : Thanks. One for Peter and one for Neville. For Peter, I'm wondering if you could characterize your approach to setting guidance and how it might be different from Braxton, since this is our first guidance under the Osvaldik regime and particularly interested in the net add guidance, which about double the average guidance that you guys have set for net adds for the last five years. And did you seem to beat that by sort of 50% to a 100%? And so, I'm looking at the net add guidance and thinking if this is a backstream guide, the real number could be something a little crazy. And then for Neville, are we still looking at 200 million pops covered by the end of the year with fast 5G on 2.5 gigahertz or it looks like things moved a little bit faster than expected in 4Q with CapEx deployment, could you exceed that? Thanks. Neville Ray : Let's start with Peter. Right. But yeah, well, let me start with that. Jonathan Chaplin : How does the Osvaldik regime operate, Peter? Peter Osvaldik : Well, let me tell you this, Jonathan. It actually isn't the first time you're hearing it. You heard me give guidance on Q3 as well and of Q2, actually second half guidance and then updated that in Q3. And look where we came in, all right, which is again, what our commitments always is, is to profitably outgrow the competition and deliver against what we put out there. But I love how you're asking me about 4.0 million to 4.7 million postpaid net add guidance next year and getting excited about it. Because what, if you look at 2020, that guy did midpoint is over twice what AT&T did in total postpaid and almost three times what Verizon did. So that's the guidance. That's the excitement here. There's a couple of factors to play out in front of us, as we said. One of those is what is that return to in the switching environment. We obviously are still impacted by COVID. And the question is, how fast does that come in? That will change the playbook for us as we said. You saw us deliver in Q3, saw us deliver in Q4, and that's our commitment in the future. But how we do it and how we go about it is in reaction to what's happening in the marketplace at the moment in time. So, look, be excited about the guide because it's an amazing guide from 4 to 4.7 on postpaid nets and similarly on adjusted EBITDA, as we talked about. Jonathan Chaplin : Peter, if I can just follow up on that quickly, if switching activity doesn't come back as you expect, can you still hit the guide? Peter Osvaldik : Yeah, look, Jonathan. Our commitment and you saw us do it in Q2, Q3 and Q4 is again to profitably outgrow the competition and deliver on what we put out there to you. So, that's probably the philosophy but you should think of when you think of myself and Mike and how this team operates. And you saw it executed on and probably the most challenged switching environment that you could have imagined in Q2, Q3, as well as Q4 of this year. And so, I can't predict the COVID future, I wish I could get it all rid of it for all of us so that we can get out there and start living. But I can't. But I can tell you we're going to adapt and we're going to deliver. And that's the commitment to have from us. Jonathan Chaplin : Thanks, Peter. That's great. Neville Ray : So, let me pick up Jonathan. Well, man, I love the question, great so and before we go to 200 million this year, just got to celebrate the 100 million that we secured in 2020. 100 million, 106 million people covered with Ultra Capacity mid-band 5G. And just to do the competitive comparison that you've helped us with, it's about 50 times, 50 times the Verizon high-capacity footprint, which is pretty stunning. It's almost embarrassing when you think about it. So, love your question, because even though we have a huge lead, you're asking, can we get even further in front of our competition, and do more than we've said, we'll do it in '21. Obviously, we're going to push on every target, Jonathan. But I'll tell you this, the most exciting thing for me in '20 and Mike referenced this in his comments is the fact that we build an incredible network machine in 2020. And we have to build and upgrade a lot more sites in '21 to get to that 200 million covered people with the Ultra Capacity. So, we have the machine, we have the resources, the supply chain, the commitments, and we have the processes. And so, this machine is moving at real pace, 200 million people covered, is with Ultra Capacity is going to be a huge lead against what our competition has talked about, or said they can do. So, we'll keep pushing on it. But I'm super excited to be able to sit here with high confidence, and talk about delivering a nationwide high capacity, high, high-capacity network in the coming 11 months on top of a coverage network, which just blows the competition away. Our extended range, 5G capability there, Mike mentioned this again, more coverage on 5G than AT&T and Verizon combined. You have to let that sink in a little bit to really understand the position that we're in. And on top of that coverage layer, now we can add and pile on this mid band asset. So, tremendously excited about the progress we made in 2020, but we're just getting started on this thing. So, it's going to be a really fun year in '21. Mike Sievert : I talked about this a little bit in my remarks. But I just want to underscore how remarkable it is the rate and pace that we're operating at right now. Because it's a real competitive differentiator. And this isn't something Neville and team are, they're doing something that's never been done before operating at this scale. It was many, many thousands of sites that had to be touched and upgraded with advanced 5G technology to get us to that a 106 million, let alone the 280 million people that are covered by extended range 5G. But that's now moving to tens of thousands of sites in 2021. Tens of thousands of macro sites with Ultra Capacity 5G. It's a massive undertaking. And we started it way back in 2018, planning and citing, permitting, design, in order to create a contiguous leading network. And it's not something that can be created overnight. And as I said, it's a real advantage, I think we're going to probably have an opportunity to talk a lot more about. So, terrific. Let's go back to the phones. Operator : Thank you. Our next phone question will come from Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson. Craig Moffett : Two questions, if I could. First Peter, I'm going to steal a little thunder probably from your Analyst Day. But as I think about longer term margins, there are some differences between your business and say Verizon's or AT&T's and that you tend to lease more backhaul rather than own it, you have lower industry - sorry lower retail prices. How do you think about the long-term margin potential of the business relative to your peers? And then, Mike, I wonder if you could just update us a bit on your progress in the areas where you have traditionally under indexed the business services market or business wireless market and then their rural markets? And where you've been growing? How can you give us some progress metrics, I guess, in those areas? Mike Sievert : Yeah, sounds good. And you're right, Craig, we're going to double click into both of those, as I said in my remarks next month. And I will give Peter a chance to respond if he wants to steal his own thunder from next month. But, as we've said for a long time, we see fantastic cash production from this model at the margin rates that we already communicated we aspire to. We don't have to achieve the margin rates that Verizon has. In fact, your question is premised on the idea that they'll be able to hang on to that and that, I don't know that that's the case either. I don't know where theirs is going. I know ours is going up. And the cash production that we're able to produce in this business model with the margin rates that we've aspired to are just phenomenal and so exciting, and create a very, very valuable enterprise. And, there are differences in our model, and one of them is the internal growth rate. And so, when you think about our faster growth and the investments in present periods to get there, there will be differences between how we pursue our business plan and theirs. And it shows that we're more bullish because we have better assets and therefore are willing to invest in a longer tail and a better terminal value. And that's going to be experienced in this five-year planning horizon as one of the big differences. But, Peter, why don't we go to you and then Matt, I'll turn to you on the how are we doing on things like prime and small-town rural businesses? So, Peter, anything to add? Peter Osvaldik : Well thanks, Mike. Yeah, and I don't want to steal all my own thunder from Analyst Day, because Craig, I want you to come and attend, so I can't do that right this moment. But I think everything that Matt and Mike talked about earlier, and what Mike just expressed now from margin perspective, is exactly that. If our plan doesn't predicate that we need to get through a Verizon level margin, and one could really question whether they will be able to maintain it when you have the combination of the premium product in the form of our network and the premium value, how they're going to be able to justify that with their customers? But that's not what we're here to do. We're here to continue to profitably outgrow, and yeah, there's some incremental costs in the short run that come with that, particularly on the sales side, as you accrue much higher terminal value for doing that. And then you did talk about some of those structural differences, which are absolutely key, and come out in CapEx versus OpEx as you see. So that's why it's so important and exciting to think about what the ultimate free cash flow generation of this business is, which really takes out some of those differentials and focuses on the cash productivity. So, really excited to highlight and update some of these figures for you next month. I'm looking forward to doing that. Craig Moffett : Thank you. Mike Sievert : And Matt small-town rural business? Matt Staneff : Yeah. Craig, that's a great question. As Mike said, we're going to dive deeper into an Analyst Day, but just a couple things, one is an overlooked part of our record results we had this year was success in business, in particular, in education and public sector. And one thing that you should know about our business, and we keep saying is we're nimble and we're flexible, and we show up and solve needs, when people have it. That's partly why we're able to do things through project in million, delivering solutions for kids to have to deal with the pandemic. And what's great about that, on the backside of it, is it opened up a lot of doors, but today, we're answering our call, in part because of the network perception, it's still lagging reality. But now that we're in the door proving how fast and nimble, we can help serve businesses in public sector, we have more and more culture rings. So, we're seeing great progress in this area. When you talk about rules on the heels that Neville build out on extended range 5G, I think that's one of the big things that's going to be a paradigm shifter this year is when you take the performance that we're seeing from the Ultra Capacity network and the speeds and the experience consumers have and bring it into rule and bring it to prime consumers. It's a game changer. And it's going to be another vector for us to continue to accelerate growth going forward as we move up market into prime customers who require the best of the best network. To-date, we have not had that we're going to get that very quickly on the heels of this build. So, we see a lot of upside going forward into these areas. Mike Sievert : And hopefully, roger that, if I can be a little bit around your question. Can you give us more insights on consumer versus business? Businesses, both are killing it. Our big opportunity and in consumer right now, we're - that's ahead of us is small town rural, whereas I said, in my prepared remarks, we have half our national market share. And this is a huge swath of the country. So big, big potential tailwinds there. And in business, we posted double-digit growth, which, look, I mean, everybody's got a smartphone already. So, when you've got a business that's posting double-digit growth, it's because you're winning share. And as I said, in my remarks, we're winning share not just as a price cut now, please throw us a little piece so you can reply to your AT&T deal. We're winning strategic accounts, the whole account. And that's, and we're winning it based on our quality. And that's just a game changer. So very excited about what the potential could hold there. Diana Gilbert's on Twitter asks, do customers really understand the value of 5G? Or is there confusion over it? And also, she asked separately, what are the some of the use cases coming? No, they don't really yet. And it's a great question. Right now, something I think if you look at the country, something like low-double-digits of consumers with super phones have switched to 5G already that means most people it's just a twinkle in their eye. And 2021 is the year when FOMO unfolds. And you've got people, that you know who've got an incredible phone that works 10 times faster than yours. And they're able to do things with it that you can't and you start to say I need me some of that. And you start to realize that when you get it from T-Mobile, it's for real. It doesn't just work on certain street corners or when the leaves aren't out or you have a suction cup device to put in your window or whatever. It works across 200 million people, which is the goal we've articulated for this year with our highest capacity variant Ultra Capacity 5G. But to your point, it's not just going to be about smartphones, and I'm not going to get into it today. I'm sorry, it's a great question but we see lots of potential. And this is analogous to when 4G started. And we didn't see everything that would unfold in 4G with the digital lifestyles, mobile first digital lifestyles that we now lead but similarly with 5G which is an even bigger, more discontinuous innovation. We're going to see hardware and software innovations that transform how we live our lives on the go. And the question will be, what kind of a network capability will those innovators develop to? And we're convinced that it has to be a capability more like ours, that's widely available than that's available in isolated spots. And so, that's a really exciting thing that I'll get into in a little more detail another time. But thanks for those questions. And let's go back to the operator. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Rollins with Citi. Michael Rollins : Thanks, and good afternoon. Two questions if I could. First, you mentioned the growth that's embedded in the guidance for 2021. But given all the moving pieces, in revenue, you had a wholesale business, you picked up a Sprint prepaid business that left you. You talked about the COVID cost. Can you help level set what the right comfortable on a full year proforma basis should be for like the key metrics like service revenue and core EBITDA just so we could better understand what kind of growth rates are within the 2021 guidance? And then secondly, you mentioned the improvement in the T-Mobile heritage churn. And, as you delved into that performance, I was curious if there are any specific factors that you think had maybe an outsized contribution whether it's certain networks tax for those customers, whether it's the bundling of content, or other Un-carrier initiatives that you employed over the last few years? Thanks. Mike Sievert : Yeah, I'll start with the second one, and then flip over to Peter, who will probably give you at least a qualitative if not quantitative answer. You know there's so many factors into this, but I don't know Matt, do you want to jump in? Matt Staneff : Yeah, Mike kind of hit it a little bit in the remarks. I mean, there's three things that really matter here. The value proposition you get, it's the network. And it's how about customer service works. And when you look at what we're delivering with this network, one thing that we also know, is perception lags reality. And what I can tell you our T-Mobile customers are seeing today is the reality of this network we have. And you see it, and how sticky they are in churn. We also announced these records on JD Power Awards. Seven in a row, 21 total, we're killing it in customer service. What Un-carrier move was that? Team of experts. It took us years to craft that and get it right. But you can just see what happens when it's right. And by the way, that's not yet at the Sprint base. We're working through that, that's in our plan to bring it forward. So those are some big dimensions that we look to that are structural, as we talked about, to really deliver this value proposition to our customers. Mike Sievert : Genuine customer loyalty takes time. Yeah. So proforma comparisons Peter, one of the things we said in our remarks is we're the only ones that posted genuine growth in service revenues and EBITDA. And we stand behind that, it gets a little gooey when you try and get to the math behind it, to try and unpack it for you, but it's significant growth. Peter, do you want to at least give a qualitative picture? Peter Osvaldik : Absolutely. Thanks, Mike. And thank you, Mike, for the question. If I would look at it, we do provide disclosures in the fact book that attempt to do a good proforma, particularly on adjusted EBITDA, and you can look at lease revenues there as well. So, look at that in the fact book. But I would say if you add all that up, and you can do that math from fact book, core EBITDA is about $22 billion for 2020. And remember, that includes having excluded the 500 plus million of COVID costs and the benefits from a lower switcher environment that we saw in 2020. So, that's one way to look at it. And then when you put it in that context, the guide is pretty exciting as I said, that shows the significant 2020 to 2021 core EBITDA growth, despite factoring in those things like the COVID costs, the non-cash straight line lease expense, as well as the projected higher switching costs that we would see being the industry share taker, as we hoped switching picks up over the course of the year with COVID. So, that's probably where I would point you to is on the fact book, but I can tell you, if you look at it, that way, you can see the growth, even despite the investments that we're making that'll set us up for the discussion that we'll have hopefully next month. Mike Sievert : And soon we have this problem, we'll about to start round tripping ourselves in this company which is exciting. Did you have one follow-up? Michael Rollins : Yeah, I was just saying thank you, for taking the questions. Mike Sievert : Okay. Thanks then. All right, let's go back to the phone. Operator? Operator : Absolutely, our next question will come from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Simon Flannery : Great, good evening. Peter, I just wanted to confirm the Shentel is not in your guidance and perhaps any color you could give on the transaction the synergy integration opportunities there? And then any updates on the 4G home broadband, how that's going, any subscriber numbers or adoption rates customer set scores, something to share on that? Peter Osvaldik : Yeah, well let me start. Absolutely on Shentel, we're certainly looking forward to taking the next steps here, finalizing the purchase agreement and getting through the close and starting to do the same network integration, customer integration as we have with Sprint, so we just see it as part of the bigger picture, very pleased that we're getting to that point. Shentel in our best estimates, is included in the guidance that we provided. Of course, you'll than see once we close some geography changes between wholesale service revenue up into our service revenue and customer geography changes which will be of course as we always are very transparent one when we close the transaction. But it is included in there, and very excited to take the next steps there and welcome those customers into the T-Mobile family. Mike Sievert : Peter you, and as I see you're out there. Do you want to comment on the transaction? Peter Osvaldik : Yeah, I just repeat what Peter said, look, we're excited to get past the appraisal phase and we're absolutely looking forward to moving on with concluding a purchase and sale agreement, filing all the appropriate regulatory papers, getting regulatory approval, and we looking for hopefully looking for close sometime in Q2. Mike Sievert : And Simon, quickly on home Internet, yeah, thanks for bringing that up. I mentioned a little bit in my remarks, we're really excited. We're in pilot phase right now. We quietly moved from LTE pilot to 5G pilot. That was an exciting milestone in this pilot. And part of what we're doing here is we're just taking our time and making sure that we put together the experience space that we need. And that means supply chain, it means customer experience, it means really being able to create a quality service. And so far, we really liking what we're seeing. So, as this network capacity starts to really hit its pace in 2021, we've got a big opportunity to get commercial and to really go out there and start attracting customers in bigger numbers. The results so far with customers we have attracted, we're delighted with and customers are too. So, that's going really, really well. This is a chance to bring real competition to this space. And our business plan relies on it, we've got a pretty significant set of aspirations in our multi-year outlook here. So, I'm excited to talk more about that, when the time is right. Now, it'll probably be more when we're ready to announce it as a true non-pilot commercial offering. But thanks for bringing that up. Very, very excited. Okay. Operator, let's go to the phone and it's now the top of the hour, and I think this will be our last question. We said we'd keep it to the hour. So last question, please. Operator : Thank you. That question will come from Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Brett Feldman : Hey, thanks for taking the question, two actually. So, on your postpaid net add guidance of 4 million to 4.7 million, I was hoping you can give us some thoughts around how you expect that to break out between phones and other devices? And one of the reasons I'm asking is, I'm wondering if there's any headwinds we should be anticipating? So, for example, because we might have to use a tablet net add because we did last year when there was an education surge that probably helped you out a bit. And then Mike as you said, the vast number of consumers probably don't appreciate 5G yet because they don't have it. So, my question is for Neville. Among the customers in your network who do have 5G and who access 5G, do you see evidence in their usage patterns that they actually do appreciate it, particularly when they're in the ultra-light band coverage? So, for example, are they streaming more or are they doing more 4K or are they actually using apps that maybe they don't typically use in the 4G network? Thank you. Mike Sievert : They do speed tests a lot. That we know. But let's talk about the guidance. Peter, why don't you talk about postpaid versus postpaid phones? And I have a feeling it's going to be kind of a non-answer, but let's give it our best shot. Peter Osvaldik : Well, thanks for that preview, Mike and Brett for questions embedded in there. One was 2020 to 2021 and you did see us absolutely dominate in that educational arena, the public and educational space and the delivery of 2020 was amazing. And so, as we flip into 2021, that probably won't be as big of an opportunity, as we saw in 2020. And that's embedded in that guidance as well. Now regarding the breakout of phones versus others, we're not providing that breakout, but what I will say is we have a commitment as we continue to highlight of being the industry postpaid phone leader from a growth perspective. So, think about it with respect to that, that's my - Mike my non-answer, answer. So, thank you for that. Mike Sievert : That's pretty good. All right. And Neville, you get the last word on 5G. Neville Ray : Super quick from me. So, Brett, yeah, we are seeing more usage on our 5G customers, and so the number is up probably early running 15% something like that, which is a great start. I'd say on top of Mike's comment, one thing that our customers do talk about when they are on our mid band 5G network, the Ultra Capacity network, they do talk about those speeds, and they're blown away, and they're excited. So, go look at our Twitter accounts and see how excited customers are by the speeds they're seeing. And we talked about speeds on that mid band layer getting to 300 megabits per second. They're pretty damn close to that now. And I'll just give you a quick shout out for Superbowl this weekend down in Tampa. We've got 80 megahertz of 5G on hundreds of mid band sites, a mix of 60 and 80 megahertz in speeds down there. And north of 500 megabits per second, on average, actually sometimes go north of 600. So yeah, folks are talking about it, they're excited about it, and usage is starting to climb. Mike Sievert : Just one additional point we're seeing is an emerging excitement, it's always been there. But perhaps even more coming to the floor around mobile gaming. We're just hearing so much about it. I think when I talk about innovators, hardware and software developers seeing this technology and seeing business models, I think gaming is a place to keep an eye on. Definitely you're seeing video consumption, especially high-def video consumption take-up, because that's not something thanks to Ben John years ago, our customers were really habituated around. So, you see that taking up. But keep your eye on mobile gaming, I think you're going to find that 5G with its low latencies and very high capacity is something that is definitely attracting developers, which means, it's going to attract consumers. So, I think that's the show. You guys, thank you so much for tuning in again. Hopefully you can sense our excitement this business is firing on all cylinders. We appreciate you and I don't normally get to say this, we'll see you next month. Thanks, everybody. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the T-Mobile U.S. fourth quarter 2020 earnings call. If you have any further questions, you may contact the Investor Relations or media departments. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect and have a pleasant day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon. Following opening remarks, the Earnings Call will be open for questions. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jud Henry, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations for T-Mobile U.S. Please go ahead, sir. Jud Henry : Welcome to the T-Mobile's first quarter 2021 earnings call. On our call today we have Mike Sievert, our President and CEO; Peter Osvaldik our CFO; as well as other members of the senior leadership team. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, which involve a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. We provide a comprehensive list of risks factors on our -- in our SEC filings, which I encourage you to review. Our earnings release, investor fact book and other documents related to our Q1 results as well as reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP results discussed on this call, can be found on the quarterly results section of the Investor Relations website. I would also like to note that historical results prior to the second quarter of 2020 represent the standalone T-Mobile prior to our merger with Sprint. With that, let me turn the call over to Mike. Mike Sievert : Thanks, Jud. Hi, everybody. Thanks for being here and May the 4th be with you all. I don't know if you can see us. If you're not watching, we're coming to you live from our T-Mobile Fight Night Octagon here at our T-Mobile headquarters. And I'll tell you it is great to be here in Bellevue with so many of our leadership team members, as we gradually and safely find the right ways to be together in person at work. And even better, we have another great quarter of results to talk about today. Results that show incredible work done by this team as we continue to push T-Mobile even further ahead of the competition, while doing what we do best, putting customers at the center of what we do. We are off to a terrific start in 2021. From accelerating our network leadership, which is fueling customer momentum to delivering merger synergies and expanding our addressable markets for growth. We have again demonstrated that our unique winning formula and balanced approach enables us to grow share while delivering strong financial results. In our increasingly connected world, we recognize our role as stewards of this profitable company and industry, while continuing to use our Un-carrier DNA to bring change to wireless and broadband alike, to disrupt the status quo and ultimately benefit customers. And this quarter was no exception. We achieved our three core ambitions. First, delivering industry-leading growth by expanding our addressable market and growing customer relationships. Second, delivering substantial enterprise value by realizing merger synergies faster and bigger and beginning to transform our business. And finally, positioning the company for long-term success with sustained 5G leadership, our strong and getting stronger brand and the best customer experiences. I'll start off with a few highlights. First, T-Mobile led the industry and net add growth yet again, building on our existing fame for superior value and customer service, while making big strides in network perception to fuel our momentum. And we did it while simultaneously delivering better-than-expected service revenues and core adjusted EBITDA. Second, we continued to further expand our 5G leadership to deliver America's largest, fastest and most reliable 5G network with multiple third-party experts now taking notice and network perception metrics on the rise. This is so great to see because it will translate into overall network leadership as we serve both businesses and consumers. And third, this unmatched 5G advantage is already unlocking new and underpenetrated segments of customers for T-Mobile. We're giving more consumers and businesses the opportunity to experience the best 5G, combined with the best value and delivered from the best team. Fourth, we've been busy this year executing on our growth plan with a number of Un-carrier moves and strategic initiatives. And finally, yes, it's another beat and raise quarter for T-Mobile. We beat expectations with continued customer growth, increased profitability and rapid unlocking of merger synergies, which enables us to raise guidance for 2021 just one quarter end of the year, something Verizon and AT&T were not confident enough to do despite all of their happy talk on their calls. All right. So let's talk about some of these in a little more detail. As I mentioned, we led the industry in total net adds in Q1. We delivered 1.2 million postpaid net adds, including 773,000, postpaid phone net adds, and our postpaid phone churn improved sequentially to 0.98%. We've mentioned before how our opportunity to improve the elevated churn from our Sprint base would be a tailwind for our business. And this is already starting to unfold, as we were the only wireless provider to improve churn sequentially as we execute the same worst-to-first playbook that has led us to the industry best churn rates for our T-Mobile branded customers. This quarter's results are particularly important and show that we continue to make great strides improving churn for both our T-Mobile and Sprint customers by providing them with best-in-class experiences, while others in the industry saw their churn rates flat to up from Q4. On prepaid, we delivered 151,000 net adds, which were the highest in three years and reflected record low industry-leading prepaid churn of just 2.78%. As I mentioned, perception is absolutely catching up to reality that T-Mobile is the clear 5G leader. With 5G quickly becoming one of the top things that customers say they're looking for in their next wireless provider, and we're extremely encouraged by our perception trends in the quarter. They showed that our network is increasingly becoming a catalyst for customers to choose T-Mobile. In fact, the percentage of customers who say T-Mobile is the 5G company has increased nearly 120% over the last just a year-and-a-half. And we saw an immediate uptick in customers switching to T-Mobile with the launch of Magenta MAX, which provides additional momentum for us to continue to outgrow this industry. As you've heard me say before, and I plan to keep reminding you, T-Mobile has the scale and the resources to do something that has truly never been done before, offer the best value and the best network, freeing customers across the country from having to compromise and providing them with our team's award-winning customer service experience on top which is our secret sauce. This opens the door to further penetrate prime consumers and businesses that require the highest quality network experience and compelling reasons for them to adopt more premium plans. Another differentiator is that only T-Mobile is operating with a synergy-backed model, which allows us to simultaneously grow customers and profits while also investing big in the business. And with the rapid expansion of free cash flows likely ahead for us, we are positioned to have great strength and flexibility from a balance sheet perspective. Okay, now let's talk about those merger synergies and our continued progress on integration for a moment. Last quarter, we shared our initial 2021 guidance to be more than double the $1.3 billion in synergies that we delivered in 2020. Today, we're already raising our synergy guidance for 2021. This progress includes continuing to migrate Sprint customers to the T-Mobile network to improve their experience, which is key to unlocking synergies. We've already moved 20% of Sprint customers to the T-Mobile network and have really hit our stride in the pace of our migration process. In addition, this is important, we're now carrying approximately 50% of the total Sprint customer traffic on the T-Mobile network when you include the seamless roaming that we provide those customers to improve their experience. This is twice as much as just last quarter. In Q1, we took another important step forward in our integration process as we transitioned many of the Sprint customers on to our go-forward rate plans. This migration is important for two reasons. First, it brings our Sprint customers closer to having the full Un-carrier experience by giving them the new value proposition with all of the associated T-Mobile benefits. And second, it sets us up for a seamless billing migration in the future. It's important to understand that separating the brand, network, rate plan and billing migrations into discrete events, which can be done at the convenience of the customer and our business plan, that's a unique and powerful feature of our integration approach and one that's already proving its value. As we shared with you on Analyst Day, we're executing our integration playbook to deliver the merger synergies bigger and faster than originally promised to ultimately provide run rate synergies of $7.5 billion, 25% higher than the original merger plan and over $70 billion on an NPV basis. This will enable us to invest in initiatives to maximize our long-term growth and cash flow generation, and to deliver truly innovative transformational experiences for customers for years to come. Those amazing experiences really begin with the network. T-Mobile is already America's largest, fastest and most reliable 5G network. The country has never seen anything like our network build. We're tracking ahead of schedule, and the results are clearly beginning to differentiate not just on 5G, but on network performance overall. With so much focus on 5G, it is worth noting that with this build, we have already quietly eliminated the legacy advantages that AT&T and Verizon previously enjoyed on LTE, which is where most traffic remains today. In fact, our LTE coverage and performance are essentially the same as AT&T and Verizon now across the country. And with that common foundation in mind, our demonstrably lead in 5G really becomes the differentiating factor in overall network performance. This is putting T-Mobile in the pole position to become the only provider with a network that can kick start this new era of connectivity by delivering our ultra capacity 5G to nearly everyone across the U.S. T-Mobile's extended range 5G now delivers coverage across 1.6 million square miles, reaching roughly 295 million people, offering roughly 33% more geographic coverage than the so-called nationwide 5G of AT&T and Verizon combined. About 1/3 more than the two of them combined. But with our rapid expansion of ultra capacity 5G that's our game changer. We're rolling it out at an unprecedented pace to deliver the truly transformational speeds and capabilities enabled by 2.5 gigahertz and above. We brought ultra capacity 5G to over 100 million people by the end of last year. And we've already expanded that to over 140 million people today. And we're well on our way to covering 200 million people nationwide by the end of 2021. That's this year. In the last month alone, multiple independent third parties including Ookla, OpenSignal and umlaut gave numerous accolades to T-Mobile's 5G network based on real customer usage from millions of device measurements. This shows that not only does T-Mobile have the fastest 5G, but -- and this is equally important as you know, T-Mobile delivers dependability where customers live work and travel and umlaut recognized T-Mobile's 5G as the most reliable and the most available. The bottom line is this, we're really starting to pull away from the pack like we told you we would. Last week OpenSignal released their latest report also showing that T-Mobile customers average 5G download speed increased by 23% just since the beginning of the year, while speeds on other networks stayed virtually unchanged. Widening the gap to competitors as T-Mobile now has nearly 50% faster speeds than Verizon and 30% faster speeds than AT&T. This increase is all about our rollout of superfast ultra capacity 5G. And as I said earlier, consumers and businesses are taking notice, as perception is finally starting to catch up with reality. For consumers that is reflected in positive early trends around our Magenta MAX plan, giving customers the industry's only truly unlimited plan, putting the full capabilities of our ultra capacity 5G in the palm of their hand. The early indicators that we see from Magenta MAX customers underscore that the most discerning customers increasingly consider T-Mobile when we offer the right plan that really showcases our 5G network and Magenta MAX customers are taking full advantage of that differentiated 5G network, with usage levels 40% higher than other 5G customers, and a whopping 70% higher than our LTE average usage with more video, music and social media engagement on their smartphones. Okay, listen, I know I've said a lot about our 5G leadership. And the truth is I'm not here to convince you that we're well ahead. I think you know that. What will become increasingly clear is that contrary to what you may be hearing from our competitors, T-Mobile is positioned to maintain our 5G leadership for the duration of the 5G era. Thanks to our superior spectrum portfolio, our unprecedented deployment momentum, and our synergy backed model. And second, that this will matter greatly to the choices that consumers and organizations make. We have the best portfolio of spectrum and the most mid band spectrum, both today and into the future with our recent C-band purchase, and we're using the latest technologies like massive MIMO and uplink carrier aggregation to unlock the full potential of ultra capacity 5G. The result will be amazing customer experiences that drive brand choices. At our March Analyst Day, we spent some time unpacking the different growth opportunities we see to expand our addressable markets through new or under penetrated segments, but we aren't wasting any time as you may have noticed from all of the activity we've announced so far this year. With the rapid deployment of our high capacity 5G network, we commercially launched our 5G home internet offering to more than 30 million households at the beginning of this quarter. Meanwhile, others in the industry are still in the planning phases of what wireless home broadband could look like, in the future. For businesses, we saw one of our best ever quarters for phone net adds in Q1. And more importantly, we see increased engagement around how these 5G capabilities available only from T-Mobile in a meaningful way can really benefit their companies. We're bringing the Un-carrier to the business space and breaking down antiquated constructs just like we did for consumers by increasing our specialized sales force and building tailored products for large enterprises and government customers. This includes our recent WFX launch, an innovative suite of products that are ideally suited to help companies adapt to the hybrid workspace of the future with fully featured secured calling and broadband products, and peace of mind of having unlimited data for those customers who've been handcuffed by the pooled data plans from the other carriers. I mean, at a certain level, can you believe that? I mean, we dragged this industry kicking and screaming into the unlimited era for consumers. And yet the carriers are still selling, pooled, shared and limited data to enterprise customers. All that is about to change because of T-Mobile. We've long said that smaller markets and rural areas which make up 40% of U.S households are a major upside for our business. And we've made major progress there as well as a result of all of our focus. But now we're kicking it all into a higher gear. This quarter, we kicked off plans to add significantly more points of distribution to reach beyond our urban areas, including our innovative new hometown experts distribution model. This will create 7,500 new jobs in small towns and rural communities over the next few years, many of them beginning to be filled this year. And we announced that we're building on our decade long relationship with Google to give customers a broad range of premium pixel devices, a great messaging experience on Android, which is so needed, and the evolution of our TVision initiative to offer YouTube TV as our premium cable alternative product on our TVision platform. So as I get ready to turn it over to Peter to comment on our financials, I do want to just take a moment to thank our team for delivering just a remarkable quarter, while operating in the pandemic and weathering so much uncertainty. We continued to overcome these challenges and delivered the highest total customer growth in the industry, while simultaneously delivering strong service revenue, core adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow growth. We continue to execute our unique integration approach to unlock merger synergies. And we continued to offer the nation's largest, fastest and most reliable 5G network as backed by multiple third parties. And the thing is customers are just starting to notice. With positive momentum on our network perception and many initiatives we have launched across multiple customer segments, we are well-positioned to continue profitably growing over time, and to deliver on our mission to be the best in the world at connecting customers to their world. Okay, now, let me turn it over to Peter to comment on our financials and our guidance. Take it away, Peter. Peter Osvaldik : Awesome. Thanks, Mike. As you can tell, this team is firing on all cylinders. We kicked off 2021 with strong Q1 results and good momentum across the business as we look at our expectations for the full year. We executed on our winning playbook and beat expectations yet again in Q1. So let's briefly touch on these great results. Service revenues grew to $14.2 billion, driven primarily by our continued customer growth. Cost of services of $3.4 billion reflects the continued volume of site upgrades to support the rapid deployment of our 5G network with lower merger related costs than last quarter as the timing of these costs will vary each quarter. SG&A expenses were $4.8 billion as we advance our integration efforts and included benefits from increased synergy realization. Net income of $933 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.74 were both better than consensus expectations, and included merger related costs of $220 million or $0.18 per share on an after-tax basis. Our Q1 effective tax rate amounted to 20.9%, which reflects Q1 rate benefits from stock-based compensation. Core adjusted EBITDA was $5.9 billion, driven by continued service revenue growth and synergy realization. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $3.7 billion, while cash purchases of property and equipment, including capitalized interest amounted to $3.2 billion as we continue to aggressively invest in the build out of our nationwide 5G network. Free cash flow amounted to $1.3 billion, which was fully burdened by merger related costs of $277 million and increased over Q4 driven by our strong operating performance. Postpaid ARPA, or average revenue per account was $133.91 and our postpaid account net additions were nearly double what we saw in Q4. Meanwhile, postpaid phone ARPU was 4,730 in line with our guidance of a roughly 1% sequential decline as a result of lower Sprint customer ARPU arising from rate plan migrations, growing lines per account, and lower late and reconnect fees with improving customer payments activity. With the great momentum in the business, we now expect Q1 to be the low watermark for ARPU this year. And for ARPU to be above Q1 levels for the remainder of 2021 and be within less than a 1% dilution compared to 2020 on a full year basis. Taking a look at our financing activity. In January, we issued 3 billion of senior notes that set record low yields for 5-year, 8-year and 10-year tranches in the high yield market, including issuing 10-year unsecured notes below 3%. Then in March, we issued 3.8 billion of senior notes at an average interest rate of 3.18%, which also allowed us to redeem 2 billion of our 6.5% senior notes, continuing our opportunistic approach to drive down our cost of debt. Also in Q1, we paid $8.9 billion related to our C-band spectrum purchases funded by cash on hand from some pre-funding we had done in Q4 and a portion from our financing in Q1. This excludes our estimated C-band relocation expenses of $1.2 billion, which will be paid over time through 2024. Okay, let's talk about how this momentum impacts our outlook for 2021 with another beat and raised quarter from T-Mobile. Our guidance reflects the OpEx investments ahead of us in the network and growth initiatives that Mike discussed, while simultaneously delivering on our promise of continued profitable growth. We now expect total postpaid net additions to be between 4.4 million and 4.9 million, up from our original guidance of 4 million and 4.7 million, reflecting our continued focus on profitable growth, building on our current momentum, and the share taking opportunities anticipated in the second half of the year, with an increasing switching environment. Core adjusted EBITDA is now expected to be between $22.8 billion and $23.2 billion, an increase from our original guidance range of $22.6 billion to $23.1 billion, primarily driven by higher merger synergies, along with customer and ARPU growth. This assumes a continued reduction in leasing revenues now expected to be between $3.7 billion and $3.9 billion for the year versus original expectations between $3.8 billion and $4.0 billion, driven by a faster transition off leases and fewer device step ups on older lease promotions. Merger related costs not Included in core adjusted EBITDA are now expected to be between $2.7 billion and $3.0 billion before taxes, primarily driven by network activities compared to original expectations of between $2.5 billion and $3.0 billion before taxes. These costs will continue to be lumpy quarter-to-quarter, as you saw in Q1 relative to Q4. And we expect a significant sequential increase in Q2 and again in Q3. Net cash provided by operating activities, including payments for merger related costs is now expected to be in the range of $13.2 billion to $13.6 billion, up from our original guidance of $13.0 billion to $13.5 billion. We expect cash purchases of property and equipment including capitalized interest to be at the high-end of the original guidance range of $11.7 billion to $12.0 billion as we continued robust pace of our 5G deployment and network integration, while also realizing procurement savings from our increased scale, enabling our investment dollars to go further. Together, this results in expected free cash flow, including payments for merger related costs to be in the range of $5.1 billion to $5.5 billion, higher than prior guidance of $4.9 billion to $5.4 billion, reflecting growth in the strong cash flow generation capabilities of this business, and does not assume any material proceeds from securitization. We continue to expect full year effective tax rate to be between 24% and 26%. And lastly, we expect higher merger synergies in 2021 of between $2.8 billion and $3.1 billion, compared to our original expectations of between $2.7 billion and $3.0 billion driven by strong execution of our merger integration. All together, our momentum and execution gives us confidence in 2021, while continuing to invest in our network and the business to unlock the significant expansion and future free cash flow. We're excited about the mid and long-term guidance that we shared with you at our Analyst Day with massive free cash flow generation and free cash flow margins on service revenue better than our peers. We're on track with our plans to unlock significant value for shareholders, including substantial potential share repurchases ahead. All right, enough for me, let's get to your questions. You can ask questions via phone or via Twitter. We will start with a question on the phone. Operator, first question please. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question come from John Hodulik with UBS. Mike Sievert : Hi, John. John Hodulik : Great. Hey, how are you guys doing? Mike Sievert : Great. John Hodulik : Great. Couple questions. First, industry phone adds were pretty much off the charts this quarter. Any sense on what's driving that? I mean, is -- are the stimulus checks people are getting, you think adding to the growth that we've seen? And then I thought the commentary on the -- on ARPU going forward was interesting. I mean, you didn't give a percentage about what -- how many Sprint customers have been migrated over to T-Mobile plans. But I guess, are you guys saying that you guys are far enough through that process that you expect dilution from that to lessen as we go forward? And then just sort of any commentary on trends beyond that would be great. Thanks. Mike Sievert : Okay. I'll start with the industry trends on nets, and maybe see if Jon Freier wants to add anything. And then Peter, I'll let you address the ARPU question. Some great news in there. Your question, John, kind of got to the answer in a certain way. We saw a lot of industry activity in Q1, particularly in the second half of the quarter that we think was driven economically by there being a lot of money in the economy, stimulus, tax refunds, et cetera. And our competitors think they suddenly got competitive in the second half of the quarter, and they were talking about their sudden momentum, I think they lost sight of that larger picture that there was probably a macroeconomic circumstance that was driving it. And we're really comfortable with that type of an environment when there's cash in the system and less -- environments of less switching and less going on, as you've seen over the past year and our strong performance, we've got a model that's very flexible. But that's at least -- was our read on it. And it's certainly continuing. Q1 is off to a strong start across the board. You heard some of that from our competitors as well. As it relates to looking forward, I'm very confident that we are, in many respects, a return to work company. Remember, we've talked all along that our model is one that relies on switching. And we believe switching will, in the macro sense through the year, will gain momentum. And it doesn't have to be every week and every month, but take it this way. The second half generally, we think will generate more production for us than the first half, just generally, because we'll see more switching and T-Mobile is always a beneficiary of switching. And that's about the economy getting back after it, people getting back into stores. And as we've all seen, that's starting to happen now. But we think more in the second half than the first half. As it relates to competitiveness of the brands and the offers and how we think it's looking out there, I'll turn to Jon, and then I'll turn to Peter on the ARPU question. Jon Freier : Yes, you bet. Thank you, Mike. Yes, we just continue to be very pleased with our position in the marketplace today. And like Mike said, the first part of the quarter was an interesting part of the quarter because we were coming out of Q4, when you look at the pandemic, the number of cases, hospitalizations, et cetera, et cetera. And then with the tax refund and stimulus money coming into the marketplace, we saw a really good uptick. But one of the big things that we saw too, is that we launched our Magenta MAX plan at the end of February. And what we saw with those two things was, one, really kind of an uptick in terms of the attractiveness of that particular rate plan in terms of people taking that rate plan. But also something that was really a great benefit in terms of people that really value an incredible network experience and value the very best rate plan that they can have in the market. We saw more people switching to T-Mobile during that particular time. So we love our position, we're incredibly confident, like Mike said. We expect to see the second half continue to accelerate and continue to improve. What you're seeing in the pandemic is really kind of a tale of two tales. One, there's some places that have kind of reopened, some other places like Texas and Florida, but there's other huge states like New York and California that are still in the process of reopening. And, of course, as you continue to see that, you will see the switching pool continue to expand. And when that happens, we're always a share taker. We love our position when the competition is at the highest. And Peter, I will turn to you. Mike Sievert : Well said. So, Peter, the question -- second part of the question was about your remarks. You mentioned that Q1 would be the low watermark for ARPU for the year and we see rising trends through the balance of the year. Why is that? Peter Osvaldik : Yes, a couple things. And I think you had a question on the Sprint base. And it's the majority of Sprint customers that we migrated. And this again, was part of the plan there and as we highlighted in Analyst Day. But there's another element here that's so exciting and Jon just talked about it a little bit. And that is Magenta MAX, which really does two things. One, it demonstrates the power and the capabilities of this 5G network. Mike talked about the usage profile of these customers. And frankly, the take rate has just been amazing, right, great momentum coming off of Magenta MAX. And it does a second thing. It shows you, as Jon mentioned, that there are premium customers that are attracted to this premium network as the perception continues to improve and understanding in the consumer base continues to evolve around just what it is that Neville and team are building. So those are the things that really allow us to get optimism around ARPU for the remainder of the year. And not only ARPU, but remember that the plan here and the growth strategy to unlock all this massive free cash flow is predicated on ARPA growth. And we're equally as excited about ARPA, which we expect to grow during the course of the year as well. John Hodulik : Great. Thanks, guys. Mike Sievert : Thanks, John. Operator : Thank you. Our next question come from Jonathan Chaplin with New Street Research. Jonathan Chaplin : Thanks, guys. Two, if I may. Starting off with Peter, you've got growing customers, growing ARPU and growing synergies during the year. If I just take this quarter's EBITDA and annualize it, I get the $24 billion, which is above your guidance. Why wouldn't we be looking at at least $24 billion in EBITDA? What are some of the pressures in cost guide that would offset that tremendous story on top line growth and synergy capture that we might not be thinking about? And then maybe for Jon, on -- it looks like the lines per account went up a lot this quarter. You grew lines a lot faster than you grew account. I'm wondering if you can give us a little bit of color on what's going on at the account level versus the lines per account level that drove the difference in the trend there. Thanks. Mike Sievert : Sounds good. Peter, you want to start? Peter Osvaldik : Yes. Let me start. Great questions. So let me start with EBITDA. And I guess it's the story of what have you done for me lately. But remember, at year-end, we definitely talked about all of the initiatives and the investments that we'll be making this year to unlock what we shared with you at Analyst Day. That massive expansion both of core EBITDA, but of free cash flow. And that really begins in Q2. You saw a lot of the initiatives that we put out there, WFX, what we're going to do from a T-Mobile for business investment, smaller town and rural hometown experts to distribution expansion in those areas. Those are investments that are really beginning in Q2. So that's an element of what I would think about from Q1 that doesn't continue into Q2, right, as you're trying to create the run rate because we're making those investments. But I'll tell you, what. From a year, where we're thinking about the investments that lead to the free cash flow targets that we shared with you at Analyst Day, I'll take it, right? It's significant year-over-year growth on a pro forma basis, even before you consider the fact that last year had significant COVID costs that were out of core EBITDA that have become part of the run rate of the business. So I couldn't be more excited about the trajectory, the continued profitable growth in Q1, already being able to meaningfully increase guidance for you. And all the while making those significant investments for the unlock of that promised free cash flow. Mike Sievert : Now, I don't know, Jonathan, if you're watching on video, but you can literally see a twinkle in Peter's eye when he talks about the cash flow potential of this business over the next few years. He literally perks up when he talks about that part. And that's all net of an investment year. And it's very interesting your point, Peter, that this is an investment year to get to that cash flow future. And yet, in this investment year, everything is pointing up in terms of the raised guidance that we've delivered across the board or communicated across the board today. So that's a good place to be. Jon, second question from Jonathan was about lines per account, and also what's going on with accounts? Jon Freier : Yes. So two things here. As everybody knows, we really drive our postpaid phone net adds from two ways. One, from the new accounts that we create from switching from our competitors, and two, deepening our existing customer relationships that we have today. So we saw both of those things in action in a very big way in Q1. First of all, our number of new accounts doubled from Q4, which is just fantastic news and shows you the momentum that's happening in terms of the switching to T-Mobile. And then, two, we had an opportunity to really deepen relationships as well with our existing customer base. One of the things to just to remember is that traditionally our Sprint branded customers, they typically have the lowest number of lines on a per account basis. So we have more opportunity to really deepen our relationships and grow there as well. So we've had a lot of interactions with our existing customers, allowing us to really grow the accounts. And then of course, typically what you see in the tax refund and kind of a stimulus event is a lot of people that are looking to grow their relationship with us. So, we love our approach on both of those and we want to continue to take that forward into Q2 and beyond. Mike Sievert : And, Jonathan, I don't know if your question was getting at this, might be because our competitors are constantly filling everybody's ears about this, which is and what part of that is free lines? Is there free -- other free lines going on? And the answer is, yes, of course, always has been. And it's a small percentage of our total gross activations, though. And I love the fact that our competitors have decided to focus on this because if they think this is what's driving our success, God bless them. I hope that's what they actually think versus just what they're trying to position with you. But what Jon said is actual paying accounts, total account relationships were up and up big this quarter, 260,000 net new postpaid accounts. And in those accounts, what we saw is customers deepening their relationships with us. And one of the things we've always found at T-Mobile is that when we can give customers something they really value and we can grandfather them on that thing they really value. It's fantastic for churn. And as you know, we were the only sequential gainer in churn this quarter with a decreased churn versus prior quarter and again, the very best churn in the industry on the T-Mobile brands. So churn is a tailwind. And this is one of our tools, giving them something that they value, that they know if they leave, they're going to have to give up. And it's been a part of our game plan for a while. So anyway, I don't know if you were getting at that, but you gave me a chance to talk about it anyway. Jonathan Chaplin : That's great. I think you just probably got a twinkle in his eye about the $23 billion high-end of EBITDA guidance as well \u2026 Mike Sievert : Yes. Because Jonathan Chaplin : \u2026 but we can [technical difficulty] more in future quarters. Thanks, Peter. Mike Sievert : You already know him so well. That's great. Terrific. Operator, you want to take the next one, please. Operator : Absolutely. Our next question comes from Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson. Mike Sievert : Hi, Craig. Craig Moffett : Hi, thank you. Two questions, if I could. First, as long as we're on the subject of what your competitors fill people's ears with, they've talked a lot about their porting ratios being positive against T-Mobile. I wonder if you could just talk about what you see, in terms of porting ratios and the competition versus each of Verizon and AT&T. And then, I wonder if separately if maybe we could hear from Mike a little bit about the pipeline for commercial accounts. And I thought that blog post from a couple of days ago was exciting. I'd love to hear more about kind of the sales process and what -- how long the typical sales cycle is to land some of those large accounts, and what the pipeline looks like at this point. Mike Sievert : Yes, great. Great, great questions. I'll start on the first one. Both of our major competitors are porting very negatively to our flagship T-Mobile brand. And what they get in their telemetry is the combination and so they can't -- they either won't tell you that or don't know. But they're porting very negatively to T-Mobile. And overall now if you look at the overall account growth, as I said, we're growing. Overall, accounts are growing. 260,000 net new account relationships growth this quarter from last quarter. That's across all of our brands, T-Mobile and Sprint combined. And so what that means is that porting at least as it relates to the combination is a bit of a weird artifact, and that's why we haven't been focusing on it recently. And they can't really get a good read on it either because of the data that they're getting. So you got to look at overall growth. And that's how we look at it and we're very pleased. I mean, it's the overall momentum for our business with declining churn is something that we've told you would become a tailwind. And this artifact will start to resolve itself as churn on Sprint dissipates, and that's fantastic. If we can lead the industry and postpaid nets while dragging around this level of Sprint churn, well that's a fantastic tailwind for our business. So I hope they enjoy this moment where they can at least look at one artifact and probably fueled by promotions that actually especially incentive port -- incentivize ports on their own end, because it's going to be short lived. If that makes sense. Absolutely. And, Mike, the second part, what are we seeing on the account? Craig Moffett : Commercial. Mike Sievert : Yes. Michael Katz : Yes. Hey, Phil (sic) [Craig]. Great question. I think one of the things that you probably know is, in this space when you're talking about businesses and government agencies, sales and activations tend to be a little bit of a lagging indicator because the sales cycles are long, particularly when you're talking about big, complex, multinational enterprise and large government agencies. So, Mike, at the top mentioned that we had one of the best quarters that we've seen today in T-Mobile for business phone nets. And that really -- that success this quarter really is accumulation of successes from many previous quarters as this team has leveraged this network advantage that's been building, which really started as we got to parity in the 4G area allowed us to really engage with enterprises in a way that we hadn't build those funnels up and start accruing successes like we did in Q1. And what's happened over the course of this last year is we've been able to take now a differentiated network asset, which by the way, network is the key variable that the companies that we're dealing with make their wireless decisions on and really start stacking that funnel with new opportunities. New opportunities that include both companies that we haven't engaged with before and existing companies that we're able to go a lot deeper with. So when I look at our business today, coming off a great Q1, and I look at the funnel, the funnel is in the best place that it's ever been both in the public and private sector and it really gives me confidence of sustained success throughout the year as well as setting us up for success over the next couple of years. Operator : And our next question comes from Phil Cusick with JP Morgan. Mike Sievert : Hi, Phil, and thanks for your questions. Sorry, we didn't get to close out with you. Hey, Phil, what's going on? Philip Cusick : I guess following up on my previous question, can you quantify at all what that business phone nets are? And then second, any kind of early read on the home broadband uptake in the first couple of months? Thank you. Mike Sievert : Mike, you want to take the first one? The short answer is not going to be not really, but \u2026 Michael Katz : Not really, but I will say up significantly both on a sequential and a year-over-year basis. And I would say generally better than what you've seen from competitors. Mike Sievert : And how's broadband going, Dow? Dow Draper : Yes, thanks for the question. And I'd say we\u2019re 3 -- a little over 3 weeks in post our launch on broadband. And I would say we're as excited as we've ever been about this business after launch. And really what I'd say is after launch, we've seen two things that are very consistent with what we saw when we were piloting. And one is that we have -- but just on a bigger scale, we have customers who are coming to us. In fact, I was talking to a colleague yesterday, who said a customer approached him and said, I had no idea I could get those speeds in our neighborhood. And it's such a great feeling, we're seeing that more and more, especially when you think about our presence in rural and suburban and even many parts of urban America where they just don't have -- people just don't have great choices. They might have one choice, they may have -- might not even have any choice. And the other thing we're seeing too, and I think that was even representative of this example I gave you is we continue to attract customers that don't have a wireless relationship with T-Mobile. And so these are customers with one of our competitors for the wireless service, but they're taking our home internet service. And so as we start to what we love about this business too is that it gives us a ability to establish a relationship with someone who isn't a customer, they get to understand and know our business real well, that gives us a great opportunity to continue to upsell. And I think Mike's even seeing the same thing as he's talking to enterprise customers with this as well. So again, we're just getting started and we're as excited about this business as we ever have been. Philip Cusick : I\u2019m getting a lot of questions about how you pitch this to customers. What kind of speeds do you tell customers to expect on sort of a minimum versus average basis? Dow Draper : Yes. So what we tell customers is and the service we offer is, it's -- on average, customers are going to get speeds over 100 megabits per second. And I think what is great about this too is that we are in many places with those kind of speeds that our competitors, like haven't even gone to yet. And so when you combine that with what we offer, which is really a great reliable service for a great price, no promotions, no exploding promotions, no fees, taxes included, all the things that the Un-carrier does backed by our great customer service, it's a -- we find it's a really compelling proposition for people. Mike Sievert : I mean, Phil, it sounds like you're shopping, you can go to our easy tool online and see if you're one of the 30 million households that now qualify. Dow Draper : Just call me, I'll get someone to call you. Take care of you. Philip Cusick : Right guys. Mike Sievert : Thanks man. Operator? Operator : And moving on to Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Simon Flannery : Great. A couple of questions for Neville, if I could. You disclosed you've taken the network with the mid band up to 140 million pops and now you're up to 325 megabits per second average speed. Perhaps just help us think about how that's going to go through the balance of the year. And maybe if you've got any early data on how many phones are on 5G, what the usage is? And then, that some of the peers have been talking about supply chain, which seems to be getting mixed messages. Any color on that? And perhaps just lastly, Mike on the CDMA network, how you're thinking about the shutdown there at this point? Mike Sievert : Terrific, Simon. Great questions. Neville, you want to start? Neville Ray : Yes. Thanks, Simon. Obviously, we are just delighted with the progress that we're making. We have a ton of network momentum. And if you look at the stats, it's almost embarrassing when you look at some of the competitive stats that are out there, especially when you look at high performing ultra capacity, 5G services that 140 million, I mean, goodness, we're almost at half the people in the U.S covered already. And our competition has not even gone out of the gate. But we're not slowing down, Simon. We're not sitting on our hands -- the pace that we've secured, we intend to maintain and accelerate as we go through the balance of this year and into next. Nationwide goal is right there for us for 2021 to reach 200 million people and speeds will continue to improve. Another dimension to think about on our rollout is not just the scale and geographic mass of that, but also the spectrum assets. And by the end of this year, we'll be committing 100 megahertz on 2.5 to that 5G service and ultra capacity 5G. And think about that, that's as much as AT&T and Verizon picked up in the C-band auction, and their mid band asset portfolio through the end of 2023. So that's just for this year. So we've always talked about speeds hitting 400 megabits per second, plus on average, and that's a target clearly in our sights. And one we would hope to get to by the end of this year. '21 is going to be fabulous. '22 is going to be even better. We're not stopping at nationwide, and we're certainly going to try and increase the gap that we have against Verizon and AT&T now. On supply chain from a network perspective, Simon, maybe this is the advantage that we have, because we started our program so much earlier. And we put massive commitments, multibillion dollar commitments into the market with our key vendors in Ericsson and Nokia. So we're accelerating the pace of deployment. We're deploying more radio gear than we ever have at a pace that's much, much faster than we've seen in our past. And our supply chain deep into the supply chain is very strong at this point in time on the network side. No issues for us there at all. Mike Sievert : And that's true on the smartphone side, too. We're seeing no supply issues and we're forecasting no supply issues on either network gear or smartphones. I think that's important for everybody to understand. And it kind of dovetails into your last question. As it relates to our CDMA sunset and upgrade of those customers, it's going really well. We're on track to do that on time as we've been communicating at the end of this year, beginning of next year. And a big piece we have to do is we have to migrate all the Sprint customers in order to get there and that's going really well as well. Last month, you saw in our 5G For All initiative, we announced a really awesome unprecedented offer, which is every single Metro and T-Mobile customer can bring any phone, I mean any old phone in to a T-Mobile store and upgrade to a 5G phone for free, totally free. And we're making the following commitment to Sprint customers which is every single customer will be transitioned to a compatible device, or have the opportunity to transition to a compatible device before this upgrade happens at the end of the year. And not one single customer will be asked to pay a penny more for a full 5G, 4G rate plan that's compatible with the future. And it's so important that we do this because the digital divide we've seen over the past year and a half is widening. And people who don't have access to the latest technology are at risk of falling behind. So we're full steam ahead on this transition. And we're going to make sure our responsibility is as it relates to our branded customers. And we're going to make sure that every single one of them has the opportunity to be ready for the benefits of this upgrade. And not one single customer will be asked to pay a penny more for their rate plan. So full steam ahead and on track. Simon Flannery : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Mike Sievert : Hi, Brett. Brett Feldman : Thanks for taking the questions. Hey, guys. So when we go back to some of those key underpenetrated opportunities talked about, whether it's in the business market or in the rural markets, I mean, really, you're underpenetrated from an account standpoint, you just would have a lower share of accounts in those markets, when I assume you and others, which is why you have a lower share of subscribers. And since the question is, as you gain traction against growing your account penetration in those markets, would it be reasonable to think that your account growth might actually pick up a bit relative to your net adds, because they would be increasingly net adds associated with new accounts as opposed to penetration of old accounts. And I asked that because it would seem like that could be a tailwind for your ARPU as net adds that are associated with new accounts that you believe tend to come in at a higher ARPU. So I'm first, I\u2019m just checking to see whether there's logic to that if there's an offset, we should be thinking through. And then just going back to some of the usage statistics, particularly on the Magenta MAX plan, I'm curious if you're seeing evidence that people were actually using your T-Mobile, mobile devices replacing for their landline when they when they go up to MAX. And I'm just interested in any other insight you might have about what are the use cases that people are using so much more data on their phone as well? Thank you. Mike Sievert : Love it. I'll start with the first one on MAX and use cases, and then we'll flip to -- it sounds like it was business and consumer. I know, Peter, if you have an opinion about account growth and as it relates to ARPU. We are so excited about Magenta MAX. And one of the things that I was just commenting on was how important it has become to get people connected with contemporary connections in this pandemic, that's become so clear that if you're not fully connected with the best and latest technologies, you're at risk of falling behind. Not just falling behind digitally, but falling behind economically. And Magenta MAX is a differentiated offer because it's on a differentiated network. And it's really a showcase that use cases for 5G are already here. We don't have to wait around for the next couple of years for people to invent use cases. They're doing that. And it's exciting, separate topic. But they're here today. And people when you give somebody a true unlimited plan on a 5G phone that's screaming fast on the biggest and best 5G network in this country, they use it. And it's a truth that's been around since the beginning of the internet in the mid 1990s, when it became popular with consumers, which is we've never been able to outrun the insatiable demand that customers have on the most popular platforms for data. And so when you provide the industry's only true unlimited plan, they do what they do. They use it up in this case with video, a full high def video and smart usage of all the social media platforms and music and other things. And they're also using it for work. And I think what happens is a light bulb goes off, when you provide somebody with true unlimited on a 5G network that's faster than an average Wi-Fi connection, they stop roaming around the world looking for Wi-Fi hotspots. I mean, when I -- we were all about to start travelling, again, to a certain extent, I don't go into a hotel or a conference room and start hunting around for a password for Wi-Fi. I've got a more powerful connection than that already in my pocket. And that's the kind of mentality that Magenta MAX unlocks. It's a real differentiated offer. And by the way, it's only the beginning. Okay. And you were going to talk about accounts and ARPU. So who wants to start on that one? Peter Osvaldik : Why don't I start and then, Jon, you can add on as well Mike Katz. But, yes, it's an interesting perspective. And it really is going to depend, I think on the mix of each quarter. You talk -- you heard Mike Katz talk about the success of TFP, right? And particularly as you go into the underpenetrated large enterprise market, you could see -- it could be one account, but have many lines associated with a little bit different dynamic than consumer. I think, as you see, some of the penetration happened in smaller town or rural, yes, absolutely that could happen. But don't forget, we're always going to continue to invest in our existing subscriber base, and particularly as we continue on this journey of worst-to-first in the Sprint churn as well. So it's going to be a mixture. But, yes, there's definitely correctness in that thesis, particularly in smaller town and rural. I don\u2019t know, Jon, or Mike, if you have anything to add to that. Jon Freier : Yes. I mean, I think you hit it Peter. When you're thinking about large enterprise, both have the dynamics of a single enterprise having really large scaled wireless deployments. And honestly, with a lot of those companies, we already have presence, and we've had presence for a long time, our role has just changed. You heard us talk about this at Analyst Day. Historically, our role was a little bit of a stocking course to create price pressure for AT&T and Verizon. And what you've seen, particularly recently with our growth, is there more and more choosing us, and we're displacing the incumbents for their wireless projects. And so a lot of our growth has come from customers that had technically been customers of ours before, but we're just majorly deepening our relationship with them. Michael Katz : Then I would just finish up and say, yes, we are definitely excited about our smaller markets and rural opportunity. And like we talked about at Analyst Day almost 2 months ago, that's 40% of the entire geographic market in the country. And we've got a market share of about in the low teens, and we're trying to get that to -- we will get that to nearly 20% over the next few years. That's for sure. And so like you said, Brett, that that's got a huge opportunity for new accounts, of course, definitely. But just remember one of the things that I said earlier, too, that when you look at our Sprint branded base, that we are going to be migrating more and more to our T-Mobile base that traditionally has had some of the least penetrated number of lines on a per account basis. So there's still big opportunities for us to deepen our relationships with the customers that we acquired through the Sprint transaction back in April of last year. So net of those two things, sure, there's ARPU opportunities for us in new accounts, but there's also ARPA opportunities for us as well as we deepen our existing relationships. Mike Sievert : Great questions, Brett. Thanks. Brett Feldman : Thank you. Operator : And moving on to Michael Rollins with Citi. Mike Sievert : Hi, Mike. Michael Rollins : Thanks. Hi. Good afternoon. Two questions, if I could. The first one was the prepaid churn came down. And just curious if you see this as a temporary change or if you're seeing something fundamental happened in terms of the retention rates for prepaid customers. And then second, lease devices, it looks like it was down from $14.2 million in the base -- $12.4 million in the base in this latest quarter, which is down 13% sequentially. Just curious if you're taking an active approach to quickly reduce the amount of these lease devices in your base and what that steady state mix might look like for T-Mobile between installments and leases in the future. Thanks. Mike Sievert : I'll start on the first one, see if Jon wants to pile in. It's too early to tell. I think what we're seeing is that our market position for Metro by T-Mobile is exactly what the market is looking for. We\u2019re -- you saw our highest net add growth in 3 years on Metro. We're the leading brand from one of the major network providers. The leading brand, and yet we're still growing. And we're growing in value, too, with churn falling and that's fantastic. It just kind of shows that we have a well-positioned value proposition, I think it's going to turn out to be very prescient that we decided to align Metro around the T-Mobile master brand. Metro by T-Mobile, because as this network investments start to take root, what's really important is that customers -- I said this in my remarks, that customers give us credit for those network investments. And that means they need to know they're part of that network and Metro customers do. As Jon rolls out in smaller markets, we're going to be able to do that in a unified way, which is much more efficient to go after smaller markets with Metro by T-Mobile and T-Mobile together with unified distribution. And that's fantastic. So we have a more premium offering, that attracts people with a credible and legitimate need to be in this wireless category long-term, not coming in looking and leaving. And that's important. And I think right now in our economy with how much people are relying on their connections, if you're a prepaid customer, that is a very good place to be positioned. I'm not forecasting churn for you. I think that would -- there's so many ins and outs, but I like where we are. I like the overall health of our Metro by T-Mobile franchise. Jon, anything to add to that? Jon Freier : Yes. The only thing I would add to that is, yes, we just really love our early retention rates of our prepaid customers on Metro by T-Mobile as well. This is something that we are seeing that's a little bit different from our offer construct, compensation construct, etcetera. We're seeing improving early survival rates of our new accounts that we acquire through our Metro by T-Mobile brand and product. So we're seeing that which is fantastic news. And then like, Mike said just a few moments ago, we're going to be able to have Metro by T-Mobile and T-Mobile, all within our T-Mobile stores and smaller markets in rural areas, because it would be extraordinarily inefficient for us to put a T-Mobile store. And then right across the street, put a Metro by T-Mobile store. And like Mike said, Metro by T-Mobile and T-Mobile they have met. So in smaller markets in rural areas, you should be able to go to one store and be able to get anything and everything that T-Mobile has to offer. So we're looking forward to that as well. Mike Sievert : And last one on lease devices, Peter, it's happening -- unfolding slightly differently than we had outlook. So maybe you can comment on that. Peter Osvaldik : Yes, well, Mike, really the plan is the same as we laid out at Analyst Day where it's really bringing customers onto the T-Mobile value proposition. And when you think about that mid-term timeframe, the goal was really to get lease revenues down to $1.5 billion and ultimately to be below $1 billion by the long-term targets that we put out there. And it's giving everybody that -- again, the T-Mobile value proposition, all new originations are practically on EIP and taking away the irritant. So there's definitely incentives. We're talking about it with Sprint customers, but it's also on their terms, right to make it be something that isn't an irritant and a churn creator, but to quickly migrate them on to all the goodness that the T-Mobile value proposition has. Mike Sievert : Operator, before you go out to the phones, I want to ask my team here, we do have some coming in from Twitter as well. Do we want to go to one of those or two or three of those, rapid fire mode? Anything like that? Janice, what's your opinion? You want to talk? Janice Kapner : I would I think you got some good ones on enterprise momentum in WFX and on our big Un-carrier move on rural America and distribution and the great American 5G upgrade. Mike Sievert : Okay. I think we kind of talked about the great American 5G upgrade a little bit, but there is a good question here. So where did it go? Bill Ho, okay. So Bill Ho says since the launch of WFX, that stands for work from anywhere. Can you discuss the reception among the broad business segment? So how's it going? We did the launch. You've made a few comments earlier, Mike. But can you expand on what\u2019s going on? Peter Osvaldik : Hey, Bill, good to hear from you. With WFX the reception that we've seen so far has been great and kind of exactly what we expected. One of the first things that we've seen is we expected that bringing a new set of business services to market would enable us to have another dimension in which to facilitate conversations with enterprise and government buyers. And we've absolutely seen that so far. And we've begun the testing process across all the products in there. But to kind of get to the second part of your question. One of the really big pieces of the reception that we've seen is one of the things that's been so appealing about what we launched, particularly the home office internet product, is the fact that it's nationwide. And as businesses are starting to do their planning for a mixed work environment where some employees are going to be in the office and some are going to be remote including in their home, having a single nationwide solution and solutions to help facilitate this mixed work environment has been particularly important for them. And we think that's one of the most exciting things about what we did, particularly with that home office internet product is give a single nationwide broadband solution to enterprise, something that they really can't get anywhere else. So it's going great so far, and I look forward to keeping \u2026 Mike Sievert : That's an eye opener. I mean, when you think about this offering that is available, essentially nationwide, for employers, they really can't get that anyplace else. For their employees not to have to be on an Un-secured Wi-Fi network, sharing the Wi-Fi with the kids to try to do their job. And that's something that we've all seen, what that experience is like over the last year. So that's a breakthrough. Hey, while we got you Mike one more and then we'll go back to the phones. For Jim Patterson, could you comment on the big announcement we made about Lumen and what we're doing, especially as it relates to distributed computing. Michael Katz : Yes, really excited about it. And I think the Lumen team is excited too, because as they think about bringing Edge Compute solutions to market, what was important to Lumen, and particularly to the customers that they're looking to bring the solution to is a big distributed, powerful 5G network. And as you heard from Mike, and you heard from Neville earlier, nobody's got a bigger, nobody's got a more powerful nationwide 5G network to bring these true mobile Edge Compute solutions to market. So we're really excited about it and the Lumen team is really excited about it as well. We've already begun engagements with customers. So we're working on some use cases. I expect to have something to talk about that later in the year when those come into market. And we think there's a lot of exciting potential there to really help enterprises transform parts of their business and bring new services to their customers. So more to come on that one. Mike Sievert : You see what happens, Jim, you asked Mike questions, and he starts to preannounce awesome stuff. So that's -- you're welcome. All right, operator. Let's go back to the phones. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David Barton with Bank of America. David Barton : Hey, guys. Thanks so much for \u2026 Mike Sievert : Hi, David. David Barton : \u2026 questions. Appreciate it. Mike Sievert : Sure. David Barton : Hey, guys. So I guess I have a question for Peter on the guidance. And I apologize it's in four parts. So I guess, I heard your comments earlier with respect to the twinkle in the eye for the rest of the year, but specifically with respect to kind of how you change the guidance, how much was related to 1Q versus plan? And how much was related to changing expectations for the rest of the year? And the second question, part two was -- how does the increase in travel and roaming and things that have been happening, I think faster than people expected, impact your outlook, or maybe hasn't yet impacted your outlook. And then part three was at the Analyst Day you talked about Sprint churn in your base case plan going to 1.5%. But with where churn is now relative to last quarter versus to a weighted average a year-ago, it's clear, at least I think that it's not going there. So has that changed yet as a base case? And then finally, part D, If I could was what have you kind of baked into the plan as an outcome from the Verizon-TracFone merger? Thank you. Sorry. Mike Sievert : Wow, rapid fire mode, Peter. Let's see how you do. Bang him out, all four of them. Peter Osvaldik : All right. Mike Sievert : Yes and no answers. Peter Osvaldik : Yes, no. 1Q versus playing the rest of the year, it's actually both right. It's more momentum in terms of integration and that's why we have the synergy race. But it's also what we're seeing in terms of, of course, customer and the momentum in the business and ARPU that we talked about Magenta MAX. So it's a combination of both that allowed us to update guidance for the remainder of the year, roaming and travel, I would say, I don't know, it's hard to really know. But I will tell you, there's probably no better provider as you start thinking about travel opening back up, roaming opening up when you think about mobile without borders, when you think about what we offer to our consumers in terms of international roaming. The capabilities if you go to Europe or other countries, I would say there's no other provider, that's better. So maybe more and more consumers will see. Mike Sievert : Probably it hasn't been fueling much of our switching in the last year the way it's been a major contributor in prior years. So that's -- it's a fascinating point. Peter Osvaldik : On Sprint churn, I think saying, are we cutting in half? Are we updating the plan? I think we talked a little bit earlier. As we see the country reopening on a more nationwide basis, Jon, spoke to the fact that it's a little bit different than different parts of the region. We do see and anticipate switching to increase. So it's hard to know whether today's level and what we saw in Q1 is really representative or whether some of that switching which again, as the share taker is a real positive for us will impact until we go through the totality of that playbook of bringing them from worst-to-first. So a little bit wait and see there, but really, really pleased with the progress that we're seeing. And on Verizon and TracFone certainly for '21, not I can't speak to when they're going to close other than what they say in terms of external views. But in Analyst Day, we did say that we do assume TracFone, which is roughly about $750 million of high margin service revenue to us would go over a way over the period and likely by the midterm. Mike Sievert : Well done, not bad. Mike Sievert : Thanks, Dave. David Barton : Rapid fire. Mike Sievert : Yes, it work. All right, operator. Operator : And our next question comes from Ric Prentiss with Raymond James. Mike Sievert : Hi, Ric. Ric Prentiss : Thanks. Good afternoon everyone. Good afternoon. I want to go back to the opportunity in rural America and small market America. You mentioned how there'll be some small town rural experts and distribution picking up. You had originally talked also about increasing rural sites by 10,000. Can you update us as far as how that's going? I've seen some of the comments online talking about coverage out in rural America. So can you talk a little bit about those 10,000 sites to [indiscernible] and over what timeframe? Mike Sievert : Yes, it's a fantastic question, Ric, because they go hand in hand, right? We go into and really put the distribution and marketing firepower in place once we know, we have an awesome and competitive product. And that's the part that's so rapidly changing. So, I don\u2019t know, Neville, do you want start with this one? Neville Ray : Yes, I mean, good to talk to you, Ric. So the rural pieces is huge for us, right? I mean, that's the massive differentiator between what we're doing and if we're honest with ourselves, AT&T and Verizon haven't even announced what they're going to do in rural America with 5G. If you look at that extended range footprint we have today, more than AT&T and Verizon combined, I mean, there is only one choice on 5G in rural America. Today, it's T-Mobile. And we're there materially. You're right, Ric, in the plan as we move through the next couple of years, we intend to add about 10,000 incremental sites to the T-Mobile network. So some sites come off with the commissioning, and we add some additional sites. And that's happening all of the time. There will be several 1,000 added this year. There will be more in '22 and again in '23. So not necessarily an even split. But we continue to improve and enhance coverage across the full coast to coast footprint of the U.S. But in the rural territory, Jon is crazy busy rolling out distribution, and the network is just going from strength-to-strength. And really it's a tremendous upgrade in many parts of the U.S where we're bringing 5G services has been pretty damn awful for many, many years. Mike Sievert : Ric, one of the things we said in our remarks at the beginning was that this build, which is synergy backed and ahead of schedule, will result in T-Mobile not just having the best 5G network, but the best network with the most coverage. And I think that's important to understand. That's our goal is the best overall network in this country with the most coverage, the most availability, and that that's such an unlock. And for customers, of course, they're just now -- just beginning to understand that this is where we're headed and for 5G, where we already are. And that's such a fantastic potential opportunity and potential tailwind for our business as we go-forward. Ric Prentiss : Just squeeze one more rapid-fire question. In the past, you've talked about content goes to the internet, internet goes to mobile. It seems like there's an appending now that say mobile goes to cloud. Can you talk a little bit about what 5G network slicing might mean? And can you maybe allude to what you guys see as the opportunity? Is mobile headed to the cloud? Mike Sievert : Well, first of all, Ric, I'm so flattered that you are quoting us on that, that makes -- that's awesome. Look, the people are asking, what are some of the use cases that will fuel 5G, especially as it relates to enterprise, but you could also say with consumer and of course, it's cloud. And you know, this notion that enterprises don't want to be buying and deploying assets, they want to have networking as a service, they want to have computing as a service. And that does raise very interesting prospects for our business as it relates to being able to ultimately serve enterprise customers with networking as a service. But even putting that aside, which is a fascinating area, that our business model will -- doesn't rely on yet, but that we won't be left behind on. The other issue is that customers, both consumers and businesses alike, as they rely on cloud are going to need very high-speed low latency network for that experience to be good. The more local your compute is, the less your network matters. And the more cloud your compute is, the more your network matters. And people are asking, will T-Mobile's 5G advantage matter as it relates to choice? Or will it be an advantage that customers don't care about our notice? Well, cloud is a differentiator there because the more enterprise customers and consumer applications rely on cloud, the more our network shines, and it really showcases a potential, again, tailwind for the future. Ric Prentiss : Great. Thanks, Mike. Mike Sievert : You bet. Operator : And moving on to Colby Synesael with Cowen. Colby Synesael : Great, thank you. I think there's an expectation that competition is going to increase. And I think we all think about that fairly generically when we say that. But that's expected in the second half of the year tied to this expectation that switching is going to improve, which you've also are expecting. I'm just curious, what you've baked into your EBITDA guidance in terms of flexibility to respond to that competition to the extent it does show itself and it is aggressive. And then secondly, just a point of clarification. You guys mentioned that you expect ARPU to be up in 2Q versus -- excuse me, 3Q through 4Q versus the results in 1Q. I'm just wondering if that's linear. In other words, 2Q obviously up over 1Q, but is 3Q higher than 2Q and so forth? Thank you. Mike Sievert : Well, Colby, first of all, thanks for the question. It's awesome. You're our last question of the day. Those are great questions. And if you have your pen out, we'll just give you the ARPU figures for the next four quarters. No, I'm just kidding. We're going to start with ARPU, because it's a great question. And then I'll come back to the competition piece. So, Peter. Peter Osvaldik : All right. Certainly. And also how much we baked into EBITDA for promos by quarter, I think all that would be great. Colby Synesael : They really are great questions. Peter Osvaldik : No, they\u2019re excellent questions. No, it's not necessarily linear. There's obviously seasonality. There's promotional aspects. There's other things, there's when investments come, how much of a mix from T-Mobile for business or consumer, but it is a low watermark in Q1, and the rest of the year will be higher than that, but not necessarily linearly increasing. Mike Sievert : And to your other question, it really goes to our whole philosophy and mentality. Some people who follow us closely, if you look at our track record on guidance, and then our actuals, would be forgiven for saying we're conservative. If you look at our actuals and our track record, and we don't feel conservative. We just feel like we're prudent. And we never know what we don't know. And this is a hyper competitive business. And so what we do is we give you guidance that covers what we think are the most reasonable outcomes. And yes, it may get more competitive this year. And if so, we will execute and perform and deliver on our ambitions yet again. We've been through this journey long enough. And we have a model that's flexible enough. And we have a set of assets and a hand of cards that\u2019s strong enough that if this is a muted environment, we're good. If it's a hyper competitive environment, we're good. We're not going to bring about change like that. We like it how it is now. We think it's serving consumers incredibly well, thanks to the innovations that we bring. But if somebody else brings it, and they do stuff that totally changes things, we're ready. And if we have to be ready, you're hiring us to be ready and we give you guidance that showcases that we're ready. And that's why sometimes it appears conservative when really it's just prudent. And we'll see how this year unfolds. I certainly hope that we will be back next quarter with a beat and race. And that's certainly always our aspiration. And anyway, it's a great question to end on. I appreciate you. And I appreciate all of you. Thanks for tuning in for this. We're celebrating here at T-Mobile. This has been a fantastic start to what I certainly hope and expect will be a fantastic year. Thanks everybody for joining us. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the T-Mobile US first quarter 2021 earnings call. If you have any further questions, you may contact the Investor Relations or Media department. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect, and have a pleasant day.",

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jud Henry, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations for T-Mobile US. Please go ahead, sir. Jud Henry : Thank you. Welcome to T-Mobile's Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. Joining me on the call today are Mike Sievert, our President and CEO; Peter Osvaldik, our CFO, as well as other members of the senior leadership team. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements which involve a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. We provide a comprehensive list of risk factors in our SEC filings, which I encourage you to review. Our earnings release, investor factbook and other documents related to our Q2 results, as well as reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP results discussed in this call can be found on the Quarterly Results section of our Investor Relations website. I'd like to remind everyone that historical results prior to the second quarter of 2020 represent the stand-alone T-Mobile prior to the merger with Sprint. I would also like to note that we are in the quiet period for Auction 110 and will not comment directly or indirectly on that spectrum. With that, let me now turn it over to Mike. Mike Sievert : Okay. Thanks, Jud. Hi, everybody. It is so great to be coming to you live from our Bellevue, Washington headquarters here, all gathered together with increasing numbers of our employees with each passing week. And it's just great to feel the energy of this team. And it's no doubt fueled by this quarter's fantastic results. T-Mobile delivered another outstanding quarter of profitable and industry-leading growth, beating our numbers across the board and leading the industry in postpaid net subscriber growth and service revenue growth yet again. And we did it while simultaneously delivering record core adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow above expectations, all of this while accelerating the transition of Sprint customer traffic onto the T-Mobile network, further extending our 5G network lead and increasing our expected merger synergies for the year. And these results all culminate in a 16% year-over-year increase in free cash flow, 16%, which is just the beginning of our rapid free cash flow expansion journey and the unlocking of massive shareholder value. Listen, we're just past halftime in the game here for 2021 and our team is feeling more confident than ever. So we're increasing our guidance expectations across the board with today's announcement. Net additions, core EBITDA, synergies, capex investments and cash flow outlooks for the year are all being increased today. These results stem from our focus on executing on our three core ambitions that I talked with you about before, delivering industry-leading profitable growth by expanding our addressable market and growing customer relationships, delivering substantial enterprise value by realizing merger synergies faster and bigger while transforming our business and positioning the company for long-term success with sustained 5G leadership, our strong brand and the best customer experiences. Let's start by talking about growth. Our 1.3 million postpaid nets were the best in the industry and we continue to lead the industry in postpaid phone growth year-to-date as well, adding another 627,000 postpaid phone net adds in Q2, above our plan and consensus. This include another strong quarter of growth from T-Mobile for business, driven by customer wins in key industries, including airlines, automotive and retail and government agencies such as the Department of Veteran Affairs and the US Army. But importantly, our reliable profitable growth is the product of our progress on churn. T-Mobile again produced the biggest sequential improvement in postpaid phone churn compared to all other wireless operators this quarter, delivering 0.87%. We continue to make great strides in improving churn for both our T-Mobile and Sprint customers by providing them with best-in-class experiences. And we continue to see the lowest churn in the entire industry from our loyalty mobile branded customers. Our T-Mobile brand's consumer churn is lower than Verizon's and this quarter, so is our business journey [ph]. This achievement is a testament to our awesome customer-loving team and also to our synergy-backed model, which allows us to sustainably deliver the best value, while rapidly building fame as America's best 5G network. And unlike the other guys, we've got room to run our higher Sprint churn is rapidly improving, giving us ongoing potential tailwinds in this area. Speaking of our customer-loving team, just this morning, we were awarded the number one ranking from J.D. Power in US Customer Care Performance for the 22nd time. And our Net Promoter Score for customer care among our Sprint customers is up 48% year-over-year. The way we care for our customers is part of our secret sauce and it's important moat around our business. Now with all the line growth we've been seeing in the industry, another strong metric to watch is postpaid accounts, which represents new overall customer building relationships. As we said during our Analyst Day, our strategy is built upon establishing new account relationships and growing them over time with additional products and services to drive ARPA growth. This quarter, we delivered our highest ever postpaid account growth at 349,000 and we continue to focus on capturing quality profitable growth. I'll say it again. This quarter's account growth was our highest ever at least in all the years I've been here. That's over 600,000 net postpaid accounts added year-to-date compared to Verizon, which is still negatives for so far this year and AT&T who doesn't want to share account growth information. In addition, we are a largest prepaid provider in the country. And we're consistently growing and delivering strong ARPUs in this valuable customer segment despite our size and despite the ongoing industry growth of postpaid at the expense of prepaid. In Q2, we delivered 76,000 net adds, which reflected record low industry-leading prepaid churn of just 2.62%. Okay, let's discuss the financial outcomes. One thing that continues to distinguish us as an investment is that only T-Mobile is converting that record service revenue and our synergy-backed model in the industry-leading core EBITDA -- adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow growth. What's even more exciting is that we are delivering these results before we begin to fully capitalize on our 5G leadership and before we fully tap into the new market opportunities and underpenetrated segments we've been discussing. Peter will tell you more about our financial results here in a minute, but what I'll say is that T-Mobile showed again today that we consistently deliver smart growth on the top-line metrics, while consistently leading on financial outcomes like core EBITDA and cash flow, pacing nicely to unlock the massive cash flows we outlined in our five-year plan, a plan that promised outcomes we are reiterating here today, built around consistent disciplined market-leading profitable growth. Our opportunities are enabled by the fact that we already have America's largest, fastest and most reliable 5G network. And as we continue to pull further away from the pack with the pace of our network build, we're clearly beginning to differentiate ourselves not just on 5G but on network performance overall. Already this year, seven third-party network report show that T-Mobile customers get the fastest 5G speeds and spend the most time connected to 5G. While others are touching to the work of a single paid consultant to support their network claims, our 5G leadership is showing up loud and clear time and again and reports that are coming from multiple, independent, industry-leading firms that look at real customer usage from billions of device measurements. Now I know we all spend a lot of time talking about 5G and for good reason, but we have also quietly eliminated the legacy advantages that AT&T and Verizon previously enjoyed on LTE, which is where most traffic remains today. In fact, the latest Ookla data shows that T-Mobile customers get the fastest overall network speeds nationwide and T-Mobile swept every mobile category in Ookla's latest report. This is in addition to OpenSignal's latest findings that T-Mobile delivers the best 4G availability. And Umlaut's latest report, which highlights again that T-Mobile has the most reliable network overall. So whether customers are on 4G LTE or 5G, they're covered by a far-reaching and speedy network at T-Mobile. Speaking of far-reaching, did all of you touched Neville's blog earlier this week, he announced that T-Mobile's extended range 5G now reaches 305 million people, that's nearly everybody. And we surpassed our year-end milestone roughly six months ahead of schedule, thanks to the terrific momentum of our team. Think of it this way. Our 5G network covers 92% of Interstate Highway miles across 5G -- across America. With 5G, 92% today compared to just 68% for AT&T and only 51% for Verizon as an example. However, where we are really unlocking transformative experiences for our customers is with our game-changing Ultra Capacity 5G, which as you know, we are rolling out at an unprecedented pace. We already cover half of the US population delivering average download speeds of 350 megabits per second to 165 million people with Ultra Capacity 5G. And we continue to increase both the breadth and depth of our mid-band deployment providing a 50% increase in our customers' average 5G download speeds just since the beginning of this year, according to billions of real-time device measurements by OpenSignal. That's because we're not just rolling out Ultra Capacity 5G to more of the population targeting 200 million people by year-end, but we are also adding spectrum targeting 100 megahertz before year-end, about what AT&T and Verizon will light up sometime next year with C-band combined. We're well ahead in our 5G leadership. But what I hope is also becoming increasingly clear is that T-Mobile is positioned to maintain our 5G leadership for the duration of the 5G era, thanks to our superior spectrum portfolio, our unprecedented deployment momentum and our synergy-backed model. We're doing just what we've said we would do during the merger process, leading America into the 5G era and doing it without leaving rural areas behind. And this leadership is beginning to really matter to customers. The 5G era is here and seven out of 10 customers say they're excited about it. T-Mobile's 5G network perception is rapidly changing. And just since March, T-Mobile has seen a 25% increase in people viewing us as the leader in 5G. Now at 26%, we're closing in on Verizon's stagnant 35% number on this metric. And we're way ahead of AT&T. And as for business customers, already over 40% of enterprise decision makers think of T-Mobile as a leader in 5G with 5G quickly becoming one of the top things that customers say they're looking for in their next wireless provider. Our network is increasingly becoming a catalyst for them to choose T-Mobile. This network progress is also helping to fuel the rapid realization of merger synergies and our continued progress on integration. For the second quarter in a row, we're raising our synergy guidance for 2021. This progress includes continuing to migrate Sprint customers to the T-Mobile network and improve their experience, which is key to unlocking synergies. We've already moved one-third of Sprint customers to the T-Mobile network. And this is important. We're now carrying approximately 80% of the total Sprint customer traffic on the T-Mobile network. This is all within just five quarters of closing the merger. And as planned, we're also expanding into new and underpenetrated businesses. We commercially launched our broad 5G Home Internet offering at the beginning of the second quarter. We continue to see great customer satisfaction and product demand continues to put us on track for our target of 500,000 Home Internet customers this year even with demand exceeding our supply for modems at times earlier this year. And we're already seeing third-party recognition, including PC Magazine recently publishing it's Readers' Choice Awards, where T-Mobile Home Internet is ranked higher than every single cable provider by actual customers for overall satisfaction and likelihood to recommend. For enterprise and government, our plan is built on taking share in core wireless, and it's well on track as I discussed earlier. But in addition, our 5G network creates a platform for growth beyond core wireless. And we are focused on helping customers realize value from emerging technologies such as private networks and mobile edge compute, which are exciting potential upsides to our plan. We're already in trial programs with major enterprises in these areas, including 12 of the Fortune 50, even though we don't issue empty press releases about it every week. Meanwhile, we're building our best value, best network, best customer experiences formula to smaller markets and rural areas as well, which make up 40% of US households. We've kicked off initiatives to add significantly more points of distribution to reach beyond urban areas as well as new initiatives and offers. We're already seeing some early success as smaller markets and rural areas drove nearly one-third of our new postpaid account activations in Q2, up from about a quarter last year. The potential here is super-exciting. So, if I get ready to turn it over to Peter to take you through our financials, I want to take a moment to thank our team for delivering another remarkable quarter, delivering the highest postpaid customer growth and service revenue growth in the industry, while translating that into the highest core adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow growth in the industry. We continue to execute our integration playbook to unlock merger synergies ahead of schedule and we further expanded our 5G lead with the nation's largest, fastest and most reliable 5G network, planting the seeds for our future success. So, okay, let me turn it over to Peter to take you through the financials and our guidance. Peter Osvaldik : All right. Thanks, Mike. As you can see, we continue to have strong momentum across the business. We beat expectations yet again in Q2 as we delivered on our winning playbook. So let me briefly discuss these great results. Service revenues grew to $14.5 billion, up an industry-leading 10% year-over-year or roughly 6% normalizing for the Boost MVNO and 2% sequentially, driven primarily by our continued customer growth. Both cost of services and SG&A expenses, excluding merger-related costs, were lower as a percentage of service revenue on a year-over-year and sequential basis, reflecting the continued scale benefits we are delivering for merger synergy realization. Net income of $978 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.78 were both also better than consensus expectations. Core adjusted EBITDA was a record $6 billion and up 7% year-over-year, driven by continued profitable service revenue growth and synergy realization. Net cash provided by operating activities grew to $3.8 billion, driven by our strong operating performance and synergy realization, while cash purchases of property and equipment, including capitalized interest, amounted to $3.3 billion, which was up $1 billion from a year ago as we continue to aggressively invest in the buildout of our nationwide 5G network. Free cash flow, excluding gross payments for settlements of interest rate swaps, amounted to $1.7 billion, which grew an industry best 16% from a year ago, even with the significantly higher capex investment and was also fully burdened by merger-related costs of $190 million. Postpaid ARPA, or average revenue per account, was $133.55 as we continue to deepen customer account relationships. Postpaid phone ARPU was $47.61, up from the low water mark in Q1, as we foreshadowed. We expect continued tailwinds from premium service revenue adoption, including benefits from Magenta Max to be partially offset by the remaining tail of Sprint customer rate plan migrations and growing lines per account. Overall, we continue to expect full year 2021 postpaid phone ARPU dilution to be less than 1% compared to 2020. And we continued to strengthen our balance sheet and lower our cost of capital. In May, we issued senior notes in an aggregate amount of $3 billion at an average interest rate of approximately 2.97%, including setting a record in the high yield market for the lowest yield ever for a five-year tranche, underscoring our momentum as we progress towards our goal of an all investment grade capital structure. We used the proceeds to retire three notes with coupons roughly double the cost of the newly raised debt. Amazing execution yet again by the team all around to deliver these strong Q2 results. So let's touch on how this momentum impacts our outlook for 2021 with another beat and raise quarter from T-Mobile, as Mike mentioned. Our guidance reflects the OpEx investments ahead of us, both in the network and growth initiatives that Mike discussed while simultaneously delivering on our promise of continued profitable growth. We now expect total postpaid net additions to be between $5 million and 5.3 million, taking the low end above the top of our prior guidance range of $4.4 million to $4.9 million, reflecting continued profitable growth and prudent share-taking opportunities from expected increased switching activity in the second half of the year. This also assumes a higher mix of postpaid phone net additions as a percentage of the total postpaid net additions in the second half. Core adjusted EBITDA is now expected to be between $23 billion and $23.3 billion, primarily driven by service revenue growth and our expectation for higher merger synergies in 2021, which are now expected to be between $2.9 billion and $3.2 billion as we continue our progress towards rapid synergy realization. We continue to expect merger-related costs, which are not included in core adjusted EBITDA to be between $2.7 billion and $3 billion before taxes with the second half being relatively evenly split between Q3 and Q4. Net cash provided by operating activities, including payments for merger-related costs, is now expected to be in the range of $13.6 billion to $13.9 billion, up from our prior guidance of $13.2 billion to $13.6 billion. We expect cash capex to now be between $12 billion and $12.3 billion, up from our prior guidance to be at the high end of original range of $11.7 billion to $12.0 billion as we continue the robust pace of our 5G deployment and network integration. Together, this results in free cash flow, including payments for merger-related costs, increasing to $5.2 billion to $5.5 billion, which does not assume any material proceeds from securitization. This reflects our increasingly strong cash flow generation more than fully funding higher levels of capital investment. And finally, we now expect our full year effective tax rate to be between 23% to 25%, the improvement versus our prior guide being primarily driven by certain state tax benefits. Altogether, our strong momentum and execution enable us to continue to invest in our network and the business to deliver significant expansion in future free cash flow. We're on track with our plans to unlock significant value for our shareholders, potentially including substantial share repurchases ahead in the future. All right. Let's get to your questions. You can ask questions via phone or via Twitter. We will start with the question on the phone. Operator? First question, please. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Jonathan Chaplin with New Street Research. Jonathan Chaplin : Thanks, guys. Just one from me. I'm wondering can you give us some more context on the DISH deal? It would be great to get a little bit more of an understanding of kind of the mechanics behind the scenes and the reasons why you let that relationship go. But also, I would love to get some context from you on how you think this sort of new deal that they've got with AT&T impacts the wireless industry overall. Thanks. Mike Sievert : Thanks, Jonathan. First of all, Peter, you owe me $100, the first question was in fact about DISH. Let me point out a couple of things. Jonathan Chaplin : I hate to be predictable. Mike Sievert : Yes. Let me point out a couple of things about this. One is, I want to make sure people understand, particularly investors understand, that when we presented you our five-year plan, we had already factored in rapid declines for DISH revenue into our plan. And so that's kind of in the run rate. I'll get to it. It could go a little faster than we had thought. But I want to make sure you understand that. We have done that for a number of reasons. One, we can observe a rapid decline in customers over at DISH. And we don't have a lot of knowledge about their operations and so there's no reasons for us to do anything other than drag right on that when we make our plans. And secondly, we took them at their word that they would build a facilities-based network and vacate ours as soon as possible. So all that was built into our run rate, so much so that in our five-year planning horizon, by the end of it, we had substantially taken out all of the DISH revenues in our plans and the vast majority of them by the end of our planning period. Now, it's possible that with this development with AT&T that they will move faster than even we anticipated in moving off our network. And that will open up some both opportunities as well as some gaps in our financial plan. And I want to make sure a couple of things are clear. First of all, we've looked at this carefully and we are here today reiterating every aspect of our five-year plan, both in the medium-term and in the long-term that we communicated earlier this year. And there's a couple of reasons for that. When we look at this, one of the things I've learned in wireless is that every time you've got a good guy coming at you, there's some opposing bad guy you have to manage. Like great growth, it's going to cost you in EBITDA, for example, and you've got to manage that. Or in AT&T's case, billions and billions of dollars in future revenues reversals hung up on their balance sheet. But on the other hand, when you get a bad guy like potentially DISH moving faster off our networks than we thought, it opens up opportunities. One of the things that we see right away is that when they move off of our network, that's going to open up both management attention, but more importantly capacity. And so many things in our plan are predicated on available capacity. Like, for example, home broadband where we don't think we're going to be so much paced by the demand, we're going to be paced by the available network capacity. So there's an opportunity to go faster. Or enterprise share taking, where our ability to put ambitious offers in front of customers is paced by what, available capacity, our ability to bring in new wholesale partners or double down with our existing ones. This is something that ultimately when we look at it, we're not really that displeased, which gets to the core premise of your question because it's going to allow us to do what we do best, focus on our knitting and get after share taking and building this great network. And that's always been sort of the core premise of the five-year plan that we put in front of you. I'll say a couple of things to wrap up. One, we like and respect the DISH team and we are here for them. So, to the extent that they want us, we're here, more or less, it's up to them. We will honor every obligation and continue to honor every obligation that we've made to both them and to the government. And overall, we are going to get after growing our core business and working with our core partners. And we're here today after looking at it carefully to reiterate every single promise that we made to you in our five-year plan. Jonathan Chaplin : Great. Thanks, Mike Mike Sievert : You bet, John. Operator : And our next question will come from Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson. Craig Moffett : Hi. I may cost you another $100 because I'm going to go back to the DISH deal one more time. And just the duration of the DISH deal is quite a bit longer than what you were willing to offer when you originally signed the deal. Can you just talk about were you willing to extend the deal or was the duration a significant part of the negotiation? And then, I guess, just a more general question. Where's all the growth in the market coming from? I mean, we are seeing growth that's now, what, 5 times population growth rate in total phone subscriptions. Can you just talk about what it is that's driving that kind of growth and how sustainable you think that will be for how long? Mike Sievert : Yes. Let's jump in on both those. And then, I might ask Peter or John to add to it. As for the agreement, one of the things, obviously, to point out -- I think everybody knows this -- is that our arrangement with DISH is a product of a merger remedy package. And it's highly negotiated and it wasn't something that we looked at in our business plan and had built in originally. We planned to operate the Boost business. So it was part of a remedy package. And in that sense, we were sort of thrust together and has to negotiate this. We did have a shorter-term than what we saw -- communicated in the AT&T agreement, but I don't really have much comment on that. I'm not privy to what interactions happen between them -- between DISH and AT&T. I'm very immersed in the interactions we've had with DISH. Yes, it had a certain term. It had it for a reason. Because remember, the remedy package was meant for DISH to get after building their own facilities-based network as fast as possible and to move their revenues and their customers onto that as fast as possible. That was always the intention. And some are asking whether this still enables that or still we'll see that happen or not. I don't know. You'll have to check with them. As it relates to the second question, what we'll see going forward, one of you guys want to jump in? Peter Osvaldik : Yes. Let me jump in on just DISH one more because I know we have, before it costs me $300. We have some questions coming in on the impact. And as Mike said, we are here today reiterating the mid and long-term guidance that we put out there at Analyst Day. And there has been some questions out there around, well, is it $2.5 billion of revenue currently? I think there's some extrapolation perhaps from DISH's cost of service line item. I just am here to say it's already less than $2 billion on an annual basis in 2021. And again, because we assumed DISH would be a successful competitor and would build out their own facilities and take customers off, that was already reflected as a decrease in the run rate. But also, one of the things we talked about in Analyst Day is the prudent plan that we put in front of you, right, with multiple upside opportunities. And that included things, as Mike alluded to, Mobile Edge compute, virtual networking, but also the ability to either slow down the ARPU dilution that was assumed in the plan as we expanded relationships, go deeper faster in smaller markets, rural areas and a whole host of other factors. The ability to grow ARPA on a faster rate as we deepened relationships. And what you're really seeing in 2021 and what's encouraging is the success that we've had to-date from a new account perspective, from an ARPA growth perspective, from the ARPU stability that we're giving you. So we're here to absolutely reaffirm everything in the mid- and long-term guidance, all the way down to free cash flow. I see some questions on Twitter coming in that way. So, just wanted to make sure that was out there. And again, that's the focus of this team. We put out prudent plans and then our job is to beat them. And that's why we're here reaffirming things. Mike Sievert : And we still see the upsides that we saw then [indiscernible], very exciting potentially. So as it relates to accounts, this is what I know that everybody's asking this and all of us only have a lens on our own business. And so, we really can't give you all that much to go on. I can tell you a few things. One, as you heard in my remarks that we're making sure that everybody understands where our focus is. And our focus is on growing profitable overall account relationships, 600,000 of them on the postpaid side so far this year. This last quarter, the biggest new account quarter in our history. And accounts are a great metric because there totally new billing relationship, it's probably somebody porting over and they are an important metric. I heard during the earnings season, one of my competitors sort of said, hey, we're focused on quality growth and not all accounts are created equal. And what I would say to that is, but service revenues are. And T-Mobile led again on service revenue growth was 10% normalized for some things last year, 6% overall service revenue growth, the best in the industry. And so, look, there's some prepaid to postpaid transfers going on, there's some deepening of account relationships with [indiscernible]. There's a lot of dynamics, but it's one of the reasons why I want to make sure that you're hearing us focusing on our knitting about growing overall profitable relationships that result in the market's best service revenue and EBITDA growth. Anybody want to pile on and say where things are coming from? Peter Osvaldik : I think that's perfect gambling [ph]. The only thing I would add, Mike -- and hi Craig -- is, yes, there is a big transference from the prepaid category to the postpaid category. You're seeing that happen more from a macro perspective, lots and lots of people from prepaid moving into the postpaid based on the economic realities that you're seeing in the country, which makes our prepaid growth that much more impressive. When you think about us being the leading prepaid provider in the entire industry and putting up another 76,000 postpaid phone -- excuse me -- prepaid nets and having our industry are at record low churn on much on prepaid, just really incredible in terms of what's happening in that space. And that's a big draw into postpaid specifically is what you're seeing from a macro perspective in prepaid. Craig Moffett : Good. Mike Sievert : Thanks, Craig. Craig Moffett : Thank you. Mike Sievert : You bet. So let's do another one from the phone. And then let's see if somebody scanning the ones coming in on Twitter. We can pick one or two of those if you want to call them out. But first, let's go back to the phone. Operator : And our next phone question will come from Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Brett Feldman : Great. Thanks. Mike Sievert : Hey, Brett. Brett Feldman : So, as you highlighted during your remarks, this was a pretty solid churn quarter. As you observe the Sprint customer base kind of go through this transition into a T-Mobile customer base, what are the points along the way that seem to be correlated with step function improvements in churn among those legacy Sprint customers? And as you look out over the next couple of quarters as you continue to go through the process, how often are we going to be hitting those? Because I think that the real focus here is, it seems like you're making great headway at moving the base over, so how low can churn go and how quickly can you get there as you move through that process? Thank you. Mike Sievert : Yes. thanks, Brett. I mean, we have a lot of work left to do. And we're pleased with our progress. We're ahead of schedule. But this next year is a really critical time. And remember, in an integration like ours, there are separate -- we designed this to be able to do separate discrete events when it comes to the migration. One is, when do you migrate the substantial portion of their network traffic? Two is, when do you migrate their account relationship in terms of the core network that they're attached to? Three is, when do you migrate their rate plan through a destination rate plan? Four is, when do you migrate their biller? Because that can be a discrete event. And finally, when do you start telling them their T-Mobile migrate their brand? All of these can be discrete events. And all of them can contribute to churn improvement. By the way, there is some bumpiness. We're actually starting the process long promised of turning down the network on the store side and adding that capacity through the destination side. And that'll create mostly delight, but it will also create some bumpiness. So there'll be opportunities netted out with some pressures. And overall, it looks like a net opportunity to us. But we're entering a really acute stage here over the next 12 months where we will begin doing billing migrations at a faster pace. We'll begin doing brand migrations. The way we serve people with our exclusive team of experts model will be start to ramping -- to ramp up and will simultaneously start turning down those network sites that are not keep sites so that we can start to get you those concrete synergic flows. All those things will be happening simultaneously. And so far, we're just delighted with how it's going. But at the same time, we see lots of opportunity to put an arm around and love those Sprint customers and we're all over it. Brett Feldman : If you don't mind, I guess, a quick follow-up. Early in the process, there is a lot of questions about whether the Sprint customer base has the potential to have the churn profile of the legacy T-Mobile base. Now that you're several quarters in and some of those customers have been with you for a while, what's your latest assessment there? Do you think that the long-term churn profile that acquired base can match or get close to what you've historically shown us? Mike Sievert : Absolutely. And one of the ways you can look at that is, when we look underneath that there are different kinds of situations of Sprint customers. For example, people who are happily into device payment plan that was given to them on fair terms and who have a great rate plan, their churn is already remarkably well. And most of their data is on the T-Mobile network. And so, we see that situation in our base. On the other hand, people who have a situation that's less palatable to them from a variety of promotions that had raising prices or the way their device plan work, so they're not in a device relationship with us and they're kind of a jump ball. Yes, those churn numbers are still higher. And our job is to welcome them to T-Mobile with the great taxes and fees included rate plans and Netflix on us and T-Mobile Tuesday's and team of experts care and of course the best 5G network in the country. And that's happening at pace, but we're only working our way through the base. Brett Feldman : Thank you. Peter Osvaldik : And Brett, to your point. This is one of those areas of opportunity that we highlighted at Analyst Day where the plan over the medium-term was really to close the gap in half to T-Mobile. So the extent that we get through this period -- this next period of 12 to 18 months rollout all the benefits of T-Mobile, it's an opportunity, right. As we see maybe closer alignment during that period to the Magenta base. Mike Sievert : That could wind up being a nice upside, because only closing half the gap. Yes, that's what's written into our plan. Brett Feldman : Great. Thanks. Mike Sievert : What are we seeing on the Twitter before we go back to [indiscernible]. Jud Henry : Well, you've got -- while it's got a couple of good questions in here, one about 2.5-gigahertz deployment, which I'm sure Neville could hit and a little bit about on postpaid phone gross adds and add lines, which I think we have some great insight on. Mike Sievert : He doesn't do the calls anymore. He's just digital versus digital. Brett Feldman : Okay, fair enough. Jud Henry : You've got in multiple questions. Brett Feldman : That way [ph]. Mike Sievert : Well, let's read it out. So, go to one feed, does the DISH move to see impact free cash flow guidance? No. Why is there only 40-megahertz of 2.5-gig in some markets? When it will be a 100-megahertz or 160 everywhere? Let's talk about that, because how our advantage level translates into not only people covered POPs but megahertz deployed to those POPs to geek out on an old industry term, megahertz POPs. The difference between what we can offer in the next few months versus AT&T and Verizon and then how that translates into years long advantage, it's pretty start. Maybe you can talk about where we are and where we're going. Peter Osvaldik : Yes, absolutely. So, if we pick up on Mike's comments earlier in the 165 million covered people we have already today with our Ultra Capacity mid-band solution. With 35 million away from an end-of-year goal of 200 million people covered with Ultra Capacity solution, which is a nationwide claim basis. So that's the progress we're making with super close, it's July. I'm very confident about our ability to hit the 200 million. And to your question, Walt [ph], that's the point in time we're targeting on average 100 megahertz of spectrum will be available across that footprint, 100 megahertz of the 2.5-gigahertz spectrum, the best mid-band spectrum there is out there in this 5G category. So that's exciting. And if you compare and contrast that to what AT&T and Verizon have announced to-date, they're talking about 100 million people covered at some point in time in the New Year. And between them, the C-band spectrum holdings, they have 100 megahertz, Verizon 60 and AT&T 40. So when you compound the footprint and the spectrum available, obviously we have a massive lead. And the good news is that that lead is there and it's durable and it's sustainable as we move into the coming years. AT&T and Verizon will try and match what we will do this year by the end of 2023 when they get more C-band spectrum available in the second tranche. Of course, we get C-band spectrum at the end of 2023 too. But the important piece is, we're not sitting at 200 million covered POPs at the end of this year. Our goal is to be at 300 million covered POPs by the end of '23 and to double that spectrum position from a 100-megahertz of mid-band to 200 megahertz. And then your question, Walt, you mentioned 160-megahertz of 2.5. Our plan is to have all of that deployed for 5G plus additional mid-band from our AWS and PCS Holdings. This set us up for an incredible leadership position that AT&T and Verizon will spend many years trying to match. Mike Sievert : I was expecting a follow-up question. I forgot he is on Twitter. Okay. So good. Let's go back to the phone and we'll get ready for another Twitter one after that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Mike Sievert : Hi, Phil. Phil Cusick : Hey, guys. Thanks. Hi, Mike. You noted in the factbook that the phone increase was driven in part by T-Mobile for business. Where are you on that? Can you quantify the size of that customer base and the growth? And then, similar on home broadband, can you tell us what the contribution was there in the quarter and how that should pace from here? Thanks. Mike Sievert : Beautiful. We'll turn it over to the leaders of those two business groups. I am just delighted with what we're seeing on T-Mobile for business. It's a big contributor. We outpaced Verizon this quarter, fantastic, even outpaced Verizon on churn. So people wonder whether we're for real and in business. We're for real. Maybe Mike, you can talk about what's driving it, and then we'll flip over and talk about what we're seeing in home broadband. Mike Katz : Thanks, Mike. I'm really pleased with what we saw this quarter. And as we talked about in Analyst Day, our focus has really been going after the postpaid core connection opportunity. Because if you look at all the opportunities in enterprise, core connectivity still is the largest opportunity both from number of subscribers but also from revenue. So we've been really focused on taking share there. And we've been really leveraging several very distinct strategies to go do that. First and foremost, its network. And it's all the things that Neville just talked about with 5G, we have a distinct advantage right now in the 5G network. We've got a huge lead that right now our competitors can't touch. And that matters in this enterprise space. And so, we've been using that to really get conversation started with enterprise, using it to get into testing with enterprise. And when they test us side by side, we win -- we simply win because we can't be touched in 5G right now. We're also really focused on disrupting in enterprise, specifically around simplicity and value. One of the things that you've heard us talk earlier in the year when we launched WFX solutions, how complex the enterprise space is with core wireless, still lots of pool plans and sharing. And when you're doing that across tens of thousands employees, it's incredibly complex, so complex in fact that we see come -- see enterprises hiring third-party companies to manage it. And we've really seen enterprise respond favorably when we can come in and offer a much more simple, much more straightforward value proposition. So, those have been some of the big key stuff we're doing it. And like Mike said, it's really translated into incredible results. We beat Verizon again in total postpaid adds and that growth is translating both into year-over-year revenue improvements that are double-digit and the network is really resonating with the base where we saw both year-over-year and sequential decreases in churn from our postpaid customers. And you heard Mike mention in the opening comments, lower than Verizon in this quarter. And so... Mike Sievert : We're talking about blended, not just on the T-Mobile side, but overall -- blended overall. That's terrific. Well done. Your second part of your question, Phil, is about home broadband. And we're just out of the gates. We're really pleased with what we're seeing. Dow Draper leads all of our emerging businesses. And one of the things I'll say to tee up Dow is that one of our early insights is that, it sure does it look like this is going to be about demand. This is going to be paced by network capacity as I mentioned in my answer on DISH by device capacity for a minute here as we recover from COVID, but not by demand. And by the way, the customer experience is pretty exciting too. But Dow, why don't you tell us what you're seeing? Dow Draper : Thanks, Mike. I mean, first off, thanks for the question, Phil, because we're super enthusiastic about this business. And as you -- as we talked about previous this year and we really entered '21 with 100,000 customers in a pilot. And then we officially launched in April to 30 million households with our 5G Home Internet service. And there's really -- it's early days here, basically echo what Mike said, we started and what we've earned is that one is the customer satisfaction and what customers are telling us about the product is really positive. Our customer satisfaction scores are very high in an industry that is known for basically bottom of the barrel customer satisfaction metrics and so that's really, really great to see and it's nice to get the results of the survey in PC Magazine's Readers Choice article and so it's great to see that. And then what that's also translating to is, we are seeing demand outpace -- really outpaced supply in the second quarter. And we've done a lot of things, we're working to catch up with that. We think we're going to be caught back up here in the next month. And so, what that means is, our aspiration was to end the year with 500,000 home broadband customers. And we feel really good about that trajectory. Phil Cusick : Thanks, Dow. Jud Henry : I think we should go to -- there is a couple in here about prepaid which you touched on, but there is lots of -- will go from Bill Ho, prepaid seems to have a resurgence given yesterday's aggressive offer, given the comments on postpaid, prepaid blurring has anything triggered this second half prepaid thinking and any color on this amazing stellar drop in prepaid churn. And he kind of goes on about the aggressive offer that we just launched. Mike Sievert : One of the things, it's 5G, look, we just -- as a company, we don't believe that 5G is for rich people on postpaid plans. We need it for everybody. And that's really important. And we're moving absolutely ambitiously to make sure everybody gets a chance to see and experience this remarkable network and by the way, with prepaid customers. That's even more important for so many of them because their phone for many of them is their only connection to the Internet. It has to be a great connection. And it's just such an advantage for us to have the nation's leading prepaid brand on the nation's leading 5G network. And we never held back. From day one, we said, hey, that's for you also. And right now, we have an incredible offer for people to switch from booster cricket, it don't seem to be growing at a fast pace to introduce prepaid customers to 5G and not only to give them a great rate plan, but also to give them a brand new Samsung Galaxy 5G phone. And so, it's a fantastic offer, really it's about celebrating this-5G moment and getting people to come see what our network leadership is all about. And I think that's a contributor. That network leadership both on 4G and 5G is certainly a contributor to the lowest churn we've ever seen or anybody has ever seen from a major prepaid brand. Let's go back to the phone. Operator : And we'll go to Doug Mitchelson with Credit Suisse. Doug Mitchelson : Thanks so much. You mentioned in the prepared remarks, you're expecting higher switching activity in the second half of the year. So I'm just curious, is that something you are already seeing -- and is that suggesting that there will be a higher churn environment for the entire industry as a result, the security implications there. And then, for Neville, beyond putting more spectrum into use, since the growth in fixed wireless might be constrained by you delivering capacity versus demand for the product, is there other things that are happening in future years beyond that to drive capacity? Are you going to go back and touch the powers again, will there be software updates or sort of new talent deployments that you're not doing this go around, anything on capacity beyond putting the spectrum to use would be helpful. Thanks. Mike Sievert : So I'll start and hand it to Neville, then we'll go back to your first question. It's funny, it's the opposite. The question we often get asked is actually the opposite, the converse of years, which is you're building all these incredible capacity, what are the use cases? Tell us please now about 5G use cases? How are you going to fill up all that capacity? And it's really important you asked the question the way you did because wireless home broadband is one of the killer apps of 5G. And that's why I mentioned earlier that anything that frees up capacity to allow us to go faster on this multi-billion-dollar opportunity is a good guy. And -- but maybe we can talk about that whole equation of what you're seeing when it comes to enabling home broadband and other high-capacity applications. Neville? Neville Ray : Yes. I mean, I think obviously the heart of the opportunity is spectrum. And we are in a strong position and I outlined for you the pace at which we're deploying that 5G spectrum, which is going to create a fairly sharp contrast with our competition. I mean, I love our messaging on 5G for role. And part of that is that the prepaid segment of the customer base that we just talked about, but it's also really hitting all corners of the United States, right. Going into rural market, small town America and bringing 5G capacity and capability at an incredible pace. And I think that's going to position us for a long-term advantage in those market areas. That capacity and capability going into those marketplaces is going to open up enormous opportunity on in-home broadband. So it's not just the application of a great set of spectrum. It's where and how and the pace at which we do it. I think, the other piece is not to get too geeky, right, but 5G is just really beginning. And the features and capabilities and the spectral efficiency that we can secure from a 5G bearer, we're at the very beginning of that journey. We're only just now rolling out 5G in the mid-band space. And if you look at what happened with LTE over a decade plus material improvements in the capacity and capability of what we could support with our radio network. And that's going to come with 5G too. There's a very rich future and roadmap to enhance the capacity and capability that we can bring. So, you add all those pieces together. This is an incredible 5G factory that we're building. And to Mike's comment, I mean, we're excited about all of the opportunities with which we can fill up this capacity bucket that we'll roll out over the next three, four, five years, but the opportunity especially in the near-term is going to be critical across the country and especially in those major markets where we make the first start. Mike Sievert : All right. Your first question was about switching and trends we're seeing with churn in the second half. I'll tee it up and hand it to Jon. A lot of this is seasonal. I mean, second half is usually a period with higher switching activity and higher churn. This year, there's the additional dynamic of COVID which is a little bit of a wildcard. But the broad trends notwithstanding Delta variant do look like a continuation of opening up. And then of course in the fall time in prior years, we've generally had big important new phone launches. And if you take all that together, we've made on the guidance to fund our plan to compete profitably, ambitiously, reasonably but to compete in the second half to make sure that we're competitive. But Jon, why don't you say what you're seeing? Jon Freier : Yes, that's exactly what I want to say, Mike, that seasonally in the second half of the year, you have three big moments, you've got a big bang SCOR [ph] moment that will be much more of a prominent moment this year versus perhaps last year. Then, like Mike said, you have a premium smartphone introduction that's typically in the fall timeframe, you never know, but typically in the fall timeframe. And then of course you have a holiday period. So what we're seeing is, we're seeing a continued reopening. We've been seeing that. I think I said last quarter that there are some places throughout the country even last quarter like Texas and Florida and some states like that were fully open and then other places like New York and California is still gradually reopening. We're still seeing that in terms of those states and some of those big markets that are still, gradually reopening. We expect that to continue. Like Mike said just a few moments ago, don't know whether Delta is going or any kind of variance that might be out there, but we're well in the position to post-vaccine environment to be able to manage that. We expect there to be much more activity in the second half of the year versus the first half. We're prepared to win in that space. That's where we win the most. That's what we love to see that kind of competitive activity and there is more people evaluating their options out there. We love that because we want them to look at T-Mobile. And when they look at T-Mobile in there in the market to shop and perhaps switch, they pick us more than not. So we're excited about it. Doug Mitchelson : Thank you. Mike Sievert : All right. You bet. Doug. Okay, let's go back to the phone. Operator : Our next phone question will come from John Hodulik with UBS. John Hodulik : Okay, great. Thanks guys. Hey, Mike. How are you? Maybe let's go back to the rural and suburban strategy [indiscernible] contribution in terms of accounts has ticked up to the third of new accounts this quarter. How high can that go and do you expect it to continue to tick up? And I guess, along with that, how far through the investment phase are, we talked about, in hiring local expected increase in distribution? Is that in the run rate or should we expect more? And then lastly, along with that, you guys talked about sort of getting on these synergies, especially taking down and decommissioning the Sprint network and it seems the equation there with either some increase in investment on distribution but eventually we're going to see that the cost come through. When do we see that inflection and investments that we start to see acceleration in the adjusted EBITDA number? Thanks. Mike Sievert : Terrific. Well, first of all, let me just say on small markets and rural areas. My opinion, I'll pass it to Jon is, we're in the first inning. We're just getting going a lot of these investments around distribution, around a new way of distributing product, around new offers, around reputation where those things take a little bit. It's just at the very first inning. And yet, we're seeing the market respond. So that gives -- that makes us very optimistic. Peter, I think, rightly pointed out that in our five-year plan, we shared with you, there were a number of important upsides. And one of them is, we would hope there might be a chance to exceed our migration from the 13% market share we had today to the destination 20% in the five-year horizon that we communicated to you. I just told you that in this quarter in the first inning, we're seeing about a third of our activations come from those markets, pretty exciting. So -- and John, some of these questions are about okay. What have we accomplished and what's next and what can we expect? Peter Osvaldik : Yes. Like Mike said, I too -- I mean, I'm so excited and increasingly enthusiastic about this opportunity for us. And as Mike highlighted in his opening comments, this is a huge opportunity for us, it's roughly 40% of the market, call it 50 million households, 140 million people, call it low teens market share. So we have a huge opportunity, specifically to the activities we said this year that we would be opening 200 retail stores, that's well on pace to be able to get done, also hiring 1,000 mobile hometown experts. And this 1,000 hometown experts, just remember, we're going into cities and towns where it doesn't really make a whole lot of economic sense to build brick-and-mortar distribution. So, this is more extending our reach into places that we ordinarily couldn't get to with retail distribution. That's well on pace as well. So, 200 stores this year, 1,000 hometown experts this year, we made a commitment to have up to 2,500 hometown experts. So we have 1,000 this year as a down payment on that 2,500 and then the balance of that coming into the future quarters and into the next couple of years. So, we're just increasingly excited about it. Like Mike said, almost a third of our postpaid new accounts coming in from smaller markets and rural areas from, call it, a quarter in 2020, it's a big opportunity. It is in the first inning for slow burn. We have a lot of perception to change, but we're capitalizing with this distribution push based on the incredible network that Neville and his team are building out there and bringing 5G to a lot of these places. I mean it's incredible when you think about it. There is not really a 5G strategy, I think, from some of our competitors in rural America. And they shouldn't be left behind. And we have a huge opportunity to go out there and bring Ultra Capacity 5G and so many places and be able to make a big difference of these markets. Mike Sievert : Perfect. I think -- there was a question, second part of this question was about synergies. Jonathan Chaplin : Synergies and EBITDA, so I think the run rate, as Jon mentioned, it really continues in the second half from an investment perspective both in distribution here, both in as we talked before, bringing our team of experts model into the Sprint base on a more full basis. So there continues to be investments in also the second half, of course, as we said with the larger switching opportunities with more of the phone launches, quote-unquote, that we don't know about, I may know about and of course holiday season and such. And then, our promotional constructs, as you know, tend to be more front-loaded. We don't hang it up on the balance sheet. But as we go through that, that tends to impact core EBITDA in period. So you'll see a lot of that, the investments, the promotions that we anticipate to be higher as we have more switching and a higher postpaid phone net add in the second half. So that all comes through in core EBITDA, but that is offset by the continuation of synergy unlock. And I think you asked, when is the inflection point in particular as it regards to the network? Well, we're starting. We are still targeting 7,000 8,000 decons by the end of this year. And with the pace that Neville was going, we feel confident about what we put out there at Analyst Day. And so, you see by 2023, we're already assuming we will overachieve against the $6 billion and ultimately on our way to $7.5 billion of run rate synergies by 2024. So, very exciting and you're already seeing that happen when you look at year-over-year margin as a percentage of service revenue. The competition obviously both went down in terms of margin as a percentage of service revenue and we went up. So, you see the power of those synergies and that unlock already starting. Very exciting. Mike Sievert : Thanks, Jon. Mike Sievert : You bet. So we'll go back to the phone and then maybe do we have a couple more on Twitter as well? Jud Henry : Maybe one and then you have. Mike Sievert : I have to go. When do I have to go? Jud Henry : Really after one more phone call. Mike Sievert : Okay, great. Operator : Thank you. We will go to Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Mike Sievert : Hi, Simon. Simon Flannery : Great. Thank you very much. So, coming back to the fixed wireless, the home broadband, maybe Neville, you could just talk a little bit about the learnings that you are seeing and this critique about your ability to handle the usage of the typical broadband customers. So what are you seeing so far? And I think you've been advertising a speed around 100 megabits a second, but at the same time you're saying Ultra Capacity networks averaging that 350 megabits per second. So what's the upgrade path for those speeds as you roll this network and add more spectrum in there? And then, any color on where the customers are coming from? Are they coming from DSL, coming from cable, neutral broadband, any color there would be great? Mike Sievert : Go to Neville for the first and Dow for the second. Neville Ray : Yes. So thanks, Simon. I mean, obviously so far we're making great progress. I mean, Dow and the team have been working really hard to get this business moving. And the network is moving at real pace to support the capacity and capabilities that are required. The real sweet spot on this program is really the Ultra Capacity. And you've heard this multiple times now talk about the pace and rollout of the Ultra Capacity layer. And that's what really brings this home broadband solution to life and allows us to move into these higher tier speeds many months now around the speeds and capabilities that we can support across this network, across this entire network and those speeds being north of 100 megabits per second. And that all comes to life as we realize all of that spectrum I talked about earlier on moving onto a 5G layer and a massive roll on mid-band spectrum layer. And so, our ability to support the growth is absolutely there. The economics are there because we have a deep and heavy layer of mid-band spectrum in 2.5-gigahertz and so we can secure these upgrades and the economics with almost a single radio deployment to leverage and unleash the 2.5-gigahertz spectrum. Very tough to do the stuff if you have to pull together lots of fragmented bands of spectrum, as for example AT&T has to do. So, for us, four quarters or so, but across the nation. And our ability to really transform that home broadband space in many parts of the country where there is very little competition and very poor service at times is absolutely there for us to go run that. Simon Flannery : Thanks, Neville. Terrific. Mike Sievert : Thanks, Simon. All right. So, where we're going now? Last question. Jud Henry : You can do, you have to go. Mike Sievert : I have to go. So we're going to take the last question. Therefore, we'll go to the phone. And operator? Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Michael Rollins with Citi. Michael Rollins : Thanks. Hi. A couple of follow-up questions. First on ARPU. Just curious if you can unpack what's happening in ARPU in the quarter and for the year in terms of some of the helps in Hertz and how Magenta MAX may also be contributing. And then just taking a step back, what's the expected pace going forward to introduce new un-carrier initiatives? And when you look at the totality of the value that you're offering, are you seeing a continued evolution in the take rates for services such as Netflix or the T-Mobile Tuesday? Mike Sievert : All right. Yes. Thank you, Mike. And thanks, Mike, for the question. So, ARPU and really the story of ARPA, I'm very pleased, like I said in the prepared remarks around what's happening with ARPU and really a lot of tailwind that we're still seeing with the adoption of Magenta MAX, which is just really a manifestation, another use case of the power of this network and bringing this differentiated product out into the marketplace and the ability for Jon and team on the consumer side to really translate that into value from an ARPU perspective. So that's a lot of the tailwind that we saw from a value add service on a sequential basis. Just remember, we told you Q1 was going to be the low watermark as we really focused in Q1 on moving a significant portion of the Sprint base into their target rate plans. And a little bit of that will continue throughout the latter part of this year. And of course there's going to be continued investment in terms of expanding account relationships. Because remember this plan is built on ARPA growth, not ARPU growth, ARPU is still confident in less than 1% dilution given all the tailwinds there. And the other part that also is an impact here is business. And you heard about the success in business, business enterprise and government larger account sizes. So you typically see that coming in at a lower ARPU than the average consumer, but also tremendously valuable customer relationships there. So, very happy there. In terms of Un-carrier, I wish I could just maybe I'll Twitter you out exactly what we're going to do from an Un-carrier perspective and when it's coming. But the one thing that's true from this team, maniacal focus on profitable growth, but never losing that entrepreneurial spirit that we have. So there is more on the horizon. I'm sure when it comes to Un-carrier moves. We are not done solving the pain points in this industry, ordinary industries like home broadband. So really appreciate it, Mike. Thank you. And I think, probably with that, we'll have to, at this point, conclude the call. So, thank you everybody for tuning in. It's just an amazing set of results, again, another beat and race quarter for T-Mobile. And we're just very optimistic about where we're going. And very glad that you could spend the time with us. So [Technical Difficulty]. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the T-Mobile US second quarter 2021 earnings call. If you have any further questions you may contact the Investor Relations or Media departments. Thank you for your participation, you may now disconnect and have a pleasant day.",

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jud Henry, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations for T-Mobile US. Please go ahead, sir. Jud Henry : All right. Welcome to T-Mobile's Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. Joining me on the call today are Michael Sievert, our President and CEO; Peter Osvaldik, our CFO, as well as other members of the senior leadership team. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements that contain a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. We provide a comprehensive list of risk factors in our SEC filings, which I encourage you to review.  Our earnings release Investor Fact Book and other documents related to our Q3 results, as well as reconciliations between our GAAP and non-GAAP results discussed on this call can be found on the quarterly results section of the Investor Relations website. I\u2019d like to remind everyone that historical results prior to the second quarter of 2020, represents standalone T-Mobile prior to the merger with Sprint. I would also like to note, that we are now in the quiet period for auction 110 and will not comment on that today. With that, let me now turn it over to Mike. Michael Sievert : Thanks, Jud. Hi, everybody, it's so great to be here to share this quarter's results with you, and as you might have noticed, we are entering the home stretch for 2021, and our team, is feeling more confident than ever. We've exceeded not only Wall Street expectations, but even our own targets at this stage of our integration journey in terms of customer growth, profitability, and synergies. And with that success, we are once again increasing our guidance expectations, across the board today.  The un -carrier is about solving pain points. And you may remember that when we closed our merger last year, we said that our combined assets meant that we would end the biggest pain point of all, that age-old problem of having to choose between the best network and the best value. We said we'd be in a unique position as the new un -carrier, with our unique assets and financial position in the 5G era to end that trade-off and deliver both. Well, let me tell you, this differentiated playbook that has never been done before in wireless is already contributing to our results, and creating market-leading profitable growth where it counts in top-line postpaid customers and revenues, and in cash flows at the bottom line. Only T-Mobile provides the best value proposition, with truly unlimited plans, fairly priced on the best 5G network and with award-winning service.  This combination is differentiating our model from the other guys and uniquely positioning T-Mobile in significant ways that have long-term implications. In Q3, we led the industry in postpaid net adds and postpaid service revenue growth. Again, just as we've done every quarter since we closed the merger, we also led the industry in core EBITDA growth and free cash flow growth. Let's talk about a few of the highlights that are driving all of this growth. Smaller markets and rural areas are already contributing about one-third of our new accounts, and brand equities are up across the board. And we're still in the very early innings of our distribution expansion and ultra-capacity build-out in smaller markets. In enterprise, we delivered our highest ever gross adds and net adds because organizations really understand our 5G leadership better than anyone.  For 5G high-speed Internet, we delivered our highest-ever net adds in Q3, more than Tableau (ph) Verizon, and two-thirds of our net adds came from urban and suburban markets. In other words, cable territory. All right. Coming back to my point on how T-Mobile is uniquely positioned in our industry, I understand that many of you have raised questions about the promotional environment and also about the source and sustainability of recent industry growth. And some have actually question whether 5G really matters to consumers.  While I do believe this is a healthy and growing industry, I understand that the actions of some of our peers may have soured sentiment on our category for some. So today, I'm purposely focused on addressing these perceptions head-on and sharing my view of how our approach and competitive position is differentiated, both for customers and for T-Mobile's business. The first question I'm sure it's top of mind, is the promotional intensity in this industry. Listen, as I've said before, at T-Mobile, we actually like healthy competition. Because we historically win, when customers start shopping around, our competitors are leaning into device offers. And while I can't really explain what they're up to, I can't imagine it's out of abject fear that were coming to take all their customers, because they don't have compelling pricing or a competitive 5G network or significant under-penetrated growth factors like T-Mobile has, so they are trying to temporarily buy-down churn while they sell off assets and come up with a plan. In contrast, our competitive push into device offers is strategic. Listen, we have a once in a decade opportunity to leap ahead and stay ahead of everyone else as customers embrace 5G.  We're years ahead on 5G, as you know, and we're positioned to stay ahead. And we're, therefore, incented to get people on 5G so they can experience that advantage. Every time we upgrade a customer from 4G to 5G, we take them from a device that works similarly on all three big networks, to a device that works way, way better at T-Mobile. And secondly, we are laser-focused on completing our merger integration ahead of schedule. This is huge because of the significant churn opportunity that we have, which is why we're putting device offers in place to bring Sprint customers to T-Mobile as quickly as possible. And unlike some, we generally pay for all of this in our P&L as we go along. Meanwhile, AT&T and Verizon are running expensive promotions to put 5G devices in their customers' hands even though they are unlikely to find a much faster 5G signal or notice a difference in speeds most of the time.  In fact, every time they upgrade a customer from a 4G device to a 5G device, they're playing right into our strength and spending a fortune to do it. And in AT&T 's case, racking up billions of dollars of future impacts on their Balance Sheet. How do their customers feel when they take that shiny new 5G phone home, only to realize that most of the time it works just like their 4G phone. At T-Mobile, those devices work demonstrably better, with ultra capacity 5G reaching more than half the country today, rocking speeds of 400 megabits per second on average. Every one of those competitive customers being upgraded to 5G, at great expense, is a potential future T-Mobile customer. The second question is around the source and sustainability of recent customer growth in the industry. This one would be easier to answer if everyone in our industry was as transparent as T-Mobile such as disclosing accounts or what adjustments are being made, etc.  What I do know is that T-Mobile has a diversified growth opportunity in underpenetrated and new markets that's unmatched in this industry. One way to cut to the chase is to look at accounts instead of lines. Our postpaid net new accounts in Q3 doubled year-over-year with our highest Q3 account growth in 7 years, even while in the thick of our integration. We're up more than 1 million net new accounts year-over-year. We did this while Verizon had no account growth year-over-year, and AT&T didn't disclose accounts. And what's more, we see significant opportunities ahead, in smaller markets and rural areas. We're leading America into the 5G era, as we march toward covering 300 million people, with ultra capacity 5G by the end of 2023, a time by which others only aspire to cover a 175 million to 200 million people. The difference in geographic coverage between 200 million and 300 million people is huge, roughly 5 times the land area, giving us a big competitive advantage in smaller markets and rural areas. Listen, as the Un -carrier in smaller markets, we are combining a suddenly much stronger network with disruptive value and the best customer service. Does that sound familiar? It should. Newly competitive network combined with disruptive value and customer experience. That's exactly the Un -carrier playbook we ran over the last few years in the tab markets. We're bringing the same playbook to smaller markets and rural areas that took us from number 4 to number 1 in the major metros, except in the smaller markets, we're not just bringing a competitive network.  Our goal is to bring a superior one, anchored by our advantage in 5G. And let's not forget that in major markets, we have room to run. We're not just defending our castle. We got to our current leadership position without being perceived as having a network advantage. Now, we have the opportunity to appeal to millions more customers in the larger markets as well, who shop primarily on network, reach, speed, and capacity. In enterprise and government markets, another big opportunity where our 5G leadership has already opening new doors. We've already seen an increase in our win share for traditional postpaid services, and we're well-positioned to capture advanced 5G services with the widest built-out 5G network and the only standalone 5G core, which is exactly why many large enterprises are in active trials with T-Mobile for advanced capabilities like mobile edge compute and private networks. And let me remind you, that these advanced 5G services represent upside to our plan. Bottom line, our competitors are broadly distributed today. They're already in smaller markets in rural areas and they already have outsized share in enterprise.  And they're overpriced with little 5G to show for it, making it tough for them to defend their flanks when we come in with a better network and a better value. I say all this, not to bash anybody, but to make it clear that as competition heats up, you shouldn't paint us all with the same brush. T-Mobile is executing and demonstrating that these profitable growth opportunities are real and they are differentiated. As part of that industry growth debate, I hear misperceptions out there that T-Mobile's growth has slowed relative to our pre -merger momentum.  And I'd love to set the record straight on this one. What we look out proudly is our Magenta performance as a signal of our future success. We delivered our highest ever postpaid phone net adds on the Magenta brand, year-to-date through Q3. Our highest ever in Company history happening now. This year, even after normalizing for Sprint transfers into Magenta, the uncarrier strategy is in full force and we're competing smartly, and the result is high quality, profitable, industry-leading growth.  With our Magenta business firing on all cylinders, we're also working rapidly through the integration of the higher churning Sprint base. Just to put this in perspective, if the Sprint base had the same churn as our Magenta base, our phone net adds in Q3 would've been about 1.2 million way ahead of anyone else in the industry. That shows you the potential future tailwind to our growth engine as we work to get Sprint churn down to Magenta churn levels. And it reinforces that our gross adds flows are right where we want them to be, at least for this point in our journey.  While others are temporarily benefiting from elevated Sprint churn today, we're working to make that very short-lived. With over 1/2 of Sprint customers, at least partly migrated, we continue to execute our playbook to finish the integration in a compressed time frame. Which does have temporary impacts, but brings forward the time frames when both the customer experience and our business results, have the benefit of integration being behind us. I'm so proud of how the team is executing to get all this done way ahead of schedule. And we're particularly encouraged by what we see from Sprint customers, that have made the full migration to the T-Mobile value proposition.  As they already have churn on par with Magenta customers. Changing gears. I've seen some media articles and analysts notes commenting on how consumers should be indifferent between 5G and 4G, given the limited availability and similar performance. While they're absolutely right when they look at AT&T and Verizon. Those companies have much more geographically distributed customer bases and only a small percentage of their customers are seeing big benefits from 5G, and nor are a high percentage of them likely to see a benefit from their early C-band deployments.  At T-Mobile, 5G is a distinct differentiator. Here's a fun fact for you, over 75% of T-Mobile 5G customers are within our ultracapaciy 5G coverage area that now reaches 190 people. Well, over half of the country, enjoying blazing fast speeds of around 10 times faster than 4G. Ask AT&T and Verizon what percentage of their customer bases are in the footprint of their fastest 5G. And at T-Mobile -- and T-Mobile's 5G leadership is beginning to really matter to customers. We see this demonstrated in several areas.  The first area where we see our network leadership resonating is in perception metrics among non-customers, or in other words, potential future customers. According to our pulling, perception for overall network reliability has increased over 20% year-over-year and is now higher than AT&T. Our recognition as the 5G leader among potential customers has increased over 80% from a year ago. 80%, matching Verizon, while Verizon scores are flat to down, and we scored three times higher than AT&T. Potential customers are taking notice of our lead.  The second aspect is the adoption of Magenta MAX, the best plan on the best 5G network. Take rates continue to exceed our expectations, and we now see more of that half of new customers choosing MAX. The engagement that we have seen just reinforces our belief that the 5G smartphone is the first killer app of the 5G era. From video calling, which has taken off as a primary means of communication, to TikTok and mixed reality and emerging metaverse applications, T-Mobile's network is unlocking a differentiated smartphone experience in this industry today.  We see this not only in the take rates that I mentioned, but also in the way that customers are taking advantage of this differentiated experience using 35 gigabytes a month on average when pairing Magenta MAX with a 5G smartphone. 35 gigs a month all ready, that's roughly tripled the average 4G usage in the industry and an experience that AT&T and Verizon will be hard pressed to support from a capacity perspective. And did you see those new offers from the cable guys? Cable is constructing 4G offers in a 5G world, and they will be challenged without wireless owner's economics. Never mind the fact that they are on the smallest 5G network, Verizon. They already automatically throttle anyone using more than 20 gigs and they are quite limited, so-called unlimited plan today. That might barely cut it with some consumers for a very short time, but not where this industry is quickly going. And the final question I want to address is around the quality of earnings in this industry. Sure, there are geography differences and some maybe aren't reflecting the full magnitude of their promotional spending in their EBITDA. at the end of the day cash is key.  And real value creation should be measured by the conversion of service revenues into free cash flow. T-Mobile has unmatched potential, because of our industry-leading growth and synergy back to model. And we've guided to deliver a significant CAGR of 45% from 2021 to 2024. From our perspective, the current market valuation of our Company based on our guided free cash flow, would suggest that there is significant potential shareholder value not yet reflected. Before I wrap up, I do want to comment on the cyber-attack we experienced last quarter. As we previously reported and updated in our filings today, we promptly located and closed to the unauthorized access to our systems after becoming aware of this criminal cyber-attack against T-Mobile and our customers. And we conducted a forensic investigation, with the assistance of world leading cybersecurity experts.  That's now complete. We also undertook extensive efforts to support and protect our customers and to further enhance our cybersecurity practices throughout this process. Protecting our customer's data is a top priority for the Company, which is why we've taken a number of steps to respond to this incident. And I've created a Cyber Transformation Office, reporting directly to me, elevating our cybersecurity team in this work accordingly. We're further building a security forward mindset into our work and our culture, and we're partnering with the best and the brightest like Mandiant and KPMG to help us do it right.  Now, before I turn it over to Peter to take us through a few financial highlights and our outstanding guidance, I want to express how proud I am of this team. We executed another terrific quarter leading the industry and postpaid customer growth while delivering industry-leading growth in postpaid subscribers. postpaid service revenue, core adjusted EBITDA, and free cash flow. All while further extending our 5G network lead and increasing our expected merger synergies for the year. Overall, our strategy is absolutely working and we clearly have the best hand of cards to win in the years ahead. All right, Peter, over to you. Peter Osvaldik : All right. Thanks, Mike. As you can see, we delivered strong results yet again in Q3 as we executed our winning playbook and exceeded expectations across the board. Let's start by talking about growth, where we doubled our postpaid account net adds from a year ago, adding 268,000. And as Mike mentioned, that is the highest account net adds for Q3 in 7 years.  We also delivered industry-leading postpaid net adds of 1.3 million including 673,000 postpaid phone net adds. This growth contributed to our record service revenue, including industry-leading postpaid service revenue growth of 6% year-over-year.  And we were the only national provider to grow margins year-over-year. We delivered record high core adjusted EBITDA and our Forex increase on free cash flow from a year ago is just the beginning of our rapid free cash flow expansion journey, and the unlocking of significant shareholder value. I'm also extremely proud of the team as we continue to work with the rating agencies.  And in August, all 3 agencies upgraded us based on the Company's continued strong financial results and momentum with Fitch moving to an investment-grade corporate family rating. These upgrades will provide us with significant incremental flexibility to further optimize our capital structure. Let's talk about how this momentum impacts our outlook for 2021 with another beaten raise quarter.  We now expect total postpaid net additions to be between 5.1 and 5.3 million, reflecting continued profitable growth and prudent share-taking opportunities, from increased switching activity expected in Q4. Core adjusted EBITDA is now expected to be between $23.4 and $23.5 billion. Primarily driven by service revenue growth and higher merger synergies, which are now expected to be between $3.2 billion, as we continue our progress towards rapid synergy realization. We expect merger-related costs not included in core adjusted EBITDA to be between 2.8% and $3 billion before taxes. Net cash provided by operating activities including merger payments is now expected to be in the range of $13.9 billion to $14.0 billion. We expect cash capex to be between $12.1 billion and $12.3 billion as we continue the robust pace of our 5G deployment and network integration.  Together, this results in a free cash flow including payments for merger-related costs, increasing to between $5.5 billion and $5.6 billion and does not assume any material proceeds from securitization. Our Q3 effective tax rate was materially below our prior 2021 guide of 24% to 26% primarily due to state tax benefits associated with certain legal entity reorganizations. We expect our effective tax rate to be between 20% and 22% in Q4, which would put us at about a 15% to 17% rate for the full year.  One last guidance item that I'll note is that we now expect full-year postpaid phone ARPU to be relatively flat to the 47, 74 full-year rate in 2020. This is driven by the fact that Q4 ARPU is trending flat to Q3 as a result of benefits from continued Magenta MAX adoption amongst our customers and converting device insurance products for our Sprint customers to the equivalent Magenta products, which have higher revenue recorded and higher EBITDA contribution. Both of which are expected to offset the typical seasonal promotional ARPU impact in Q4.  And we expect full-year ARPA to be up more than $2 from last year, driven by our strategy to continuously expand our revenue within our account relationships. Before I wrap up, I'd like to come back to Mike's points on addressing questions out there. Some have questioned the real drivers of service revenue growth in the industry, which for some has been supported by grossing up third-party content and cable MVNO growth. At T-Mobile, our growth is primarily driven by our retail business, as evidenced by an industry bet, 6% growth in postpaid service revenue. And our content costs are treated as contra revenue. That's a reduction to our ARPU. And 1 final point around the quality of earnings in the industry. Several analysts have written about how AT&T has rung up over $4 billion of promotions on their Balance Sheet, and how pressure their ARPU and margins for years to come. However, I think the industry has been unfairly painted with a broad brush based on the actions of one player. At T-Mobile, we take most of our promotional expenses upfront with only a minimal amount amortized through the balance sheet. No point in kicking the can on expenses when you are a sustainable growth Company. Altogether, our strong momentum and execution enable us to continue to invest in our network and the business to deliver significant expansion in future free cash flow. We're on track with our plans to unlock value for our shareholders, potentially including substantial share repurchases ahead. And with that, I will now turn the call back over to Jud to begin Q&A. Jud? Jud Henry : All right. Let's get to your questions. [ Operator instructions] All right. We'll start with a question on the phone. Operator, first question, please. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our first question from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan. Michael Sievert : Hi, Phil. Phil Cusick : Hey, guys. Thanks. Appreciate it. Let's talk about the CDMA slowdown impact. I know you're thinking of planning to shut down LTE at the end of next year, anyway. How should we think about the CDMA a little bit delayed. And then second, can you just talk about the -- with everything going on in the base, whether it's Dish and AT&T and everything else, but your confidence in growing EBITDA by double digits next year. Is that a reasonable expectation for the industry? Thank you. Michael Sievert : Thanks, Phil. I'll start with the first one, and maybe hand it to Peter and he'll go ahead and guide you on '22, three months in advance. On CDMA, yeah, I think most of what we had to say was in our disclosure at the time. We've been in talks with all the other parties involved, including the Department of Justice. And following those talks, we just decided to take upon ourselves to voluntarily move that date out by 3 months and plan to sunset the CDMA network at the end of March.  And we did that after carefully looking at our own plans and determining that there wouldn't be a material impact from doing that to our outlook or our financials, our ability to deliver use synergies as expected. But we did want to make sure that everyone involved had the time that they needed to make sure that we meet the Department of Justice.  What I know is, is there\u2019s a goal in the public interest, which is to make sure that every single customer out there has the opportunity and is given the opportunity to switch to the superior network in time. Now, as we've said all along, we believe that December 31 provides that ample time, and we've given everybody involved well over a year way more notice than they needed. But when we look at the actual run rates, it looked to us like even at the current rates, an extra 3 months would be something that everyone would appreciate.  And so, I'd like our partners to be moving faster, they don't appear to be, and because we just took that voluntary action on our own. And we think this is based on everything we're seeing, we think this is all that would be necessary, and so that's something that we we\u2019re pleased to be able to do. As it relates to all the pros and cons and effects on EBITDA for next year, we're looking forward to an exciting '22, but I doubt Peter will give you a much on it, but I\u2019d hand to my friend Peter. Peter Osvaldik : Yeah. Phil, we'll certainly provide a full update and guide you as part of our year-end call. But let me give you a couple of points around how we think about '22. First, I know there's been questions around what's the potential impact of DISH, and I think we highlighted it well at our Q2 earnings call. DISH revenue is already under $2 billion in '21. And as we look about how the business momentum is continuing, we said that was always part of the plan.  Again, we took DISH on their word and always assumed that they would become a full facilities player, and during the duration of the LRP, that revenue would go away, and you heard us recommit and we're doing it again today around the \u201823 and the \u201926 service revenue guidance, given the underlying strength for the business. And so, that is probably the area where I'm most excited. I mean, you saw the results today, you've seen the net account additions and the real growth around not just postpaid phone but postpaid other.  One of the areas of the business that I would like to highlight for '22 is probably ARPU, and with the momentum that we've seen in our updated guide just now to be relatively flat full-year '21 to full-year '22, I see a path with Magenta MAX and the excitement there from our customer base to be less than 1% dilution in '22. And remember, that's off of a higher base in 2021, which is now going to be flat to 2020. The other area, I'd say is really where we're excited is free cash flow.  And you see what's happening are continually raising our guide this year as you look into the 10-Q you also see it's allowed us to take opportunity and do significant prepayments with certain vendors and generate flexibility and savings. And that working capital is already fully contemplated in our updated guide today. So, as we think about '22, I'm very excited about the opportunity for free cash flow. And as Mike said, that really is the ultimate expression of value creation in how you take that service revenue and translate it into cash flow. Jud Henry : Perfect, Phil. Phil Cusick : Thanks, Mike. Thanks, Pete. Jud Henry : Next question. Operator : Our next question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Brett Feldman : Thanks. Maybe just to start off with a follow-up question. Thank you for giving us some of that insight into next year. Why would postpaid ARPU still have dilution next year? The sequential trend has obviously been pretty positive as you've been moving customers into the MAX plan and you're deeper into the integration, so any other puts and takes that really just would play out over the next few quarters, would be appreciated.  And then the comment you made about how strong your phone net adds would've been if Sprint churn was aligned with legacy Magenta churn, implies you're losing a couple of a hundred thousand Sprint subs a quarter still at this stage in the integration with 90% of the Sprint customer traffic on the T-Mobile network and over half those customers having been moved over, what's your experience been with the point at which a Sprint customer takes on the characteristics of a legacy Magenta customer. In other words, at what point could we see a material positive inflection in the aggregate Sprint losses? Thank you. Michael Sievert : Terrific. I'll start with the second one and then maybe hand it to Peter on the first one, and I'll ask Jon if he has anything to add on the first one. On Sprint churn, listen we're really pleased with what we're seeing, but you have to bear in mind that what we're doing in this strategy is we're compressing integration into a tighter time frame, and that means that whatever Sprint churn is going to happen as a function of integration is going to happen in a shorter period of time and affect the integration periods to a greater extent. And our Sprint customers are showing us a tremendous number of patients as we give them a much better 5G network experience and get them migrated over. But still as anybody who follows this industry knows, when you have an integration during that period of integration, there can be puts and takes for customers. And we're trying to do our best to give every customer a great experience. As it relates to what we're seeing, when somebody comes across from Sprint to Magenta in what we call a full migration, and there aren't that many that have a full migration yet. So, there could be some selection bias here.  That means you're fully on the T-Mobile network. You're fully on the T-Mobile biller. You're engaged with the T-Mobile brand. You've moved to T-Mobile tax inclusive rate plans and you're experiencing T-Mobile team of expert service. So, where we're going? Where we're going very quickly for everyone. Those customers that have come all the way across are showing so far this about the same churn profile as Magenta customers, and that's very exciting because Magenta is on par with anybody out there and many time periods has been the best in the industry. So that's really promising.  Now, I think while we have the opportunity because we're compressing the time frames and we're only seeing somewhat elevated churn to actually come through this integration with less overall losses than we would have expected from the Sprint side, because it's happening during a compressed time frame. We are very pleased with those trends and we're -- you'll see us in our actions with things like our Sprint forward initiative and things like our device offers moving to get Sprint customers the handsets they need, particularly 600 megahertz compatible handsets, as well as everything else they need to take full advantage of their Magenta network.  And before we go on to ARPU, I know John, if you'd like to add anything to what you're seeing and what your team is seeing with Sprint customers because it's one of the most important questions I think we'll talk about today. Because as you saw, the underlying Magenta performance is unbelievably great and we just have to get through the synergy. What are you seeing, John? Jud Henry : Well Mike, you -- I think you hit on a number of things that we're seeing within our team here. And Mike, what you said is that we've got to make sure that we bring this full experience, and we've done this integration in the last 18 months in disparate parts, with rate plans for one, two, moving traffic and changing our SIM cards. But really bringing the full experience together, like Mike said, great T-Mobile, tax inclusive plans, 1, 2, having the latest and greatest devices with the full network capabilities associated with those licenses, namely 600 megahertz.  Because if you don't have a 600-megahertz device on the T-Mobile network, it's like the T-Mobile network from 2015, so it's really important that we do that. And then of course, the award-winning team of experts, customer experience, and bringing all that together, not being enough. Still in a Sprint application, you're logging the sprint.com, you're going through a Sprint app, moving the whole experience over to T-Mobile, that's the big on lot for us.  That's what we're really focused on. We've been putting a lot of effort and a lot of work starting in Q3 on moving the full accounts over and not doing that in discrete events, but we started that an earnest in Q3. We've seen great results from that, so far. When you take a look at the customers that we're porting out from Sprint and they were coming back in a T-Mobile, we've seen dramatic increases since we put a number of initiatives in place back in August of this year, and in Q3 and that we're still running so far in Q4.  I'm really pleased about that. We continue to be bullish, like Mike said. It's going to be a compressed overall timeframe during that. For any of you who -- I have been covering this business for a long time. Integration of migrations and those things are tough, are always a little bit painful and are always a little bit grilling, but as I take a look at my 27 years in this business in terms of how we've been handling, this migration and overall integration, I would say it's first-in-class and best-in-class.  We got a lot of work still to do in front of us, no question about that, but we're well on track to do what we need to do in 2022 and beyond. I hope you understand why we see Tailwinds ahead. Because obviously we're in the height of this integration right now. And we have a lot of work left to do. We have a lot of keeps sites that need to come over on the Magenta side still that there's still on the Sprint side. We have a lot of handset migrations to do so, people can take full advantage of that destination network. And we have lots of migrations that we need to do on customer service, on rate plans, on the full picture. A lot of work ahead and -- but our goal is to get it all done at least a year ahead of schedule. We're very focused on that and you've seen us show up each time with updates telling you we're going faster than expected. Brett, the second part of your question, I can roughly paraphrase as -- Peter, you promised us negative 1% ARPU this year, and we're going to pull into the station sounds like with flat ARPU after all. So why isn't that going to happen again next year? Peter Osvaldik : Absolutely. Brett. Let me -- as you know, right? Underpinned assumption under the LRP was 1% dilution year-over-year through the end of 2023 because the plan was really always focused on how do you get account growth and how do you expand those relationships and have ARPA growth. So, as we look forward to next year, there's a number of things that could impact, and certainly we talked about the great momentum from Magenta MAX and other value-add services that will be a tailwind to ARPU.  But as you think about some of the growth opportunity areas for you, and I'll give you one example which would be large enterprise in government, where our actual phone ARPU maybe lower than our blended base, and so you're going into a new account relationship and enterprise or government where that might be ARPU dilutive, but certainly a very strong ARPA type of relationship.  And typically, you also see a lot of the postpaid other, the other connected devices where in many cases, the CLV amongst those are much stronger than the phone business in and of itself. So that's one area where you could see ARPU dilution and yet tremendously value accretive to T-Mobile from a whole account relationship. So, I'm not going to give you all the puts and takes. You got to let you leave me something to guide you on at year-end earnings instead of Q3. But certainly, great momentum and again, focused on ARPA expansion throughout the course of this plan. Brett Feldman : That's great. Thank you. Jud Henry : Okay. Brett. Okay, operator, we'll get back to the phone and then just to prepare the team, if you can call out one or two, you see on the Twitter feed that be great, we'll do that after this next one. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson. Craig Moffett : Hi. Two questions for you, if I could. One, now, that we've seen your numbers and everybody else's, the industry growth rate is now pushing even higher to a total phone subscription, prepaid and postpaid combined, to almost 3%. So now, what 7 times population, I wonder if you could just talk about what you're seeing there.  Is that [Indiscernible] or what is making the industry grow the way it is? And then second, there's been a lot of talk about convergence from your competitors about what they can do with fiber and their wireless plans. I wonder if you could just talk about how you see the role of combined offers of wireless and wireline and whether you think that that or fixed wireless and whether you think that's critical to be competitive. Michael Sievert : Terrific, well I'll start with the first one. I don't think we have all the answers as to what's driving account growth or line growth over at all of our competitors and you don't see quite the same amount of transparency. It's one of the reasons why we decided to start talking much more about accounts and about ARPA because there's no ambiguity in that. Our 268,000 net new accounts relationships on the postpaid side was the largest in 7 years for a Q3. And you see ARPA rising and so it shows you the quality of that business. One of the things we didn't talk about is that our prime percentage is up several points from a year ago. I mean we're getting more and more prime, not surprisingly, because we have a better and better network. So, attract -- where it's starting to attract to higher levels the best customers in the industry.  And so, for us, it's not some of the things that you might expect. It's not EBB because we have no material EBB in our numbers. Generally, that program is over on our lifelines side, which isn't in our subscriber goals, but is for our competitors in to a certain extent. It's not due to subprime, it might be for our competitors, but our prime mix continues to improve.  It\u2019s not due to some weirdness of lines underneath the accounts because you see account growth and ARPA growth, very healthy. And you see that flowing through to industry-leading postpaid EBITDA growth, as well as industry-leading cash flow growth. And so, look, I don't know how sustainable it is. Prepaid is about flat, so there's certainly been some amount of transference there from what you would've expected to be an organic rate.  I don't know how sustainable it is. But what investors should ask themselves is if it doesn't become sustainable, who's going to win? and who has a reliable ongoing strategy that will be able to deliver growth in all the different time periods? And look, for us, we have a strategy and a set of assets. It's going after majorly under-penetrated segments, like small markets in rural areas which are 40% of the country. Like enterprise, like home broadband, your second question. These are huge places where we don't play and the other guys do.  And so that -- between that and our massive lead in 5G, we're 2 years ahead on the 5G race and I'm here to tell you that in 2 years from now we'll be 2 years or more ahead in the 5G race. And that's going to translate as well to opportunity for us. And so, look, I think there is some amount of temporary that's happening with the other guys. They're feeding to a small extent on our integration driven Sprint churn, investors will have to ask themselves whether you believe that's going to be very short-lived and not only not be a tailwind for them anymore, but will turn around.  We'll see how that goes, but we're really pleased with where things are going and what's the underlying trends. Now your second question is about convergence and about home broadband. First, I want to talk about how we're doing as being a multi category player with our push into home broadband and then maybe we can talk about the question on fiber, etc. Peter Osvaldik : So, question on convergence is, we'll have to see. But one thing we do know is that consumers are beginning to realize that there are choices. And they aren't having to put up with what they get today. What we're seeing is that while there are a lot of places, there are very limited choices in terms of what their cable or fiber offering are, and those offerings are typically very punitive.  They start out with promotions, they explode those, they end up paying very, very high prices, fees for modems, the other taxes, other charges that customers don't like. What's translating for us in that is that we're seeing customers, the majority of our customers, are not only coming as Mike mentioned, from urban and suburban areas, but they're also coming from cable and fiber providers. And why is that? Well, a big part of that is customers want a good product and a great price, and that's what they're getting with our products. And so, we're seeing people come in and say, this is a product that actually works. And you know what, I'm paying an amount that doesn't explode, I'm paying a very fair amount, and I don't have to be extremely irritated about having my existing cable companies gouge me on these things.  And so, for us, this has resulted in what we've seen is our highest net add quarter since we launched the product. And we see continued momentum from people coming from cable fiber. And quite frankly, even other sources, DSL, satellite, etc., and rural markets. So as our 5G ultra capacity network gets built, more and more, we're going to continue to follow that and begin giving more and more customers choice. We're still very excited about this product. Michael Sievert : Perfect. Okay. Well, let's go -- Jud, let's see what's on Twitter and then we'll come back to the phones after that. Jud Henry : Sounds good. We've got a great question here. Can you talk about potential enterprise 5G use case opportunities? Michael Sievert : Let's go right to my [Indiscernible] Peter Osvaldik : Yeah. Perfect. Well, as Mike talked about the beginning, let's not forget that the first big 5 -- killer 5G use case is core connectivity, smartphones, tablets, and other connected devices, and I'm really proud to say that we have seen our win rate continue to improve in that area, and our win rate is trending well above what our market share is, and continuing to improve like we saw in Q3.  And that's resulting in huge growth. If you just look at what's happened over the course of the last 2 years from 2020 to now, our growth in core connectivity is more than 50% better than Verizon 's. in the business space. So, we're seeing that the correlation of us as T-Mobile emerging as the 5G leader correlate with this big growth in core connectivity in business. But your question around these additional 5G use cases.  One of the things that we talked a little bit about in last earnings is we're involved in multiple trials with enterprise and government customers. And we think we're really well-positioned to bring these new enterprise advanced network services to market because of the way that we've delivered our 5G network. Mike has talked a lot about the scale of our network covering a 190 million people with our ultra -- our mid-band 5G network.  But we also have some other key features that we've built our 5G network around that are really positioning us well to differentiate on these 5G use cases, like the fact that we've got a dedicated 5G network core. So, our 5G traffic isn't running through our 4G network first. It's -- we have a dedicated network core that's delivering better performance for customer and customer applications. And also gives us the ability to bring really cool features to market like network slicing that we think is going to be a big opportunity for us with enterprise and government customers in the future.  We have a highly distributed network of data centers so we can help customers process data closer to their application on average than our competitors can. And so, we've got a number of these trials going with customers right now. And these are big, even though you don't see us doing press releases every single week about this, we have big customers with big significant use cases like for instance, we're working with one of the largest airlines in America right now on a mobile edge use-case application that allows them to process data faster, under-weighing, and improve their on-ground operations at one of their major hubs.  We're working with one of the largest U.S auto OEMs to help support a bunch of self-driving use cases and autonomous fleet that they're building. So, we're working with some of the biggest companies in the world helping co-innovate these solutions with them. And we think we're really well positioned because of the engineering decisions that Neville, and his team made to differentiate on these advanced 5G network use cases for our enterprise and business customers going forward. Jud Henry : Terrific. Operator, let's go back to the thump. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Jonathan Chaplin of New Street Research. Jonathan Chaplin : Thanks, guys. Mike, your SOGA is the lowest it's been in the third quarter since you guys close the merger. And I understand that sort really a flare -- I stare measure based, given that you guys said earlier in the year on the second quarter call, that you're really saving your dry powder for the period of the year where switching is going to be high, presumably that's now -- and so I'm wondering if you can give us some insights into what you think has happened to your share of decisions since the iPhone and launched in September? Michael Sievert : Yes, one of the things that we've talked about, and I think you heard in Peter's earlier remarks, is that after listen, we did see to the first question and impact from the data breach that happened in August, and there was a muted effect there because of that, I was quoted early in the Fourth Quarter saying that we finished much stronger and we were seeing nice trends as we entered the Fourth Quarter. And that shows that this was while a big event and something were very-very sorry happened. Something that customers have generally prepared themselves to move on from. And so that's good.  On the other hand, look, our model, one of the things I pointed out was that if you were to normalize our churn and look at what it may look like after we are finished with this integration. And just for a minute, I don't know if it will look like this, but just for a minute to say, what if all of our churn was at the Magenta levels. Our net adds this quarter, with that SOGA figure you talked about, would've been 1.2 million on the postpaid phones side. By far the biggest in the category and outsized versus time periods in our history as well.  And it really shows you that SOGA level that we're getting is reliable, sustainable, and about where we want it for this point in our journey. What you don't see us doing, Jonathan, that you may see elsewhere is kind of knee-jerk reactions and lurches into unanticipated, very expensive promotions, etc. etc. With no strategic apparent linkage behind it. And we've got a plan we consistently deliver.  We -- in any given period, we can take more gross ad share, but we want to make sure that we're also delivering the industry-leading EBITDA growth, and industry-leading cash flow growth, and we're creating the wherewithal to make this a sustainable journey as we go penetrate all these underpenetrated segments that our competitors don't have. And that takes consistency and reliability rather than chasing that last couple of points of SOGA like the other guys are doing. And we're very pleased with this execution and we think investors ought to be too when. They look at the big picture. Jonathan Chaplin : Mike, f I can just quickly follow up on that. It also -- you guys have mentioned a couple of times how complex and an enormous the integration process is and how this integration is going far better than any integration of comparable scale ever in the industry at least that we've seen.  When you say that at this point in your journey you're happy with the circle that you've got, is it a function or just all of the complexity that needs to be managed in the business right now. And once you get through the integration, that's the churn benefits on the Sprint side aside, you'll have more management bandwidth and resources to focus on increasing the pace at which you take share. Is that maybe say focusing on [Indiscernible] right now just unfairly given the complexity in the business? Michael Sievert : I don't think it's about management bandwidth, but resources are certainly a relevant point. One of the things we're doing, as you see is we're spending heavily into this integration and outpacing our expectations on the timeframes for our costs to achieve plan. So that we can get this integration done more quickly. And we think that's by far the right strategy. The customers get the benefit sooner, the shareholders get the benefits sooner.  Probably the magnitude of the benefits is positively affected by the rate and pace. But during that sausage making, it takes a lot of resources and we want to be able to reliably deliver cash flows to you and down payments as we go along, I think asking the market for a giant leap of trust for us to plow deeply into our cash flow plan in a different way than you expected just because we're ahead on integration, that wouldn't be I think a great trade-off for us to ask investors to ride along with.  So, we're paying for this as we go, and we're delivering the amount of SOGA and investing accordingly in SOGA that allows us to deliver high quality, prime customers that deliver outpacing EBITDA and cash flow growth, even during the height of this integration. Which is something I'm very pleased about. But to your point, the underlying Magenta business, which is all we're going to have as we get into a major part of '23 is performing beautifully. And it shows you the power of this brand and that the un -carrier is in full force and effect. We are tackling the biggest pain point of all. That trade-off that people have always had to make between quality and price. We're delivering both, and they're noticing like never before. And those trends, I think bond (ph.) very well for us on the back side of this integration. Peter Osvaldik : And I would just add, Jonathan -- Jonathan Chaplin : Thanks, guys. Peter Osvaldik : -- I know you were thinking ahead to what happens post integration. And you've got to remember, we're delivering this SOGA while we're still expanding distribution and building the network around smaller markets in rural area. So, this is the SOGA that we're delivering before we're fully deployed the Un -carrier machine in 40% of the population. And when -- you heard Mike talk about just how differentiated that experience is going to be.  We're bringing everything that made us so successful to date, except doing it with a fully differentiated network experience that is just going to blow the other guy's away in that 100 million covered pops that is going to be a 4G, I don't know 5G experience relative to ultra capacity with T-Mobile, with all of the uncarrier goodness that comes from the last eight years bringing it there. So just that's another area as you look forward, as we bring this machine to that 40% of how it could impact SOGA. Jonathan Chaplin : That's a great point. Thanks Peter. Thanks, Mike. Peter Osvaldik : You bet. Jud Henry : Let's go to the next question, Operator. Operator : Thank you, we'll take our next question from John Hodulik of UBS. John Hodulik : Great. A couple of quick questions for you. First on cash EBITDA, it has been decelerating for the last few quarters, grew 4.5% this quarter, but the guidance for the year, so there's suggests growth of over 5%. I mean, first of all, is that the way to think of it that this is the bottom in terms of cash EBITDA growth. And then maybe the [Indiscernible] to it because I see him sitting over there by himself.  Do you guys have visibility in terms of the synergies coming through with the sprint network that it's a sort of linear growth from here in terms of the acceleration of cash EBITDA, as you pulled down that Sprint network. That's number one. And then, on fixed wireless, anything else you can tell us about the sub-based, maybe the size of the sub-base, [Indiscernible] -- I think you have that 500,000 subs by year-end target out there or anything about usage or how the networks performing in areas where you guys are selling fixed wireless service. Thanks. Michael Sievert : Okay. EBITDA, synergy pacing, and fixed wireless. So, Peter, let's start with you. Peter Osvaldik : Yeah. John, I think you're trying to tease out of me '22 core EBITDA. So good job, again. I think you know I'll revert back to all the comments about the business and how I see '22 shaping and the excitement around free cash flow. On the 2021 guide, yeah, you're absolutely right. There was another -- not only synergy increase as a result of the integration, but also the growth from the underlying business that's allowed us to increase yet again for a third quarter in a row, core adjusted EBITDA to between 20.34 and 20.35 billion.  So tremendously excited about how that continues to grow and of course the opportunity and momentum of the business as we look out into the 23 and 26 period of LRP. And maybe I'll hand it over to Neville to talk through decommissioning, but it's not linear in terms of how you achieve the synergies or as we spoken before, how you really achieve and when you record the merger-related cost. But next year is certainly a big year in terms of decommissioning and I'll let Neville talk about that. That sets us up for such a significant portion of the synergies as we decommission the sites. Neville? NevilleRay: Thanks, Peter. And I'm not on my own, John, I got hope as a whole team here, we're all in the room -- John Hodulik : It seems like you are a being ignored, [Indiscernible] NevilleRay: But very quickly on synergy and the developments and pipeline. We're already well into synergy development in, we made a good start in '20. We're making great progress in '21. As Peter just outlined, '22 is really our biggest year and it's not linear. Our goal is to substantially complete our decommissioning activity across the network inside 2022. So, we've made good progress to-date, but '22 is going to be our big year.  And unrealistically, it won't be linear during the year either, I mean things will certainly pick up and there will be a tail, a positive tail, as we move into the second half, but we're making great progress, and as we've always said, this integration, migration, decommissioning strategy is all based on building the network first and you've heard from almost everybody on the call today, the progress we're making in terms of building the capacity and scale and reach and breadth of this network is just super exciting.  We're ahead of our plan with in an arm's reach of a nationwide mid-band 5G ultra capacity network, really before the other guys, even get started. So, we're in a great place, and to the back half of your question, John, around how we performing in areas where [Indiscernible] was successfully growing in-home broadband products at a great rate. We're doing really well. The growth is strong.  There's huge demand for the product and the capacity that we can generate with this network is just phenomenal. that 200 million people by the end of the year that are covered with ultra capacity, we're targeting 100 megahertz of dedicated 5G spectrum across that footprint. That's more spectrum on mid-band and AT&T and Verizon will have available from C-band between them both. And so, the capacity and capability that we're generating is truly exciting, and a lot of growth for activism and great growth opportunities, including specifically in-home broadband product you referenced. Michael Sievert : Yeah. As for that, we didn't disclose lots of detail. I did tell you that we were running last quarter at twice the pace of Verizon, who had a three-year head start. We launched this out of beta early this year. And as well as this last quarter, the [Indiscernible] team delivered more net new home broadband customers on 5G than Verizon did on fiber and 5G combined.  Which kind of shows you that there's a lot of latent demand out there, and it also shows you the capacity of our 5G network and the kinds of things people are doing on that broadband. Hundreds of gigs a month on that 5G network, and of course we have that footprint now out there pretty widely available. So maybe now you could talk about what kind of feedback we're getting from customers. Peter Osvaldik : Yes, I know, thanks Mike. As Mike mentioned, we're seeing customers. One, we're seeing great uptake with the product. We're seeing customers use the product in several 100 gigs a month we also have many using many more and Neville's network is serving them just fine. We're -- what's great to see too is a lot of third-party recognition from like PC Magazine. And I think it's Readers\u2019 Choice -- Awards. They rated us higher than all the other cable companies and we even this last quarter, we had a record high NPS that we track internally...  Customers seem to be liking this very much and we -- initially we, at the beginning of the year, we said we aspire to be at 500,000 customers by the end of the year, we're well on track to do that. On our way to 7 million to 8 million customers by 2025, which I think we remind everyone that's only a couple of percentage points of the overall industry. This really big opportunity for us is really just a small penetration into the industry and gives us lots of opportunities, so off to a great start. I mean, it's not surprising that there's a lot of delight out there and I hope we can keep that up.  I think we will be able to, it looks like the usage while it rises is not rising as fast as our capacity, but look, we're solving problems for these customers. that's why there's so satisfied, we are either solving the problem of giving them a real viable high-speed choice where there wasn't one, and boy that would -- that change your life, or coming into a place where you're so frustrated by cable, and you want a decent deal and a fair price and a Company that will put you first and treat you right, so you can unplug that code. Jon Freier : That's a big problem solved to $50.00 for home broadband. The kind of home broadband we have like 5% or 6% of our customers using a terabyte a month. That's solving real problems for people so, not surprisingly, those net promoter scores are high. We're so excited about this business. Michael Sievert : Thanks John, let's go back to the Operator and then maybe they want to prepare us 1 more Jud from this big screen of Twitter feed. Operator : Thank you. The next question we have comes from Q - David Barden of Bank of America. David Barden : Hey, guys. Thanks so much for taking my questions. I guess, the first would be, I think Mike you talked about more than 50% of the customers are taking Magenta MAX at the margin. Obviously, Verizon need a kick through a lot of the opportunity to migrate metered to unlimited. I was wondering if you could share where Magenta MAX stands as a percentage of the base. And relative to the base, what kind of ARPU lift are you getting? And then the second question I have, if I could, is just related to, again, the Sprint network shutdown and its importance to the realization of synergies.  And Mike, some of your comments about how you sat down with all the interested parties related to the network shutdown and decided to extend the deadline to March 31st. In the blog post that went out, you said it would have no financial impact, at least if we went that far. Are we convinced that we're ready to just end this and begin to get the network shutdown and we're comfortable saying March 31st it's the last concession, we're making? Thanks. Michael Sievert : Let me start with the second one, Dave, and then we'll talk about Magenta MAX. We just don't see any cause for a further delay. And this getting people upgraded to the right side of the digital dividing, getting a high capacity 4G, 5G network in the hands of people who need it most as urgent it's certainly also important for our business.  And when we look at the run rates of upgrades and we study the run rates and the declining based on CDMA, all the curves pointed they just wouldn't be caused to delay it further. So, I wouldn't expect a further delay for that reason. I certainly wouldn't expect a further delay that would have any impact on our financials our ability to go execute the plan that we promised you, and nor does this one. We looked at it carefully.  We found a way to do this because we wanted to do the right thing for a partner that was asking us, even though we don't feel that they needed it, and we're pleased we were able to do it. And we are pleased we were able to be responsive to our conversations with the Department of Justice to do this on a voluntary basis, so no, we just don't see that there would be cause to delay it further, and then back to Magenta MAX, no, I can't give you too much on the base here, it's all very competitively sensitive. But the premise of your question is really interesting, which is the other guys might be starting to exhaust their opportunities.  Man, we're just getting started. The base, there's lots of room to run in the base and this is the very best expression of the best 5G network in the market. And no wonder, it's popular. When people have been able to get amazing handset deals by signing up for this plan, and that's been a catalyst. They're using 35 gigs a month. What we think is on its way to 80 gigs a month that this network will be able to handle, no problem. And that shows you -- the Magenta MAX experience shows you, as Mike said a little while ago, that the smartphone is the first killer app of 5G.  We see huge usage in video, and social media growth, and mobile hotspot growth. Our Magenta MAX customers don't walk into a building and look around for the Wi - Fi signal and ask you for the Wi - Fi password. They provide the Wi - Fi, and that's where this world's going. So, we're so excited about what we're seeing, but can't really parse it too much other than I agree with the premise of your question which is, do we have room to run on the base here? Yes, we do. David Barden : Thanks, Mike, really appreciate it. Peter Osvaldik : If you put that 35 gigs into context on Magenta MAX, that's three times the industry on what you're seeing in 4G LTE. It's just incredible in terms of the consumption on Magenta MAX when you compare with the industry's best in leading 5G network.  It certainly helps to put cable competition into perspective. As I talked about in my prepared remarks, you see \"unlimited offers\" that throttle you. We're not talking about prioritization if the network is busy, we are talking about you throttled after 20 gigs.  First of all, why are you calling that an unlimited plan. And second of all, that's a 4G plan in a 5G world. And with where we're going, I don't know where they go. I don't think that they're going to be able to have the owner's economics in wireless to truly compete on value on the wireless side. And I don't think that AT&T and Verizon have the wherewithal or the plans to compete with us on the quality of the 5G network that we're building. and so, we really like the hand of cards for that reason strategically. David Barden : Thank you, guys. Peter Osvaldik : Thanks, Dave. Do we want to go one more on the -- did you find? Jud Henry : Yes, we've got a quick one here from Bill Ho. So, he asked with the recent Best Buy and Walmart distribution relationships, what's the view on these channels driving 4Q '21 and the future years growth relative to the past. John on if you want to hit on that quickly and something announcements recently on that distribution front? Jon Freier : You bet, we're so excited about this. You made a couple of announcements just in the last 30 days, 45 days or so where we have -- Peter Osvaldik : we're going to be expanding our T-Mobile and Metro by T-Mobile products. Not [Indiscernible] we have expanded them into Walmart and across 2,300 stores on Walmart and a lot of those in smaller markets and rural areas, of course. And then also have launched T-Mobile and Best Buy across 900 stores. We're incredibly excited about this. I think when you look at what Walmart has done and what Best Buy has done in the pandemic and how they have completely revolutionized their particular companies. Walmart is the place to go shop in rural America. It is incredible what Walmart has done digital transformation and then when you look at Best Buy as a premier consumer electronics retailer across the U.S, those are attractive opportunities for us. Peter Osvaldik : You've got to remember too is that we haven't really played in national retail in these large national retailers in a very long time. As matter of fact, just in the last quarter, we quadrupled with these announcements, our number of national retail locations. So, we see those as big opportunities for our Company to be in the customer basis of Walmart and in Best Buy and see significant switching opportunities in those spaces as well. So, we're very attracted to what Walmart is doing, what Best Buy is doing.  Clearly, they are attracted to the industry's best 5G network and all of the opportunity that our Company represents over the next several years. So, we're very bullish on that. I don't have numbers exactly by channel to give you in Q4 or the years beyond. But I'll just tell you that we're very bullish about these opportunities. We've got great strategic relationships with Walmart and Best Buy, we've been engaged in a lot of conversations over the last several months, and we're very excited about the future and very confident in our approach there. Michael Sievert : Well, terrific. I'm going to wrap it up here in a second. First of all, I want to thank you for all these great questions and I know we gave you some long answers and so apologies to the people that might have been in the queue we didn't get to. We are always available to you. I know Jud and team are anxious to talk to you and answer questions in an FD-compliant way, following this meeting. But I really like the kind of questions that we had.  And as you noticed, I prepared my remarks to try to address what I see is some of the big questions out there about our sector and we get a lot of people saying, man, is it getting competitive? What's going on? Are you guys still the growth leader? And the answer to that is an emphatic yes, we like it competitive. We execute incredibly well when it's competitive.  And the question for investors is, who has the situation and the hand of cards and the assets and the team to sustainably deliver in a competitive marketplace with room to run. And that's what we were hoping to address in a high-quality way today, and your questions gave us those opportunities to address some of those topics. So, we appreciate you. Thanks for tuning. And Jud, anything final? Jud Henry : No. Just again, thank you, everybody for your time. If you have any follow-up questions, please reach out to Investor Relations or Media Relations and we're happy to follow up. Thank you again. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's T-Mobile Third Quarter Earnings Call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect, and have a pleasant day.",

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jud Henry, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations for T-Mobile US. Please go ahead, sir. Jud Henry : All right. Welcome to the T-Mobile Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2021 Earnings Call. Joining me on the call today is Mike Sievert, our President and CEO; Peter Osvaldik, our CFO; as well as other members of the senior leadership team. During this call, we'll make forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. It may cause \u2013 forward-looking or may cause actual results to differ materially, which we have in our SEC filings and I encourage you to review. Our earnings release, investor fact book and other documents related to our Q4 and full year results as well as reconciliations between our GAAP and non-GAAP metrics are all available on the Quarterly Results section of the Investor Relations website. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Mike. Mike Sievert : Okay. Thanks, Jud. Well, my buddy and I here are excited to be here today to discuss another remarkable year at T-Mobile. We shared with you a year ago that 2021 would be a foundational year for us as a merged company, a year in which we set bold goals for ourselves in terms of customer growth, profitability, network leadership and merger integration. Well, we not only exceeded our own targets, but also Wall Street's expectations. We are experiencing the greatest growth momentum in our history, setting record customer growth and service revenue growth, all because of the important investments we've made and will continue to make in our network leadership and in underpenetrated markets. This momentum sets us up for a very strong 2022 with plans to deliver another year of industry-leading postpaid growth, 10% in core adjusted EBITDA and over 30% growth in free cash flow at the midpoint of our guidance. We have big aspirations for this year, as Peter will explain more about in a minute. Our historic network build is a driving force behind our growth opportunity and it's central to unlocking our merger synergies. For the second year in a row, we set an audacious goal for Neville and the technology team, and they crushed it yet again. We set our sights on getting ultra capacity 5G to 200 million people and the team blew right past that goal, reaching 210 million in 2021. This is no small feat when you consider that it takes roughly 3x the number of cell site upgrades to get from 100 million to 200 million. And that gives you a sense of the challenge that AT&T and Verizon have ahead of them. Once they woke up to our 5G lead and differentiation, they finally began lighting up mid-band 5G POPs, but still only tens of millions compared to our hundreds of millions. According to their own build plan, it will take them multiple years to reach 200 million people, and they still won't be anywhere near the depth of mid-band spectrum that we're putting to work across our larger footprint. This demonstrates the remarkable deployment machine that we have spent years building and how hard it is to replicate. And don't forget our extended-range 5G reached 94% of all Americans at the end of 2021 with speeds double that of typical LTE. This reinforces the importance of not just having the best spectrum portfolio, but how quickly T-Mobile puts spectrum to work for the benefit of consumers and businesses. We continue to add to our mid-band portfolio with our recent purchase in Auction 110. Once again, our prudent and opportunistic approach meant that we concentrated on supplementing our mid-band spectrum holdings in major urban and suburban areas, mostly aligned with our C-band purchases and importantly in places where these frequencies are well suited to the density of our network grid. That means we'll be able to deliver meaningful customer benefit with very little network capital and OpEx using existing towers, thanks to our completed agreements with American Tower and Crown Castle and we're not slowing down. We continue to extend our year's long 5G lead on the competition, and independent network experts continue to recognize this. More than 20 reports from third-party testing firms in the last year confirmed T-Mobile is tops in 5G speeding coverage. In Ookla's latest testing, T-Mobile delivered a clean suite of every category and we're not just talking about individual 5G category wins like speed and availability. This is important. T-Mobile also won for overall network performance meaning customers have a winning experience on the T-Mobile network period. Opensignal's new report published last week states that T-Mobile customers enjoy the fastest 5G speeds and can connect to 5G more often and in more places than anyone else. And the gap has only gotten wider as we keep increasing our speeds and reach. Meanwhile, AT&T somehow managed to see their 5G speeds get slower year-over-year with an LTE like 49 megabits per second. Okay. Let's talk about our industry-leading growth. Last year, we posted the best growth in our company's history. Across the entire span of our years' long Un-carrier journey, our best postpaid net add growth ever was in 2021. Our Magenta brand momentum is just incredible. And we added 1.2 million postpaid account net adds, doubling 2020's adds, the highest reported in the industry yet again. This measure of total billing relationships is the best barometer of winning the switching decisions in the industry, something we're famous for as the Un-carrier. And our highest-ever postpaid net adds were 5.5 million, leading the industry for the seventh consecutive year and exceeding the guidance that we raised again just last quarter. And our 2.9 million postpaid phone net adds were up 32% from last year, even during our accelerated Sprint customer integration. Thanks to the strength of our Magenta brand, we're delivering at best-ever levels. Our Magenta postpaid phone churn in 2021 was the lowest in the industry for the second year in a row. We exited the year with great momentum as well. In Q4, we not only had the highest phone gross adds in the industry, but also the highest in our history. This last quarter, interesting fact, our Magenta postpaid porting ratio was above 1.5x in Q4, and we're seeing those ratios trend even higher against AT&T and Verizon so far in Q1, while seeing our overall phone churn so far in Q1 move down seasonally just as expected. And to put this underlying momentum into perspective, if the Sprint churn was the same as the Magenta churn, postpaid phone net adds in Q4 would have been closer to 1.4 million and would represent the highest quarterly postpaid phone net adds in our history. And I couldn't be more excited about high-speed Internet, where T-Mobile was the fastest-growing broadband provider in the industry in Q4. Let me say that again. In Q4, T-Mobile, and not Comcast, not Charter or AT&T or Verizon, posted the most broadband net adds in the industry, and we're just getting started. And mobile customers are taking our Magenta MAX plan in record numbers with over 55% of new customers choosing our best plan. This wasn't part of our playbook before and is now a tailwind as our continuously improving network perception and competitive device offers are enticing customers right to the top of our rate card. And there's still a huge potential upside here as fewer than 15% of our postpaid phone customers are on Magenta MAX or equivalent plans. This affects ARPU and ARPA. When we shared our plan with you at Analyst Day last year, we assumed postpaid phone ARPU would decline 1% every year through 2023, consistent with our historical trends and any benefit from the Magenta MAX would be upside to the plan. Well, you're already seeing that upside as we just delivered flat ARPU, actually up $0.01 in 2021. And not to steal Peter's thunder, but on the strength of this trend, we now see postpaid phone ARPU being flat to slightly up in 2022 for the first time ever. In addition, we've seen our prime mix of credit apps increase year-over-year every quarter in 2021, showing that our network and brand is consistently attracting some of the industry's best customers. We're off to a great start, bringing the same winning formula to smaller markets and rural areas. This is 40% of the country where we haven't meaningfully played before. We're growing our presence here as we expand the reach of our distribution and network. In just one year, our share has grown from approximately 13% to roughly 15%. Our share of port-ins in smaller markets and rural areas has increased multiple percentage points year-over-year, and these markets accounted for more than a third of our new accounts. This is one place our network leadership is beginning to shine. We're already the only 5G game in town for many of these communities. Our extended range 5G provides speeds more than double the average LTE and reaches nearly five times more geographic coverage than Verizon's 5G. And we're rapidly rolling out our Ultra Capacity 5G to more of these communities at an unprecedented clip, expanding our mid-band 5G coverage to five times the land area that we cover today. By the end of next year as we move from 210 million people covered to over 300 million exiting 2023. Meanwhile, AT&T and Verizon have finally started rolling out mid-band 5G and hope to soon be where we were almost two years ago. I'll say it again, we're two years ahead of AT&T and Verizon in 5G and two years from now will still be two years ahead. T-Mobile for Business had another great year as enterprise and government customers continue to do hands-on testing and when they do, they see the strength of our network. This differentiation on the network experience is delivering win share well above our market share. Just to put that in perspective, we're already, today, at a win share in enterprise and government that would get us to our targeted 20% market share by 2025, that's if we just hold our win share at current levels. And we've still got room to run. We're in many ways just beginning the expansion of our solutions and capabilities. Last week, others said they were still in proof-of-concept for advanced 5G network solutions like mobile edge compute and private networks that they hope to commercialize at some point in the future. At T-Mobile, we already have commercial, revenue-generating agreements for advanced 5G solutions with multiple large corporations, including the federal government and a very large logistics company. I'm excited about building on our momentum with businesses in 2022 with our ever-expanding 5G network lead. And let me just go back and touch just a little bit more on high-speed Internet. At the beginning of 2021, we were actually still in pilot. While we closed out the year with 646,000 customers, far exceeding our 500,000 target, it's abundantly clear that customers are loving the network performance and the simplicity of this 5G-based product. And with roughly 40% of high-speed Internet customers being new to T-Mobile, it creates another front door to fuel our mobile growth. We're excited about the revenue and margin contribution potential of this business as we ramp up further this year and next as our planned network capacity really hits its pace. T-Mobile 5G Home Internet is ready for its prime-time moment. And I think a lot of people are going to be surprised by how mainstream this product really is with our unique 5G network capacity to back it up. Okay, let's touch on our progress on our accelerated merger integration. While our Magenta business is firing on all cylinders, we're also successfully powering through the transition of the higher-churning Sprint customers faster than planned. At our Analyst Day last year, we laid out our post-merger plan to accelerate our integration, bringing many of our biggest milestones forward by a year or more. The Sprint customer network migration is an essential part of this integration. At the end of 2021, 64% of Sprint customers have been migrated onto the T-Mobile network, well ahead of the 60% target that we laid out back at Analyst Day. This is impressive in one year when you consider that less than 10% were migrated at the end of 2020. As we've previously said, we expect the billing migration to be relatively seamless to the customer as we begin to ramp up this final part of the integration over the course of 2022 and into the first half of 2023. As we enter the home stretch in 2022 for many of our Sprint customer integration initiatives, we believe that Q4 of 2021 was the high watermark for churn, in terms of our overall postpaid phone churn during the integration. Having seen the integration results so far, we're now confident that churn will improve because we've seen the performance of a now material cohort of migrations. As customers migrate to fully compatible devices anchored on the T-Mobile network and have a new EIP instead of leasing, they show churn rates similar to our Magenta customers. A sizable minority of Sprint customers have now hit these milestones. Completing these upgrades and migrations won't happen overnight, but the bottom line is simple. While others are temporarily padding their net adds from elevated Sprint churn today, we're working to make that very short lived, which will create a growth tailwind for us, as you saw from our underlying Magenta performance while simultaneously creating a corresponding headwind for them. And we like those kinds of trends. Okay. Finally, before I wrap up, I do want to touch on our accomplishments as a leading corporate citizen in our industry. We not only set and exceeded our bold business and financial goals in 2021. We also stayed true to our commitments to use our new network, scale and resources for good, building a more connected, equitable and sustainable future for all of our stakeholders. T-Mobile was the first telecom to commit to sourcing 100% of our total electricity usage with renewable energy. And we're proud to announce this week that we're the first to achieve that goal, just another example of where we're leading the industry. We also further extended our leadership position in helping to bridge the digital divide. We're removing economic and geographic barriers in multiple ways. Our centerpiece is Project 10Million, which has already connected 3.2 million students with free or subsidized service. And we're expanding our high-speed Internet availability to millions of rural households, providing an important new connectivity option right where it's needed most. We also have an active participation in the government's affordable connectivity program through Metro by T-Mobile and Assurance Wireless, providing lower cost subsidized connectivity for many at a time when it's needed most. Okay. So let me sum it up. 2021 was our best year ever, and that's just because 2022 hasn't happened yet. Our positioning to simultaneously offer the best network and the best value is working while we also rushed to successfully expand into big underpenetrated segments. We saw strong ongoing growth ahead. We see it ahead in 2022 with a strategy that is really resonating with customers. Our network excellence has unlocked unprecedented growth for our Magenta brand, allowing us to move upmarket in urban and suburban areas with prime consumers and with enterprises and government. And at the same time, we've expanded our reach into smaller markets and rural areas and new product categories like high-speed Internet. We delivered big milestones in each of these areas in 2021 that really demonstrate our growth thesis with results. That customer growth helped to deliver industry-leading service revenue growth, and combined with our accelerated execution on our merger synergies, has enabled us to nearly double our free cash flow year-over-year in 2021. Only T-Mobile has this unique recipe with permission to win and room to run across multiple paths to unlock the massive shareholder value potential of this business. I'm incredibly excited to carry our momentum into 2022. This is a huge year, and there's no team I'd rather tackle it with. So, Peter, over to you. Peter Osvaldik : All right. Thanks, Mike. As you can see, our strong results in 2021 highlighted our unique ability to leverage our 5G network to execute our exciting growth initiatives and accelerate the merger integration. Let's start by talking about growth. We achieved our highest postpaid accounts and customer growth ever in 2021, which resulted in the best service revenue growth in company history and in the industry. We delivered strong ARPA and ARPU trends throughout 2021 with postpaid ARPA up nearly 2% from a year ago, consistent with our accounts and ARPA growth strategy we have shared with you. This postpaid ARPA growth is driven by both customer growth across both postpaid phones, including the success of our Magenta MAX offering and value-accretive postpaid other connections. We realized approximately $3.8 billion in synergies in 2021, nearly tripling year-over-year, with around $2.8 billion in P&L savings, which funded our growth initiatives and network build and roughly $1 billion in avoided costs. Through our higher service revenues and merger synergies, we reached record high core adjusted EBITDA of $23.6 billion, exceeding the high end of our recently raised guidance. Our growth in synergies have also unlocked rapid free cash flow expansion, which nearly doubled year-over-year to $5.6 billion in 2021 and it's just the beginning of our unique journey to deliver significant shareholder value. So, let's talk about how our great execution and investments in 2021 set us up for another strong year of growth in 2022. We expect total postpaid net additions to be between 5 million and 5.5 million, reflecting continued focus on profitable growth with our Magenta brand as we continue the accelerated Sprint customer migration. This assumes roughly half of postpaid net adds coming from phones and continued growth in high-speed Internet. This net adds guidance does not include an expected small subset of customers who will not migrate upon the sunset of the Sprint network, which will be treated as a base adjustment at the end of Q1 for CDMA and the end of Q2 for LTE. The anticipated small impact of these adjustments is fully incorporated into our core adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow guidance. So, we expect core adjusted EBITDA to be between $25.6 billion and $26.1 billion, up approximately 10% at the midpoint based on continued growth in service revenues and merger synergies. And this excludes leasing revenues, which we expect to be between $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion as we continue to transition Sprint customers off device leasing. Our merger synergies are expected to further ramp to $5 billion to $5.3 billion in 2022, primarily as we unlock more network savings, particularly as we get into the second half of the year. Merger-related costs not included in adjusted or core adjusted EBITDA are expected to be between $4.5 billion and $5 billion before taxes, primarily representing network activities. These costs will peak this year as we laid out at Analyst Day, and we expect roughly one-third of the total to occur in Q1 and another third in Q2 and then taper off in the second half of the year as merger-related costs precede synergy realization. Net cash provided by operating activities, including payments for merger-related costs is expected to be in the range of $15.5 billion to $16.1 billion, up more than 10% year-over-year. We expect cash CapEx to be between $13 billion and $13.5 billion as we continue the robust pace of our 5G deployment and network integration while also accelerating additional components of our build plan in order to capitalize on growth opportunities and enhance the customer experience. It is important to reiterate that our overall network capital budget remains unchanged. This acceleration further strengthens our competitive advantage by continuing the unprecedented pace of deployment, which unlocks the differentiated growth and significant cash flow generation potential of this business. Together, this results in expected free cash flow, including payments for merger-related costs, to be in the range of $7.1 billion to $7.6 billion. This is up more than 30% over last year, even with the higher levels of investment and does not assume any material net cash inflows from securitization. We expect our full year effective tax rate to be between 24% and 26% as 2021 included significant onetime benefits. And finally, we expect full year postpaid ARPA to be up again in 2022 as we execute on our strategy to continuously deepen our account relationships. As Mike mentioned, we expect postpaid phone ARPU to be flat to slightly up year-over-year in 2022, driven by continued customer adoption of Magenta MAX. Altogether, we expect 2022 to be a year of profitable growth and free cash flow expansion as we continue to invest in our network and the business. Our unique opportunity to unlock significant expansion in free cash flow is what we find so exciting and look forward to building on our momentum this year. And with that, I will now turn the call over to Jud Henry for Q&A. Jud? Jud Henry : All right. Thanks, Peter. Let\u2019s get to your questions. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll start with the question on the phone. Operator, first question, please. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will go to our first question at this time from Phil Cusick of J.P. Morgan. Mike Sievert : Hi, Phil. Operator : And one moment, please. Please go ahead, sir. Please go ahead, sir. Phil Cusick : Detail on the space adjustment at the end of the... Mike Sievert : Hey, Phil, we lost you at the beginning. Can you start over? Phil Cusick : Sorry. Mike Sievert : Yeah. Phil Cusick : Let me start over. So, thanks to the direction on postpaid phones being half of adds. What do you \u2013 can you give us more detail on how you think of this base adjustment at the end of the transition? Do you expect that these are sort of non-responsive customers that you\u2019ll treat it as an adjustment rather than people who actually leave? And how else do you think about fixed wireless broadband for 2022 within that guide? Thank you. Peter Osvaldik : Yes. Mike Sievert : Peter? Peter Osvaldik : Yes, absolutely. Thanks, Phil. So yes, we couldn\u2019t be more excited to continue on this journey and get the CDMA network shutdown and transition that technology and really unlock things for customers, particularly with 5G. In terms of what we expect there, what we\u2019re anticipating is probably in order of a couple hundred thousand phone subscribers. And really what those represent is the non-usage subscribers that we\u2019ve seen really tail off. So, it\u2019s not customers really leaving. I think it\u2019s really the tale of non-usage customers there. And of course, we\u2019ll probably see some other devices. It\u2019s a little unique. You have some end-of-life devices that really aren\u2019t practical to be replaced. So that\u2019s really there. But again, couldn\u2019t be more excited about the progress that we\u2019re making towards decommissioning these networks and both unlocking the synergies that come from that, but also putting all of that spectrum to use in the 5G space. And all of that is incorporated in the guidance that we gave you. With respect to fixed wireless, what we really see is 2022 will be a bigger year than 2021. And that\u2019s how we thought about it in the context of the guide that we gave you, but not specific figures. Mike Sievert : And maybe Dow, you can give a little color on how it\u2019s going out there with mobile Internet and what we\u2019re seeing and why is 2022 going to be a bigger year? Dow Draper : Yes. As we said earlier, I mean, this last year was our launch \u2013 our official launch \u2013 we did 542 \u2013 or ended the year with just under 650,000 customers. So, it\u2019s a great growth year for us. And the thing that\u2019s really exciting about this business is customer satisfaction continues to actually improve. I mean we\u2019re already three times higher than cable, and we\u2019re seeing it improve. So, the customers are liking it. We have momentum. The other exciting piece about this is that 40% of the customers we\u2019re bringing on are new to T-Mobile, which is a fantastic opportunity for us to cross-sell our wireless services. So, this continues to be the case. And our economics, as we stated back at Analyst Day, continue to be something that\u2019s really great and attractive postpaid like ARPU, much lower acquisition costs. So economically, this is a really good piece for us. So, we\u2019re seeing all the things that we had expected continue to trend as we expected even more favorably than we expected. And the penetration we\u2019re seeing across different market types also continues to be really positive. I mean the majority of our customers are coming from suburban and urban areas. And don\u2019t get me wrong, we do very well in rural areas where people are looking for even one choice of high-speed Internet. So that\u2019s been great. But the value proposition that we have, the simplicity, the price, the quality of the product, the fact that we have back it with amazing customer service, it\u2019s so easy to set up, all these are resonating with customers, whether they come from cable, which is still the majority of customers that we\u2019re bringing on or customers that are just looking for a great Internet provider. So, all these things give us great momentum in the fourth quarter, again, where we were number one in industry net adds, and we continue to \u2013 we expect to lean into that going into 2022. Mike Sievert : Yes. Last word on home Internet, Phil. I would say \u2013 I think some people are going to be surprised. I mentioned this in my remarks at how mainstream this product really is. And you certainly saw it in our growth numbers in Q4 where we beat the industry. But more importantly, you see it in our usage profiles. Average users are using 300 to 400 gigs a month. We have a mid-single digit using more than a terabyte. And people might say, well, that\u2019s not the same as cable. Cable uses more than that. But if you look at the broad distribution of cable users, their medians are right in that range. Their averages are only higher because they have some 10%, 20% of people that use multiple terabytes. Look, we can support some of that, too, as we\u2019re demonstrating today. But we don\u2019t have to target those people. I mean 80%, 90% of the customers are right in the sweet spot of where our product performs. And that\u2019s a wide, huge TAM for us. This is a very mainstream product for one reason. Our 5G is backed by the massive capacity of our rollout advancements and our spectrum portfolio. Nobody else is anywhere close or we\u2019ll give you quite some time. Yes, please, Phil. Phil Cusick : Mike, just a follow-up on one thing. I think that Peter said \u2013 and thanks on the fixed wireless side. That couple of hundred thousand customers, you said mostly non-usage. Is it fair to assume that the revenue associated with those are substantially less than average for those customers? Mike Sievert : Yes. And it\u2019s \u2013 we don\u2019t have it exactly sized yet, and its low usage and no usage and lower revenue. But it\u2019s basically the people who you\u2019ve offered them a phone completely brand-new, totally free phone several times, and they haven\u2019t responded. And in many cases, they have lower revenue profiles, little or no usage. And we don\u2019t have it perfectly sized yet. But it\u2019s \u2013 what Peter is trying to get at is it\u2019s not material to either our total subscriber enrollment nor our revenues. And so, at some point, when we begin our orderly transition, which looks like it\u2019s right on track for March 31, we\u2019ll begin that orderly shutdown of CDMA we\u2019ll do a residual base adjustment, but it won\u2019t have a material impact on our financials. And certainly, whatever impact we do expect is fully embedded in the guidance we shared with you today. Phil Cusick : Thanks very much, guys. Mike Sievert : You bet. Okay. Operator? Operator : And thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019re going to be moving next to our question from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Brett Feldman : Yes. Thanks for taking the question and great to hear the confidence you have in the cash flow profile of the company. Going back, that\u2019s one of the principal reasons why you had expressed confidence that you would be getting to a point where you could seek approval from the Board to pursue a fairly meaningful buyback program. Could you maybe just revisit for us what are some of the conditions you would hope that the business would be in, in order to be in a position to go seek that approval? And to what extent would that be operational milestones like completing certain elements of the integration, such as the network integration versus maybe being in line with certain financial objectives, such as where you\u2019re looking to get leverage? Thank you. Mike Sievert : Of course. I\u2019ll just take you back to Analyst Day because essentially nothing\u2019s changed. We\u2019re a year smarter, but all that year has done is demonstrate that the thesis we shared with you last year is completely intact, if not better than before. And what we said back then is that it\u2019s all predicated on the massive cash flow potential of this business, particularly in the years 2023, 2024, 2025 and beyond. So, we set an aspiration of about a $60 billion program during those years, the possibility of starting sooner, and all of that remains intact because the thesis is intact. And you saw that we authorized a pretty good capital build for this year because we\u2019re running well ahead of schedule on integration. We want to get this thing behind us. That means next year\u2019s capital profile will be lower. We\u2019re going to see a significant step down in capital next year versus this year. We don\u2019t have any formal updates for you, but the entire thesis that that magnitude of buyback makes sense and is a great way to return value in those time frames, including the possibility of starting earlier, all of that\u2019s intact. But I can\u2019t really parse it for you any more than that in terms of our deliberations. So sorry about that. Brett Feldman : Well, as a follow-up for Pete. You had previously expressed the goal of getting to investment grade. I don\u2019t think that was a prerequisite for pursuing buybacks, but obviously, the rate environment has changed since I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019re thinking around your balance sheet priorities have evolved at all. Thank you. Mike Sievert : No. They haven\u2019t. And look, it\u2019s very straightforward. We are going to achieve in this time frame according to our outlooks investment grade. We are going to \u2013 according to our outlooks have the wherewithal to be able to do these buybacks. They\u2019re not in tension with one another. And there are no preset predicates to when we might pursue these things. But I don\u2019t have a formal update for you. Brett Feldman : Thank you. Operator : And so, we\u2019ll move to our next question from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson. Craig Moffett : Hi, thanks. So, let\u2019s stay with \u2013 you talked a lot about fixed wireless broadband. Let\u2019s stay with the cable theme for a second. Having now seen the rapid growth that the cable operators posted in their wireless businesses. Can you talk about how you think about coexisting with cable? I\u2019m guessing they probably don\u2019t take a lot of subscribers directly from you, but they now sort of occupy a similar kind of value price that you occupy. How much do you think that affects your growth trajectory? Mike Sievert : Well, as you know, Craig, we also posted the biggest postpaid numbers in the entire industry in that same quarter you\u2019re asking about, Q4, the one we\u2019re reporting. And the highest postpaid net adds in our history in the full year 2021, all during which we\u2019re seeing this trend on cable, which isn\u2019t new. Cable had a strong quarter in Q4, but it wasn\u2019t an outsized quarter. I mean basically, it was 10.4% of gross adds. And we\u2019ve been saying for a long time, we see them right around 10%. They\u2019ve been consistent performers. And when you have those kinds of smaller bases that you\u2019ll see a little bit more variability in nets. But their activations are very consistent. And you see how we\u2019re thriving in that environment. And one of the issues is what you talked about. We think our value proposition is distinct, and it\u2019s resonating. And I\u2019m really talking about the Magenta value proposition because that\u2019s the one we bring to the market. We talked about the fact that if Magenta churn matched Sprint churn, and they were both at the Magenta levels right now, which is certainly a long-term trend, this performance this last quarter would have been 1.4 million postpaid phone net adds, the highest in our history. And it\u2019s not meant to give you some alternate reality on Q4. It\u2019s meant to express what we see in the underlying trends of our business that don\u2019t always come through in the reports. So, look, we are coexisting with them. We\u2019ve been coexisting with them and we\u2019re really just not concerned about some step change catalyst. Great. Operator, let\u2019s go back. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll go next to a question from Michael Rollins of Citi. Michael Rollins : Thanks. And good afternoon. Hi. I wanted to touch upon the flow of performance over the course of 2022. I think you mentioned earlier that the integration investments would be, I think, one-third, one-third and then the balance in the back half of the year. I\u2019m just curious how we should be thinking about the pace of churn \u2013 normal course churn or Sprint related churn over the course of the year as you\u2019re continuing with the integration, how to think about the synergy realization and whether EBITDA growth is back-end loaded for the timing of those savings and then as it relates to free cash flow. Mike Sievert : Sure. Let me make a comment on churn, and then I\u2019ll hand it to Peter on what you can expect in terms of timing, so he can give you his usual non-answer on how it will all unfold during the year. But look, on churn, what I mentioned in my remarks is that we\u2019re, as expected, seeing a seasonal step down in churn. But we\u2019re also seeing an improvement in our relative performance with our underlying Magenta porting better so far in Q1 than in Q4, where it was already very strong. So, we\u2019re really pleased with the progress that we\u2019re seeing. And then underneath that, I mentioned that I believe that Q4 would be the high watermark quarter for churn overall, certainly through this multiyear integration period. And the reason why we were able to express some confidence in that is that you remember last time, I said there had been a small group of people that have sort of fully completed the migration. And we weren\u2019t sure if there was a selection bias or what was going on, but they looked exactly like or even a little better than Magenta. And now we have a significant cohort, millions that have moved across. It\u2019s still a minority. I mean, it\u2019s going to take some time because it\u2019s driven by upgrades, which are stepwise. But now we have a big material cohort of people who have a compatible device. They have one or more on their account T-Mobile payment plans or T-Mobile light payment plans, not the leasing, on a compatible device, domiciled on the T-Mobile network. And when you have those pieces in place, there are lots of pieces. But when you have those pieces in place, you see churn just like Magenta. And we have now a significant minority of Sprint customers that have that in place. And it makes sense. If you have one or more phones on your band that have to be every single one \u2013 a band is an account. If you have one or more phones that are on a new T-Mobile like payment plan, then you see how user-friendly it is versus the leases. You see how it performs on the network versus your prior product. And there\u2019s a dynamic there of having a level of commitment to the company. And so, you see that taste of Magenta and what it\u2019s like, and that corresponds to churn just like Magenta. So now we\u2019re able to say, look, we just got to get the job done. We have to sweep across all these bands, make sure that they have the experience of agenda, particularly compatible phones and compatible phone plans, and we\u2019re going to see the performance that we expect. And it\u2019s easier to predict now that we have a material cohort that\u2019s come all the way across. As to the time frames on some of the financials through the quarter, what kind of color can you share, Peter? Peter Osvaldik : Yes, absolutely. I\u2019ll try to give more than a non-answer to say, Mike. But you mentioned, Mike, on the merger-related costs, and we said out of the guide that we provided, we anticipate about a third of that in Q1 and about a third of that in Q2. And you see that, of course, as you starting to decommission the cell sites, you\u2019re going to start seeing the majority of this cost be associated with that e-com. By the way, and all of this acceleration of synergy that we provided, including beating 2021 and this 2022 guide, we\u2019re still projecting the same total amount of merger-related costs, which remember, were $15 billion. I do think now instead of the 11.5 OpEx, 3.5 CapEx, what we\u2019ll see is about 12 OpEx and 3 CapEx because the acceleration actually meant some things that we thought would be capitalized and now flipped to OpEx given the shorter time frame. So that\u2019s it with respect to merger-related costs. And those perceive the synergies. So, as I said, as you start decoming the cell sites, in particular, you\u2019re going to start seeing the network synergies build in the second half of the year. And those are the things that will give you color around how it develops with respect to core EBITDA. And of course, you have other things such as seasonality and holiday and gross add flows that will affect some of that, but at least color around merger-related cost and synergy developments throughout the course of the year. Michael Rollins : Okay. Sounds good. Let\u2019s go to Twitter for a couple and then come right back to the phone. So, Neville, Bill Ho asks, with Auction 110 spectrum expanding our mid-band TDD, what are the issues beyond clearing to put this new spectrum into service? And while you\u2019re at it, with 5G ultra capacity, 260 million POPs targeted by the end of this year and 300 at the end of next year, is that organic or with roaming partners or what should we expect them? Neville Ray : Great. Yes. Thanks, Mike, and thanks for the cue, Bill. So, Action 110, so we\u2019re very pleased with the outcome, as Mike referenced in his opening comments, a great addition for us to our mid-band spectrum position. Your question there about what are the issues, well, obviously, this is a new band. So \u2013 and it does have some complexity with coordination with the DoD to navigate. So that takes a little bit of time. The radio infrastructure is new. So that has to be brought on and made available. And obviously, supply chain can play in there. And then third, but certainly not the last issue, is handsets and devices. And so, we see kind of from the major OEMs availability on devices in this band tail end of this year, early next. So, for T-Mobile, our plan is to look at starting deployment of that 110 spectrum in 2023 in conjunction with the C-band spectrum that we purchased last year. And that\u2019s a one and done for us. That\u2019s a single radio. Unlike the AT&T approach you\u2019ve heard about, which is two radios kind of integrated together. So, for us, I mean, we\u2019re looking to deploy the spectrum at the perfect time as we move into 2023. So very pleased with the outcome there. And I think the other important piece, as Mike referenced, we purchased spectrum in key areas of the country where the spectrum is most suited for deployment and capacity use. On the target for 260 million POPs by the end of 2022 and then 300 million by the end of 2023, nobody more excited about those numbers than me. That\u2019s one hell of a footprint and looks to really extend the powerful lead we have today. And are we going to be using roaming partners? I think they\u2019re going to be very few and far between. I think the question out there, Bill, is how many folks are going to be coming to T-Mobile and asking if they can roam on our great 5G with all of that footprint and capacity and capability that\u2019s out there. So, it\u2019s an organic build. I won\u2019t say 100%, but effectively, it\u2019s a T-Mobile build, so excited on both those. Jud Henry : Okay. Back to the phones in a minute. But first, Roger Entner, Mike Katz, he asked, can you talk about progress in the business segment, both for phone and for fixed wireless. So, a little color on the quarter and maybe what you see ahead in 2022? Mike Katz : Yes. No, thanks for the question, Roger. And look, I\u2019m very, very proud of the progress that we made in business this last year. As you heard Mike talked about at the beginning of the call, we left 2021 in with a win rate and a corresponding net add velocity, that gets us to the 20% target share target that we talked about at Analyst Day in 2025. So, I\u2019m really thrilled with the momentum that we\u2019re building there. And we left the year with a lot of momentum. Last time we were here together, I talked about it being the best quarter that we\u2019ve had in enterprise. Q4 bested Q3 in enterprise. So, we\u2019ve left 2021 with a lot of momentum. And one of the things that we\u2019re seeing is the size of the wins that we\u2019re getting. It\u2019s not just new companies picking us, but it\u2019s the depth of wins. And it\u2019s really well demonstrated by one of the ones we announced this last quarter with Alaska Airlines picking us to not just be a partner but be their primary wireless provider. And those are the kinds of partnerships that we see striking, both in enterprise and government throughout the course of 2021. The wins are coming both in phone, but also in postpaid other, the latter of which we\u2019re really excited about, because we are seeing CLVs on other connectivity that are greater than phone in enterprise and governance. So, it\u2019s really profitable business for us. And in that part of the business, we led the industry in growth there. So, it\u2019s coming both simultaneously from phone and postpaid other. On fixed wireless, Dow will tell you that part of the growth that we had this year certainly came from business customers, and I see that as one of the big growth vectors for us this coming year. Certainly, in small business where they \u2013 we talk about the lack of choices that consumers have in fixed wireless. Just think about how rough it is for small businesses. Man, they get gouged. They have very few choices and the choices they have, they really get gouged. So, we think there\u2019s a big growth opportunity in small business. And we think there\u2019s opportunities across other business segments as well, including large enterprise, where we can provide both primary and redundant service in certain use cases. So, Dow and I worked closely on that, and I see that as one of our big growth opportunities as we roll into 2022. Jud Henry : Terrific. Thanks, Mike. Okay, operator. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll go next to Jonathan Chaplin of New Street. Jonathan Chaplin : Thanks. Two quick ones, one for Peter. I\u2019m wondering if you can give us some context for what you\u2019re assuming in your net add guidance for the industry. Is it another year of 9 million adds to the industry? Are we heading back towards a sort of a pre-pandemic trend of maybe 5.5, 6? And then maybe for Mike, sticking with the fixed wireless broadband theme, I\u2019d love to get your thoughts on the pricing environment in broadband and a sense for other markets where you\u2019re up against Verizon\u2019s fixed wireless broadband product. And if so, how does your message around 5G resonate against their $30 pricing? Mike Sievert : Terrific. Okay. First to Peter. Peter Osvaldik : Yes, absolutely. And look, Jonathan, I think the important thing is, at some point, this industry will probably normalize more to pre-pandemic levels, right? That\u2019s no doubt about it that it will happen at some point. It might come in ebbs and flows. The most important thing is in what we provided you from a net add guidance and what we, of course, delivered in 2021 that you have to ask yourself is, who really has a clearly articulated strategy backed up with proof points in terms of how they\u2019re going to generate the growth. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re so excited about the guide that we gave you because of all the underpenetrated opportunities that we have, smaller markets and rural areas, you just heard Mike Katz talk about enterprise and government, of course, what we have in terms of high-speed Internet, and we\u2019re going into all of these areas while we\u2019re building a completely differentiated network that is going to stay ahead. And that's going to fuel the opportunity to bring the best product and the best value, fuel the growth that we're seeing and the momentum and the stats that you've heard, whether it's from smaller markets and rural areas that are generating the account growth. We're just tremendously excited about it. And so, despite what the industry does in 2022, we feel very confident in the guide that we gave because of, again, the product differentiation on the network and our ability and traction and growth opportunities in these underrepresented areas. Mike Sievert : Yes. And on mobile broadband or fixed wireless, no, we're not really running into that. But remember, we're just operating at a different scale. So, in Q4, we delivered more net adds than Verizon has delivered in the entire time frame they've been swinging the bat on fixed wireless, three-years plus. So, we're operating at completely different scales. And you have to remember that while they're starting with mid-band 5G, they're starting with very small amount of geographic coverage and concentrating POPs in urban areas where it's easiest to do deploy. We started planning our mid-band 5G in 2018 with permitting and licensing and started rolling it out in earnest over two-years ago so \u2013 or about two years ago. So, we know that's a different opportunity. So, we're not really running into that much. As to their pricing, it's interesting what to see, where that goes. I\u2019ll tell you this, the response we're getting to our offers is phenomenal, the idea being able to have a product with massive capacity and mainstream usage, across vast class of this country for $50.0 including all taxes and fees, and no promotional like our wired into fine Verizon offers. That\u2019s really cool and that\u2019s resonating and we\u2019re not really not out to respond to other people\u2019s initiative, we\u2019re out the like customers with an offer with product. The think I think they will see is that it\u2019s backed by this massive capacity network, others \u2013 it just kind of shows a time-to-market advantage. Others do have massive capacity in a few places with millimeter wave, but they're also demonstrated issues there with self-install and other complications. And so, we feel like we've got the right sweet spot and we're just heads down executing our strategy and really not worrying about all the noise. Jonathan Chaplin : Great. Thanks guys. Operator : We'll move next to Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Simon Flannery : Great. Thank you very much. I wonder if you could just talk a little bit about some of the key priorities for the CapEx program. I think we were a little bit surprised last month when the guide \u2013 or in December when the guide went up year-over-year given that you've achieved the $210 million already, so any color around that? And also, color around the dispute with the FAA around the C-band availability and maybe also pivoting to Mike, does that give you an opportunity to do more with enterprises that rely on connectivity around airports. How and when do you think this issue will be resolved? Thanks. Mike Sievert : You do capital, I'll do the FAA. Neville Ray : Sure. Yes. We'll split the two. Yes. Thanks, Simon. So obviously, this is a year with this powerful lead that we just talked about, we really want to press that home in 2022. And Mike referenced earlier, how this is our time. We've built a very, very high-performing deployment machine. It's not just deployment, its supply chain logistics, radio features, there's so much to pulling together this type of deployment at this pace, which is record breaking. So, while we have that wind in our sales, it's a great opportunity for us to really push the envelope and gap our competition. For Verizon to come close to what we're delivering, it's a multiyear task. And AT&T with their announced strategy have really said meaningful for our 5G customer \u2013 meaningful experience for our 5G customers, it kind of may start in 2023, maybe. So, they've almost put another year on the clock for themselves. So, they're also way behind. So, it's a perfect opportunity where we have such a high-performing machine. There's a bunch of other pieces in there, Simon. Obviously, we continue to expand and increase our coverage. We're working hard on in building and supporting Mike and the team on the TFB side. That's another area of growth for us. And we want to wrap up on this integration. Part of that program is upgrading a high volume of Sprint sites that we always said we would integrate and combine into the T-Mobile network, adding coverage and capacity. And part of the pull forward is to get all of that work done inside the 2022 envelope as well. So, lots of things ongoing, but we have incredible momentum. We have the crews, the equipment, the team, the process. And so, this is a great year for us to really look to extend that leadership we've now established. Mike Sievert : Simon, just to double down on what Neville said. Neville's plan respects and understands that there's a lot more to a customer's network assessment than just our massive 5G lead. They also want coverage everywhere it matters to them. And we have such a great coverage footprint, but we've always talked about in our merger plan the idea of 10,000 incremental sites going after smaller markets and rural areas and pursuing great business opportunities for us in underpenetrated segments. And our thought is, let's get after that now and get it done. And so that's one of the reasons why you see the capital, but you don't see a different goal on the POP coverage other than around the margins on 5G because a big part of this is about chasing meaningful coverage for consumers and, as Neville said, for businesses. And we think that's very important to our overall competitive story. As it relates to the controversy, we see AT&T and Verizon embroiled in, first of all, it would be awfully tempting to sit on the outside of a controversy like that and take pot shots. But honestly, we think that in the final analysis after the work has been done, the studies have been completed, we think the wireless industry, AT&T, Verizon, the FCC positions will be validated. And we think they're right. So, these are different frequencies than what radio altimeters operate in. And a properly functioning radio altimeter, I think, will ultimately be shown not to be interfered with by C-band. I regret that this has been so widely reported as a 5G issue and that we've been a little left out of the story there. It would be great if what sold clicks for the press was to say, and by the way, T-Mobile is already nationwide with a frequency that has nothing to do with this controversy. But that doesn't really sell page views, and so it's not showing up in a lot of the reports. But as I said, when this \u2013 when everything is said and done and the assessments are completed this year and people take a breath because of the importance of this issue, I think the positions of AT&T, Verizon and the FCC will be validated. And that's our company's view. Obviously, we've taken interest in this because we hope to deploy C-band down the road. We're not in a rush. But to me, that's very important. And if it's ultimately found that some old or faulty radio altimeters are picking up stray signals, then I'm sure that the country will deal with that. I for one would prefer to have a world where there aren't old and faulty radio altimeters out there. So, look, we'll see how it all unfolds. But I think the positions of the industry and the FCC will ultimately be validated. Simon Flannery : Thanks a lot. Operator : And we'll go next to a question from John Hodulik of UBS. Mike Sievert : Hi, John. John Hodulik : Hi, Mike. A couple of questions, first on fixed wireless. Do you guys have a sense of where those customers are coming from? I mean, whether it's cable or maybe start fixed services or customers move the category? And then in terms of the ramp, I mean, at what point \u2013 how long does it take to get to sort of the run rate in net adds where you think you're sort of going full speed now the logistics worked out and then the business model sort of clicking? And then my quick question, a follow-up to the buyback, I think that obviously is a big focus of investors. Is there any chance that you could see the buyback, given the potential magnitude of this over the next few years, starting in the second half of the year, given it really looks like, as really Peter called out, you'll be really largely through or really starting to see the sort of the end of the integration at that point? Thanks. Mike Sievert : Sounds great. Well, Dow, let's go back to you on some of these statistics on urban and suburban or on cable switchers, new to T-Mobile and what you're seeing also the ramp rate for this year next. Dow Draper : Yes. So, I mean, the great thing about our position here and what Neville and his team have built is we're all across the country in all different markets, all different types of markets. So \u2013 and we're seeing wins \u2013 customer wins across all of those. So, we're certainly seeing a small percentage of people who have never had wireless before coming to us. And we certainly do very well. And as you would imagine, in rural and small-town America where they have either no or a choice and that choice isn't very good, and so we're doing well there. The thing that's been also validating for us is that we are also winning well in urban and suburban markets. In fact, the majority of our customers come from suburban and urban markets, and the majority of those are coming from cable and fiber and other things. I know you might say, well, why is that? And look, quite frankly, we're half the price in a lot of cases against cable companies when you add in their fees and all the different charges they have. Also, it's simplistic. We don't have price hikes. I mean, customers are generally very unhappy with the cable industry. So that tends to be why we see people coming to us from all different types of geographies, all different providers, especially cable and fiber, is it's just a better value proposition. They get treated right and it's a good product. And in terms of the trajectory, remember, we are really following the network build. And so, as you're seeing, Neville is covering the country in terms of coverage. We're adding capacity, and that capacity just keeps getting bigger and bigger and bigger over the next several years. And so, I think our business will continue to grow and scale along with that build, at least that's our plan as more availability, more capacity and supportability arise. Mike Sievert : Great. And then on the share buyback, I think what you're getting at, is there a preconceived milestone? And no, there's no particular preconceived milestone that we're looking for. And beyond that, I can't really update you on our deliberations and our Board's deliberations other than to repeat what I said a minute ago, which is that when we put out this thesis a year ago, we saw a future that of rapidly accelerating cash flow, massive value creation opportunity and the wherewithal to do $60 billion in share buybacks in 2023, 2024 and 2025 with the possibility of starting sooner. And everything we saw then is still intact and obviously, many of the underlying trends, as you saw with our great cash flow beat this year, if anything, are improving. John Hodulik : Got it. Thanks guys. Mike Sievert : Operator, let\u2019s go back to the next caller. Operator : Thank you. We'll go to our next caller, Doug Mitchelson of Credit Suisse. Doug Mitchelson : Well, thanks so much. Sorry to follow-up on broadband, but I'm just curious if you're able to offer any context on business versus residential, but also relative to the follow \u2013 the build-out of the network, is there any reason why the fourth quarter isn't the right growth pace to look at for fixed wireless net adds in 1Q and beyond? That would be interesting. And then separately, just your comment on premiums like Netflix and Apple TV+ and Paramount+, how have those impacted marketing? Would you look to add more services? Has that been efficient for you? That would be helpful. Mike Sievert : You bet. Well, first of all, as it relates to the trends that Dow was saying, we see 2022 significantly bigger than 2021, and we see 2023 bigger than 2022. So, we do see a ramp-up happening. We probably fixed wireless is such a new industry, and we're by far the leaders in the U.S. I don't think there's a seasonality trend well established yet for this part of the industry. And so, look, we're going into places informed by our capital and our network capacity and where we're able to market. And there's so much great opportunity in smaller markets and rural areas, which I think we should talk about, both for mobile and for fixed. So, it's going to be a year of, I think, increasing momentum as essentially, we follow that network build. You remember in 2021, including Q4 with this record performance. We're still in the process of allocating capacity to the Destination Network. We're still in the height of an integration, and that capacity starts to massively increase and that opens up more and more doors for us because all of our opportunity in fixed wireless is centered around our excess capacity model being able to offer fixed wireless services in places where our analysis says mobile capacity won't take it up. As it relates to the second piece on marketing, I'll ask Jon Freier to comment on what he's seeing. And a big piece of this, Jon, is as consumers are trying to get to know us in smaller markets and rural areas and our brand differentiation with the Un-carrier, things like Netflix on us, Apple TV+ for a year, all of the things that we provide, some of which we're talking about in this question, what are people in smaller markets and rural areas nationwide seeing as it relates to our value proposition. Jon Freier : Yes. So, thank you for the question. I got to tell you, we are just incredibly excited about what's happening with this space. Like Mike said, we pioneered this entire space of having content that people love and get into the very best value with Netflix On Us that we introduced back in 2017 and then followed up with YouTube TV and a discount on YouTube TV and Filo and Apple TV+ on us for a period of 12 months on us and then also with what we announced in Q4 on Paramount+ on us for 12 months as well. So, all of that is going incredibly well because it is the very best content that you can get that is at \u2013 is brought to you at the very best value. And so, when you look at all of that put together, we love how that's working. And like Mike said, in the smaller markets in rural area space, people are just loving that because you got to remember, these people \u2013 and just let me just back up 140 million people, 50 million households, 40% of the entire country have been looking at these T-Mobile television commercials for years and years and years and see what the Un-carrier is doing and wishing they could have some of that. And now what we're being able to do is bring them that, that incredible value, that incredible offer set that they haven't been able to get before. And what Neville was talking about a little while ago with this network pull forward, it's given us a huge opportunity to go after this space. I'm really proud with what we've done so far in 2021, 13% market share increased to 15% market share. That's fantastic. But we really see a much bigger opportunity in front of us because when you think about the markets that we have a permission to win in, we've taken all of our markets and kind of dice them up into 770 pipe markets across the country. And when you \u2013 and we're looking at them from a full network superiority position all the way to \u2013 we need to make some investment and there's a few a few steps along the way. But when you look at the markets where we have a permission to win across the 775 markets and smaller markets and rural areas, it's about a third. It's about a third. So, we're moving this market share position of 13% to 15% by playing really only about a third of the markets in smaller markets and rural areas. And that's why this coverage expansion is so incredibly important so as we can continue to get more and more markets with the permission to win, and we can follow that with our infamous sales and marketing playbook that the Un-carrier is famous for, we see huge opportunities here. And just remember, these are places that from a wireless perspective, it's really kind of a page of the 1990s with really kind of two choices, and it's like high cost and higher costs. Those are the two choices that are in those particular areas. So, with us bringing our value proposition and a superior 5G network declaration in these markets, we think we have a huge opportunity to continue to bring this winning formula across the entire country. Doug Mitchelson : Helpful. Thank you. Mike Sievert : Well then great. Let's go back to the phone. Operator : And we'll go to our next question from David Barden of Bank of America. David Barden : Hey guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. I guess just one quick numbers question, guys. Obviously, last year with the DISH announcement with the relationship with AT&T, the closing of the Verizon TracPhone announcement, high-margin wholesale revenue is kind of this unknown quantity as we look into 2022. Could you kind of share with us \u2013 you said in the past you expected this trajectory to go to zero over time? But can you kind of give us more color as to kind of how you think this is going to unfold into 2022? Thanks. Mike Sievert : Sure. In that particular question, I think you were talking about DISH because we sure don't see wholesale going to zero but that's always been our plan with DISH is that ultimately, they would build their own network and wouldn't need ours. And as you know, the AT&T deal that they struck last year looked to us like it would accelerate that. And that's fully embedded in our guidance. So, I think we've previously disclosed that in 2021, our revenues from DISH were under $2 billion. The guidance we gave you today assumes that in 2022, it's a lot less than that, material step down in 2022. And \u2013 but at the same time, that means there's a materially less usage of our network from DISH, and that opens up other opportunities. First of all, in wholesale, we recently struck a deal to make sure we have a thoughtful transition with TracFone over multiple years, and that's something I think is very productive for both us and for Verizon. We have been able to strike a multiyear exclusive agreement with Google for the Google Offer, and that's very exciting. And we're in discussions with several other opportunities, both renewals and greenfield. So, and that's just in the wholesale area. The other opportunity, of course as these millions of customers come off our network is increased capacity for us to pursue our core business. And our core business is on fire. If there's nothing else, we've gotten across on this call, including the fixed wireless that's subject of so much interest today because that's a consumptive product, and it's all driven on a detailed excess capacity model. So as capacity frees up, that frees up new eligible households. So, lots of opportunity, but I wanted to be clear on at least what the guidance that Peter shared with you today assumed. And hopefully, that helps. David Barden : Thanks guys. Jud Henry : Alright, we got time for one final question. Mike Sievert : Wow. Is it that time already? Okay. Great. Operator? Operator : Thank you. We'll go to that last question from Peter Supino of Bernstein. Mike Sievert : Hi, Peter. Peter Supino : Hi, thank you. So, time flies when you're having fun, right? I just wanted to ask a very long-term oriented questions, so please expand your aperture out many years. T-Mobile has about 27 million accounts. The market is trending towards \u2013 albeit just recently \u2013 towards a more bundled relationship with consumers in your fixed wireless broadband initiative looks extremely timely in that context. But one question we get often from investors is, how does T-Mobile thrive over the long run? How does T-Mobile keep a valuation multiple when it has a finite ability to sell fixed wireless in a converging marketplace? And I'd love to know your thoughts on that. Is that \u2013 does that get solved by densification, by ad spectrum? What's the long-term plan for that? Mike Sievert : Yes. It's a great question. Well, first of all, I would say that the question presumes some things about convergence, which I don't know how they will apply in the United States. One broad trend, if we're going macro, that we certainly keep in mind is the underlying health and vitality of mobile. The broad trends are that all content and communications of all kinds are leaving and have left their prior linear forms and landing on the Internet, and eyeball time and usage and customers on the Internet are going mobile. So, the broad trend is from linear to Internet to mobile. And we're the country's leading pure-play mobile Internet Company, and that is a great place to be. And we're backed by a differentiated asset base that really does have the ability to deliver massive capacity. We don't talk much about our second best in the industry millimeter wave portfolio, the years' long lead we have deploying spectrum against our mid-band leadership portfolio. And all of this builds to a position of massive potential capacity that we can use to create businesses. And those businesses may be pure connectivity or they may be things that surround connectivity as we're already starting to see in the enterprise space. In my remarks earlier, I said that we're entering actual revenue agreements for advanced 5G services with major organizations, including the Federal Government itself, not trials, but major agreements. And so, there's lots of opportunity when you have a differentiated asset base, a strong balance sheet, a killer brand, a creative, fast and entrepreneurial team and the wherewithal to be able to turn those things into businesses. What I can tell you is that we thought it through at a level deeper than that for the five- or six-year picture. And we see the trends that we've been describing to you pretty clearly within that time frame. And it gives us a lot of confidence in the massive shareholder value creation that we see ahead. I hope that helps. Peter Supino : Thanks so much. Mike Sievert : Okay. Great, Peter. Well, Jud, anything \u2013 any final words? Jud Henry : No, I just appreciate everybody joining us today. Obviously, we look forward to speaking with you again soon and telling you more of this exciting journey in 2022. If you have any additional questions, feel free to reach out to the Investor Relations team or the media relations team. And again, we look forward to speaking again soon. Thank you. Mike Sievert : Bye, everybody. Operator : And so, ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the T-Mobile Investor Relations Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. Again, if you have any further questions, you may contact the Investor Relations or media department. Thank you for your participation. And you may now disconnect, and have a pleasant day.",

I'd now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jud Henry, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations for T-Mobile US. Please go ahead, sir. Jud Henry : Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the T-Mobile first quarter 2022 earnings call. Joining me on the call today are Mike Sievert, our President and CEO; Peter Osvaldik, our CFO; as well as other members of the senior leadership team. During the call, we will make forward-looking statements which involve a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. We provide a comprehensive list of risk factors in our SEC filings which I encourage you to review. Our earnings release, investor fact book and other materials that accompany our Q1 results as well as reconciliations between our GAAP and non-GAAP disclosures can be found on the Quarterly Results section of the Investor Relations website. With that, let me turn the call over to Mike. Mike Sievert : Okay. Thanks, Jud. Hi, everybody. Well, what an exciting time right now at T-Mobile. We have a lot to cover but we'll keep our comments brief this time so that we can get right to your questions. We just celebrated the 2-year anniversary of this merger. We delivered another exciting outperformance in Q1 to kick off 2022. We're in the home stretch of our accelerated integration. And we're raising our guidance for the year across the board based on the momentum that we see in our business. It's hard to believe that it's already been 2 years since we closed our merger with Sprint. I'm incredibly proud of what we've accomplished as we have consistently exceeded not only our own targets but also Wall Street's expectations. One of the cornerstones of our merger advocacy was that we would lead the U.S. into the 5G era. And I don't think very many people anticipated what we've already achieved in just 2 years. We now cover 315 million people with 5G. That's 95% of all Americans. And our 5G geographic coverage with dedicated low-band spectrum is more than Verizon and AT&T have combined which both, by the way, are still largely sharing spectrum with their LTE networks. Perhaps our greatest impact though was to awaken the industry to the transformational performance of mid-band spectrum for Ultra Capacity 5G. We already cover 225 million Americans and nearly 85% of all T-Mobile customers with these game-changing experiences. We caused others to pivot from an apparent willingness to leave fast 5G to a select few customers within arm's reach of a millimeter wave site. And now we see them greatly increasing their investments in mid-band spectrum and deployment. They are trying to chase us but only to realize they will be and are years behind T-Mobile. Pre-merger, we laid out a plan to realize massive synergies from our scale and efficiencies only to raise our run rate synergy expectations by 25% after closing the merger. We're delivering these synergies bigger and faster than expected to the benefit of our shareholders. And synergies are ramping up even further this year as we're approaching some of our biggest milestones, including moving the remaining customers off the Sprint network in the next couple of month just over 2 years from merger close. And we're also on track to upgrade or decommission substantially all of the Sprint sites this year, less than 3 years from close. We've been selectively decommissioning sites since the merger close. And as of Q1, we've decommissioned roughly 1/3 of the 35,000 targeted sites, with the big push coming in the second half of this year. Remarkable execution by the team as we pulled these milestones forward by more than a year. At the Un-carrier, we're committed to use our 5G leadership and synergies for the good of consumers and businesses, eliminating the biggest pain point in this industry where customers were forced to make trade-offs between network quality and value. As the only national wireless provider with a clearly articulated and differentiated growth strategy, we have led the industry in postpaid customer and service revenue growth in the 2 years since the merger closed. In that time, we've delivered roughly 2 million postpaid account net adds and 11.5 million postpaid net adds, including an industry-best 5.3 million postpaid phone net adds. We were also the only national wireless operator to deliver double-digit growth in both service revenue and core adjusted EBITDA over that period. And we accomplished this while building the foundation for sustainable growth platforms across enterprise and government, smaller markets in rural areas, prime consumers in the largest 100 markets and bringing real competition to broadband. We've unlocked new experiences for consumers, like the first truly unlimited 5G plan with Magenta MAX. And we've established T-Mobile as the fastest-growing broadband provider, bringing a better product and value proposition to over 40 million potential households and already serving over 1 million customers, just a year after our commercial launch. We are carrying this momentum right into 2022, delivering another industry-leading quarter of both customer and financial growth in Q1 built on the incredible momentum of our Magenta brand. We added 348,000 postpaid account net adds, our highest Q1 ever and the highest reported in the industry yet again. As I've said before, this measure of our total billing relationships is the best barometer that we're winning the switching decisions in this industry. While others appear to be leaning into adding lines to their base, we are focused on growing the number of customer relationships and then deepening them over time across our products and services. And we delivered our highest Q1 postpaid net adds in 8 years with an industry best 1.3 million. That's more postpaid nets than AT&T and Verizon combined. This includes 589,000 postpaid phone net adds. Our postpaid phone churn dropped by a whopping 17 basis points from Q4 to just 0.93, the industry best improvement both year-over-year and sequentially. We were the only national wireless operator to improve churn year-over-year as our competitors saw their churn increase. This integration-driven churn improvement really matters because our phone gross adds were the highest in the industry yet again in Q1. In fact, if the Sprint churn was the same as the Magenta churn, postpaid phone net adds in Q1 would have been closer to 900,000. And I couldn't be more excited about high-speed Internet, where we had 338,000 net adds and I expect will be the fastest-growing broadband provider in the industry for the second consecutive quarter. Demand just continues to build from dissatisfied suburban cable customers to underserved customers in smaller markets and rural areas. Our Net Promoter Scores continue to improve quarter-over-quarter and, are now more than 3x the average NPS scores for cable customers. The best part is we're just getting started bringing the Un-carrier to broadband. So stay tuned for what we have in store next. Magenta MAX continues to see great adoption from customers which is helping to drive strong ARPU and ARPA trends and we still have lots of room for further growth. With the trends that we're seeing, we now expect postpaid phone ARPU to be up roughly 1% in 2022. In addition, we continue to see our prime mix of credit apps increased on a year-over-year basis each quarter, showing that our network and our brand are consistently attracting the industry's best customers. We continue to see good momentum in smaller markets and rural areas as we expand the reach of our distribution and network. The team is executing our precision playbook here to a T, coordinating the network and distribution build-outs to unlock new experiences community by community. We ended 2021 effectively competing in about 30% of households in these markets and will continue to expand to more than half of households in smaller markets by the end of this year. Our new accounts from smaller markets and rural areas grew 40% year-over-year in Q1. And these markets are also a great example of where our high-speed Internet is helping to open doors for us to drive mobile penetration. T-Mobile for Business continues to build mind share with enterprise and government customers on the strength of our network and our ever-expanding suite of products and services. We've built strong momentum across major verticals now, such as the financial sector, where we continue to expand the list of large multinational banks relying on T-Mobile for secure and compliant connectivity for their hybrid mobile workforce. Our network performance has also been a catalyst for over 31st responder agencies to join T-Mobile just in Q1. We recently introduced the first 5G connected cars in America with Magenta Drive for BMW. And we continue to be on the leading edge of advanced 5G network solutions like mobile edge compute and private networks. I'm excited about building on our momentum with businesses in 2022 with our significant and durable 5G network advantage. Okay, let me wrap up. It's been a remarkable run in the first 2 years since our merger. We've unlocked better experiences for consumers and businesses by offering the best value and the promise of the best network for the first time in this industry's history. We've unlocked shareholder value through industry-leading growth in postpaid customers and service revenues while delivering merger synergies bigger and faster than originally planned. We're off to a great start in 2022 with a beat-and-raise quarter that not only led this industry in growth of postpaid customers but also service revenue, core adjusted EBITDA and cash flows. And positioned us to raise our guidance across the board just 1 quarter into the year. Our team is excited to carry all this momentum through the rest of '22 and I'll let Peter take you through our key financial highlights from Q1 and our increased guidance in more detail. Peter? Peter Osvaldik : All right. Thanks, Mike. As you can see, we started off 2022 with very strong Q1 results. Our industry-leading growth in postpaid customers and highest postpaid phone ARPU growth in the last 5 years resulted in the best postpaid service revenue growth in the industry, up 9% year-over-year. That strong service revenue growth, combined with our continued execution on our merger synergies, delivered year-over-year core adjusted EBITDA growth of 10% compared to the year-over-year decline in EBITDA that you see from others in our industry. That growth and profitability fueled higher operating cash flow even with higher merger-related costs and enabled us to deliver industry-leading growth in free cash flow of over 25% while accelerating our CapEx investments in the network. So let's talk about how our great execution in Q1 set us up to raise guidance across the board for 2022. We now expect total postpaid net additions to be between 5.3 million and 5.8 million, up 300,000 at the midpoint, reflecting our ongoing focus on profitable growth with our Magenta brand as we continue our accelerated Sprint customer migration. We continue to expect roughly half of postpaid net adds coming from phones for the full year more weighted to the second half, with the Sprint migration impacts more in the first half and expansion in smaller markets and rural areas building throughout the year. Consistent with Q1, this net adds guidance does not include the small subset of customers who will not migrate upon the sunset of the Sprint networks which will be treated as a base adjustment. As we began the CDMA sunset at the end of Q1, we took an adjustment of 212,000 postpaid phones, in line with what we had guided, as well as 349,000 postpaid other devices which were largely low ARPU IoT devices. We expect to begin the LTE sunset at the end of Q2 and estimate a base adjustment of approximately 300,000 postpaid phones and between 700,000 and 900,000 lower ARPU postpaid other devices. The anticipated impact of these adjustments is relatively immaterial and fully incorporated into our core adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow guidance. Turning to core adjusted EBITDA. We now expect full year 2022 to be between $25.8 billion and $26.2 billion, up more than 10% year-over-year at the midpoint which is up $150 million from the prior guidance, driven by our growth in service revenues and merger synergies and excludes leasing revenues which we continue to expect to be between $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion as we transition Sprint customers off device leasing. We now expect merger synergies to be between $5.2 billion to $5.4 billion, up $150 million at the midpoint and weighted to the second half of the year, primarily as we unlock more network savings as site decommissioning accelerates. As a result of timing of synergies within the year, the impacts from the Sprint network onset and an expected slight sequential decline in wholesale revenue, we expect core adjusted EBITDA in Q2 to be similar to Q1 and then higher in the second half. Merger-related costs not included in core adjusted EBITDA are still expected to be between $4.5 billion and $5 billion before taxes, primarily representing network activities. We expect slightly over 1/3 of the total to occur in Q2 and then taper off in the second half of the year as merger-related costs precede synergy realization. Net cash provided by operating activities, including payments for merger-related costs, is now expected to be in the range of $15.7 billion to $16.1 billion, up more than 10% year-over-year at the midpoint which is up $100 million from the prior guidance. With the robust pace of our 5G deployment and network integration, we now expect cash CapEx to be between $13.2 billion and $13.5 billion which is up $100 million at the midpoint as we capitalize on growth opportunities and enhance the customer network experience. Together, we now expect free cash flow, including payments for merger-related costs, to be in the range of $7.2 billion to $7.6 billion which we raised $50 million at the midpoint. This is up more than 30% over last year even with the higher levels of investment and does not assume any material net cash inflows from securitization. We continue to expect our full year effective tax rate to be between 24% and 26%. And additionally, as we execute our strategy to continuously deepen our cap relationships, we now expect full year postpaid ARPA to be up 2%. As Mike also mentioned, we expect postpaid phone ARPU to be up approximately 1% for the full year, driven by continued customer adoption of value-add services, including Magenta MAX. And finally, with the shutdown of the Sprint CDMA and LTE networks, certain wireline assets acquired in the merger will no longer support the wireless business, triggering an impairment analysis. As a result of the wireless network shutdown, we anticipate a noncash impairment charge in the range of $400 million to $500 million in Q2. The cessation of wireless traffic also enables monetization of certain wireless assets to the wireline assets which were previously supporting the wireless traffic. Any cash monetization of these wireline assets would be recorded as gains in future periods if they occur. Altogether, we see 2022 as another year of profitable growth and free cash flow expansion as we continue to invest in our network and the business. What I find most exciting is our unique opportunity to unlock significant free cash flow by delivering industry-leading growth in customers, service revenue and core adjusted EBITDA. And with that, I'll now turn the call back over to Jud to begin Q&A. Jud Henry : All right. Let's get to your questions. [Operator Instructions] All right. We'll start with a question on the phone. Operator, first question, please. Operator : Your first question will come from the line of John Hodulik with UBS. John Hodulik : Two quick ones, I think. First, have you guys seen any slowdown in sort of store traffic or gross adds in March or heading into April? We heard something like that from Verizon. I just want to -- doesn't sound like it given Peter's commentary about growth accelerating through the year. And then similarly on inflation, any impact on your business from what we're seeing in the U.S. from higher inflation? Mike Sievert : We've heard some of that, too, John and not really but I'll let Jon give you a little color on what we're seeing in retail and as we engage with the consumer. And then I'll come back and talk about inflation. Jon Freier : Yes, you bet. John, yes, we're not seeing any of that. What we're seeing is a great Q1, as we've reported, with 348,000 postpaid net accounts and 1.3 million total postpaid. And when you look at what we're seeing in March and April, we're actually seeing the seasonal benefits that you would expect and actually switching and improving on a year-over-year basis. Remember, in Q1 of last year, that was the depth of the pandemic when people were kitty baring the door back in January and February of last year. And today, we're seeing the overall switching activity continuing to improve on a year-over-year basis. So when I look at traffic and I look at all the activity in the marketplace, I'm feeling really, really confident about what we're seeing. Mike Sievert : You can see that in both of our competitors having elevated churn in Q1 relative to the year ago period. It wasn't the case for us. Our churn is unfolding exactly as we've told you it would. It's driven by merger integration synergies. And we've achieved some really important milestones here on merger integration to where if you think about the customers that have transitioned, Sprint customers that are on the T-Mobile network, with all their traffic predominantly on T-Mobile, who have T-Mobile plans and T-Mobile device plans, those customers are the ones we've been telling you about the churn just like Magenta customers. And those are now 37% of our base. So we brought a substantial minority across. And that was a big factor in driving a whopping 17 basis point sequential churn improvement in just 1 quarter, exactly unfolding the way we told you it would. There's a lot of work left lot to do, obviously. 37% isn't 100%. That's going to take us some time. But it shows you that the thesis that we've been sharing is unfolding exactly as predicted. Now as it relates to inflation, I'm not sure what you're getting at but I'll talk about 2 things here, John. One is from a cost structure standpoint, as we've said in the past, our sector is actually somewhat insulated. Obviously, we need to watch labor costs and variable costs but the vast bulk of our cost structure is in long-term contracts around things like tower contracts, backhaul contracts, technology contracts, those kinds of things that are generally fixed and finite and known over a multiyear period which gives us some insulation from inflation effects. I think the larger question facing our society is what will be the impact of inflation beyond consumers? And the answer is we don't know. Right now, there's a lot of consumer anxiety about inflation. And customers have stressed out budget. What we know is that T-Mobile is famous for being the value leader. We can save a family of 4 on postpaid $900 a year, a year, every year, from switching to T-Mobile. And so as -- we'll have to watch what happens with consumer sentiment here but if it is a difficult time, there's a real opportunity for us to stand up and serve more and more people as the value leader and we'll, of course, be ready to do that. Operator : Next, we'll go to Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Phil Cusick : So speaking of inflation, AT&T is out there trying to signal prices higher and backed off a little bit on their promotions. I see your current promotions out there. Maybe talk about where you see your competitiveness versus peers and any ability to take price if needed over time. Mike Sievert : I'll start by saying our envelope of value leadership has been remarkably consistent over time. And so if you look at a multiyear arc, we offer the best value to postpaid consumers. That has been the case for the entire Un-carrier journey. And it's been about consistently the case in terms of the extent of that value leadership. Now we're always introducing new promotions. But I want to be really clear. Our strategy as a company is about showing customers the remarkable value of Magenta MAX. That's our strategy. And you can see how it's unfolding in terms of customers self-selecting up our stack to buy our best products because they are the very best expression of the very best 5G network. And that is running on all cylinders, allowing us today with the best values and with incredible promotions in the market to tell you about for the first time in the 10 years I've been here, an outlook of ARPU rising. And that was something we just did a few minutes ago for the first time in the entire decade I've been here on the strength of this strategy. And so it really shows that we can have it both ways. We can have the best value in the industry, remarkable promotions, bring competition to this market like we always have, to no greater or lesser extent than in our past, while simultaneously showcasing the incredible value of our leading 5G network in the expression of Magenta MAX and attracting customers to that best expression. So it's a really nice place to be. We like this market competitive. We know we're stewards of a healthy and vibrant marketplace that has room for all of us. But one thing is very clear. As it becomes less known, whether they're will be enough room for the Verizons, the new entrants, the cable companies, et cetera, it's very clear that our tailwinds of growth driven by our rational and well-articulated growth strategy is a real differentiator for us. And that's something that I think people need to understand as their -- investors, I know, are looking for growth but they're also looking for reliable safe bets on growth. And that's what we strive to achieve quarter after quarter. Phil Cusick : Maybe one more on revenue, if I can. You talked about wholesale revenue down a little bit in the second quarter. How do those wholesale relationships look at this point in terms of the runoff of Boost and TracFone? It seems like those are a lot more stable than we were worried about a couple of quarters ago. Mike Sievert : Yes. I'll let Mike talk about it. First, I'll just give you some context. I know a quarter ago, we talked about reaching an agreement with DISH as a path forward, that's a real win-win for everybody and that continues to be under review by the Department of Justice. But I will say we've gone forward with DISH in a very productive way and they have with us, really finding a path forward and that's been nice to see for their customers and for all of our businesses. But obviously, we have a large and diverse wholesale base and maybe I'll let Mike Katz tell you about what's happening. Michael Katz : Yes. Thanks, Mike. As Mike said, we reached an agreement with DISH. We're waiting for the approval from DOJ. But both companies are operating as if the deal is in place and that partnership has been going really well for us. A couple of things that we talked about last quarter that you've seen come to fruition this quarter. One is we reached a wind-down agreement with TracFone and you're seeing that roll through our numbers. We also reached agreements with -- extension agreements with Google which is a large exclusive scaled MVNO that's in our portfolio. And a new MVNO agreement with Altice. So we're seeing new and expanded MVNO relationships in our portfolio. And we're seeing a lot of interest and a lot of growth from the existing companies in the portfolio taking advantage of the network capacity and the network capabilities. So it's a -- wholesale has been a really strong portfolio for us. Operator : Next question will come from the line of Michael Rollins with Citi. Michael Rollins : I guess first on the fixed wireless broadband side. Can you provide an update on the experience that customers are getting in terms of download-upload reliability and what you may be seeing in terms of the early retention and satisfaction levels. And then secondly, with the financial guidance up for the year, what are the circumstances under which T-Mobile could consider beginning share repurchases during 2022? Mike Sievert : Great. I'll start on the first one and maybe ask Neville to pile in. We're really delighted with what we're seeing here. I think this product has been a fantastic showcase of what the leading 5G network can really do. And we're now operating at scale with 1 million customers. Net Promoter Scores have risen again quarter-over-quarter which is terrific to see now 3x the Net Promoter Scores of a cable company. Our download speeds meet the nationwide medians of cable companies. And that's something most people wouldn't really appreciate. Our average usage is 300 to 400 gigs per month and yet we're able to serve that with rising Net Promoter Scores. We have a tail, 10%-ish or so, that are using a terabyte per month. And so these are normative figures that you would see in an industry with a product that's really driving satisfaction. Maybe Neville, you can talk about what's behind it and add any color? Neville Ray : Yes. I mean they're great stats, right, when you look at how we are performing and competing in this broadband space. I think everybody said, what happens with 5G? Well, look at what we're doing with this in-home broadband experience. And 1 million customers now, 1 million, our first 1 million, the first 1 million. And so it's coming from just the powerhouse network we have. And I like to say we're just getting started on this 5G story. We're adding a lot of coverage. We're adding a lot of spectrum. And the sheer horsepower that we can provide off this 5G network allows us to support this great and increasing and improving experience. So we're super proud about the performance we have. Customers are really enjoying this product. And to be honest, I'll say it again, we are just getting started in this space. We have an incredible 5G network with a lot of new spectrum to come in and be dedicated on this 5G capability. And the performance and capabilities are going to continue to expand and improve. Mike Sievert : And Mike, I think you know our basic game plan here. What's fascinating about this business is we are able to offer it nationwide now across 40 million homes and compete in a relatively even basis in all parts of this country because our go-to-market plan is based on an excess capacity model. And so we aren't dedicating large sums of capital to this business. Instead, our algorithms look at normal mobile usage that's rapidly growing because of the strength of our 5G network and we expect will continue to rapidly grow. We also expect we will continue to take share. We model all that forward and find the pockets where even all those extra customers and all their extra mobile usage won't soak up the capacity of this remarkable network. That's where we approve applicants for 5G home broadband. And so that's really interesting because you have that swallow capacity. And it's just the nature of a mobile network. Our spectrum coverage is relatively consistent and therefore our capacity can be relatively consistent. But mobile usage isn't. Mobile usage is in some places and not others. You have to be everywhere to be competitive. Once you're there, you might as well light up all your spectrum. And so that's really the nature of this. And it allows us to have the economics to be able to go to market with a competitive offer for large swaths of the population and price it attractively and still make a return. Okay; you had a second question about buybacks. I have lost the office pool came in on the third question. So Peter, please tell us what to say. Peter Osvaldik : Yes, absolutely. Mike, as you said, the momentum of the business gives us a lot of confidence in that opportunity that we expressed around '23 to '25 both the free cash flow generation and the potential for returns. But with regards to timing or starting or opportunity sets, there's really no update from what we shared with you last time that we have to share at this point. Operator : Next, we'll go to Jonathan Chaplin with New Street. Jonathan Chaplin : I'm going to stick in a cheeky 3, if I may. So on fixed wireless broadband, just a follow-up on Mike's question., I'm wondering if you could give us some context on where the ads are coming from and how much of a pull-through you're seeing for fixed wireless broadband customers who weren't previously T-Mobile customers and taking mobile from you? And then you gave us some great color on how market shares are progressing in small markets in the rural. Could you give us an update on what's going on with market share in business and how you guys are tracking towards your objectives there? And then finally, you mentioned monetizing the wireline network. Does that mean selling it? Or you just have excess capacity on the wireline network that you'll then be able to fill up with new wholesale deals? Mike Sievert : Are you sure you don't want to ask you about top 100 or Sprint integration because that would cover all of the -- okay. Great, Jon, well, let's try to hit those in rapid fire. First on fixed wireless, maybe Mike, you can give us a little color on where the customers are coming from. And then Jon get ready to tell us about small markets and rural areas and what's going on there. Michael Katz : Yes. Thanks, Jonathan. As Mike said a second ago, because we're deployed nationally with fixed wireless, really the customers are coming from everywhere. You're seeing customers in top 100 where we are now providing a competitive choice to cable. You're seeing them in Smyrna, where oftentimes we're the only high-speed wireless alternatives in those communities. You're seeing good growth in business. So it's really across the board. And our growth is following the network expansion that Neville just talked about. So as the network expands and we have more capability, we have more sectors with capacity, we'll continue to see growth. All of that combined puts us on a really good trajectory to the 7 million to 8 million customers we talked about in 2025. I think we're in a good pacing to meet that objective. Mike Sievert : Great. And Jon and Callie, you get ready. And also not only has Jonathan been asking about it but also Roger Entner is asking again about business, what's going on with market share? What kind of customers are we winning? But Jon, small markets in rural areas. Jon Freier : You bet. So just to remind everybody, smaller markets in rural areas, everything outside of our top 100 market is approximately 40% of the U.S. marketplace. So we started this journey back in 2020 at 13% market share. And we finished at the end of 2021 at 15% market share. So in very short order -- percentage points in smaller markets and rural areas. And what you've seen in Q1 is a plan that's unfolding exactly like we expected which is 40% up on the new accounts that we've established on a year-over-year basis in smaller markets in rural areas. So I'm feeling really good about that, the network expansion, the distribution expansion, bringing that winning formula that we're famous for in the smaller markets and rural areas. We still have a lot of opportunity. When you think about what Neville and his team have done from a 5G coverage perspective, I mean it's just amazing that our 5G coverage geographical footprint in smaller markets and rural areas is more than the combination of AT&T and Verizon. We're 30% larger geographically than AT&T, 4x larger geographically than Verizon. So we're feeling really good about what we're doing there. People need choice in these areas. Of course, when you think about it, I've said this a couple of times, it really is in so many of these places to trip back to the 1990s with just a couple of choices. And when you bring real competition in these spaces, customers are choosing us at rates that we've expected and we're seeing today. What's going on in business? Callie Field : All right. Well, listen, we gave ourselves a pretty bold aspiration to be at 20% market share in 2025. And I'll tell you, when share rates today, we're already on track. There's still room to run. We've got strong momentum in the financial sector. We're expanding the number of large multinational banks relying on T-Mobile for security, for compliance, for their hybrid workforce. Our network performance is a catalyst for over 31st responder agencies to join T-Mobile in Q1. As Mike mentioned earlier, we launched our first 5G connected cars in the United States with Magenta Drive for BMW. We also launched TIoT in partnership with DT which is a disruptive solution that allows enterprises to access seamless global connectivity. Customers like Biotronic, a leading global medical device company that uses TIoT to monitor their patients all around the world. This was the ninth consecutive quarter of growth of over 200,000 connections in the public sector. One of our new customers is the U.S. Department of Treasury. So we're seeing a lot of growth, really good traction. We've got a lot of work to do. We've got runway ahead of us. We're leveraging our 5G network advantage, enabled already to have active deployments in over 20 trials in advanced network services. So we're very excited about the growth potential that we see there above the plan that we've already stated that we would deliver. Mike Sievert : One of the things -- reasons I made my joke at the beginning is you were asking about all of our growth objectives. And before we ask Peter to wrap up on wireline, I just want to remind everybody that what you just heard from the team is that we are absolutely on track with the bold aspirations that we shared now more than a year ago with you as we laid out our multiyear plan on this business. And what's interesting about us that makes us so different as a growth bet is that we have a rational, articulated growth strategy based on proven areas of underpenetration where we know we have opportunity and where we are making down payments and are very much on track. And that's what investors should be asking us about. So I just want to make sure everybody is reminded that we have major underpenetrated opportunities in small markets and rural areas, 40% of this country where we've already grown from 13% to 15% share and we're tracking beautifully. We have major underpenetrated segments in business, a huge part of this marketplace and probably growing in the wake of the pandemic where we're very underpenetrated and where Callie just reminded us, our present performance would get us to those multiyear aspirations. We articulated a huge opportunity in high-speed Internet and now 2 quarters in a row have showed you that we're the nation's fastest-growing broadband provider. Our top 100 markets where we lead the industry are also a big opportunity. And you're going to hear us talking more and more about the growth trajectory that we see with prime consumers and quality seekers in the top 100 markets. Despite our leadership, there are tens of millions of people in the top 100 markets who've never given T-Mobile a serious look because they want the best network. Now that we offer that, there's a huge opportunity for us to unlock there and you'll be hearing more about that. And then finally, Sprint integration. I already told you that Sprint integration is a growth tailwind. If Sprint was churning like T-Mobile, we'd be at 900,000 phone net adds this quarter. And we're making the progress that we promised you with one of the biggest sequential churn reductions this industry has ever seen, our best one in 7 years, a whopping 17 basis points quarter-over-quarter, all on the strength of executing like we said we would on a major growth trajectory. So that's one thing I want to make sure to remind people about. And then finally, big question was about wireline, what's going on there? What are the opportunities that we see? What were you really talking about? Peter Osvaldik : Yes. Exactly, Jonathan. So yes, as we see the wind down of the wireless traffic when we shut down the LTE network, that does create capacity on the wireline side. And of course, from a customer perspective, we'll look at what's the right suite of products and services, particularly in the 5G era to serve all their needs. But with the traffic going away, it does create some opportunity for monetization. So we'll rationalize things like buildings. We'll rationalize routes. And there's other things that have become quite valuable now in the form of, for example, IPV4 addresses that with the wireless traffic going away are potentially monetizable for us. So we'll look at the right suite of products and services and monetization opportunities to create the most shareholder value, as you would expect of us. Mike Sievert : Okay. Terrific. Before we go back to the phones, obviously, we've got questions coming in on Twitter. We usually get interesting ones from Bill Ho. I see one want to hear Neville about network. It looks like we're up again in 5G reach out to 315 million people. Where is that really going? And where are we on ultra-capacity 5G? Can you forecast for us what to expect there because that's the real game. Neville Ray : Yes. Love the question, Bill. It's 315 million on our 5G footprint today. I mean, say, the headline, again, 95% of all Americans are covered with T-Mobile's 5G service, more coverage than AT&T and Verizon combined. That's something to sink in. But I love your question is about where do we go from there? I almost want to say we've got to give the competition a chance. We're so far in front. You're asking what happens at the end of '23 and beyond. And of course, we will continue to expand and improve the quality of this network. We've said 300 million people from the 225 million today will be covered with 5G Ultra Capacity. And so that's our end of '23 target. That's way over and above anything that AT&T and Verizon have stated around their ambitions on mid-band rollouts. I think the outer edge there is 250 million. So we're going to be providing way more coverage. But the other piece, Bill, is a lot more spectrum. And so today we have more dedicated 5G spectrum than AT&T and Verizon combined in play. And really, we have just started on that rollout of mid-band and even low-band 5G spectrum. So over the next couple of years, a lot more spectrum coming. The last part of your question was about what's happening with speeds. Are we hitting kind of the 300 to 400 megabit per second speeds that we planned and anticipated. Yes, we are on that mid-band footprint. And that mid-band footprint is going to get bigger and stronger. The lanes are getting wider and faster. We're hitting more and more parts of the country. Many of those opportunities that Mike and Jon just outlined, where we are bringing a massive multi-lane 5G freeway to town. This is going to be an incredibly exciting journey over the next couple of years. And of course, we won't stop there. We'll continue to improve and enhance the network but I don't have any stats to give you above 300 million yet on Ultra Capacity. Mike Sievert : It's very interesting what's happening here. You've heard us say before that we see that we're 2 years ahead in the 5G race now. And 2 years from now, we'll be 2 years ahead in the 5G race. And that's not a quip, that's not a competitive quip. That's actually an aspiration that we take very serious. And you just heard Neville say that by the end of this year, we'll reach 260 million people with Ultra Capacity. That's an aspiration that Verizon has by the end of '24, except only 250 million. But by the end of next year, we'll be at 300 million. And what's interesting is our goal is that in many places, it's not just to have 300 million people deployed but in many places to have fully 200 megahertz of 5G dedicated spectrum. That's remarkable in terms of what we can do to change customers' experiences on smartphones, to serve enterprises, government customers and, of course, broadband and other new applications. And so that's our aspiration. We take it very seriously. And one of the things you should judge us on is, have we been through over and over and over again to the things that we said we would go do. Because we've been very clear-eyed about this strategy for many years and I think that consistency is something that people should acknowledge. Operator : Next question will come from the line of Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson. Craig Moffett : I'm going to stay with this topic of rural markets for a minute. You've talked about this being 40% of the country. And I think last quarter, you gave some interesting color on how you can even further segment that 40% of the country into areas where you've already introduced retail stores and presumably come in behind low-frequency spectrum with some mid-band filling in some of the denser areas of those otherwise non-dense markets. Could you just sort of talk about the segments within the 40%? Sort of how much is left that is sort of truly greenfield, I guess, in the sense that you really haven't gotten there yet with a real retail presence? And where even that 15% market share that you talked about may be quite a bit lower? And then in the areas that are a little more mature within the 40%, what that looks like? Mike Sievert : Absolutely. I'll start and then I'll ask Jon Freier to jump in and maybe Neville as well. I'll remind you of a couple of things that we've said in the past and something I said in my prepared remarks. What we do for this 40% of the country, we call it our precision playbook. We've divided that segment of the country into 775 submarkets. And what we do is study our relative competitiveness. And so it starts with the network. Is our network every place people in that local area need for us to believe that we have all the factors of success required to win market share. Now this is observable because we are number one in many places in this country. We know what it takes. And we take that same observable logic and we apply it now to places we were never highly competitive. And what we've said in our upfront remarks is that we believe we are competitive across about 30% of those places, the POPs represented by those places. And that will be competitive across about 50% by the end of this year. Now, I'll guide you. There are some layers of competitiveness. That's sort of our base level and above. And there's levels that we can get to above that. But we measure that number because what we see is when we have that level of competitiveness, what we call right to win, we are able to see win shares in line with our aspirations such that we know that the price that we promised you is within reach. And that's really important. So again, we're in those 30% of POPs where we already have a right to win, we are winning. And so that gives us a lot of confidence in this strategy. We'll be at 50% by the end of this year. And maybe, Jon, you can talk about what's going on as we enter each of these markets, what formula we bring to make sure that we get the win share that's required for us to grow our market share. Jon Freier : You bet. So that's what Mike just said in terms of really staying focused on this overall cocktail and proven recipe of success when you think about network readiness, distribution entry and then really bringing this differentiated localized marketing to the markets to go in and drive choice and consideration of some of those things. The other thing, too, that I don't think I've mentioned is that we took an opportunity last year to reorganize a huge portion of our company around smaller markets and rural areas. So I've got teams all across the country that are focused on the top 100 markets and exclusively on the top 100 markets. So you think about right here in New York City, L.A., Chicago, Dallas, those teams are focused on those markets. And then also we took a big portion of our team and focused them on smaller markets in rural areas. So for example, if you're in Washington State, we got a team that's focused on greater Seattle, Tacoma and then another team that's focused on rural Washington state, driving the commercial success that we're looking for in those particular areas. And what we've seen is that when you focus teams and give them the kinds of tools that they need to go drive the commercial success we're looking for and all of the accountability, we're beginning to see real traction around that. And what that does, too, is it creates an overall kind of feedback loop and listening system within our company so that we can go and take further action where we have more network that we need to really kind of dial in, in a particular area. If we need more marketing in a particular area, the network is really good but we need a little bit more investment from a market perspective, we get that real feedback. When you have a team that's focused on a total geography, including the top 100 markets, almost always the top 100 markets take that focus because of the tonnage of the population in those areas and on the established muscle memory. And so that's a big part of our formula that we are executing today that we put into place last year and something that's proven to be really successful. And like we talked about, too, when you look at this accelerated build-out of what's coming, thanks to Neville and his team, with not only extended range 5G but that Ultra Capacity 5G and the majority of the growth that's going to be happening in terms of covered POPs, it's going to be in smaller markets and rural areas, that's one more big reason why we need to be organized the way that we are to drive the playbook that we've laid out for you. Mike Sievert : A lot of times, our breakthroughs come from willingness to lead things in an unconventional way like with team of experts a few years ago and Jon just told you about another big breakthrough management concept that we've fully implemented across the country that we think is a big part of our, I guess, now not so secret sauce. Great. And by the way, so before we go back to the phones, Neville back to you. There's a question from Tech Life Channel, Techlife32, What's going on with those 10,000 new sites because 5G coverage is great but what about coverage? So what's happening with our promised site expansion? And while you're at, we did say in our prepared remarks where we are on decommissioning. This is the year of decommissioning. We expect to complete the task this year. Maybe you can give an update on how that's going, too. Neville Ray : Yes, sure. Thanks, Mike. And let me build on both your and Jon's comments on SMRA. I mean back to the last call, our last earnings call, we talked about how this was the year where we were accelerating capital and we were bringing in incremental investment into the plan in '22. And the big, big chunk, lion's share of that is focused on expansion of our coverage and our footprint. And so a big part of what we're doing is making sure as Jon is getting ready to roll in distribution and new capabilities into the smaller market and rural areas, we're making sure our coverage is second to none. On top of the coverage, of course, Jon referenced this, we're adding this mid-band capability. So that we don't just have a great network, we have an incredibly strong network with 5G capabilities that our competition simply can't match. And just to navigate through some of the stats we talked about earlier on, in many of these small markets and rural areas, AT&T and Verizon have no plans whatsoever to bring mid-band capability in 5G. So we're going in, putting in a very differentiated proposition and one that will stand the test of time. And so that share gain is getting started and moving. It's a super exciting space. So we've always said 10,000 new sites is part of the plan as we combine the sets of assets together. And we're eating into that in 2022. We're a couple of thousand in and we'll be continuing to build as we move through this year and next. We're also upgrading a lot of Sprint sites that are critical to enhancing coverage and performance across the network. So we've always said north of 10,000 of those. We're about 1/3 of the way through that build. And so we're adding coverage in many, many dimensions, both in SMRA but also in core market areas. And inside top 100, too, where we're adding great sites for capacity in building all of those different aspects of performance. And last but not least, Mike asked about reference decom. And so this is the year where we will complete all of the decom that we said we would do as part of combining Sprint and T-Mobile together. And we announced in the release, we're about 1/3 of the way through at the end of Q1 on the 35,000-site decom ambition. And that number is accelerated and it will accelerate heavily as we go through Q2 and Q3. We want to get the lion's share of that done earlier in the year, this isn't all going to happen in Q4 and we're making great progress and, I'd add, as we see declining churn. And so the work and the intense work across the entire business to manage the customer experience as we navigate and work through decom is extraordinary and going very well. And we're incredibly confident about our ability to execute and complete this integration in advance of the time frames that we talked about prior. Mike Sievert : Neville and his team are very busy. This is, as you know, the peak capital year in our business plan. And we have teams that are upgrading literally hundreds and hundreds of sites every single week. In a year, we're going to simultaneously reach 260 million people with Ultra Capacity 5G while completing the shutdown of the Sprint network well and ahead of our schedule. So it's a -- and we're very much on track. And it's fantastic to see the team's execution in every part of this country. Operator : So next, we'll go to Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Brett Feldman : And this is actually sort of a follow-up to what you guys were just discussing. So we look at your results for the first quarter and your cost of service, excluding merger-related costs, actually downticked a bit despite the fact that you had, I think, a new tower lease in place, despite the fact that you still had the CDMA network up and running, I think, for essentially the entire quarter. And as Neville just pointed out, you still have the large majority of the decommissioning in front of you but of course you're also still investing. So I guess the question really would be, how should we think about the opportunity and the pace of further improvements in that cost item throughout the remainder of the year? And maybe at what point would we expect to see the full synergy benefit of having completed the network projects in your cost of service line item? And then just a second question. The comments you made before about the excess Sprint churn and how it affected your postpaid phone net adds. It sounds like that headwind has diminished a bit from what we saw in the second half of the year. I'm wondering if that's a signal that we are indeed through the peak pressure associated with that. And then just as an update on that, if you can give us some insight as to what the churn profile that legacy Sprint cohort looks like as they continue to make the migration fully over to T-Mobile. Mike Sievert : Great. I'll start with the second one and then hand it to Peter on the first one. We are delighted with what we're seeing this year on Sprint customer response to everything happening on the network and service and plan front; and you can see it in our results. So one of the things we -- I mentioned a little while ago is that right now, we're substantially complete with about 37% of the customers, bringing them what I'll call all the way across. Now the vast majority of our customers are on the T-Mobile network now, almost all their traffic is on the T-Mobile network now. We'll be moving to shut down the Sprint network this year. But we have a lot of work to do to make sure that the customers come across with T-Mobile plans, T-Mobile phone plans, no remaining leases on their line and all of their traffic on the T-Mobile side. When those things happen, churn is the same. And we have achieved that milestone now for about 37% of the Sprint base. And that's much higher than it was just a few months ago. And so you see the result in the sequential churn improvement because as more and more people achieve that level, more and more of them churn just like T-Mobile churn was. And that's what unfolded over the last quarter. And so that gives us a lot of confidence in our plan. I want to make sure that people don't connect it though to something happening just 2 months from now. I mean when we shut down the Sprint network, it's not just the network traffic. The network traffic is already on T-Mobile. It's the whole thing, getting them migrated to the right plan, the right service structure and, importantly, getting them on a T-Mobile phone payment plan and making sure there's no more leases because those are sources of dissatisfaction. And that's where we're at 37%. It will take us some time to stepwise move through the base. But what we know is that when we do, they love T-Mobile on the other hand and they churn like the lowest-churning brand over the last 2 years. And so that's fantastic. And then specifically to your first question, we'll turn it to Peter on the cost of services. Peter Osvaldik : Yes, Brett, absolutely. And you are seeing great scale, just as we promised it would unfold on cost of services. As you think about this year and the shaping, of course as you mentioned in Q2, you'll continue to have rapid investments as Neville and team continue to build these new sites, rebuild Sprint sites, while we'll continue to still have Sprint LTE cost. So as I think about the year shaping, it's very much in line with the synergy commentary that I gave, that as we go through the rapid decommissioning and accelerated decommissioning and get through all of that by the end of the year, you'll see those benefits come out in cost of services. In totality, of course, we're looking at 2024 to achieve the full $7.5 billion of run rate savings. So that's how I think about the shaping for the balance of the year. Mike Sievert : It's nice to see things unfolding the way we predicted. We're very much on track for the $7.5 billion. We increased the in-year synergy attainment with this guidance. And of course, that results in also an increase in cash flows to 30% year-over-year cash flows in the present guidance. So terrific to see that happening. Listen, we promised you a 1-hour call. And so with apologies to those still in the queue, many of whom I'm really sorry we didn't get to because we love you but we'll take the last question, operator. Operator : Certainly. We'll go next to Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Simon Flannery : So great to hear the updated guidance on the net adds. If you look at the first quarter, it looks like the industry is probably going to do close to 2 million phone adds and there's been this concern about a deceleration in the industry growth. So it'd be great to get some perspective about what you're seeing and how you feel confident about not just your growth but also that the industry can sustain these sort of 8 million, 9 million type ad numbers that's sort of implied by what we've seen from the others so far? And then just, Neville, anything to comment on supply chain availability of tower crews et cetera, given again some of the macro constraints we're seeing? Mike Sievert : Let me start with Neville and supply chain and then I'll wrap things up with an answer to your question, Simon. Neville Ray : I'll be very quick, Simon. I mean we're in good shape. And based on the arrangements that we put in place with our OEMs and our tower crews. And of course, we have the advantage, we've been at this for some time now, whereas our competition is really just trying to get started, especially in AT&T's case. So we're strong. Obviously, we are not sitting on our hands and we are very, very closely managing supply chain. Our position does not come from inaction and just letting it happen. We're very engaged with all of our suppliers across the U.S. and both internationally. And right now, we're in good shape. And you can see in terms of the performance and growth on the network and the investments we're making. Mike Sievert : Simon, I'm glad you asked that because your question goes -- in my mind, it goes right to the heart of what a lot of people want to know about this sector right now. And I would characterize it really in terms of 2 important questions people have. One, is there room for everybody? What's going -- can this growth continue? What's going to go on when the growth slows down? And if it slows down, will it get unhealthily competitive? Those are the big questions, I think, on people's minds. And I got to tell you, I'm not concerned about those questions. As I've said in the past, first of all, I think what we're seeing is some of that is happening in the dynamic right now out there. And in the very time frame when people are asking these questions, they're asking, \"Hey, how are you going to navigate if things slow down?\" We delivered 1.3 million postpaid net adds, the best in 8 years, more than AT&T and Verizon combined. In the very time frame when people are saying, what about are things slowing down? How are you guys going to do if things slow down? And I love that you're asking that because it reminds everyone listening that this is a business with major underpenetrated growth opportunities that we are proving we know how to execute against. And that's why we reliably bring the performance quarter after quarter. And to the second question people have which is, isn't it going to get crazy out there if there isn't room for everybody? Which is I don't know but I can tell you that the amount of competitiveness that we bring is consistent over time. We are the competition. We like it competitive. It's been relatively consistently competitive through our actions for years now. Customers and businesses are the beneficiaries. Right now, the cost per unit in this industry is lower for consumers and businesses than it's ever been, in a time when every other category has rising prices. We're driving ARPU improvements without price improvement. And we're bringing a level of competitiveness to this industry that's so exciting for consumers and businesses while delivering on financial performance that we promised you and then some. And so people have these 2 questions. Is there room for everybody? I don't know. That's not -- I'm not burdened with that. I can tell you that this quarter it looks like there is. Cables about to report, I think they had a healthy quarter. We're going to see nice numbers there. Our telemetry has usually been pretty good at predicting what to see there. But we delivered an 8-year Q1 all-time almost high. And that shows you that our growth strategy has integrity and it's reliable, safe, quarter-after-quarter growth that comes in just like we promised you it would. And it comes in with a healthy industry and a dynamic where T-Mobile can achieve its cash flow aspirations. And so look, we like it. We look at the industry. We know we play an important role as stewards of a healthy industry and we think it's a healthy industry. And whether or not it's a healthy industry, it's going to be an industry that's healthy for T-Mobile. So you got to think that in all the time that you have, we really appreciate you. Thanks for coming quarter after quarter with your great discussions. And we look forward to engaging with you more. Appreciate it. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the T-Mobile first quarter earnings call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect and have a pleasant day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. [Operator Instructions] And via Twitter by sending a tweet to @TMobileIR or @MikeSievert using #TMUS. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jud Henry, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations for T-Mobile US. Please go ahead, sir. Jud Henry : All right. Welcome to T-Mobile\u2019s Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Joining me on the call today are Mike Sievert, our President and CEO; Peter Osvaldik, our CFO; as well as other members of the senior leadership team. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, which involve a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. We make -- we provide a comprehensive list of risk factors in our SEC filings, which I encourage you to review. Our earnings release, investor fact book and other documents related to the quarter, as well as reconciliations between our GAAP and non-GAAP metrics can be found on the Quarterly Results section of the Investor Relations website. Also, we are in a quiet period for Auction 108, so we cannot discuss or comment on anything related to the 2.5 gigahertz licenses. And with that, let me turn the call over to Mike. Mike Sievert : Okay. Thanks, Jud. Good morning, everybody. Well, you can see, if you are watching us live on the web stream, we have got most of our senior team here in New York City today and we are here to share our Q2 results and I am extremely proud of our team for delivering another quarter of great results while completing major integration milestones. Q2 was another strong quarter of industry-leading growth for us in customers, postpaid service revenues and EBITDA, and based on our momentum, we are raising our full year guidance across the board again. This just shows that the Un-carrier playbook, putting customers first and providing them with the best value and the best network, continues to work in a competitive climate and in the changing macroeconomic environment. Before I go into our results, I do want to take a moment to acknowledge this challenging economic climate for consumers and businesses and what T-Mobile is doing to help customers stay connected. Inflation has been dominating headlines and dinner table conversations. It\u2019s a reality that millions of American families are facing as prices every day for essentials are skyrocketing all around them. That\u2019s why we did what the Un-carrier does best with three big moves last quarter to help customers when they need it most. Prioritizing customers\u2019 needs is exactly what continues to fuel our growth. Others in the industry notified their customers that their already overpriced bills are going up when they could least afford it. Naturally, some have asked when will T-Mobile raise its rates. Well, building on our proud history as the Un-carrier, our answer is that we are not. Instead, we introduced price lock. We are standing by our commitment to customers and those who switched to T-Mobile that we won\u2019t raise the price of their rate plans. We are here to help broadband customers across the country as well with our recent launch of Internet Freedom. Broadband customers are some of the least satisfied in America, the fees, the contracts, the price hikes, the terrible customer service, it\u2019s all ridiculous and it looks a lot like the wireless industry a decade ago. But it\u2019s all changing because we are making it easy for customers to break up with big Internet, lock in their price and finally feel appreciated. And we made T-Mobile Business Internet available nationwide, which makes T-Mobile the first and only nationwide Internet provider for business. And third, we saw another opportunity to help customers as travel is on the rebound. But like everything else, travel has become more expensive and more complicated. So T-Mobile launched Coverage Beyond to help people get back out there and save money while doing it. We have got customers covered across the U.S., on their airline flights, on the road and in more than 210 countries and destinations. This is what the Un-carrier is all about, chasing down customer pain points and smashing them, and right now, with this economy, there are a lot of pain points out there. And you know what? This strategy works again and again. We delivered another industry-leading quarter of both customer and financial growth. In fact, we posted a record 380,000 postpaid account net adds. The highest in company history and the highest reported in the industry yet again. As I have said before, this measure of total billing relationships is a strong barometer that we are winning the switching decisions in this industry. I know the competitive market trends are top of mind and here\u2019s what we saw in Q2. Postpaid switching activity increased year-over-year and we benefited from more than our fair share of those switching decisions. Importantly, our network and brand are consistently attracting the industry\u2019s best customers, driving the prime mix of our customer base to an all-time high. And we delivered our highest ever Q2 postpaid net additions with an industry best 1.7 million, more than AT&T and Verizon combined again. This includes 723,000 postpaid phone net adds. Our postpaid phone churn dropped 13 basis points sequentially to 0.80 and we were the only wireless service provider to improve year-over-year. In fact, delivering lower churn than Verizon for the first time ever on a combined basis including Sprint. The fact that our all-in churn, including Sprint, is trending so strongly just two years out from our merger shows our team\u2019s fantastic progress and it is exactly what we told you would happen. Okay, let\u2019s talk about high-speed Internet, where our team delivered 560,000 net additions. I am pretty confident that we will see T-Mobile as the fastest growing broadband provider in the industry for the third consecutive quarter and most likely by a wide margin. Demand continues to build from dissatisfied suburban cable customers to underserved customers in smaller markets and rural areas. I am so excited to see our broadband business hit this pace, which puts us right on track to meet the multiyear ambitions we shared with you last year. We continue to see great customer adoption of Magenta MAX, which is helping drive our strong ARPU and ARPA trends. With the trends we are seeing, we now expect postpaid ARPA to be up roughly 3% in 2022. These results reflect our differentiated strategy to unlock growth across smaller markets and rural areas, T-Mobile for Business, network seekers in the top 100 markets who hadn\u2019t previously considered us and in new product categories like 5G broadband. They also reflect the strength of our network leadership, as supported by nearly every third party. Recent reports from Ookla and PC Magazine not only recognize T-Mobile for the fastest and most available 5G network, but for the best overall network experience. And OpenSignal recently reported that not only did our average speeds increase yet again, the gap over the competition widened even further despite their C-band deployments. We are winning this race, and as I have been telling you, we plan to stay ahead. And speaking of network, we just hit some major integration milestones. Just over two years since we closed the merger, we have successfully shutdown most of the Sprint network. As of the end of the quarter, we had cumulatively decommissioned nearly two-thirds of the 35,000 targeted sites and can now report that we will be substantially complete by the end of Q3 this current quarter, remarkable work by the team to deliver these milestones ahead even of our recent year-end target and more than one year earlier than our original merger plan. Before I wrap up, I want to touch on cybersecurity, following the criminal attack we experienced roughly a year ago. Protecting our customers\u2019 data is a top priority for the company, which is why following the attack we immediately took additional steps to protect our customers. We created a cyber transformation office and engaged some of the top -- world\u2019s top experts to help. We are investing hundreds of millions of dollars to enhance our data security tools and capabilities to transform our cybersecurity program. We always knew that there would unfortunately be financial consequences from this attack and we were pleased to recently reach settlements that will resolve the class actions and most of the consumer claims. Together, we believe these settlements will represent the biggest component of those impacts. These costs were contemplated in our financial guidance and the amounts are consistent with precedents we have seen in other similar agreements. We are now focused on moving forward as we continue to invest in and enhance our company\u2019s cybersecurity. Okay, let me give a quick recap before I hand things over to Peter. I am very pleased with our company\u2019s performance and progress against our ambitious multiyear goals. Again, this quarter, we outperformed against our plans, and again, led the industry in net additions of postpaid customers and growth in postpaid service revenue, core adjusted EBITDA and cash flows, and as a result, we raised our guidance across the board again. The Un-carrier value proposition resonates, and it\u2019s so well tuned to the tax. People want the best network and now more than ever they wanted at the best value from a team that\u2019s obsessed with their satisfaction. Our strategy is so simple, but maybe that\u2019s why it works quarter-after-quarter, year-after-year. Okay, Peter, over to you to talk about our key financial highlights from Q2 and our increased guidance for 2022 in more detail. Peter Osvaldik : All right. Thanks, Mike. As you can see, we delivered another strong quarter with our Q2 results. Our industry-leading growth in postpaid accounts and postpaid ARPA resulted in the best postpaid service revenue growth in the industry, up over 9% year-over-year. That strong service revenue growth, combined with our continued execution on merger synergies, delivered year-over-year core adjusted EBITDA growth of 10% for the second quarter in a row. This just highlights our profitable growth strategy when compared to the year-over-year decline in EBITDA margins that you see from others in our industry. That growth in profitability fueled higher operating cash flow and enabled us to deliver industry-leading growth in free cash flow, while accelerating our CapEx investments in the network. And finally, I wanted to highlight a few special items that impacted earnings for the quarter. As we foreshadowed last quarter with the shutdown of the Sprint network, certain wireline assets acquired in the merger will no longer support the wireless business. As a result, we took a non-cash impairment charge of $477 million on a pretax basis in Q2. In addition, we recorded a $400 million pretax charge related to the $350 million class action settlement and other expenses from the data breach one year ago, which was within our guidance expectations for the year. All right, let\u2019s jump into the details of our increased guidance across the Board for 2022. We now expect total postpaid net customer additions to be between 6 million and 6.3 million, up 600,000 at the midpoint, reflecting both the great execution of our differentiated growth strategy and progress on reducing sprint churn. We continue to expect nearly half of postpaid net adds will be coming from phones for the full year. As we mentioned last quarter, the net adds guidance does not include the subset of customers who we do not expect to migrate upon our network sunsets, which were treated as a base adjustment. As we began the orderly network shutdowns at the end of Q2, we took an adjustment of 284,000 postpaid phones, in line with what we had guided, as well as 946,000 postpaid other devices that were not practical to be upgraded. Turning to core adjusted EBITDA. We now expect full year 2022 to be between $26 billion and $26.3 billion, up more than 10% year-over-year at the midpoint and up $150 million from our prior guidance, driven by our profitable growth in service revenues and merger synergies. This excludes leasing revenues, which we expect to be between $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion, as we continue to transition Sprint customers off device leasing. We now expect merger synergies to be between $5.4 billion to $5.6 billion, up $200 million at the midpoint as we unlock more network savings driven by accelerated site decommissioning. Merger-related costs, which are not included in core adjusted EBITDA and are expected to be between $4.7 billion and $5.0 billion before taxes, primarily representing network activities. With Q2 being the peak quarter, we expect that Q3 will be closer to Q1 levels, and then taper off in Q4. Net cash provided by operating activities including payments for merger-related costs are now expected to be in the range of $16 billion to $16.3 billion, up more than 10% year-over-year at the midpoint and up $250 million from the prior guidance. Turning to cash CapEx, we now expect it to be between $13.5 billion and $13.7 billion, which is up $250 million at the midpoint with both the robust pace of our 5G deployment and our success in high-speed Internet, where we capitalize the routers. Together, we now expect free cash flow, including payments for merger-related costs, to be in the range of $7.3 billion to $7.6 billion, which we raised $50 million at the midpoint. This is up more than 30% over last year, even with the higher levels of investment and does not assume any material net cash inflows from securitization. We continue to expect our full year effective tax rate to be between 24% and 26%. And finally, as we successfully executed our strategy to continuously deepen our account relationships, we now expect full year postpaid ARPA to be up 3%. And we expect postpaid phone ARPU to be up approximately 2% for the full year, driven by continued customer adoption of value-add services, including Magenta MAX. Before I wrap up, I want to celebrate an important milestone of achieving an investment grade corporate family rating for the first time in our company\u2019s history. With the Moody\u2019s upgrade last week, in addition to our existing investment-grade rating from Fitch, T-Mobile now has investment grade ratings from two of the three top ratings agencies. This is proof of the investment community\u2019s confidence in our Un-carrier playbook, delivering on our substantial -- delivering on our accelerated merger integration and synergies, executing on our differentiated growth strategy and our ability to translate that into unprecedented free cash flow. And with that, I will now turn the call back to Jud to begin the Q&A. Jud Henry : Thanks, Peter. Let\u2019s get to your questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator, first question, please. Operator : We will go first to David Barden with Bank of America. David Barden : Hey, guy. Thanks so much for taking the\u2026 Mike Sievert : Hi, David. David Barden : Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks so much for taking the questions. So, obviously, Peter, congratulations on the IG rating. Obviously, everyone\u2019s going to want to know how that informs your plans to begin executing on the stock buyback program and kind of your maybe updated thoughts around that in light of the recent actions? And I guess, second, if I could, just on the guidance increase in core adjusted EBITDA of $150 million. With the merger synergies now going up to $200 million, 2Q results kind of being, I think, ahead of where street expectations were and in light of the new wholesale agreement that you struck with DISH, which likely means that the kind of pressure on the wholesale business is not going to be nearly as much as was feared. I guess, it sounds to me like that $150 million could be larger and if you could talk a little bit about maybe some of the reasons why it might not be larger given some of the inflation and the other pressures in the market? Thanks. Mike Sievert : I will start with the first and then, like, get Peter wound up to answer the second one. First of all, I just want to congratulate this whole team and our finance department and Peter, first and foremost, for achieving this major milestone. We have sought to be an investment-grade issuer for many years. It\u2019s been a goal of ours and now we have two of the three rating agencies. I certainly hope to see S&P soon. And that\u2019s just an exciting moment for us and particularly with what has happened this year in the high yield market, it\u2019s particularly important. As we have said all along about the share buybacks, there was no preset designated things that needed to be accomplished before our Board would deliberate on this. But with where high yield markets are right now, clearly, this is a very important milestone. Unfortunately, we don\u2019t have an update for you other than to reiterate what we told you in the past, looking at all of our momentum, our financial performance, we continue to see upwards of $60 billion in share buybacks in 2023, 2024 and 2025 in total with the possibility of beginning sooner, and absolutely, nothing has changed on that front, but we have accomplished some very important milestones toward that end. Peter Osvaldik : Absolutely. All right, Dave. And on your other question of core adjusted EBITDA and what are we seeing from inflation, what are we seeing from DISH and with synergies up $200 million and core adjusted EBITDA of $150 million, what are some of the delta items in there. So, first, just with regards to DISH, I think we are very pleased to have reached agreement, gone through all of the settlements of the disputes, as well as the CDMA shutdown and we are looking forward to being great partners with DISH in the future. The agreement, as of the struck, gives us tremendous visibility into what revenues will be in the coming years. And while that\u2019s down over Analyst Day expectations, it\u2019s about three quarters of what we anticipated at Analyst Day through the duration of the plan period, so very pleased with that. The other thing I will say from an inflation perspective, as we have talked before, there\u2019s been a great, great work by Neville and his team to early on lock in a lot of our significant cost into long-term contracts, whether that was on the CapEx side, with the OEM vendors as the network rollout happened, whether it was with tower operators, whether that was with backhaul. So we have been able to get a lot of those costs fixed. Of course, we are seeing some pressure, as everybody else is, particularly in the labor space, but that\u2019s all contemplated into the guide itself. Synergy is up $200 million is just, again, speaks to Neville and his team and how quickly they are moving on decommissioning in a very efficient and customer-friendly manner. And the other thing I will point to is, we just raised net adds guidance by 600,000 at the midpoint. So, obviously, the S part of SG&A will be the thing that we are investing in to drive that growth, as well as that quicker acceleration of the network allows Neville to continue building quicker and you have some earlier costs associated with that, which of course, pays off in the ability to acquire customers with this value prop. So those are all the components as I think about them. Mike Sievert : David, that last point is particularly important to me. As you have seen something from this report, you have seen that we have incredible momentum right now on growth. I mean more postpaid net additions than AT&T and Verizon combined, plus or including 560,000, by and large, high-speed Internet connections and those things cost us money to generate that growth in an in-period basis. So we are anticipating, as you saw in the guide, continued success there. Also, our accounting approach, as Peter has explained in the past, is a little different than our competitors. We take the preponderance of those costs in period rather than racking up millions of dollars on our balance sheet that would come in the form of negative revenue charges later. So those are some of the key things that explain the difference between the increase in synergies and the increase in EBITDA. David Barden : Super helpful guys. Thanks. Mike Sievert : You bet. Let\u2019s come back to the phones. Operator : We will go next to Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Simon Flannery : Great. Good morning. Thank you. A couple on fixed wireless, if I could. First, if you could just update us. I think, you talked about account growth being driven by fixed wireless. Can you just talk about new to T-Mobile, what\u2019s that doing in terms of pulling through phone adds and into reducing churn, what sort of impact you are seeing as this becomes a more important part every month of the base? And then, I guess, a question for Neville and a way you are at 560 this quarter, annualizing at over $2 million. It seems like it\u2019s accelerating on a steady basis. If you extrapolate that out, that takes you pretty much to the top end of that $7 million to $8 million by 2025. It looks like you could exceed it. What\u2019s your capability in terms of network capacity to handle the 5 -- more than, say, 500,000, 600,000 adds per quarter or is this going to be sort of the run rate to take us to that guidance by 2025? Thanks. Mike Sievert : Great. Well, I will jump in first and then turn it to Neville. I am so delighted with what\u2019s happening here. I mean 560,000 net adds is a run rate that, if you just do the math, it gets us to the goals that we have established. And so this is really now a run rate business that we are very excited to be seeing success around. And not a lot has changed in that it remains the case that the majority of our net additions are coming from existing T-Mobile customers. And that\u2019s terrific to see and we not only like that trend, but we doubled down on it with offers during the quarter. As you saw, Internet Freedom put in an exciting offer for Magenta MAX customers to create a bundle and we have seen the uptake of that has been really terrific. So, for example, loading of the new high-speed Internet product late in the quarter and early in this quarter has been coming in a little above $45, as compared to $49 to $50 in the base. So you see that you are getting the benefit of that bundle blended in now and most of the sales continue to be to our existing customers. That being said, it also is a terrific front door for the company and you can see that it\u2019s driving new relationships. But increasingly, those new relationships are not just stopping at high speed Internet. So they are coming in buying high speed Internet and then going ahead and switching, including Magenta MAX. So that\u2019s starting to work as a very successful cycle. Anything to add to that, Mike or Jon? Mike Katz : The only other thing I would add is we are also seeing more and more customers pick both at the point of sale. I think a dynamic that\u2019s been driven by exactly what you just said, Mike, this powerful bundling that we have done with Magenta MAX. And we continue to see growth coming from the two areas that Mike said upfront, about two-thirds coming from suburban and urban environments, where they are switching from cable, and one-third coming from rural, where we are the only high speed alternative and that\u2019s been an exciting area and pocket of growth that we will continue to expand as the network expands. A little over half were switching from cable and here\u2019s an interesting thing that came out in the Ookla study this past month. It -- and this is based on comprehensive -- it\u2019s Ookla comprehensive speed test. And for the first time, T-Mobile 5G surpassed the nationwide speeds of cable providers, looking at Comcast and Charter on cable connections as compared to T-Mobile customers on 5G smartphones, the T-Mobile customer 5G speed test nationwide median were higher and that really shows you one more data point on the competitiveness of our ability to use this network to serve high speed Internet customers. Okay, second question. Neville Ray : Yeah. Thanks. Thanks, Simon. You have opened the door for me to talk about 5G network, lots to talk about. Mike Sievert : That\u2019s all the time we have. Neville Ray : Quote-unquote, I will be brief. The in-home broadband story, it\u2019s just a tremendous testament to the progress we have made with rolling out at a really accelerated pace to our 5G network. I mean, we clearly have a very strong leadership position on 5G. It\u2019s significant. It\u2019s durable. We are here to lead on this 5G story for years to come. And so we announced in the materials today our low-band network, now 320 million people covered, 97% of all Americans. Our mid-band footprint, our ultra-capacity 5G, which is where the 5G story really comes to life, 235 million people covered well on our way to 260 million by the end of this year and that footprint covers 87% of T-Mobile customers today. So a tremendous progress, we are actually hitting some of the highest production rates in our two year history rolling out mid-band, well over 1,000 sites moved into various radio upgrades on a weekly basis inside the month of July, so real momentum across the Board. And what we can do on in-home broadband, to your question, Simon, is a real product. This in-home product is in-home broadband product is a testament to our 5G network growth. And as Mike referenced, our Ookla report, if you look at the fixed broadband industry and the median speeds, it\u2019s lower than what T-Mobile is being recorded as delivering on a median speed basis. And so it\u2019s not just about footprint, it\u2019s about capacity and the spectrum story and today we have over 110 megahertz of dedicated mid-band spectrum on average across that mid-band footprint and over 30 megahertz of extended range 5G spectrum. So 140 megahertz of dedicated 5G spectrum and it\u2019s that capability of coverage, plus 5G depth and spectrum that allows us to push into these 5G broadband stories and this growth. And we are really, I mean, we are a year into this business, Simon. We are very confident about the projections and capabilities that we have mapped out over the coming years. But this network is really starting to now gain traction. The integration with Sprint is all over by the shelving, to be honest, two-thirds of the sites have been de-commed, less than 1% of the Sprint traffic -- customer traffic now on that legacy Sprint network, high confidence. We will bring that to a close as we exit this quarter. And that\u2019s driving a ton of goodness. The spectrum that we can migrate and move across, the coverage and the capabilities that come with one very strong powerhouse network and a little over two years from when we started this process. So great progress, very confident in what we are delivering, delighted with the speeds that we are delivering on in-home broadband and I think we are bringing to the market probably the real first 5G use case. Everybody has been hunting for this thing. But in-home broadband, fixed wireless is here and it\u2019s here to stay. Mike Sievert : Simon, one of the things that Neville said, I think, has been under discussed, which is how much spectrum we have against this leading mid-band 5G footprint. There\u2019s a lot of discussion about fact that we have 235 million people covered with mid-band ultra capacity 5G as compared to 70 for AT&T, 135 for Verizon, as they begin their C-band deployments. But what\u2019s really interesting is what Neville said about the depths of spectrum across that 235 on average. He said 110 megahertz of mid-band, plus 30 of low band, 140 dedicated to that 5G layer, and that\u2019s unique and it will be unique for some time to come. And it really allows for the kinds of capacity throughput and performance that we have been talking about on this call. It opens up not just high speed Internet opportunities but really exciting opportunities in the business space that our competitors can issue press releases around, but where we are ready to execute and support businesses right now with advanced network 5G services. So we will talk more about that later. But thanks for your question about that. Simon Flannery : Thank you. Mike Sievert : Okay. Next caller. Operator : We will go next to John Hodulik with UBS. Mike Sievert : Hey, John. John Hodulik : Thanks. Good morning, guys. Two issues or two areas I\u2019d like to explore. First, on the macro side, Mike, you said the consumer is feeling some pressure. I mean any impact so far in terms of slower payment or on bad debt? And are you seeing any evidence that your value proposition is actually driving some flow share versus your competitors? That\u2019s number one. And then I thought the highlight of the quarter was the phone churn 80 bps. Any color you can give in terms of the disaggregating, what you are seeing on the Magenta side or on the Sprint side, and how close are we to getting that Sprint churn down to where we are with Magenta and further improvement in that metric? Thanks. Mike Sievert : Yeah. Absolutely, John. Well, first, let me just take the first question on what we are seeing. You saw that our bad debt returned to more historic levels this quarter and we are very comfortable with it at this level. One of the things that makes us different than our competitors in this space is we have a long history and a deep confidence at dealing with customers who have variable economic circumstances. And so it\u2019s not new for us that some customers are stressed up financially. We know how to work with them on that front and you have seen our bad debt levels return to more historic rates. There have been other things driving that debt as well. One of the things you see is that our EIT balances continue to rise. And in EIT balances, when those go bad, it hits that bad debt metric as opposed to leasing, which we have been rapidly moving customers off does not. So there\u2019s an artifact there. There\u2019s also some accounting artifacts that cause us to be more forward looking in our bad debt charges now than before, plus the return to more historic norms. Long way of saying, we are very comfortable with where it is and we know how to execute in this environment. But to your point, it\u2019s very interesting. There is a flight to value that I believe is beginning to happen. You see it in our suppressed churn rates as people are comfortable where they are, our progress across both T-Mobile and Sprint to the premise of your question, our net add performance, our overall account growth performance was the highest ever in our history for any quarter in any season was this quarter, 380,000 new account additions. And so there is a flight to value that is beginning to happen and T-Mobile is famous for value in our category. At a time when this product category is becoming more and more indispensable, we are famous for value while showing you that we are second to none on the quality of the product and so that\u2019s something that I think positions us very, very well for the times. On that 0.80, look, I am just so proud of the team. We told you two years ago that we would execute our worst to first playbook and a lot of people looked at us and said, yeah, but you have got Sprint now. And here we are with 0.80 in combined churn and possibly some room to run. We will see where we go. There\u2019s obviously offsetting pressures here on the involve side that all of the carriers are seeing. But we look at Q3 and it looks to us like we will be 2021 churn by a similar margin in Q3 as we beat it in Q2, mid-to-high single-digit bps improvement versus last year, and of course, there\u2019s seasonal effects in the second half of the year as switching tends to be higher due to phone launches. So we are very comfortable with what we are seeing and we believe that as we continue to get more and more Sprint customers settled with the right rate plans, which is the last component of our integration that potentially there\u2019s some more momentum to see in the quarters ahead. Anything to add to that, Peter? Peter Osvaldik : No. I think you hit it all really well. Mike Sievert : Okay. John Hodulik : Great. Thanks, Mike. Mike Sievert : Thanks, John. Okay, Operator? Operator : Yeah. We will go next to Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson. Craig Moffett : Yeah. Hi, guys. It seem we have been hitting with everybody sort of I wonder if you could reflect on the new revenue opportunities aside from fixed wireless that come from 5G, whether it\u2019s mobile edge compute, private networks, IoT? And talk about how your thinking has evolved about the size of those revenue opportunities and how it is that you think T-Mobile can most effectively compete to get what\u2019s there? Mike Sievert : You bet, Craig. Let me first start by saying, we are a lot further along in this space and in thinking around it and execution around it, then you would probably surmise from our press releases. And I will have Kelly talk about some of what\u2019s going on out there. But we are hesitant to take an early business like this and forecast it forward for you when it\u2019s in its infancy. Our competitors haven\u2019t had much choice about that, and so they have gone ahead and given some big aspirations in this area. But our view is it\u2019s an emerging market and we can achieve what we set out to achieve, generally speaking, in the core business. But that being said, there are exciting things happening, and what\u2019s interesting is this 5G network leadership is getting us conversations with CIOs, CEOs, the coroner office that our company never earned before. We were talking about smartphone plans with the procurement office two years ago and that\u2019s the big difference. And Callie, maybe you can share a little bit of what you are seeing and the kinds of conversations you and your team are having. Callie Field : Yeah. Thanks, Mike. So it\u2019s been an exciting time to spend time with CIOs and CTOs as they are looking at their own digital transformation. They are looking at their own ways to manage costs, be efficient and effective, and get connectivity that is on not only the largest and fastest, most reliable 5G network, but the only provider that has a 5G standalone port, which CIOs understand that matters to solutions like Advanced Network Services. We talked about how we launched Business Internet as a part of our Internet Freedom Un-carrier move this past quarter. But for business, this was significant because we are the only provider that truly has nationwide 5G Internet for businesses, which allows us a really great frontdoor to sit down and talk about, yes, we can connect your retail locations, working with places like Tractor Supply and Circle K and AutoZone, but we also are sitting down and talking about, hey, how can we use edge compute solutions and IoT connectivity in order to really help you solve the business problems that you are facing as leaders. We also launched or announced our relationship, our new customer, Cell GP. You don\u2019t know Cell GP, that\u2019s the world\u2019s most extreme sailing competition and we saw in the last rate 240,000 data points transferred from 6,400 sensors, and we were able to deliver up to a 50% reduction in latency. That gives athletes a competitive advantage and fans of really in view of the race, so broadcasting retail. We are also doing a lot of work with this advanced network solutions in the automotive industry. And because of our relationship with DT and our TIoT platform that we launched and told you about last quarter, we are able to provide seamless global connectivity for their B2B2C solutions, as well as for employees who are traveling internationally as a part of our last and most recent Un-carrier moves. So we have seen a lot of action. And we don\u2019t want to discount full line here. I mean we like to have the phone lines and we are seeing the lowest levels of business phone churn in our history and I think we just heard that Verizon reported some of their highest. And so we are growing in business. We are growing in enterprise in SMB and in the public sector as well and we are very interested in where we are headed with these Advanced Network Solutions. Mike Sievert : I am glad you mentioned coverage beyond and all that, too, because not only are there incredible opportunities for us to do deep services for enterprises as they look to create network-as-a-service and outsource some of that thinking to advanced networks like ours, but we are still interested in the core. And coverage beyond was an investment in something that originally put map with enterprises in the first place. Our simple global move in 2013 was our introduction to enterprise. And today, we have launched coverage beyond, which not just doubles down, it multiplies the power of that move by many times so that now business customers and consumers can travel the world and have high speed data, the highest on offer in that country completely included in our most popular plan, not low speed data and it is a breakthrough. So we are very excited about what that portends for our business customers and consumers. Neville, I will give you the last word on this question. Neville Ray : Yeah. I mean, I think, we -- I\u2019d say this, Craig. We are the best positioned company in the U.S. for all of 5G opportunities that Callie outlined. There\u2019s just no doubt. I mean, this 5G thing is for real at T-Mobile. I mean more than 50% of our entire network traffic is now on 5G, over 55%, actually and that number continues to increase as we see great engagement and great discussions with all manner of opportunities, business leaders, as well as our consumer base. And we continue to really push the 5G architecture. We are the only company, as Callie referenced, with a standalone network core. We are the only company in the U.S. to push -- to move voice services, voice over a new radio onto that 5G layer. Why is that important? Because as a company, we are a 5G business, we are not in the business yet of retiring LTE, but we are focused on that at some point in time in the coming years. This 5G network is moving at incredible pace, coverage, spectrum and architecture. And we have a lead on all corners of that dialogue against our competition, which positions us incredibly well for future growth across all segments. So delighted with our progress and the 5G story is not just beginning. I mean, we are into it at T-Mobile and the growth vectors are starting to shape up around us incredibly well. Mike Sievert : Beautiful. Okay. And before we go back to the phones, I know we have some coming in on Twitter. I see a few upfront. Janice, did you find some what we should be tackling here? Janice Kapner : Yeah. We have a couple. Let\u2019s start with Bill Ho. He\u2019s asking for some notable examples of enterprise or medium company wins from T-Mobile for Business. I know Callie may have some good things to talk about there. And to your point earlier on our coverage announcement, curious how that\u2019s impacting the business broadly both consumer and B2B? Mike Sievert : Anything to double down, I know you just kind of answered some of that. Callie Field : Right. I mean, we had did some great work with AutoZone and General Mills, we spoke, we did an interesting solution using ANS and edge compute and some smart warehousing, where we built a combination private network and public network. We have been working with a lot of global automakers using both our TIoT capabilities, as well as edge solution for vehicle-to-vehicle communication. And then another cool thing in SMB, because we are seeing a lot of growth in SMB as well, we just announced -- we partnered with Apple to launch the only wireless plan that includes Apple Business Essentials, which is really cool for small businesses to really where they are looking at cost, when they are looking at getting more efficient and effective, how they can manage all of their devices at once with an incredible rate plan and an iPhone 13 included. So that was a really big announcement recently. Mike Sievert : So lots of exciting new logos, only some of which we say because of agreements with customers. But the other thing that\u2019s happening that\u2019s really interesting is that we are deepening relationships with enterprise customers across the board. Remember, a couple of years ago, we were kind of winning some accounts along the lines of, hey, if I throw you a few of my lines kind of unofficially, will you help me re-price my AT&T business, and you will get some of my. That\u2019s never really spoken, but you can see the RFPs were sort of designed for that. And what happens now is some years later, customers are coming back and saying, actually, I\u2019d like you to bid for the whole kit and caboodle now. And so this potential to deepen with customers is really happening and that\u2019s a dynamic that\u2019s driving our sales. So, hopefully, Roger and Bill that answer some of your questions about TFP. So, Jess, get ready for the next one. I will go back to the phone while we do that. So, Operator? Operator : Yeah. We will go next to Jonathan Chaplin with New Street. Jonathan Chaplin : Thanks, guys. Two follow-ups on prior questions actually. So, Neville, I\u2019d love to just the context you gave around fixed wireless broadband and the capability for the network was great. But I am wondering if you can address what you think you can serve in terms of capacity, the capacity that you have got in terms of the total number of subs you could put on the network. I know you said in the past that 7 million to 8 million that you expect in 2025 isn\u2019t the limit. So I would love to know what the limit is. And then just to stick with the theme on enterprise for a second. I am wondering if you guys could give us a sense of how you are progressing towards that 20% share where you are at this point. And Mike, you said that you -- it\u2019s too soon to put a market sizing on the mobile edge compute and private network opportunity. Does that mean that none of that opportunity is in your long-term plan? Thanks. Mike Sievert : Great. Let me start with Peter to talk about the last two questions about the plan and the 20% share, et cetera, and then we will give it back to your earlier questions, Jon. Peter Osvaldik : Yeah. Jonathan, as you know, all of the -- because of all the reasons that Mike just described around an emerging business, while we are best positioned to capture it, it wasn\u2019t something that we built into the plan when we did Analyst Day targets, because it was too early. We didn\u2019t want to make the plan with something that we didn\u2019t have a good view and a road map to how to get the growth, but we are seeing the capitalization of that. So that is all upside, potential upside to the plan, very excited about that. In terms of progression in enterprise space, you heard Callie say we are actually, what\u2019s exciting about this is, we see growth across the entire T-Mobile for business segment. It\u2019s not just enterprise, it\u2019s government, it\u2019s SMB. So we are excited about the progression in all of those categories against our goals. Jonathan Chaplin : Great. And then how many millions and millions of customers can we support? We are not really going to be able to answer that because we don\u2019t halt? Mike Sievert : It kind of depends. One of the things that we have disclosed in the past that our model, which is an excess capacity model is based on our anticipated share gains in mobile. And the usage of our base in mobile, which we expect to continue to rise at a rapid pace arriving in this planning period at around 80 gigs per mobile customer. And maybe that will be higher, maybe that will be lower and that\u2019s obviously a very important input to this. And obviously, so is the availability of spectrum, our ability to refarm spectrum, to deploy it, et cetera. But I don\u2019t know, do you want to take a stab at answering this question or are we just going to say we don\u2019t know, Neville? Neville Ray : Well, I am not sure that we want to announce revised numbers today. So, I mean, Jonathan, you know our story well. You know the $7 million to $8 million that we put out into the marketplace some time back. But to Mike\u2019s comments just now, if you look at where we are, we are ahead on our coverage rollout on 5G, we are ahead on our spectrum transition, we are ahead on our integration goals that we established when we put that plan together. There are many factors coming in, but we see great consumer adoption on the 5G side and our capacity generation for this business is ahead of schedule. We always said that, if you compare where this business would be as a combined T-Mobile and Sprint in 2024, 2025 against the standalone T-Mobile, that multiple was about a 14x, 1-4 on capacity. We are about halfway through that already in terms of the capacity we are generating. So we are in the business of creating a lot of headroom for growth for the company. And can we bend that curve some more? I am sure we can, but we are still early into this business. As we said, we are a year in driving great numbers, and we will see, I think, as we exit this year with continued strong growth in the space, we will be in a position to look forward into 2023 and 2024 with great momentum and hopefully some stronger numbers. Mike Sievert : We have been an early adopter of so many techniques and technologies that have allowed us to unlock capabilities for our customers in the network space. And Neville and Ulf and Doel and their teams are constantly chasing new ideas and capacity is one of the centerpieces of our conversations now because of the premise of your question. So it\u2019s a topic we are very interested in. I will tell you that we won\u2019t load customers beyond where we can give them a great experience. And right now, our Net Promoter Scores continue to rise. They are 30 points higher than the competition. They are triple what they are from a provider that our customers are switching from. We just won a major nationwide survey of all ISPs that are scaled, named us the second highest in customer satisfaction in the country and number one was a fiber provider. And so our customers love this product and it\u2019s really important for us and for our brand that we continue to load customers where we know we can serve them well. And but, hopefully, that gives you some color on where we stand. Jonathan Chaplin : Fair enough. Thanks guys. Mike Sievert : You bet. We want to go on to Twitter for another one. Janice Kapner : Sure. This is a great question from Roger about churn. You are growing significantly with often free connected devices. How are you going to prevent to have the same to your churn off experience that the others are having -- have experienced when they drove connected device net adds, kind of ties to Alan\u2019s question about churn from some of the smaller players as well. Mike Sievert : Yeah. Maybe we start with Mike on this one. I will say, what\u2019s going on in the market is very different from what you saw from our competitors some years ago. There aren\u2019t, by and large, we are not, by and large, driving this through free devices or free connections. What\u2019s happening is we live in a 5G world now and people are getting real utility and value out of tablets, watches and other devices, because of the strength of our network and because of the changing lifestyles of connected lives. But, Mike, maybe you can give a little more on what we are seeing. Mike Katz : Yeah. Hey. Roger, thanks for the question. I do think in a world where people only differentiate off of giving free phones, the risk that you point out is a real one. And in our model, we recognize that a lot of the competition has moved to free devices and we feel like we have done a really good job figuring out how to deliver on free devices but not make that our big point of differentiation. Our big point of differentiation is what you have heard from several of us today, it\u2019s this value proposition that gives customers the best value without having to make any trade-offs on network and that proposition, I think, is more important now than it ever has been before, because with the macroeconomic environment, customers are looking for ways to save money and not have to make trade-offs and experience and really only T-Mobile is the one that provides that. Right now, T-Mobile customers, T-Mobile families can save $225 on T-Mobile, not just through their core wireless services, but with all the value that we pack into a plan like Magenta MAX and the included benefits that we give in things like streaming services and everything else. So I think what you are seeing is and what you will continue to see is customers picking us because we have the best overall value position, because we can save them in expenses across their entire lives and that\u2019s translating into things like you saw this quarter with sequential and big year-over-year churn decreases. And as it relates to connected devices, we are also watching usage and it\u2019s very important that those devices are actively used and paid for and they are. And so that\u2019s something that\u2019s very important so we don\u2019t get question. Okay. Let\u2019s go back to the phones. Operator : We will go next to Phil Cusick with J.P. Morgan. Phil Cusick : Yeah, guys. Thanks. Mike, you said that the prime mix is at an all-time high. What is the mix of the base, as well as in first incoming accounts or if you can give us something sort of relative? And then you talked about bad debt, and we noticed that DSO stretched out a couple of days. What changes have you seen lately in customer activity, anything you can tell us around traffic levels, lower payments or traffic and increased charge-offs? Thank you. Mike Sievert : Sounds good, Phil. So, well, let\u2019s go to Peter Osvaldik to say what we are seeing. Peter Osvaldik : Yeah. Definitely. We are not giving the prime mix of the base. Obviously, very recent, but it is up significantly. In terms of what we are seeing from a payment pattern perspective, on a year-over-year basis involve churn is up, and remember, last year was tremendously muted. There was still a lot of stimulus money. There was still not really the switching activity happening. So we are seeing what we anticipated is that you would see an increase involve churn still below pre-pandemic levels for us. And we talked about bad debt a little bit, and of course, what we did in Q2 as well is, remember, the accounting standard changed a couple of years ago and now forces us rightfully so to look forward as well. And so we did a macroeconomic loss overlay in Q2 that was significant, whereas last year, that wasn\u2019t happening. In fact, we had some releases happen as we saw involve churn way down. So I do believe Q2, of course, we are watching the macroeconomic trends very carefully and customer payment patterns and behavior, but I believe Q2, based on everything we are seeing now, was the high watermark in terms of bad debt expense for us in 2022. Again, it goes back to that tremendous core competency that we have that we actually built on even further when we saw some of the FCC holds happen, we created even further differentiated tools to help our customers and we are seeing that pay off in dividends now. Mike Sievert : And like I said in my opening remarks, we are comfortable here and increasing our EBITDA, feel confident with how we are handling the macroeconomic picture. There are places in our P&L where there are pressure points, but there\u2019s also a lot of opportunity for us to stand up and serve customers at a time when they need a company to provide them with a fantastic value. Great. Let\u2019s go back to the phone. Operator : We will go next to Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Mike Sievert : Hi, Brett. Brett Feldman : Thanks. And I have sort of two follow-ups. So you talked about migrating Sprint customers to the right rate plans. I was hoping you can maybe just give us an update, where are you in terms of migrating the legacy Sprint subs fully over to T-Mobile, when do you think that will be done and are you continuing to see the churn improvement in that cohort as that unfolds? And then the second question is, you seem comfortable with this kind of 500,000 or so fixed wireless net add quarterly run rate. What\u2019s going to be the driver of that, particularly as we think out the next few quarters? I am specifically interested in the extent to which you may be expanding distribution. I think it\u2019s available to over 40 million potential customers today. I don\u2019t know where that might go. And what are you seeing or what are you expecting in terms of fixed wireless churn? Thanks. Mike Sievert : You bet. Where do we want to start? Maybe turn to Mike on the first one. Mike Katz : Yeah. Peter Osvaldik : Mike, I can speak to that one maybe and Mike would do fixed wireless. In terms of migration of rate plans, you saw certainly in the first part of last year, as we said, we did a significant amount of the rate plan migrations to the target rate plans. There\u2019s still some more of that to go in planned, both this year as well as the start of next year, but we are through the vast majority of it. I think inferred in the question was also, when are we going through the billing migration, which we always said, was going to be disconnected from the network migration to make it a seamless to the customer as we can and that plan goes through middle of next year as we build the capabilities on and then really seamlessly convert customers, which has already begun. We are already in the process of doing that. But to make that, again, is churn friendly and as consumer-friendly as possible, that\u2019s going to go through mid-next year. And so maybe I can... Mike Sievert : Yeah. Yeah. Just on the -- it\u2019s harder to answer. You saw we didn\u2019t disclose sort of a Sprint migration figure this time only because it\u2019s becoming harder and harder to do so. As Neville said in his remarks, less than 1% of the traffic is now on the legacy Sprint network. We will be at network shutdown this quarter, having decommissioned substantially all of the sites. And so now it becomes much more of a picture of, do they have the right rate plan, do they have the right device plan, are we -- have we reengaged with them and gotten the recommitment from them, et cetera? That\u2019s a stepwise process. But you can see the incredible progress that we are making with combined churn being at 0.80. And then, as it relates to fixed wireless, first of all, what I said in my remarks was that we have achieved now a pace that if you were to extrapolate it forward gets us to our goals. That wasn\u2019t a forecast for you though. That wasn\u2019t a prediction that it will be at that pace it could be higher, it could be lower, this is an emerging business, it\u2019s going really well. And what\u2019s interesting is I don\u2019t think we have yet fully tapped our base with this potential. I don\u2019t think we have yet fully have the opportunity of prepaid with this potential, which has been newer in distribution. Jon and team have done a fantastic job bringing this to metro. TFB still represents a minority of our connections and yet we are the only one with our most recent Un-carrier move to provide a nationwide broadband service to businesses. The sales cycles there are longer. And it\u2019s a good thing that we have lots of potential tailwinds here because, obviously, as the base grows, we know that math is math and churn will grow and that\u2019s just obvious. And so we have to outrun that and then some. And we are very confident and feeling like we are in a great spot. Anything both Mike and Jon to add to what we are seeing how distribution is going, the value proposition? Mike Katz : Yeah. Maybe I will sit churn, and then Jon can talk about distribution. I think it\u2019s too early. We launched this business one year ago. So it\u2019s too early to make like big broad comments about churn. The thing that I will point to that we have said in some of our earliest comments is, NPS on this product is amongst the best and broadband providers only vested by one fiber provider by a single point. And then the performance that customers are getting is they are not making any trade-offs and I think that\u2019s one of the things that\u2019s really resonating with customers is a great price that\u2019s reliable and predictable and not making a trade-off on their incumbent service. And I think that\u2019s what\u2019s resonating with customers and that will be a big part of our strategy, is making more customers aware of that going forward. I don\u2019t know, Jon, if you want to talk about distribution? Jon Freier : Yeah. The only thing I would say is that we are still ramping in distribution. We have got this product across all of our T-Mobile stores. We have got it service from a digital point of view. Our telesales teams, et cetera. And then just most recently in the previous quarter, we announced this and launched this in Metro by T-Mobile. So we are still driving that and ramping it, like Mike said, we have got quite a bit of opportunity here still. When you think about an underserved segment like our prepaid customers with high speed Internet, so many of these customers don\u2019t even have a product, they can\u2019t get it. They can\u2019t afford it except from your typical mainstream cable provider. And what you can get with this particular product at the price point with the all-in total cost of ownership is just incredible. So we continue to see that we have more runway here. We are continuing to build that and we might have even more distribution opportunities with other partners in the future as well. Mike Sievert : And Operator, we can probably squeeze in one last question. Operator : We will go next to Michael Rollins with Citi. Mike Sievert : Hey, Mike. Michael Rollins : Thanks. Thanks. Hi. Two questions, if I could. First, just going back to the volume side of the equation, as you consider the updated postpaid net add and postpaid phone outlook, what are the expectations for the industry growth for the rest of the year and are there any notable changes in the landscape early in the third quarter? And then, separately, just maybe taking a step back, I was curious if you could give us an update on the possibility to monetize the Sprint wireline assets and if there are other considerations for T-Mobile to consider the use of M&A to accelerate the core strategy for the company? Thanks. Mike Sievert : Okay. On volume, our forecasts don\u2019t imply an industry run rate. Our job is to win switching decisions and you saw in our quarter, that\u2019s exactly what we did. And so we are not deeply dependent on industry net adds. That being said, what we are seeing is overall switching is up about 3% in the marketplace. We have not seen any substantial changes to that as we have entered into the new quarter or any other substantial changes to the overall competitive dynamics since the quarter ended. So that\u2019s what we are seeing across the Board. As it relates to Sprint wireline asset, you may have seen we made some announcements that we are no longer using that asset to support our wireless business. We are obviously conducting a review as to the best way to manage that asset. It\u2019s a terrific product with a deep, deep legacy in our company and it\u2019s important that we make the right decisions there for the long haul, taking into account how the market has changed over time. M&A, listen, you never rule that out. You never rule that out. That being said, one of the things I hope you are getting from this call is that we are very, very confident as a management team in our ability to execute with the hand we are holding. In a broad market where all content and communications have left their linear forms and have landed on the Internet, and the Internet is going mobile, we are this nation\u2019s leading pure-play mobile Internet company and we are executing very solidly for our shareholders with a clear eye towards returning value to those shareholders as a result of our efforts. And so we are very pleased with where we sit, but smart management teams never rule out ways to further benefit our position for shareholders. And that\u2019s a great place to leave it. Listen, I hope you got from this call, our confidence. We are having a lot of fun here. We are taking care of our customers. We are leading this company into a new era of the Un-carrier, and quarter-after-quarter where our aspiration is to continue to post results that increase your confidence in us as a management team. Thanks for tuning in today, everybody. Appreciate it. Jud Henry : And we can close the call. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the T-Mobile second quarter earnings call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect and have a pleasant day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon. [Operator instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jud Henry, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations for T-Mobile US. Please go ahead, sir. Jud Henry : All right. Welcome to T-Mobile's third quarter 2022 earnings call. Joining me on the call today are Mike Sievert, our President and CEO; Peter Osvaldik, our CFO; as well as other members of the senior leadership team. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, which involve a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. We provide a comprehensive list of risk factors in our SEC filings, which I encourage you to review. Our earnings release, investor fact book, and other documents related to our results as well as reconciliations between GAAP and the non-GAAP results discussed on this call can be found in the quarterly results section of the Investor Relations website. With that, let me turn it over to Mike. Mike Sievert : Okay. Thanks, Jud. Thanks everybody. Very welcome to our third quarter call and thanks for tuning in. It is so great to be back to talk about another quarter of outstanding results by this team. Our differentiated strategy is working. Our ongoing focus on delivering the best value while simultaneously capitalizing on our network leadership position has delivered another quarter of industry leading growth in customers, EBITDA and cash flow, and we are raising our 2022 guidance for the third consecutive quarter this year. All of this while completing our biggest integration milestone, I am incredibly proud of this team. As we told you when our merger closed, our plan was to expand on our fame as the industry's best value while building and becoming known for having the best network in the country, finally giving customers the ability to have both from one provider for the first time ever. Now just 2.5 years later, we're doing exactly what we planned. Our brand strength for value leadership has never been better. And it's been further aided by our competitors' price increases. And our long-established 5G lead is translating to overall network leadership for the first time and giving customers the beginnings of really a powerful network that they're really noticing. Our results this quarter are a clear demonstration of how differentiated and sustainable our growth strategy really is. Only T-Mobile has both this unique combination of network and value leadership and multiple large scale new and underpenetrated segments to tap into. To grow our business, we are also driving innovation where it matters most for customers. Through Magenta MAX, our most popular plan and the best expression of T-Mobile's 5G network, we're providing features that are meaningful to customers in their daily lives like with the recent addition of Apple TV+ and our Un-carrier move, Coverage Beyond. Well, we're not just keeping people connected on the ground, but also in the air and when they go abroad. With the launch of Easy Switch and Network Pass, we're making it simple and risk-free to experience our network and make the switch to T-Mobile. It has long been established that T-Mobile is the 5G leader. But with the rapidly growing adoption of 5G by consumers and businesses, we're now seeing that 5G lead translate into overall network leadership. And to back it up, we're beginning to win more third-party recognition for our network leadership from multiple third parties like Ookla, umlaut and PC Magazine. This is precisely the network evolution that we planned. We knew that 5G leadership would eventually translate into overall network leadership, and that's exactly what is now unfolding. And speaking of network, we just hit our biggest merger integration milestone. By the end of Q3, we had successfully decommissioned substantially all targeted Sprint macro sites, more than a year earlier than our original merger plan. And our Ultra Capacity 5G now reaches 250 million Americans. Think about that. Today, we're already where Verizon hopes to be more than two years from now. And we're not stopping. We recognize the importance of coverage to customers, and we will continue to pursue more opportunities to ensure our network is there for them whenever and wherever they need us. This lean and data informed customer driven coverage approach will guide us as we enhance and expand our network to even higher levels and in a capital efficient way using our spectrum resources. We also recognize that there are some places where it's just not practical for any wireless operator to build a terrestrial network. But because we want T-Mobile customers to have peace of mind that we have them covered no matter where they go, in Q3, we announced our joint effort with SpaceX to do just that, combining a slice of our mid-band spectrum that's already compatible with existing customer devices with next-gen satellite technology from SpaceX. Our goal is for T-Mobile customers to be connected anywhere in the U.S. where they can see the sky. Overall, this differentiated growth strategy and emerging network leadership produced another quarter of truly differentiated results. So let's get right into them. In Q3, we posted a record 394,000 postpaid account net adds, the highest in company history and the highest reported in the industry again. Winning the switching decisions in this industry and growing share through our core growth strategies I've outlined for you many times is the central growth ambition of our company. In this quarter, we did that better than ever before. In addition, our network and value proposition are consistently attracting the industry's best customers, which is contributing to an all-time high in our customer prime mix. And we delivered an industry-best 1.6 million postpaid net additions, more than AT&T and Verizon combined. We had our highest postpaid phone net adds since the merger with an industry-leading 854,000. Our postpaid phone churn of just 0.88% improved 8 basis points from last year. Once again, we were the only wireless service provider to improve year-over-year. And our postpaid phone churn, including Sprint, was lower than Verizon's for the second consecutive quarter. And as I said, our multiple growth opportunities are all contributing to this success. Consider smaller markets and rural areas, which include 40% of the U.S. population, at the end of last year, we only had a competitive network and distribution to effectively compete in 30% of those households. Today, thanks to our accelerated network build. We have already surpassed our year-end target to compete in 50% of these households and we now expect to reach roughly 60% by the end of this year. We also continue to grow in the top 100 markets as we win the prime network seekers who are increasingly recognizing that T-Mobile has the best network for them, an audience we never effectively competed for in the past. We achieved share leadership in many of these markets in the past without winning on network. All of that is changing. So the same advantages in network and value proposition that are driving growth in smaller markets and rural areas where we're underpenetrated and are driving it in the top 100 where we've always been strong. In fact, our net account growth in the quarter was split roughly equally between these two geographic segments. Okay. Let's talk business. We continue to win business customers from incumbents as T-Mobile for Business continues to build momentum, delivering one of our highest ever postpaid phone net addition quarters in Q3. The impact we're having can be clearly seen in Verizon's business churn, which was up again at the highest levels they've ever reported. Meanwhile, we added more business accounts and had lower business phone churn than Verizon in the quarter, delivering one of our lowest ever postpaid phone churn quarters for business. Our 5G network leadership, particularly as it relates to our lead in advanced 5G services, is increasingly enabling us to become a strategic partner for enterprises and for government agencies. Okay. Let me briefly touch on high-speed Internet where additions of 578,000 hit another record high. And once again, we expect to lead the industry in net adds. In fact, I anticipate that T-Mobile had more broadband net additions than AT&T, Verizon, Comcast and Charter combined for the second quarter in a row. In addition, our high-speed Internet attracted consumers and businesses who are new to T-Mobile at an increasing pace, establishing new relationships that we can grow with additional products and services over time. In just 1.5 years since our commercial launch, we now serve more than 2 million customers with Net Promoter Scores more than 30 points higher than cable and even higher than the average fiber provider. These results demonstrate that our differentiated growth strategy and our Un-carrier playbook to provide customers with the best value and the best network continues to win, and our differentiation is a particular source of strength in this ever-changing competitive and macroeconomic environment. And importantly, we translated our leading customer growth into industry-leading financial growth in postpaid service revenues, core adjusted EBITDA and cash flows. This momentum has enabled us to raise our guidance every quarter this year, including today. Finally, as you know, thanks to our strong execution and confidence in the future, our Board authorized a substantial share repurchase program and did so earlier than our initial Analyst Day plans to begin in 2023. I could not be prouder of this team and of these results. Okay, Peter, over to you to talk about our key financial highlights and some more information on our guidance. Peter Osvaldik : All right. Thanks, Mike. It's such a pleasure to watch this team reliably deliver on our commitments, and we did it yet again with another strong quarter in Q3. Our industry-leading growth in postpaid customer accounts resulted in the best postpaid service revenue growth once again, up 7% year-over-year. Our disciplined focus on driving profitability translated at strong service revenue growth, combined with our continued execution on merger synergies, into year-over-year core adjusted EBITDA growth of over 11%. That increase in customers and profitability is driving industry-leading operating and free cash flow expansion and further unlocks the massive cash flow potential of our business. These robust operating results also enabled us to achieve two major financial milestones. First, we're extremely proud to have reached an investment-grade rating from all three major agencies, opening access to a much deeper and cost effective capital pool for the company. We also closed our first asset-backed securities issuance related to our equipment receivables, which provides yet another established and attractive capital source as we continue to be opportunistic in optimizing both our capital structure and cost. And second, as Mike mentioned, we commenced the significant share repurchase program in September, and we repurchased 4.9 million shares for a total purchase price of $669 million in Q3. Cumulatively, through October 20th, we have repurchased 10.9 million shares for a total purchase price of $1.5 billion. Also in Q3, we announced the planned sale of our wireline business, which resulted in a pretax loss of $1.1 billion that had substantially no cash impact to the quarter. This includes the financial liability associated with the commercial take-or-pay, the impairment to the carrying value of the associated assets and other cost to sell. The transaction is not expected to have any material financial impact to 2023 based on the expected closing timeline. All right, let's jump into the details of our increased guidance for 2022. We now expect total postpaid net customer additions to be between 6.2 million and 6.4 million, up 150,000 at the midpoint, reflecting both the great execution of our differentiated growth strategy and progress on a reducing churn. We continue to expect nearly half of postpaid net adds, coming from phones for the full year. Turning to core adjusted EBITDA, we now expect full year 2022 to be between $26.2 billion and $26.4 billion, up 11% year-over-year at the midpoint and up $150 million from our prior guidance, driven by our profitable growth in service revenues and increased merger synergies. Core adjusted EBITDA excludes leasing revenues, which we expect to be between $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion as we continue to transition Sprint customers off device leasing. We now expect merger synergies to be between $5.7 billion to $5.8 billion, up $250 million at the midpoint, primarily as we unlock more network savings driven by accelerated site decommissioning. Merger-related costs, which are not included in core adjusted EBITDA are expected to be between $4.8 billion and $5 billion before taxes, primarily representing network decommissioning activities. Net cash provided by operating activities, which include payments for merger-related costs, are now expected to be in the range of $16.3 billion to $16.5 billion, up 18% year-over-year at the midpoint and up $250 million from the prior guidance. Turning to cash CapEx, we now expect it to be between $13.7 billion and $13.9 billion, which is up $200 million at the midpoint, reflecting the ongoing robust pace of our 5G deployment and success in high speed internet where we capitalize the routers. Together, we now expect free cash flow, including payments for merger-related costs to be in the range of $7.4 billion to $7.6 billion, higher by $50 million at the midpoint. This results in free cash flow increasing by more than 30% over last year, even with the higher levels of investments and does not assume any material net cash inflows from securitization. We now expect our full year effective tax rate to be between 17% and 19% based on favorability, primarily from non-recurring benefits we've seen year-to-date. Additionally, we continue to expect postpaid phone ARPU to be up approximately 2% for the full year, driven by continued customer adoption of value added services, including Magenta MAX. And with greater success in attracting new to T-Mobile customers with high speed internet, we now expect full year postpaid ARPA to be up in the mid-to-high 2% range. And with that, I will now turn the call back to Jud to begin the Q&A. Jud Henry : Thanks, Peter. All right, let's get to your questions. You can ask questions via phone by pressing star one and via Twitter by sending a tweet to @TMobileIR or @MikeSievert using $TMUS. Let's start with a question on the phone. Operator first question, please. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our first question from Jonathan Chaplin of New Street Research. Jonathan Chaplin : Thanks guys. Congratulations on a great set of results. I just had a quick question on fixed wireless broadband actually. It looks like net adds are leveling off pretty much as you described, they would last quarter Mike. I'm just wondering, you are still expanding your addressable market as you deploy 2.5 gigahertz spectrum. Are you starting to run out of capacity in some of the early markets that you deployed such that the sort of markets open for sale isn't growing anymore? Is that what's causing the leveling off in net adds? Mike Sievert : Not at all. In fact, the capacity picture is actually more sector by sector than market by market, and that's sort of what makes it different than other models. Just to kind of remind everybody how this works. So we took the entire country and looked at every sector of every tower and predicted mobile usage for years to come through share taking and additional mobile usage per device. And then looked at each sector, whether or not to approve addresses in that sector. And then once we get enough addresses in that sector, which is very rarely achieved so far, we stop approving addresses in that sector And so it's not really a market-by-market basis. And it's also therefore not a model that requires us to allocate significant extra capital, meaning we can go after this market very, very cost effectively because the network is substantially complete only for mobile usage. It's just a fantastic model. When we laid that out for people in 2021, we said that we saw that particular model getting us to six to eight million postpaid homes, and that would be about the model. But that doesn't mean we might not go beyond that. We'll have to watch how it all unfolds. And we just really like this run rate, it's competitive, it's rapidly growing. I love the fact that the premise of your question is why the slowdown only as many net adds as AT&T, Verizon, Comcast and Charter combined, what's going wrong with your model? It's a fantastic place for us to be. But the answer to your question specifically is no, other than in some particular neighborhoods where we have lots of neighbors all joining on at once, we're not seeing any issues with capacity. And remember, and I'll ask Neville to finish this answer, we're only getting started when it relates to applying the capacity. It's not a finite quantum. In fact, right now we have 120 megahertz is it deployed in the mid-band ultra-capacity? And we're on our way to 200. Maybe you can talk about the journey because it's not a fixed capacity story. Neville Ray : Yes, I\u2019ll just build on your comments, Mike. I would say, Jonathan, the reverse is happening. We are just coming off the back of a tremendous quarter, actually our busiest quarter since close of the merger with Sprint. In terms of how many sites we modernized and upgraded with mid-band 5G. And so the footprint is expanding which is tremendous. We're also adding more spectrum across the footprint, both the existing and the new footprint. And that's not just in 2.5 gigahertz now, we're also adding PCS in the 1900 megahertz band to those sites. So we have more sites and more spectrum coming online as we move through the future months and years for the company. And it's not just that, right. The other great piece is that 5G is becoming more efficient. We are rapidly moving to all SA, all standalone. And what does that mean? It means we can leverage and transport all of that home internet traffic on a pure 5G lane. So that's more efficient, it's more spectrally efficient. And from a performance perspective, of course, we get better latency. So we are still in the early innings of rolling out this mid-band network. Obviously we have a tremendous leadership position, but in terms of our ability to support the numbers we've talked about by 2025, we're in a good place. And as Mike said, we will continue to work to see if we can beat those opportunities. Jonathan Chaplin : Thank you guys. Mike Sievert : One thing I love about this \u2013 just to wrap it is that I mentioned this in my remarks, but the net promoter scores that we're seeing on this product are just fantastic. And people love this product because it's lower price and because it does exactly what it promises. And for us it's really, really important that we keep all of that in balance on our journey to millions and millions of home served. So great. Thanks, Jonathan. Jonathan Chaplin : Thanks, Mike. Mike Sievert : All right, next question. Operator : And moving on to Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson SVB Securities. Craig Moffett : Thank you. Hi there, two questions. First, as 5G chipsets become increasingly commonplace and sort of more the norm than the exception, how do you think about telling the story of 5G network advantage in a way that, particularly the consumer market sort of internalizes it? What kind of metrics should we be looking at for a sense that your network advantage is really something that is becoming known and resonating with customers? And then second on just a purely more financial note, for example, as you've bought in some previously leased spectrum and that sort of thing, how should we be thinking about the margin trajectory for the business going forward? And where you think service margins can get to longer term? Mike Sievert : Okay, great. Let's start with the second question about bringing on leased spectrum, what's the margin trajectory, where can margins get, I'll start with Peter. Peter Osvaldik : Yes. Well there hasn't been a lot of that yet Craig. I mean, we announced our transaction with Columbia Capital that again, is subject to regulatory approval and would close six months thereafter. But again, as I think about the long-term trajectory of this business, we laid out obviously our set of mid- and long-term aspirations in Analyst Day, and there are some service revenue margins that are inferred from there. But this has been a question that's come up multiple times in terms of the competitive set and where do we land relative to the competitive set. And the most important thing to look at, because it is what powers the growth of the ability to both return shareholder to capital, to invest further in the business and to continue this flywheel success is how are you able to translate that service revenue into free cash flow? And that's where we're tremendously proud and excited about the opportunity ahead of us. And you see, even with our Analyst Day projections for 2023, even before we get the full run rate cash potential of this business in the later periods, we're projected to convert service revenue into free cash flow as a leader in this industry. And so that's really what we're laser-focused on. It gets rid of the question of leased fiber versus owned fiber, takes all that noise out of it and really shows you the value creation capability of this business. Mike Sievert : Yes, just back to the consumer question, I'd be interested if anybody else wants to jump in. Ultimately consumers and businesses want an available signal and where they have available signal, they want speed and capacity, and they want that at a great price from a company that will treat them right and love them. And that's the bottom line. Our lead in 5G puts us in a position now that 5G is becoming the norm to be the leader in overall network. And network is one of the top two reasons why people switch. They switch either because they are not satisfied with the price or the terms around those prices, or they switch because they want a different or more powerful network signal. And more and more they are learning that T-Mobile is the company that offers that. Remember all the companies now provide signal just about everywhere people go. The question is when you are moving around, what kind of signal do you have? When you walk into buildings are you begging for a Wi-Fi password or do you have T-Mobile where your signal is probably faster than the Wi-Fi in the building you just walked into? And that kind of thing is habit forming. We're seeing usage move really fast. The most popular plan we have, and as I said, the best expression of our 5G network is Magenta MAX. It's now our most popular plan, and people are using it significantly more than they were using prior plans, and certainly more than they were using LTE, like several times more. And so, those are the kinds of things that, I think, people look to. It's applications like gaming, it's media consumption, it's the emergence of new use cases like AR and VR that are the underpinnings of the metaverse. No matter what you believe about how the metaverse might or might not unfold, clearly more immersive 3D experiences are on their way. And all those things require ultra-high capacity, low latency, powerful network signals. And that's what T-Mobile uniquely provides with our 5G advantage. The last thing I'll say, and I know your question was about consumers, is that businesses don't just go on the reputation. They actually go have a look at it. They take a 100 or so phones from each of the providers and test it for some weeks. And our win share is like it's never been. And so it really shows you that when they take a hard look at where all their customers go, where their employees go, and they look at it side by side, they come back. And more times than not and certainly more times than the past, it's T-Mobile. So we're really at the beginnings of, I think, this 5G revolution taking hold. Anybody want to add to that? Peter Osvaldik : I might just say one or two things to emphasize a couple that you said. 5G is more and more becoming the network. And so one of the ways that we're measuring our success in 5G is how are we succeeding in overall network perception, how are people perceiving that T-Mobile competes overall in the marketplace against our two main competitors. And I think increasingly, you're seeing us close the perception gap. You're also seeing us win awards for overall network leadership that we had never won before, and Neville can double-click into some of those. I think the way that we'll continue to talk about this is coverage in places where customers really care about and with our Coverage Beyond move, we've featured coverage both on the ground, the best 5G network, and increasingly, the best network when you're on the ground, covered when you're in the air and covered internationally. And I think you'll start to see more and more of these use cases emerge about experiences that both businesses and consumers can appreciate as we progress over the next couple of years that we'll feature and talk a little bit more about the kinds of experiences that could be unlocked by a leading network. Final words to quantify that for you. Now that 5G usage is most of the usage and 5G devices are most of the devices, we're seeing our 5G lead take root, not just in reputation and reality, but in quantitative measures. So for example, the Ookla data that came back said our average customer is experiencing speeds twice as fast as just a year ago, average customer, regardless of device type, and twice as fast as they can get from AT&T or Verizon. And that's very powerful because they noticed that, and they tell other people about it. Did you have a follow-up question? I was just starting to hear you jump in. Craig Moffett : No. Just \u2013 is it an issue of coverage that you can see on a map? Or is your 2.5 gigahertz spectrum more an issue about fewer dead spots because the propagation is going to be better than, say, the C-band? Mike Sievert : Well, I mean, if you total the people that we reach right now, it's 250 million with Ultra Capacity. And with C-band and other forms of Ultra Wideband as Verizon calls it, that's where they hope to be by their public disclosures over two years from now. And so years ago, I said we were two years ahead in this 5G race. And in two years, we'd still be two years ahead. That continues to appear to be the case, even though our competitors are now in rapid deployment of their C-band assets. And of course, they are different assets. Ours is underpinned on one 5G network with a 5G stand-alone core by a massive low-band 5G network that reaches 97% of Americans. And that's a huge difference maker as well, and we see it in all kinds of scenarios, including even the resiliency of our network. When issues happen with a storm or something, we can beam in from miles away and save the day with a very high capacity 5G signal on low-band. And those things are very important to our customers, they notice. Craig Moffett : That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Operator : And moving on to John Hodulik with UBS. Mike Sievert : Hi, John. John Hodulik : Great, thanks. Hi, Mike. Two questions. First, churn and the ARPU. First one on the postpaid churn, 0.88%, obviously, very solid improvement. I mean, in the past, you've talked about the difference between Sprint churn and Magenta turn, and now with everybody sort of on the same network, and I think on the same plan \u2013 or on the T-Mobile plans, is there room for continued improvement just given all the improvements you guys just outlined in terms of the network? And then the other one is on the postpaid phone ARPU. I guess where are you in terms of sort of Magenta Max penetration? And given what I think is still relatively low, do you think that low single-digit ARPU growth can continue as we look into 2023? Thanks. Mike Sievert : Okay. Great. I'm going to go turn to, just so you have a heads up, to Peter and to Jon on ARPU and Magenta Max. On churn, I'll just personalize it. I'm not going to be satisfied until we're the lowest. Magenta was the lowest. Right now, we're number two on churn. I want to be number one. And we have the best network and the best value and a team that loves its customers. We should make our way to number one. I can't really outlook for you the journey because it's a competitive marketplace. Our competitors aren't standing still. I respect them. But I think with our team and our assets and our unique proposition, we should be number one. We're not going to probably be unpacking it for you a lot more than that. We used to do that here's the T-Mobile and give you some color on the churn and how many people and Sprint starting to look just like Magenta now, et cetera, because the premise of your question was accurate. We've shut down the Sprint network. We hope the billing migration that happens in 2023 will be largely invisible to customers. And so yes, we have a lot of work to do. We need to get them under commitment. We need to get them on the right plans, give them the full uncarrier benefit. There's some improvement we can undertake still, but it's one customer base. And we're going to be focused on how do we improve churn for that one customer base, and I won't be satisfied until we're number one. Okay. So turning to ARPU and ARPU development and Magenta Max and what we're hearing from customers, Peter and Jon. Peter Osvaldik : Perfect. So I'll let Jon talk about Magenta Max. But really, I mean, the trajectory of ARPU has just been just such a success this year. And when you think about the history of T-Mobile and even the plans that we had anticipated during Analyst Day when we came out, the ability to have Magenta Max be such a tailwind and allow us to get to the point where we're increasing ARPU guidance year-over-year and expecting a 2% increase is just phenomenal. But at the same time, as you know, ARPU is very much a mix-driven metric. And one of the reasons why we're so focused on ARPU itself, and just some of the examples are, of course, as you deepen relationships, for example, with our Sprint customers, as we saw migration happen, we had an opportunity to expand relationships. And so while that second, third, fourth line is obviously a lower ARPU and can impact blended ARPU, it's tremendously accretive from a CLV perspective. So that's one. In business where you're seeing some of the success in business, large enterprise, obviously, has a lower blended ARPU basis than what you typically see, but it's a tremendously CLV accretive business to bring in. Our segmentation approach, 55-plus that's bringing in such a significant amount of prime customers and driving switching is another one where you see ARPU may be mixture differently than what we see on a blended average, but high CLVs. And so that's part of the reason why you've always heard us focus on ARPA and the strategy to land and continue to expand the relationships, both with more phones, but also beyond the phone, such as with fixed wireless. And that's where we're seeing mid to high 2% year-over-year increase in ARPA. So that gives me a lot of comfort there. And I do think with ARPU, you're going to see a mixture of things happen. But Magenta Max has just been such a great tailwind. And I'd love to give Jon the opportunity to brag about it a little. Jon Freier : Yes. We couldn't be more pleased with what's happened with Magenta Max. I mean when you think about all of our new accounts that are joining T-Mobile, we're having north of 60% of our new bands choosing Magenta Max. And like what Mike said just a few moments ago, it's our most popular plan for not only new customers that are joining, but also existing customers who are changing the rate plans. We're still under 20% of our total base on Magenta Max. So with what Peter was saying just a few moments ago, we still have tailwinds and opportunities still within our base, not only for the business benefits that, that represents, but also for the incredible consumer benefits that it represents as well. You got to remember, too, that when you look at Magenta Max, for customers with two lines or more, it's $225 per month in savings and value that consumers get. And when you think about this inflation, pressured budget cycle that so many households are in and you think about what we're doing with Apple TV+ now included on Magenta Max, Netflix included, all of the Wi-Fi included on airplanes, think about taxes and fees, that's something that we talked about and rolled out some number of years ago, I think at the beginning of 2017. That's 15% to 18% of the bill with our competitors that's completely included within our value proposition on the Magenta Max. So our customers are loving it. Like Mike said, there's incredible utility, 5x more gaming, 2.5x more social media, 2x more video, including all those emerging technologies that Mike was referring to just a few moments ago, an augmented reality and virtual reality as well. So our customers are loving it. We have a lot more opportunity still to go within Magenta Max, but we're feeling great and just could not be more pleased with the overall performance of that particular rate card. Mike Sievert : Okay. Before we go back to the phone, I want to go out to Twitter where we're seeing questions come in. We have a question from Roger Entner and a similar one from @LinkedIn, right. So I'll go with Roger's version. So it's a question for Callie Field and TFB. In what business sector do you see the most success? Where are you gaining traction? Is it SMB, midsize or large enterprises? And maybe I'll also add to the question, Callie, because all of the competitors said in their calls, business is going fine. Business is going fine. So what's going on? We just said business is going fine. How can it be going fine for everybody? So maybe if you can answer both. Callie Field : Yes. Thanks, Mike. I can't \u2013 and Roger, thanks for the question. Good to hear from you. I can't speak too much to AT&T and Verizon, but I do see the TAM expanding. Mike, we see in business this year, mobile subs are expected to grow by 4.6%. A third of all business subs will have a 5G connection by the end of 2022. IoT connections are expected to grow by 16%. And of course, private networks and managed services are supposed to be well over 44% CAGR year-over-year. We see work-from-home as a category expander, and we see companies that are providing employee lines to have less than 10% attrition. So this is a benefit that they're coming and talking to us about. And then when we see regulation and some of the environment from the SEC, maintaining and providing secure electronic communications allows us to expand our product portfolio and the way that we're delivering solutions. So there's a lot of really great and interesting opportunity for us. We're having a lot of conversations. And then, Roger, to your question, our revenue in enterprise is up 20% year-over-year. In SMB, we're seeing double-digit growth quarter-over-quarter. In our offering for business Internet, which is really the only 5G nationwide fixed wireless solution, we've seen double-digit growth quarter-over-quarter for four quarters in a row. So in this last particular quarter in automotive and in airlines, those verticals we saw a lot of growth. We signed the deal with VinFast, which is a global EV manufacturer. Ford, we announced a partnership for our Advanced Network Solutions. We won with Boeing, Delta, a partnership with our SMRA growth in consumer, let us win in rural America with Tractor Supply, which is America's largest rural retailer where we started with fixed wireless and have the opportunity to land and expand. So in the public sector as well, Roger, we're seeing great deals with Dallas ISD, Chicago PD, the IRS. So it really is a pretty exciting time for business. Overall, across several different product categories outside of only voice and then we're in SMB, we're continuing to see growth there. Mike Sievert : So two things are happening, right. So one, we're taking their share. That's just very clearly happening, and that's exactly what we told you would happen because of the superior network and the better value. But secondly, the pressure is a little bit being taken off of our competitors, which I think is a good thing, by the category expansion that Callie just talked about. And we forecasted this for you a while back. We told you that we thought, because of this really tight labor pool, that employees \u2013 employers would be looking at all kinds of way to retain employees, and great phone plans are certainly one of those. And this hybrid workplace that companies find themselves in has persisted longer than a lot of people predicted. And now with employees distributed outside the office, employee sponsored phone plans become a more important piece. And so you see growth in the sector, which I think takes a little pressure off of the underlying dynamic, which is we\u2019re taking their share. Okay. So let\u2019s go back to the phone for the next one. Operator : Thank you. Next we\u2019ll hear from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Simon Flannery : Great. Thanks very much. Just continuing on the TAM expansion there. We\u2019ve had another quarter, it looks like the industry will do over 2 million postpaid phone ads. Can you just talk to the sustainability of that and any broader comments on customer behavior, bad debts, day sales outstanding, et cetera? We hear a lot of other companies talking about a weaker consumer that may help you in terms of value seeking behavior. But any updated thoughts there would be great. Mike Sievert : Great. I\u2019ll have Peter start it off and then I have a couple comments. Peter Osvaldik : Yes. So let me start with bad debt and consumer behavior. As you know, year-over-year, certainly you saw bad debt increase from the more muted pandemic-related conditions. And we\u2019re seeing involve churn roughly normalized to pre-pandemic levels. 2019 levels, which was actually our best year pre-pandemic and it\u2019s exactly what we foreshadowed for you in Q2. We did see bad debt sequentially step down and we do believe Q2 was the high water mark in terms of percentage of total revenue from a bad debt perspective. So we\u2019re seeing exactly what we anticipated seeing there. Remember, this is a core strength of ours and we\u2019ll continue to work with consumers. To your point, is it an opportunity set? Yes, I think that\u2019s another thing we\u2019ve talked about before. And we see a continued, as Jon mentioned, really, really strong uptake on our highest featured rate plan. And we\u2019re also seeing, as you see, tremendous uptake on high speed internet, both within our current base, but also with new to T-Mobile relationships that then allow us to expand beyond that. So that\u2019s a lot of, I think what we\u2019re seeing very, very optimistic about those trends. And I hope I had all the questions for you. Is there anything, Simon? Simon Flannery : The sustainability of the overall postpaid growth? Peter Osvaldik : Yes. Well, this is another one where we\u2019ve been saying for the longest time, we do believe ultimately the industry growth were normalized. And that was always in our plans. It\u2019s always continues to be in our plans. But remember the differentiator for us is that not only do we have this tremendous combination of the value proposition and our fame for value and the 5G network leadership that is turning into overall network leadership. But it\u2019s also combined, those two things combined with the tremendous growth opportunities that are again, differentiated for us that Mike spoke about earlier. Network seekers in the top 100 are expansion in smaller markets and rural areas, TFB and the success that we\u2019re continuing to see there. So for us, we believe we\u2019re going to continue to take share because of that combination of value and network and the differentiated growth opportunities, despite the fact that we do anticipate the industry will normalize. And the proof as we continue to deliver is in the results, right? Our highest ever postpaid account net ads, a true measure of switching and relationships and the ability to land those and grow those now, you know, in the mid to high 2% range for ARPA. So that\u2019s kind of how we\u2019re thinking about it. I don\u2019t know Mike, if there\u2019s anything to add thoughts? Mike Sievert : Well, just that normalization is starting to happen. You see these last couple quarters, overall postpaid growth was more moderate, and yet our performance is fantastic. And so it does underscore what Peter said, which is our strategy isn\u2019t actually predicated deeply on category expansion. It\u2019s predicated on share taking something we consistently and reliably do quarter after quarter. Now there\u2019s \u2013 as I mentioned, there\u2019s some pressure being taken off. Prepaid continues to contribute to postpaid but at more modest levels, business expansion is happening. And that\u2019s a newer phenomenon. And by the way, that looks to us to be partly incremental. So some people are actually carrying two phones around and so that\u2019s good for the category. And we\u2019ll have to see what happens. But what\u2019s different, of course about our strategy, as Peter said, is that unlike our competitors, we have big growing under penetrated segments where we are positioned to win with the team, the assets and the value proposition that resonates. And we\u2019re proving that that\u2019s true quarter in and quarter out. I think that\u2019s one of the things that makes our story a little different. Simon Flannery : Great. Thank you. Mike Sievert : You bet. Back to the phone. Are you going to force us to Twitter or are you going to bring us in? Jud Henry : Operator, next question. Operator : Yes, please. If we can move to Twitter. Mike Sievert : Okay. All right, funny. All right. So we do have a couple questions that are pending. So looking Neville at the network that we\u2019ve just finished the substantial shutdown of the Sprint network, we now are one integrated network. But we did keep a lot of the Sprint sites. What percentage of them have been converted and upgraded? And also could you give an update on where we are with VoNR, that\u2019s voice over new radio. What that means is voice over 5G kind of like voiceover LTE worked in the LTE days? Neville Ray : Yes, I\u2019ll hit these quick, Mike. So we\u2019ve talked about how we\u2019ve effectively completed our network integration. And a big part of that was not just decom, it was incorporating literally thousands upon thousands of Sprint sites into the T-Mobile network. And that\u2019s the definition of this term that\u2019s used at keep sites. And that work is in the majority now complete too. So this last quarter, a lot of decom, a lot of these keep sites were upgraded and brought on air. And so we\u2019ve made \u2013 it was just a cracking quarter for us with all the 5G build too. So really, really pleased to have the vast majority of all of that work behind us. And now we can move on with continued expansion of coverage and performance in 5G. Mike Sievert : So it was the single biggest capital deployment quarter of the single biggest year in our business plan for capital. So you should look more tired than you are. Neville Ray : Thankfully, I have a great team. Thank you, guys. But yes, I think last quarter, Mike was the busiest network quarter in the company\u2019s history. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever seen the level of delivery and performance on decom, on new sites, on modernization. It was a remarkable set of performance characteristics. Mike Sievert : So that means you\u2019re touching the network with upgrades and decommissionings at the highest rate in our history, while being the only player with year-over-year churn improvements, 8 basis points and beating Verizon for the second quarter in a row. When you touch a network there\u2019s people \u2013 some people get affected very temporarily. That\u2019s powerful. And it really shows the planfulness of the build that we were able to do that\u2019s substantial of a set of improvements and yet simultaneously deliver churn improvements showing that customers are noticing and they\u2019re not just noticing pardon our dust, they\u2019re noticing improvements. Neville Ray : And there was an intense focus from the team on obviously churn management, but more importantly the customer experience throughout that process. And as we moved into 2022, we were way, way better at executing on the plan. We put together some time back. Quickly on voice over NR. So we always seem to forget to bring voice along with the next generation of technology. We\u2019ve done it multiple times now. But I see us as in a leader leadership position globally. We have a voice over NR, so 5G voice live in several markets. We continue to test, we continue to optimize. Why is that important? It\u2019s important because we want to have all of our traffic, all of that customer experience on a 5G lane. Today, we have to drop our customers down off of that 5G lane onto LTE. And we\u2019ve talked before about how we see our business as an all 5G network and having VoNR and that voice service is critical to executing on that strategy and making sure we have a full 5G network with full standalone capability. So we\u2019re making progress, still got work to do. I\u2019m not going to say it\u2019s where we want it to be yet. But I\u2019m confident over the next couple of quarters we will materially expand that footprint. Mike Sievert : And with that stall tactic \u2013 Neville and I can just bro out on network all afternoon while you guys watch, or if the operator\u2019s back, we can take a question. Operator : Thank you. And next we\u2019ll go to Michael Rollins with Citi. Michael Rollins : Thanks. Good afternoon. Hi. Two questions if I could. So first, as we\u2019re getting closer to 2023 and we look back at the previously issued guidance, can you unpack some of the developments in 2022 that can impact those ranges for core EBITDA and free cash flow, whether it\u2019s inflation, the pace of synergy realization or the CapEx intentions after you\u2019re looking at the growth that you\u2019ve achieved to date. And then just secondly, as you\u2019re looking at the progress for the business model and the network, how are you thinking about fiber these days in a couple of respects? One more ownership of the fiber to run the network on. And also on the home broadband front, does the success of fixed wireless increase your interest to have a fiber pipe into a substantial number of homes and businesses? Mike Sievert : Great. Well, let me start with the second one on fiber. We\u2019re in the same place really as we were the last time we talked about this. I think I got asked about this the last time, which is, as a management team, we have a fantastic business model and a fantastic business plan. And we are focused on it. And we love our ability to move fast and serve customers as a wireless pure-play. And it\u2019s been a big source of strength. That said we are very open minded about whether our team, our ability to execute, our brand, our in place 5G network could serve broader markets. And so we\u2019re of course interested in adjacencies that would very smartly utilize all of those assets, including our physical and digital distribution capabilities. And so we\u2019re interested. We haven\u2019t drawn any conclusions about it and I really can\u2019t answer whether 5G fixed wireless success makes us more interested or less interested. It could be a little of both for the obvious reasons. So you\u2019ll have to stay tuned. We\u2019re having a look at it. One of the things that we do is we try to learn. We have some partnerships that we\u2019re pursuing now called T-Fiber at a very small scale so we can make sure that we\u2019re learning. And then of course with \u2013 surprising to many people, but not to us consistent with plan success in 5G, we\u2019re also learning a lot about what it takes to be a home broadband operator. I\u2019m very pleased with the net promoter scores that our customers are realizing because many looked at us and said, hey you guys are pretty good at slinging smartphones and taking care of customers on mobile, but could you do that broadband thing? It\u2019s different. And we\u2019re starting to be able to answer that for ourselves and we\u2019re growing some confidence in that. So, no conclusions. We\u2019re just a team that hopefully is building trust with you that a, we like our plan, we\u2019re confident in our plan, and if we can find accretive smart ways to augment that plan in a way that makes this a better investment for you, we\u2019ll look at those things. And we haven\u2019t drawn any conclusions. As it relates to the question about 2023 guide. I mean, I\u2019m glad you asked. I might ask Peter to go ahead and lay it all out for you three months early. No, I\u2019ll just start and then ask Peter to amplify. The short answer is a lot has changed, but nothing has changed. A lot has changed. We laid out those guidelines for 2023 and beyond in the spring of 2021 and that was a very different world than we now live in. And it\u2019s one of the things that\u2019s pretty gratifying for us, because as we look ahead in 2023, even though so much has changed and it\u2019ll land differently than we thought. The initial thought is, yes, the parameters we laid out for you, although they were incredibly audacious and although they didn\u2019t anticipate some of the changes that have hit the market since then, look to us to be on track including things like the EBITDA range we shared, the revenue range that we shared, the customer aspirations, the cash flow aspirations, and therefore, the share buyback potential in our plan and also the CapEx outlook. All those things look to us like, roughly the right answers, even though so much has changed. And that's one of the things that makes our story so different than the other stories out there in tech and in telecom. Peter? Peter Osvaldik : Yes. As I reflect back on Analyst Day, what we said is there's a lot of opportunity and, to your point, Mike, so much has changed. When we just think about where the macroeconomic situation is now, certainly, I can rattle off a lot of things that have changed since then such as the DISH relationship and our ability to secure a long-term arrangement that while it's under the Analyst Day assumptions, it still secures about three quarters of that revenue. But we've had so much success in the business as well. The share-taking that we anticipated has happened. What we've seen from Magenta MAX as a tailwind from an ARPA and ARPU perspective has been just tremendous. And we talked about how a lot of the inflationary impacts \u2013 well, of course, they're happening on the edges in terms of bad debt, in the macroeconomic environment and labor. And you saw the moves that we made early on to address labor with our rate changes. We've been insulated from a lot of that because, again, I think a lot of the brilliant moves that were done on the part of Neville and team to secure just long-term arrangements with a lot of our large cost categories. So in a sense, as you said, Mike, so much of the world has changed since then. And there's been so many puts and takes. But the success of this team gives us confidence in achieving those audacious goals that we set out there for 2023. And we're looking forward, obviously. This is not the time to update 2023 guide. I'd like to. Maybe I can treat that later. But what we'll do is we'll, of course, update you on that at our Q4 call and looking forward to that. Michael Rollins : Thank you. Mike Sievert : Terrific. Thanks, Mike. Operator : And next, we'll go to Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Mike Sievert : Hi, Brett. Brett Feldman : You guys hear me, okay? Mike Sievert : Yes. Brett Feldman : Okay. Great. Kind of a follow-up on network. You nudged up your CapEx guidance for the year. You talked about accelerating the build-out of the 5G network and also the sensitivity to the high-speed Internet routers. And so the bigger picture question is, from this point forward, now that you've completed the network integration, what are the principal drivers of your network CapEx? What's it most sensitive to? And to what extent is it going to be increasingly sensitive to your traction with fixed wireless? Or put another way, if you keep putting up over 0.5 million net adds a quarter, does that inevitably mean you're going to have to keep nudging up CapEx? Or do you think you're at a run rate to support that growth right now? Thanks. Mike Sievert : Yes, I'll start. No, it doesn't mean that. And because, again, our business plan on fixed wireless is essentially an incremental capital free plan. Now if we look at \u2013 to the previous question about we're learning and there's opportunity and we're growing increasingly confident, if we look at that fixed wireless space and decide to augment our capital-free business plan with an additional business plan that's burdened with some capital, we'll let you know about that. We won't surprise you with that. But that's something we wouldn't completely rule out because we have great assets. We've barely tapped our millimeter wave assets. We have fantastic mid-band. The recent auction has given us potential access soon as soon as those licenses are assigned to significant additional mid-band in areas where we actually already have the towers deployed. And that's fascinating. Well, this is the first auction that's like that where our winning bids, when they are assigned, we have already deployed the radios to \u2013 by the end of this year to 13,000 towers, reaching 45 million people. It's like flipping a switch. Neville is going \u2013 it's not like flipping a switch. For me, it's like flipping a switch. Neville Ray : Almost. Mike Sievert : It's almost immediate because the radios are there, and they're not allowed to transmit into the white spaces that we just want in the auction. So we're very anxious to see those being assigned. And the FCC did a great job getting this auction done, and I know they'll do a great job getting the process completed. So that \u2013 so the answer to the fixed wireless and capital is no, unless we see an additional business because to the very first question in the call, it's not something that is predicated on capital or on capacity. Our core plan is going to add a lot more capacity as Neville moves from that 120 to the 200 he commented about a few minutes ago. Anybody want to add to that? Neville Ray : I'll just add quickly. I mean, obviously, the modernization of the network continues on, but we've achieved so much to date. I mean we're way ahead of our competition. I mean we're not in \u2013 we're majority complete on our network modernization and the addition of those mid-band radios. We still have more to do, and that's going to continue into 2023 and 2024, and that will continue to open up more opportunity, as we referenced earlier, for fixed wireless. I think the other piece we will continue to make, coverage investments. These networks continue to grow. Customer demands continue to grow. We have great growth, as Callie referenced in our business and enterprise space. We need to feed that. We've got work to do still in small town rural America. So our CapEx profile is feeding both. It's all back to delivering that overall best network experience. And it's the combination of 5G. And everything we add on coverage is 5G capable, of course. So the network, as Mike K. referenced earlier on, is all about 5G. And we have a great leadership position, and our plan as we go forward is to extend that. Brett Feldman : Thank you. Mike Sievert : Terrific. All right. Let's go back to the phone. Operator : Thank you. Mike Sievert : I think this is the last question. You tell me, Jud. Yes, timing wise. Jud Henry : We'll take one more. Mike Sievert : Okay. Great. So we'll go back to the phone. Operator? Operator : Thank you. And that question will come from David Barden with Bank of America. David Barden : Hi, guys. Really appreciate it. Thank you so much. Mike Sievert : Hi, Dave. David Barden : Hi, Mike. Thank you for taking my questions. So I guess two, if I could. I mean the first would be, I guess, for Peter, which is presupposing, we get to this point where T-Mobile shares are over $150 a share. We have this 48.8 million shares that we're going to issue to SoftBank, and you've got this buyback. And you've left a lot of options on the table for how you can use that buyback to use open market operations or structured buybacks. I was wondering if you could kind of share with the market a little bit of your thinking about how to address that overhang and what the \u2013 what SoftBank's potential selling of those shares could mean for T-Mobile? And then if I could, the second question, Mike, would be \u2013 Verizon advertised at the very beginning of this quarter that they were going to have a big churn bubble and that, that would contribute a lot of switchers to the market and that they expect that, that's going to change in the fourth quarter. Could you address kind of how you think that \"churn bubble\" affected your performance in the third quarter? And how we should think about the fourth quarter as that unfolds? Thank you. Mike Sievert : Great. Well, maybe we'll have Peter start with the first one. I'll just give you a premise on it, which is ever since we wrote this business plan during the merger and then gave you our outlooks for what we thought we could accomplish, we've always been assuming that, that dilution event is coming because it's only $150 where it would trigger, and that's all the way out to, what, 2025, I think. And so our minds have always been, yes, that's on its way. It's sort of nothing new. I hope we're right about that. But maybe, Peter, you can talk about the question, which is how do we address the overhang, and is there any interplay with the share buyback? And then we'll get to the second piece about share. Peter Osvaldik : Yes. Absolutely. And as you'd expect, Dave, obviously, we consider all of those things. But frankly, there's no serious discussion happening around that now. And that's probably because you'll have to ask SoftBank, but I would assume that they much like we assume that this was going to happen, right? And that delivery on this plan and those audacious goals that we gave out to you would achieve $150 a share. And so there really are no significant ongoing discussions at the moment around that, probably because that's exactly what SoftBank assumes. So \u2013 and I got to tell you, we're just \u2013 we're so pleased on being able to start that share buyback earlier on the success of the integration progress, the business progress as well as achieving core family investment-grade rating and to be able to begin a significant share buyback program early. Now I will remind you on the SoftBank shares, that $48.8 million, it does come with some restrictions. You were asking me about what happens in terms of them selling those shares, and we hope they'll be long-term holders with us, but that's a question for them. But there are restrictions on their ability to sell those shares. That's part of the agreement between them and DT that's public out there. For example, they can't sell any of those shares at DT is not at 51% ownership at a minimum. There's a certain amount they can't sell through the end of 2024 no matter what. They have some ability to monetize a portion of those shares, not via sale, but other mechanics that they might employ, but there's some restrictions there that everybody should keep in mind in terms of the SoftBank shares. Mike Sievert : Right. And then on the churn bubble, look, I mean time will tell whether or not what we're seeing in the competitive dynamic is long-term or short-term. I mean to us, these last few quarters have looked like really consistent competitive mill use. Yes, it's very competitive out there. Yes, our competitors sort of stepped in it by jacking people up with price increases while they're stuck into phone payment plans and surprising them that way. And I do think, by the way, that there's a difference in philosophy between our companies. Our company is absolutely obsessed with the power of our brand. And for a decade now, we have been building fame and trust as the company that puts you first those customers, that gives you the best value and that changes the rules of this industry in your favor. And our competitors saw inflation as an excuse to go grab some short-term money and said, don't worry, it'll all be over in a few weeks. I mean some people will leave, and there will be a bubble, but then it's all over. And of course, it's not all over. People don't forget that. That's the power of brand. And we've shown that for a decade now what happens when you gain fame as a customer advocate. We're all duking it out on the network side now that T-Mobile has become competitive, and we've got the best 5G, and that's rapidly transforming into the best network. And you could say that perception-wise, there is a lot of similarity these days. It's not even close on value and customer trust and Net Promoter Score. We're up this year. They're down. Our fame for having the best value is twice theirs. It's not even close, and they made it worse this year. And so we'll see how that unfolds. Yes, I bet you that there will be some short-term effects that may be the initial onslaught of people leaving because of what they did to their customers might slow down. But in terms of the word-of-mouth value and the ability for us to perpetuate our ongoing success built on our fame is the customer advocate that gets better and better with the passage of time because they're carriers, and we're the un-carrier. David Barden : That's great. Thank you so much, Mike. Mike Sievert : Okay. Great. And Jud, is that all the time we got? Jud Henry : That is all the time we have today. But again, we really appreciate everybody joining us. If you have any other questions, please reach out to the Investor Relations or Media Relations team, and we look forward to speaking with you again soon. Thank you everyone. Mike Sievert : Thanks, everybody. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the T-Mobile third quarter earnings call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect and have a pleasant day.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jud Henry, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations for T-Mobile US. Please go ahead, sir. Jud Henry : All right. Welcome to T-Mobile's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2020 Earnings Call. Joining me on the call today are Mike Sievert, our President and CEO; Peter Osvaldik, our CFO; as well as other members of the senior leadership team. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. We provide a comprehensive list of risk factors in our SEC filings, which I encourage you to review. Our earnings release, investor fact book and other documents related to our results as well as reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP results discussed on this call can be found in the Quarterly Results section of the Investor Relations website. With that, let me turn the call over to Mike. Mike Sievert : Okay. Thanks, Jud. Hi, everybody. As you can see, we're here in New York City with the whole senior team. And I am very much looking forward to talking about 2022 and a look ahead to what I think is going to be an even more exciting future. 2022 was a record year for our company. It was our best year ever. We welcomed more customers to the un-carrier than ever before in our history, and we translated this customer growth to industry-leading financial growth, finishing with a strong Q4. Our T-Mobile team delivered at or above the high end of our guidance across the board. 2022 was also the biggest investment year in our history. By accelerating these investments, we rewrote the competitive dynamic on network competition for good, and laid the foundation for a highly capital-efficient run rate business beginning this year. When I took responsibility as CEO almost three years ago, I spoke to you about an opportunity we saw that if we could execute well, we can position T-Mobile to be the first company in our space to simultaneously offer the best network and the best value, breaking a decade forced choice on consumers and businesses. While the results are in, with the latest network awards and we've done it. T-Mobile is not only the 5G leader, but now the overall network leader. And this opens big growth pathways for our future. Along the way, we successfully completed the customer migration and network shutdown faster than planned, while also delivering industry-leading growth in both customers and cash flows through our differentiated and profitable growth strategy. And we launched our most ambitious ESG initiatives ever. Our financial outcomes allowed us to accelerate our network deployments and begin share repurchases earlier than planned. And looking ahead to 2023, we're very confident in our differentiated strategy. In fact, we're on track to meet or exceed all of the aspirations for this year that we shared with you way back at our Analyst Day in early 2021. I'm excited to talk more about all of this today, and let's start with our merger integration. Back when we closed the merger, a few people would have thought that we could shut down the Sprint network faster than planned and deliver the lowest churn in our history at the same time, that's exactly what our team did. We moved all Sprint customers off the network and completed the DCOM of Sprint sites, all within 2.5 years. And not only that, we had our best postpaid phone churn year in the Company's history at just 0.88, and we were the only one in the industry to deliver year-over-year improvement for full year 2022. Diving into network, while T-Mobile has been the clear 5G leader for years, we can now say that T-Mobile has the best overall network in the United States. That is a big statement. For the first time ever, T-Mobile won a clean suite across every single overall network category in Ookla's recent report. And recent data from Opensignal and umlaut also show T-Mobile as the clear leader with over 12 billion data points across these network coverage and performance tests, the facts show T-Mobile is the new network leader. And this brings with it an exciting new opportunity, convincing people that this 30-year force choice between network and value is gone when you choose T-Mobile. This is no small task. But other results show that more and more people are beginning to notice and they're choosing T-Mobile. In fact, our results in '22 demonstrated how differentiated and effective our growth strategy really is. Kind of feels like deja vu. When I think back to this time last year, and everyone was worried about what would happen when industry growth began to normalize. And I sense that's top of mind for everyone again as we enter 2023. Well, let's show up immediately last year. The industry did see lower year growth in the second half. And guess what? Our unique ability to offer customers both the best network and the best value across multiple new and underpenetrated segments of the market led to T-Mobile's SaaS growth year ever, with two of our best core system merger coming in the second half, even as market growth began to normalize. We posted a record 1.4 million postpaid account net adds, the highest in company history and the highest reported in the industry once again. We're winning the highest share of switching decisions in the industry through our clear growth strategies. And we delivered our highest-ever postpaid net adds of over $6.4 million, above the high end of our recently raised guidance. This included our highest postpaid fund net adds since the merger with an industry-leading 3.1 million. We explained it before. Our strategy is differentiated and durable because it's driven by taking share in places where we're massively underpenetrated relative to the competition and where we now have the winning hand. Including T-Mobile for Business, where we just delivered one of our highest ever phone net adds quarters in Q4. And we're clearly having an impact on the incumbents. As you can see in Verizon's highest-ever business churn in 2022. In the top 100 markets for consumer, we're winning with prime network seekers who increasingly recognize that T-Mobile offers the best combination of network coverage and capacity for their needs and at a lower cost. We're only beginning to tap into this new opportunity. And in smaller markets in rural areas, where we're bringing a better value proposition and a better network to new geographies, we really didn't play in before. We're capturing a win share of switchers in the high 30s, which says a lot because in many of these places, we're only just getting started. In addition, we added 2 million high-speed Internet customers in our first full year since our commercial launch. In fact, T-Mobile had more broadband net adds in '22 that AT&T, Verizon, Comcast and Charter combined. This is a powerful new phenomenon for our brand in addition to being a good business. And not only did we deliver industry-leading customer growth, but our focus on profitable growth translated into industry best financial performance with core adjusted EBITDA up 12% year-over-year and free cash flow up 36%. The investments we've made in 2022, including in our cybersecurity capabilities showed up in a critical way a few weeks ago. I want to take a moment to address the recent cyber incident. After address identifying a criminal attempt to access our data through an API, we shut it down within 24 hours. And more importantly, our systems and policies protected the most sensitive kinds of customer data from being accessed. We take this issue very seriously. Find disappointed that the crime actor will be able to obtain any customer information, we are confident that our aggressive cybersecurity plan working with the support of some of the world's experts will allow us to achieve our goal of becoming second-to-none in this area. Before I wrap up, I want to touch on some of the ways we're building a more connected and sustainable future. Nearly three years ago, we launched our digital divide initiative called Project 10Million to bring connectivity to underserved students nationwide with free or highly subsidized service. And I am proud to say we're now more than halfway to achieving our goal. To date, we've provided $4.8 billion in services and connected more than 5.3 million students, and we're not slowing down. We're also working hard to create a more sustainable future, recently committing to our most ambitious sustainability goal yet to achieve net-zero emissions across our entire carbon footprint by 2040. This makes T-Mobile one of the only four Fortune 100 companies to do so. Our work in this space is being recognized, including being named in the top 20 of JUST Capital's 2023 rankings, which measures companies against metrics that matter to our communities, including environmental impact, where we ranked number one in our industry. Okay. Let me wrap up with some comments on 2023 and what's ahead. With these record results, we've clearly shown that our differentiated strategy has lots of room to run. And I strongly believe that this will prove to be the case even as industry as a whole is seeing moderating growth and potentially a challenging macroeconomic environment. In fact, it may be especially true in that case as our unique high-quality positioning is proving remarkably well suited to the times. We believe 2023 will also be a year in which we begin to see the payoff. In terms of EBITDA and massive cash flow expansion of years of work on merger integration, synergy attainment and the most ambitious network build in U.S. history, all of which are mostly behind us now. And an ongoing differentiated profitable growth, which is the durable result in front of us. I could not be more proud of this team and our employees, and I am so excited for all that's ahead in 2023 and beyond. Okay, Peter, over to you to talk about our key financial highlights and our guidance for 2023. Peter Osvaldik : Awesome. Thanks, Mike. As you can see, our 2022 results highlighted our strong execution in accelerating the moderation while leveraging our network leadership to deliver industry-leading growth in both traditional postpaid and broadband customers. This translated into industry-leading postpaid service revenue growth of 8% in 2022. We delivered core adjusted EBITDA of $26.4 billion, up 12% and reaching a record high and at the high end of our recently raised guidance. We realized approximately $6 billion of synergies in 2022 or roughly the total run rate synergies expected in our original merger plan in 2018. Our strong margin expansion also unlocked rapid free cash flow growth, which grew at an industry-best 36% year-over-year to $7.7 billion and that's even after funding our peak CapEx year in 2022. This strong financial performance allowed us to commence our share buybacks ahead of our original 2023 time line. We repurchased 16.5 million shares for $2.3 billion in Q4, bringing the cumulative total repurchase to $21.4 million shares for $3 billion in 2022. This is such an exciting start to this opportunity to deliver significant shareholder value. So let's talk about how our great execution and investments in '22 set us up for another strong year of growth in 2023. We expect total postpaid net additions to be between 5 million and 5.5 million, reflecting continued focus on profitable growth as we execute our differentiated growth strategy even while expecting total industry net additions to be down versus 2022. This guidance assumes roughly half of postpaid net adds coming from fans. That profitable growth leads to core adjusted EBITDA that is expected to be between $28.7 billion and $29.2 billion, or up 10% midpoint based on continued growth in service revenues and merger synergies and above our Analyst Day guidance for 2023. This excludes leasing revenues of approximately $300 million as we transition substantially all remaining customers off device leasing by year-end. Our merger synergies are expected to further ramp to between $7.2 billion to $7.5 billion in 2023, approaching a full run rate synergy target from our Analyst Day a year ahead of schedule. And thanks to great execution by the teams. We not only delivered accelerated synergies, but now also expect higher run rate synergies of approximately $8 billion in 2024, of which approximately $2 billion is avoided cost, which is consistent with the amount expected at our Analyst Day. With the major integration work now behind us, we expect merger-related costs, which are not included in adjusted or core adjusted EBITDA, to be approximately $1 billion before taxes, and is expected to be front-end loaded with roughly 40% expected in Q1. This is expected to be the last year of material margin related costs from a P&L perspective. And just as we have highlighted at Analyst Day, cash payments related to merger costs have underwent the P&L recognition to date and are expected to invert and be between $1.5 billion to $2 billion for 2023 with almost half of that total heading in Q1. Net cash provided by operating activities, including these payments for merger-related costs, expected to be in the range of $17.8 billion to $18.3 billion. We expect cash CapEx to be between $9.4 billion and $9.7 billion as we deliver capital efficiency unmatched in our industry on the back of our network integration and 5G leadership. I would expect this to be a bit more weighted towards the first half of the year. Our capital efficiency and data-informed customer-driven coverage approach guides us as we continue to enhance and further expand our network. Together, this results in expected free cash flow, including payments for merger-related costs to be in the range of $13.1 billion to $13.6 billion. This is up approximately 75% over last year, thanks to our large tension and capital efficiency and does not assume any material net cash inflows from securitization. And this also represents a free cash flow service revenue margin multiple percentage points higher than peers. Turning now to taxes, we expect our full year effective tax rate to be between 24% and 26%. And finally, as we continue to execute our strategy of winning and expanding account relationships, we expect full year postpaid ARPA to be up approximately 1% in 2023 and as we continuously win and then deepen our cap relationships. Altogether, we expect 2023 to be another year of profitable growth and even greater free cash flow expansion as we continue to extend our network leadership and further scale our differentiated growth opportunities. And with that, I will now turn the call back to Jud to begin the Q&A. Jud? Jud Henry : All right. Let's get to your questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator? Operator : Our first question comes from Craig Moffett with SVB Moffett. You may proceed with your question. Craig Moffett : Two questions, if I could. One is, you've now had a number of announcements about dabbling in the wireline market. I wonder if you could just talk about your wireline ambitions. And maybe bridge from that into the role that you think WA plays in making bundled offers. Is that something that you need to have nationally? And if so, how do you think you get there on the wireline side? And then second, just a financial question for Peter. I wonder if you could talk about the pacing of share repurchases. I understand that there's some debt paydown that we always expected the first, now that we're sort of well into the repurchase segment. What does the pace of that looks like over the next couple of years? Mike Sievert : Well, I'll start, Craig. Let me start by telling you a little bit about how we view the convergence space. And obviously, to the premise of your question, we are competing very ambitiously in this space with more new broadband net additions in 2022 than the rest of the industry combined. So we're very happy with our position, and it has lots of room to run for years to come. But on the other hand, the larger question is whether or not we're doing this for offensive reasons or defensive reasons. And our view is that the market has shown that customers will accept bundles. But it's far from certain weather bundles are something that they will require. And so we're some flank is exposed that we have to protect. We're interested in convergence because we have a lot to offer. And we have a great brand, a great capability, a great team, great distribution and the ability to add value to the space as you're seeing in our present success in home broadband through 5G. So we're very interested in the space. But I'll tell you, we haven't decided whether or not that would translate into augmenting that strategy with a wireline approach. But if we did, it would be because it's a good business. Not because we feel like there's some flank that we have exposed that we need to protect. And so while we haven't made a decision about it, I can tell you a few things that we've decided not to do. And I think that's important for people to understand. I personally have no interest in having some kind of major change to our strategy as a company or the financial outcomes that will go from that strategy or the shareholder remuneration that flows from our financial outcomes. We're on a mission to become the best in the world at wireless. And we're pursuing that mission ambitiously and so far, very successfully. That is the place where the future lies and where we want to be. And I'm interested in delivering all of the financial outcomes that we promised you that flow from that business plan. And the shareholder remuneration and share buybacks that flow from that, and we're not interested in something that would cause a material change in any of that. Secondly, because of that, I think we've looked at it and said, if we got involved we would do it most likely with partners. It would make -- it would just be smart to do it with partners versus by ourselves. And that means purely through a partnership or if we have an ownership stake of some type of some kind, it would be off balance sheet and again, would not be at a level that would have a material change in terms of who we are. And then as I said, we'd be interested in it. If it's something that we could add value and make the market better for customers and make some money doing it, directly for the merits of the business, not necessarily for the merits of how it would attribute to wireless. And that's because consumers are sort of voting with their feet. And so far, we haven't seen a benefit to convergence that really translates into consumer value beyond just a discount. And there are plenty of ways to deliver customers' discounts when you have the superior assets in wireless superior balance sheet and wireless, the best overall network and a tradition of a brand that delivers outstanding value. So hopefully, that helps clear that one up. Peter Osvaldik : Yes. And then on share buybacks, Craig, I think the important thing is that the strategy hasn't changed, other than, of course, the ability with the financial performance of the Company to initiate those earlier. And so, we couldn't have been more excited to get that first $14 billion through Q3 approved, and you saw we delivered $3 billion of that in 2022. We continue to have line of sight to the up to $60 billion. And so, nothing's changed with regards to the strategy. We're very excited about the cash flow generation of the business, and the flexibility that, that provides. If you think about shaping, of course, I'm not going to talk about day-to-day or week-to-week shaping for natural reasons. But of course, you've got the growth of core EBITDA coming throughout the years, which gives you financial flexibility. As you know, we're very prudent in just the leverage target that we've set overall. But again, nothing has changed with respect to the strategy, very excited about the free cash flow generation and the shareholder remuneration affords. Operator : Our next question comes from Philip Cusick with JPMorgan. You may proceed with your question. Philip Cusick : I wonder if you could dig into the business growth a little bit. What type of contracts are you signing? Are we -- what's sort of enterprise versus SMB mix? And where do these customers tend to come in on ARPU? We've heard about some free heavy discounting that you've done to win some big contracts. And as it goes to that, as we think about our POP up 1% this year, should we think of ARPU more like flat? Or does that start to drift a little bit lower year-over-year? Mike Sievert : We'll start with Callie on what we're seeing and then switch over to Peter on ARPA and ARPU. Callie Field : Okay. Thanks Mike. So in T-Mobile for Business, as Mike mentioned earlier, we continue to build very strong momentum, which is driven by our 5G network leadership combined with toward winning customer service model. In Q4, we continued to grow our service revenue. We delivered one of our highest ever postpaid so net add performance. We recorded our lowest postpaid phone churn since the merger with Sprint, and we grew our voice ARPU. In fact, we grew strong net adds every quarter in '22 and it's having an impact, as you can see in Verizon's business trend, which was its highest ever levels in '22. And their business to net adds declined sequentially for the last three quarters. We've also achieved five consecutive quarters of business Internet growth. Some of our key wins in strategic verticals, we found in the airline industry, where we've won nine out of 10 major airlines growing our base with these customers by 15% in Q4 alone. In the healthcare industry, we welcome to Ensign here as a using company who's deploying our mobility of a service solution to their 25,000 employees. In banking, large financial institutions are fast adopting on multiline solutions. We won three new logos in Q4 for a total of 24 accounts. In the public sector, we welcome to Chicago PD, Head County, Dallas IST. And even in our Advanced Network Solutions category, we signed on Formula 1, where we're on the last Vegas, be providing powering our operations and ensuring top performance fees. And we also welcomed Bell Resorts, the largest mountain resort operator where we're working together to provide innovative guest experiences, helping meet their sustainability goals and enhance restore operations. And we know why we're laying, it's not a race to the bottom, it's not a bit of the lowest rate of pricing down. We always treat our customers first. And in the modern workplace where CIS, we are focused on productivity digital transformation, even more considered sales. And therefore, it matters that we have a two-year head start in IT network leadership. It matters that we deploy customers drove coverage, and we're differentiated as a superior network an unparalleled service model. I'm going to it over to you, Peter. Peter Osvaldik : Yes. Let me just add to that. I think what you heard Callie say is we're competing on quality, by and large, and ARPUs are rising. They rose in 2022 in the business space. And the premise of your question, they're lower than consumer, but they rose in 2022 because CIOs are picking us because we have the best network and the best solutions, and they're interested in what we can bring in 5G that our competitors are behind on. And so, that's I think, very much to the premise of your question. As we go forward, one of the things to keep in mind is that even though business ARPUs are lower than consumer and always have been, and there's no structural change happening there. They are very good. The cost to sell in that area is lower longevity. So, there's plenty of reasons to like that business that are different for ARPU. That's why you got to be careful about ARPU as a guiding metric for the profitability of the business because it's not. Mike Sievert : Yes. Absolutely, Mike. And your question, we're definitely not anticipating ARPU to be down on a year-over-year basis. And probably our guide right now would be generally stable. And that's primarily the mix-driven metric as we just had the continued success in T-Mobile for Business, for example, being a mix-driven metric responders or segmentation approach. But there's been just a this amount of tailwind. We continue to see strength in Magenta MAX take rates in Q4. So as you get further into the year, there's potentially opportunity that we could even see some increases over that. But I'd say right now, generally stable with potential upside later in the year, and we'll see how that develops. Operator : Our next question comes from John Hodulik with UBS. You may proceed with your question. John Hodulik : Great. Two quick ones, if I could. First, I guess, following up on the business market question. Could you give some details on the rural market strategy? In the past, you've talked about where you are from a sort of spectrum deployment and distribution standpoint and sort of how well you're doing in terms of penetrating that market? And then on the CapEx guide, about $9.5 billion, is this sustainable level? And for Neville, maybe could you give us a sense for sort of what you have in store for the network in '23? Maybe update us on sort of the spectrum deployment at 2.5 where you're thinking for C-band and the other spectrum deployments as we look out to 2030 and beyond would be great. Mike Sievert : Thanks, John. Those are two great ones. First, on smart markets in the rural areas, and I'll hand it to Jon. I am so pleased with what's happening here. We set out to do something we hadn't really done at scale before a couple of years ago. And 2022 was a pivotal year due to all of that at scale. We moved from 30% in to 60% of the marketplaces where we're really competing at -- I think we've explained to you before, what we call internally license to play or better. And in those places, the numbers have been placed. So, maybe, Jon, if you can give a little bit of color on how that's going and maybe even some numbers and back it up, and then we'll switch and talk about what's going on in the network. Jon Freier : Yes. Like Mike said, from 30% one year ago to 60% where we'll keep hitting it just reminded about the size of this market. This is 140 million people across the entire country. It's 50 million households. It's 40% in the U.S. in terms of how we define small markets in rural areas, which is everything outside of the top 100 markets. But this overall business, it's been so fun. My heritage is I started out 25 years ago selling into a market are bringing cell phone service into rural markets, and it's in such times to actually bring usable Internet service, whether it be in your home or the mobile service in dual markets. So it's a very, very fun issue so far. And I got to tell you, our switching is up 350 basis points on a year-over-year basis. And when you look at where we're competing, again, 60% of the markets across all small markets areas, we're on in key areas of Verizon peaking over the leadership position in share of portends across the entire market, so a lot a lot of fun. When you look at what's happening to with high-speed Internet, that's a new for opportunity for us in smaller markets and we are in. About 1/3 of our total HSI, high-speed Internet net adds went out of smaller markets or areas, and that's a big catalyst for us in these particular geographies to be that front door in that consideration. But when you look at -- as been talking about this for a while in terms of not having to make a choice between the great value and a great network, that's never been more important, particularly in these areas that have been underserved for the last 25 years and certainly in the last 10 years from mobile perspective. So, we have a lot of fun doing it. Mike Sievert : And to see shares switching well into the 30s given that a lot of these places, we really does start, I mean, we have the last many years of experience. And that shows that those customers have a resonance with our brands and with our story and they want in. So, we're very pleased without these markets and consumers in the markets are responding. Terrific, let's go back -- sorry. Peter Osvaldik : The second part of his question was CapEx. John Hodulik : I almost forgot about network. Mike Sievert : Yes, the CapEx fees where the answer is yes, $9 billion to $10 billion run rate. So that's also we're getting done with that line '23 and beyond. Peter Osvaldik : Thanks for the question, John. We're coming off what has been a historic year for network investment in this company. I mean we had an accelerated spend in 2022. And you can see in Mike's opening comments, the results that are coming from that. Our 5G leadership is just not disputed in the marketplace. So that's now translating to overall network leadership, which is just tremendous progress for the business, and I thought a series of great growth opportunities as Jon just outlined in rolling across many other parts of the country too. So, as we look at a sustainable level in '23, we're in a great place because we got the integration effectively complete last year. That was a massive effort, but we're ahead of schedule there. And as we look at the build program on 5G and overall network, we just took great strides. Today, we announced 265 million people now covered with our ultra capacity footprint in the U.S. And that number will be 300 million people covered with our ultra capacity footprint by the end of this year. So we continue to expand that great powerful 5G service across the country. 300 million is a number that neither of our major competitors have even considered announcing a target to reach or to achieve. And in addition to that first part of your question, John, we continue to pain spectrum assets on 5G. I mean, we're a 5G business. We're trying to commit our spectrum, our entire portfolio to 5G as fast as we can. Why, because it's delivering just a tremendous experience to our customers. So that spectrum position today. We have 150 megahertz that are dedicated to 5G, some markets. And that's, I think, currently more than AT&T and Verizon combined having the 5G space. And that number, we've said we're targeting 200 megahertz just on the mid-band spectrum by the end of this year. And so, we've recently talked about how we're not just deploying 2.5 gigahertz. We're also adding powerful PCS spectrum in the space. That's a big part of the program as we move through in 2023. You asked about DoD and C-band spectrum. We have some great assets there. Probably a 2024 deployment plan for us as the opportunity to leverage and deploy that spectrum cleaned up with the FAA, et cetera, but 200 megahertz on mid-band is going to be an industry-leading proposition long before we get to the pentanes. So delighted with the progress, I mean, the 5G network is just unbeatable today across all markets in the U.S. The recent benchmarking clearly demonstrates that. But I think more exciting for the business and especially for the network team is this overall network leadership, something that we've been working way on for, as Mike referenced decades and now is in our hands. So a lot to do, '23 will be a continued busy year for us, but the plan is to extend on that work Mike Sievert : One of the things you can take away, John, from what Neville just said is that this network leadership story that has emerged has lots of room to run. We said three years ago, that we had jumped out in front on 5G, and we were at least two years ahead of our competitors. And I quoted in two years from now, we'll still be two years ahead of our competitors, and that's exactly what has unfolded if you listen to Neville's statistics, he told you that we're already, as you know, at 265 million people covered by ultra capacity. Neither of our competitors has stated the goal to be there any time in the next two years. In fact, they've stated to go for the end of next year, two years from now, it's less than that. And yet, we're not stopping there. We're on our way to 300 million people this year. But to me, is actually the more exciting part about the future testing you heard from Neville is going from 130 megahertz deployed of mid-band, 150 overall, 130 in mid-band to 200. That's a massive capacity expansion that's happening. Because that's not just factors on the experience you get every day. So far, our medium speeds are 5x faster than just three years ago. Our Magenta MAX customers and you know how Magenta MAX is. They're using 30 gigs a month. These are big advantages versus our competition. In broadband, where we're generating more net adds than the rest of the industry combined, has lots of room to run. And so that's all on the heels of this massive capacity that's not just in the network, that's still coming and within the run rate of the $9 billion to $10 billion in capital per year. Operator : Our next question comes from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed with your question. Simon Flannery : Mike, you teed up my question. You said you've got lots of room to run on fixed wireless. Some of the competitors critique the product around limitations on capacity, on speed. So perhaps now you've got a base of customers. You've seen behavior over a couple of years now. We are the learnings? How much market share do you think this product can take? And what's your ability to continue to expand the footprint to continue to expand the capacity of the network? And then maybe just a quick word on macro. You talked about some concerns you've seen, anything on payment patterns or any other cautious behavior yet? Mike Sievert : Great. Well, first on broadband, it's kind of stating the obvious. When somebody who is a fiber provider. So as you know that product not as good as our product. It's kind of like the people at pointing a finger at the world's best-selling car, Toyota saying, we're faster. We have the faster car. Yes, but Toyota is the world's best-selling car. And that's because -- and if you look in the case of T-Mobile, 5G home broadband because it's perfectly suited to what people want. And although it has less overall potential for capacity than a strain of fiber, which is patently obvious, it's radically simple at low cost. It's transparent. It's portable within tens of millions of households. It has the speed and capacity that allows people to think that they want. And therefore, the net promoter scores are some of the highest in the industry, 10 points higher than fiber, 30 points higher than cable. And most of our customers are coming directly from cable, not just from rural areas or unconnected places or DSO. And so it kind of demonstrates that we've got a product here with the right mix of services to meet people's needs, lots of room to run. When we launched this product, we talked about 7 million to 8 million homes. And as you can see from our numbers, we're tracking beautifully to that. And the question now is where do we go from here? And I gave comments before about whether or not we're looking at ways that could augment that strategy, of course, we are. But that's because we have a winning product and massively expanding capacity to support it. One of the things to keep in mind is that economically, this unlike fiber and cable. This product so far is not burdened by amortization of capital and the cost structure, right? So we're able to take the capital that we deployed through mobile and find places with excess capacity and market broadband there. And those places are rapidly expanding even though we have millions of customers on board now soaking some of it up. We're moving our eligible homes from 40 million to 50 million. And that means that there's 50 million homes out of 140 million nationwide, where tomorrow morning, you applied for service, we'd say, yes. And so that is a big footprint. And we think the product is beautifully suited to the times. Peter Osvaldik : I can speak to the question on the macro environment. From a consumer perspective, No, we're not seeing it. Of course, this is an area where we're very cautious. But when we think about just Q3 to Q4, we actually saw a little bit of improvement in voluntary churn. And bad debt was exactly what we laid out in Q2 stable on a percentage of revenue and in fact, actually lower than AT&T or Verizon on those metrics. So, it's something we're looking at and making sure we would closely monitor. As we said, this could also be a moment of opportunity for us because as a consumer set to the extent that you're pressured from a recessionary perspective, from an inflationary perspective, it might make you consider a lot of categories of spend and wireless is being one of those. And at the time you create the consideration moment, you go look around. And again this is the time where not only 5G leadership, but has translated into overall network leadership, coupled with that value proposition just being a fabulous time and it could be a tailwind for us. Again, looking at and making sure we're cautious, but nothing we're seeing right now gives us costs for concern. Mike Sievert : We're making sure our companies ready for after you know. I mean, but the fact that we saw bad debt moderate from Q2 with inflation for spike surprise consumers last spring. How Q3 and Q4 were lower than Q2. In voluntary involuntary churn was actually lower in Q4 than Q3. Our bad debt rates are lower than AT&T's are for us and showing the quality of our customer base, which has always been a question people had, especially after the Sprint merger. And so, we're signing in the future like everybody else, but we take it as far from a foregone conclusion that very stressful economic times are coming. We're prepared if they are. We're financially prepared. And as importantly, we prepared to serve American consumers that in that situation may be questioning whether they ought to be having a great network at a better value. And we're ready to stand up and serve them if they start questioning whether or not they should be saving money in this category because we are uniquely positioned with our high-quality value positioning for economic times like what might be coming. And so, we're ready in other case, but the emphatic answer to the question is no, we are not seeing it. Simon Flannery : Thanks for the color. Mike Sievert : Yes. So Jud, should we go in between here, should we go up to -- you guys can't see this, but we always have screens pointing at us with Twitter -- Twitter questions, and we'd like to open it up. And I was going to have you call out a couple, but there's one that's from at Magenta. So, they win, they have to have a long -- but it's actually a really good question. It kind of goes to something we've been talking about, which is what's T-Mobile doing to maintain its industry-leading growth, giving cable starting to build momentum in the telco space. And we talked about convergence earlier on. And it's interesting to me that we keep getting this question. We saw cables results coming. I talked about them in Q4. And I would just tell you that it looks to us like cable, who's been in the run rate now for a long time because you had a recent uptick. It looks to us like you're seeing lots of transference in terms of net adds that add to the category, additional adds being printed, et cetera, for customers. New phone numbers being created, people coming over from prepaid as a dynamic. But what's interesting is you see that recent surge in growth from cable, and this is interesting. At a time when every one of the three wireless incumbents experienced better-than-expected churn. So churn was better than expected, for us, it was falling. AT&T was falling in Q4 as well versus a year ago. And at the moment, when cable has for some, well, it didn't surprise us, but for some, a surprise uptick in net adds. And that should kind of tell you a little bit about what's going on. So for me, we look at it as sort of, as you would expect, since this is a contact sport as sort of us against everybody else, right? And so, if I look at the second half of the year, what's interesting is T-Mobile was able to deliver 17% more postpaid net additions in the second half of this year versus last year, while the rest of the industry, Verizon, AT&T, Charter and Comcast combined in wireless, delivered 19% less postpaid phone net additions in the second half of this year versus '21. So in terms of our separation from the market at a time when people ask were doing better and better. Jud, any -- one more on Twitter before we go back? Jud Henry : Not yet. Let's go back to the line and we'll keep watching. Great. Mike Sievert : Operator, next question please? Operator : Our next question comes from Jonathan Chaplin with New Street Research. You may proceed with your question. Jonathan Chaplin : Thanks for taking the question. You gave really great context on sort of what the market size is for rural and small markets and the fact that you've moved from 30% of that market to 60%. I'm wondering if you can give us a little bit more context around the business market in terms of like how your market shares have progressed over the course of this year, and what you see the size of the overall market being? Mike Sievert : I mean, one of the things you heard from Callie before is that Q4 was one of the best net add quarters ever in our history. So, we're really comfortable with where this is -- how this is shaping up. And one of the reasons for that is there are long sales cycles in this market. And we've been at this 5G story longer than anybody else. CIOs are very interested in more strategic engagements than they were interested in a couple of years ago. And now, we're in those conversations, but we're way down the pike in them. So, we're very comfortable with where we are. We're competing extraordinarily well. And to your market share question, we're very much on track for the Analyst Day aspirations that we shared with you. Jonathan Chaplin : Mike, can you give us the mix of business in fixed wireless broadband? Mike Sievert : You mean should I disclose that right now as a new fact. I don't think we did we haven't. I think what we've said is, it continues to be the majority from consumer, but you're seeing continued uptick in the business side as just Callie mentioned in growth there. So we see a lot of room to run on the business side as well. And obviously, continued room in the consumer space. Mike Sievert : I did see some notes on that that kind of got it wrong is that maybe business is what's surging in that area. It's the business is doing well, but it's the overwhelming majority for us is the consumer in that space. Yes. Operator, next question please. Operator : Our next question comes from Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed with your question. Brett Feldman : So, you've been able to sustain very strong post pay net adds throughout the merger integration despite those results being burdened by elevated churn related to those integration activities at certain points in time. And I know it sounds like it seems like a lot of that is behind you, but I'm curious how you think about the levers to drive churn lower from here. I'm wondering, if there's actually any residual benefits from the integration we haven't seen yet. I don't know how important the remaining billing migration may be to churn. And maybe just at a higher level, what type of churn outlook is embedded in your postpaid phone -- your postpaid net add estimates for this year? Mike Sievert : Yes. First of all, yes, on integration, there's more room to run. But principally, I think most of the room to run comes from value network, service brand. And look, we've been through this journey. We drove the Magenta brand to the best churning brand in this industry. And I certainly won't be satisfied until T-Mobile blended postpaid is the best churning brand in this industry. And that shows you we've got some room to run because while we're the most improved, which is a great price, we're not the best yet. And so that's where we're going. That's the goal. And it is, of course, there's some room to run on integration. But we're not separating it for you anymore because it's very hard to chop up at this point. All the customers are on the destination network. Some of them are on the destination biller. It's not that determinative anymore as to which biller you have because we try to make that biller sort of very opaque to you and not transparent. You're called T-Mobile in many cases. So it's -- it's just hard to chop it up now. But yes, there's still room to run to get people settled into fantastic rate plans, both on their device as well as on their service and to feel very careful with clear transparent services. But I'd say the bigger opportunity is our worst to first game plan that we know how to execute, which is give people a great gives them un-carrier moves that allow them to voice that deal and express in vote for T-Mobile. Give them the best network bar not, give them a fantastic path to great devices. Give them a brand that's famous for caring for them and the best customer service in the industry. That's why our net promoter scores are the highest in the industry, and I expect that to translate to the lowest churn by the time we're done. Brett Feldman : If you want to mind, if I guess as a churn follow-up question. Where are you in understanding the churn profile of your fixed wireless base, either just as a stand-alone broadband customer or perhaps the impact it has on your mobile churn to the extent of bundle with mobile. Mike Sievert : We're really happy with it. What we do with any business is we age it into cohorts and look at it sort of based on people that have been with us 1.5 years, people that have just been with us a few weeks. And what you see is what you -- exactly what you would expect, which is the more aged cohorts are settling into a beautiful pattern. We have the youngest broadband base in the industry because we went from nothing to 2.5 million subscribers all in the last few months. And so, we have to really break it down to understand it. And when we do, we're very pleased. And one of the things that happens as a dynamic on this business is that the barriers to trial, therefore, the cost to us of encouraging that trial are totally different than wireline. We're not sending some drug -- some truck to your house to dig ditches or drill holes in the side of your house and all kinds of cost. We're letting you take home a modem and router and give it a shot. And if you love it, you wind up sticking with it. And if not, there's sort of a no harm, no file relationship. This is, let's try it again in a year that wasn't perfect for you right now because we're pouring capacity into this network. And as long as we treat customers really well and they gave this a shot, and we were transparent with them that as to whether or not it would work. The vast majority will keep it, but the small portion of people that don't, doesn't really wind up costing us anything. So, the dynamics of early churn in a business like this are totally different than traditional broadband is one of the things that makes it a better business model. Operator : Our next question comes from David Barden with Bank of America. You may proceed with your question. David Barden : So, I guess the first question would be for Peter. If you could kind of kind of step us through the guidance and the changes from the Analyst Day outlook from $28 billion to $29 billion, what's changed to move your midpoint expectations up? And then from the free cash flow or original guidance of $13 billion to $14 billion, what's moved your midpoint down? And what are moving parts in between those two things? And the second question would be, Mike, what would be your appetite to proactively reach out to SoftBank within the confines of the stock buyback program and clean up this $48.8 million share issue that seems to be keeping for whatever reason, and I understand the lockup and it seems to be keeping T-Mobile stock from going north of $150 million. Is there an appetite to just get rid of that and just make sure that, that's not a headwind for the stock on a go-forward basis? Mike Sievert : Those are both great questions, Dave. Let's start with EBITDA and cash flow. As you could just eliminate all the headwinds and tailwinds since the early 2021 kind of give us a high level. Peter Osvaldik : Yes. Mike Sievert : But we're the only still talking about our 2021 guidance. And we're talking about pulling into the stations and beating it. And that should say a lot about our business plan and the integrity of it. But it is actually quite different than what we were expecting in terms of some of the shaping of it inside. Peter, maybe you can give some color. Peter Osvaldik : Absolutely, when I just think, Dave, back to Analyst Day and what's happened since then, you've certainly seen a tremendous amount of incremental profitable growth than what we see. And you saw the ARPA trajectory grow you've seen high-speed Internet and the tremendous growth that we've had there and the ability to accelerate synergies. On the flip side, of course, the world has changed a lot since then, and inflation is one of the elements, that's impacted a lot of companies. For us, we've been a lot more insulated than others, and we've talked before around why that is with our ability early on after the merger to walk down major categories of costs during a time when the negotiation looks a lot different in low interest rate environments and low inflation rate environment. So, there's a lot of the kind of puts and takes and why you see us now being able and confident to express a guy that's actually above Analyst Day. When I think about just the shaping of the core EBITDA throughout the course of the year, what you're going to have, of course, is continued profitable growth and continued synergy unlock. And one of the things that's assumed in the core EBITDA guide is the wireline sale close somewhere around midyear and that's a little bit of a drag on core EBITDA. So as I think about like Q1 probably in the approximately 6.9 range and then continued unlock throughout the course of the year on core EBITDA. And then how I think about from there to free cash flow, really free cash flow in 2023 as a few onetime items that you need to consider. And first and foremost is we're actually now in '23 achieving what we've been talking about for a long time now, which is the highest conversion of service revenue to free cash flow in the industry, despite these kind of few onetime things that I'll highlight. One is merger-related expenses, and I spoke in the prepared remarks around $1.5 billion to $2 billion. And that's a little bit higher than we assumed at Analyst Day in terms of total merger-related expenses by about $400 million, and that gives you now an incremental unlock up to $8 billion of total run rate synergies. So, that's one -- the other is a 21 cyber event. And remember, you saw us take a lot of the expense-related charges in 2022, but we anticipate the cash flow associated with the class action settlement to outflow in '23. And then the last again is related to wireline, where as you recall, we have an IT related take-or-pay agreement. The first year after close is $350 million and then tapers down significantly from there. And so, we're assuming about half of that flowing into '23. So that's how you kind of take core EBITDA down to free cash flow guide. And hopefully, that answered almost all the puts and takes. Mike Sievert : I just love the question, by the way, Dave, because our guide on cash flow for next year is to have 75% year-on-year growth. And you're like, right. We have just a little low respect. And the answer is I hope so. Let's see what happens. So when you had a second question about SoftBank. Obviously, we know the SoftBank guys very well. We talked a lot, we're in constant communication. But I wouldn't say there's a deal imminent. And there's a reason for that, which is people on both sides of a potential transaction, believe that we're moving past 150 anyway. And so, they don't have a lot of incentive to give us a deal or a discount because they think they're getting this event we've always planned for it. We've always believed the average analyst target is 170 on this business. If you look at our rapidly expanding cash flow profile and the durability of our growth strategy, we think this event is probably coming. So, it doesn't feel like it feels like for us, we would want to discount it, we were going to take that out and they look at it and say, \"Yes, but why would I give you a discount and so there's -- that's a little bit of color on it. So I wouldn't say a transaction is imminent, but I wouldn't say it's impossible either. I think the operator cut you off. But yes, we know and thank you for that -- great. And so looking over, if we look at the Twitter, Bill Ho always has some great questions. T-Mobile, John Fryer, Mike Katz, state of prepaid for T-Mobile competitors, including MVNOs. And T-Mobile was the only net positive on prepaid, others had losses. What's going on with prepaid and also what's going on with the MVNO market. Since it includes the MVNO market, I'll actually switch to Mike Katz you can tell us a little bit about what's happening in prepaid. Mike Sievert : Yes. Like Mike said, we're really excited about what happened in prepaid. We were the only one with positive gains. And I think most importantly, we have and continue to have the number one brand in prepay with Metro. And we see the Metro growth being a big tailwind for us. We also have a really healthy and robust MVNO set of partnerships, including big exclusive partners that also had significant growth over the course of '22 and in Q4. And we've got a diverse set of partners that both focus in unique distribution that we don't always fully reach with the T-Mobile brand and unique segments that also sometimes are underrepresented with the T-Mobile brand. So, we feel really good about the portfolio of products and brands that are reaching the prepaid market. I find it particularly gratifying that in an environment where there's lots of transference from prepaid to postpaid going on and which has lasted longer than most people predicted it would last. Our prepaid brand continues to be the strongest in the market and the only one that grew this quarter. That's fantastic because you have seen lots of momentum across the industry from prepaid to postpaid because of the economic times. People are qualifying for postpaid and continue to do so to the premise of the earlier question about what we're seeing in the macroeconomic environment. And yet our prepaid brand remains this strong. The lowest churn ever in our history on prepaid and the lowest in the industry was in 2022. And so this is a business where -- that has a great bond with its customers. They stick with it for a long time. They love Metro by T-Mobile, and it's a real source of strength. Jud, is that -- does that take us to the end of the program? Jud Henry : It does. We can probably take one more question and then we got to hop it up. So operator, one more and then we got a call it a day. Operator : So our next question comes from Peter Supino with Wolfe Research. You may proceed with your question. Peter Supino : A question on postpaid phone ARPU. For many years, your ARPU model was flat to down annually and 2022 is a fantastic year for ARPU. Thanks in part to MAX. MAX sell-in still sounds really steady for '23. And so, thinking about your outlook for flattish. I'm just wondering why we might not expect to see more growth in ARPU and maybe even a similar year to 2022 in '23. Mike Sievert : A part of it is because it's early in the year, and it's not that clear where the dynamics of competition will be. If you look back to our multiyear Analyst Day targets, we actually thought back then, back to all the puts and takes, and Peter just kind of talked about this, that there would be much more going on, on sort of the service revenue ARPU side, And we didn't anticipate as much as what wound up happening on the device side. And so we guided accordingly on service revenues and ARPU where we achieved the '23 service revenues last year and ARPU growth was a big reason for that. But we had unexpected costs on the device side because the factors of competition sort of shifted. So it's a little early to comment on ARPU. We do know that if there's an opportunity for growth versus just generally stable, it would be more in the second half than the first half, and there's reasons for that. But we really like where this is. The underlying dynamics on Magenta MAX are stronger not moderating. They are stronger than they've ever been. But on the other hand, we're finding success with military, with seniors, with business and other things that could be dilutive to ARPU, but are fantastic on a CLV basis. And that's why we have to be careful about not getting people to hooked into ARPU. ARPA, we're guiding for growth because we see lots of opportunity for customers to continue to double down on their relationships with us across the board, including new device types and including home and business broadband. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of puts and takes on kind of why it unfolded the way it unfolded. Jud Henry : Thanks, everybody, for joining us today. Again, I look forward to catching up with you again soon. If you have any other questions, please reach out to the Investor Relations and Media Relations team, and have a great day. Mike Sievert : Thanks, everybody. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the T-Mobile fourth quarter earnings call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect and have a pleasant day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jud Henry, Senior Vice President, Head of Investor Relations for T-Mobile US. Please go ahead, sir. Jud Henry : All right. Welcome to T-Mobile\u2019s First Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. Joining me on the call today are Mike Sievert, our President and CEO; Peter Osvaldik, our CFO; as well as other members of the senior leadership team. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. We provide a comprehensive list of risk factors in our SEC filings, which I encourage you to review. Our earnings release, investor fact book and other documents related to our results, as well as reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP results discussed on this call can be found in the Quarterly Results section of the Investor Relations website. With that, I will turn it over to Mike. Mike Sievert : Okay. Thanks, Jud. Hi, everybody. Well, welcome to the call, and as you can see, we are coming to you live from Bellevue, Washington at our headquarters and I am here gathered with a great group of our senior leadership team as we share with you some terrific results that we are posting today to kick off 2023. And I will start by saying our results for Q1 continue to demonstrate that no matter the competitive environment, our unique formula of offering the best network and the best value continues to produce best-in-class outcomes. We again led the industry in postpaid and broadband customer net adds, while continuing to deliver the best profitability growth. And our consistent focus on reliably translating customer growth into industry-leading postpaid service revenue growth and unlocking substantial cash flow gives us the confidence to raise our full year guidance just one quarter into the new year. Now I will also say Q1 was a quarter of celebration at T-Mobile. I am so proud of how our now 10-year history of more than 20 Un-carrier moves have transformed to this wireless industry and more recently, broadband for the benefit of customers, and as you often hear us say, we won\u2019t stop. So we announced last week our latest Un-carrier move with Phone Freedom, a move aimed to free customers and other wireless providers locked into those three-year contracts, while they are subjected to relentless pricing changes and gadgets. We continue to make it easier for customers to come to T-Mobile and switch to T-Mobile for peace of mind, knowing that with price lock, we won\u2019t raise their price for top text and data. And now with new one too are part of Phone Freedom, they will be upgrade-ready in two years, because three years is too long to force customers to wait. Here\u2019s kind of a crazy sort of fact to get your head around, AT&T reported the lowest postpaid phone churn in the industry this quarter and yet quantitative research states that their customers have the highest self-reported likelihood of switching away. Their customers report being almost 50% more likely to switch than Verizon\u2019s or T-Mobile\u2019s customers. The lowest churn, but the highest apparent dissatisfaction. And to me, that means one thing. Their customers are trapped and we are here to solve it and that\u2019s what our latest Un-carrier move is all about. That\u2019s what Phone Freedom is all about. And it\u2019s the way we have been designing our groundbreaking Un-carrier moves for a full decade now. And as you know, we hit another milestone this month, the three-year anniversary of our merger. We are wrapping up an integration that many have deemed, and I think, we will conclude that it is, the most successful merger in telecom history. And most of all, we are celebrating what it was always about, the dream we had of leapfrogging from last place in the 4G era to leadership in the 5G era, smashing the biggest pain point of all by finally giving customers in this industry both, the best network and the best value from the same provider. And you know what? We did it and we did it ahead of schedule, meeting our commitments and unlocking massive value in the process. And yeah, we brought about a new level of competition to this market and a 5G network to America that would not have been possible without this merger and that makes customers and businesses everywhere, the real winners. Speaking of network, another round of results are in and our team is again celebrating wins as the largest, fastest and most awarded 5G network as well as the best overall network for the second quarter in a row according to Ookla. And this is not just a snapshot in time. It is a durable network lead. And I am confident that Ulf and team in his new role as President of Technology, congratulations and thank you for stepping in to lead us\u2026 Ulf Ewaldsson : Thank you. Mike Sievert \u2026 will continue to keep us ahead in this race over the next years with our great spectrum assets in both depth and breadth deployed rapidly and our rapid execution of our unique process called customer-driven coverage, and finally, continued leadership in implementing advanced technologies such as standalone 5G and multi-carrier aggregation. All of these things, importantly are contributing to the best capital efficiency in our sector. All of these strengths, coupled with our unique opportunity in underpenetrated markets are what enables a differentiated and profitable growth strategy that separates us from the competition, and you know what, we showed that again in Q1. We added 287,000 postpaid account net additions, the highest reported in the industry once again. And that means we are winning the switching decisions in the market, because this looks at it at the account level. And we had postpaid net additions of 1.3 million, more than AT&T and Verizon combined. This included postpaid phone net adds of 538,000. We won a higher share of net adds year-over-year even as the industry continues to moderate, just like we predicted we would in previous calls. Our increased share was driven by our strong phone gross adds, as well as being the only national wireless provider to improve postpaid phone churn year-over-year. Our consistent approach to profitable growth continues to deliver right on and sometimes even above our ambitious plans and that\u2019s even as the competitive landscape continues to shift and evolve. In recent quarters, we have seen cable giving away three first lines that don\u2019t, by the way, appear to be incrementally pulling from existing customers and incumbent providers but definitely are driving their ARPUs down. We have seen AT&T and Verizon significantly outspend us in media advertising. I mean Verizon alone spent almost 60% more than T-Mobile in Q1. And we continue to see, as I mentioned earlier, others lean into expensive long-term device contract offers to lock up their customers, while T-Mobile was the only one who improve churn year-over-year and have the lowest upgrade rate. Improving churn, but with the lowest upgrades, that\u2019s because our approach is not to slam customers with expensive unwanted upgrade contracts to tie them down for three years. Customers genuinely choose to stay with T-Mobile for the network, for the value proposition and for the experiences. And you know what? That\u2019s how we want it to be. You have heard us say before, our strategy is differentiated and durable, because it\u2019s driven by taking share in the places where we continue to be underpenetrated relative to the market, but where we now have new permission to win. This profitable growth playbook and the momentum we saw in Q1 is exactly what gives us the confidence to raise our postpaid net add and financial guidance for the year. A perfect example of this, T-Mobile for Business where we just posted one of our highest ever phone net add quarter in Q1 with the lowest business phone churn in our history and we are profitably taking share with more business account net adds and more business phone net adds than Verizon in the quarter. On the consumer side, we are winning with prime network seekers in the top 100 markets who increasingly recognize that T-Mobile offers the best combination of network coverage and capacity for their needs. In fact, our prime customer base hit an all-time high again this quarter. And in smaller markets and rural areas, we are now capturing a win share of switchers in the upper 30s and that\u2019s in the roughly two-thirds of this geography where we are competing. This is great news, because it\u2019s showing that our strategy here is very much on track. In addition, we added 523,000 high-speed Internet customers as we have continued to grow our gross adds every quarter since we launched two years ago. I would expect that we added more broadband customers than AT&T, Verizon, Comcast and Charter combined for the fourth consecutive quarter. And not only did we have the highest net adds, but our focus on profitable growth translated into strong financial performance with core adjusted EBITDA up 9% year-over-year and free cash flow up over 45%. Our Q1 results were just the latest example of how we have lots of room to run at T-Mobile and I am confident in our ambitions for this year and beyond. One thing you have come to expect from this management team is that we are never satisfied, and you saw that again with our latest Un-carrier move to free customers from three-year contracts and introduce new Go5G plans that offer even more value than before. As proud as I am of what we have accomplished in our 10 years as the Un-carrier and in Q1 most recently, I am even more excited about what\u2019s ahead for T-Mobile and I am so thankful that all of you are on this journey with us. Okay. Peter, over to you to talk about the key financial highlights and our updated guidance for 2023. Peter Osvaldik : Absolutely. Thank you, Mike. 2023 is positioned to be another year of best-in-class profitable growth based on our Q1 results and the updated guidance I will share with you in a moment. Our continued increases in postpaid accounts and postpaid ARPA resulted in the best postpaid service revenue growth in the industry, up 6% year-over-year. Our disciplined focus on profitability resulted in a 9% year-over-year increase in core adjusted EBITDA and we grew our core adjusted EBITDA margin by 270 basis points year-over-year, while AT&T and Verizon were flat to down. In addition, as Mike mentioned, free cash flow was up over 45% and unlock the highest free cash flow margin relative to our peers. We expect our industry-leading free cash flow margin to be a durable and differentiated unlock of shareholder value going forward. This strong financial performance also supported our share buybacks as we repurchased 33 million shares for $4.8 billion in Q1, with a cumulative total of 59.4 million shares repurchased for $8.5 billion as of April 21. It was also great to see our continued execution on profitable growth reflected in the recent rating upgrades from both Moody\u2019s to Baa2 and Fitch who recently upgraded us two notches to BBB+. These rating increases further strengthen our access to lower cost capital in the deep investment grade market. All right. Let\u2019s jump into the details of our increased guidance for 2023. We now expect total postpaid phone net customer additions -- total postpaid net customer additions to be between 5.3 million and 5.7 million, up 250,000 at the midpoint, reflecting growth across all of our market opportunities and we continue to expect nearly half of postpaid net adds coming from phones for the full year. Our focus on profitable growth allows us to fund those higher customer net adds and still increase our core adjusted EBITDA expectations, which are now expected to be between $28.8 million and $29.2 billion, this is up 10% year-over-year at the midpoint based on higher service revenues and merger synergies, of course, excludes leasing revenues of approximately $300 million, as we transition substantially all remaining customers off device leasing by year end. Our merger synergies are expected to be between $7.3 billion to $7.5 billion in 2023, approaching the full run rate synergy target from our Analyst Day a year ahead of schedule as we build towards the recently raised run rate synergy target of $8 billion in 2024. We continue to expect merger-related costs, which are not included in adjusted or core adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $1 billion before taxes and we also continue to expect cash merger-related costs of $1.5 billion to $2 billion for 2023 as they have underrun the P&L recognition to-date. Net cash provided by operating activities, which includes payments for merger-related costs is now expected to be in the range of $17.9 billion to $18.3 billion. We continue to expect cash CapEx to be between $9.4 billion and $9.7 billion, driven by a capital efficiency unmatched in our industry on the back of our network integration and 5G leadership. We expect Q2 to remain elevated, just slightly lower than Q1 and then moderating in the back half of the year. Together, this results in higher free cash flow, including payments for merger-related costs, which is now expected to be in the range of $13.2 billion to $13.6 billion. This is up approximately 75% over last year. Thanks to our margin expansion and capital efficiency and does not assume any material net cash inflows from securitization. And as I mentioned, this also represents a free cash flow to service revenue margin, which is multiple percentage points higher than peers and based on the cadence of CapEx, I would expect free cash flow in Q2 to be slightly higher than Q1 and then ramp in the back half of the year. We continue to expect our full year effective tax rate to be between 24% and 26%. And finally, as we execute our strategy of winning and expanding account relationships, we continue to expect full year postpaid ARPA to be up approximately 1% in 2023. All right. Before I wrap up, I want to give a quick update on the sale of our wireline assets to Cogent. The process is progressing very smoothly led by Dave and the team at Cogent, and we now expect the transaction to close in early May. On a quarterly basis, this will lead to approximately $125 million lower wholesale and other service revenue and approximately $175 million lower cost of service expenses with a nominal impact to SG&A. With the mid-quarter closing, we expect a partial impact in Q2 with the full quarter impact beginning in Q3. So, in closing, we expect 2023 to be another year of profitable growth and even greater free cash flow expansion as we continue to extend our network leadership and further scale our differentiated profitable growth opportunities. And with that, I will now turn the call back over to Jud to begin the Q&A. Jud? Jud Henry : Thanks, Peter. All right. [Operator Instructions] Operator, let\u2019s take our first question, please. Operator : Our first question comes from Phil Cusick with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed. Phil Cusick : Hi, guys. Thanks very much. Maybe we can start with the revenue per user. I think you said the same thing about ARPA this quarter that you did last approximately up 1% in 2023. We have been looking at the Go5G plans, which were launched recently. Can you remind us of the path of customers moving to Magenta MAX, how long that took and sort of the and is that a good guide for the pace of the Go5G upgrades and how that drives that ARPA lift? Mike Sievert : Hey, Phil. I will start and maybe turn to Mike and Peter. First of all, we are really excited about this new lineup. But I want to point out a couple of things. One, Magenta MAX continues to be in the lineup and so this is being added to Magenta MAX. And as we think about the price point represented by these kind of mainstream popular plans, we are going to be kind of thinking of it as Magenta MAX and higher. So that would include Magenta MAX, it would include the new Go5G Plus Plan kind of as a category. And what you see is, our expectation is that, that run rate we have been seeing in that 60s will carry forward and we have certainly seen that since the launch and it was true for Magenta MAX all through Q1. So really great to see that our popular plans are also our highest value plans packed with the things T-Mobile customers are looking for. And maybe, Mike, you can talk about -- unpack that a little bit. Mike Katz : Yeah. I mean, I think like Mike said, it\u2019s a great representation of the differentiation of our strategy, particularly as it comes to the way that we construct rate plans and do pricing, because with Go5G and Go5G Plus, you see new plans that are incremental to our portfolio that really give customers choice. And with these plans, we packed in the most benefits that we have ever done in the plan with increased roaming in Mexico and Canada, which is the most popular destination for our customers, increased hotspot, which we are seeing utilized more, especially in a post-pandemic world where people are moving around and working everywhere and with Go5G Plus. The first plan, we are guaranteed in the plan, new and existing customers get the same deal on phones, not a promotion like you see from other folks. So we are really bullish on these plans. The early response to them has been really good. One of the things I will say about ARPU is ARPU is a mix-driven metric. And one of the things that you see with us, particularly with the success in some of the segments that we have talked about as being opportunities for us, whether it\u2019s business or 55-plus. The mix of our success in those segments is reflected in our ARPU and it\u2019s one of the reasons why we look a lot at ARPA and we focus a lot on opportunities where we can attract customers and retain customers that demonstrate a really high CLV, like we see with business customers and like we see with 55-plus customers. So you will see us continue to focus on those kinds of accretive value creating opportunities in our portfolio. Mike Sievert : Peter? Peter Osvaldik : Yeah. I think the only thing I add and Mike said it really well is, it\u2019s such a mix-driven metric. And for example, on the segments that Mike spoke about 55-plus brings in customers with CLVs that are actually above the average CLV, right? They may have lower ARPUs but very high accretive CLVs, because that\u2019s how we really model everything and the growth that we are trying to drive, as you know, is profitable growth for us. So on an ARPU-based metric, because of that mix shift, I\u2019d probably expect it to be sequentially relatively flat. But, yes, as you pick up some more mix of potentially 5G Plus -- Go5G Plus, excuse me, 5G everywhere here, then you could see some opportunity in the latter half of the year. But ARPA and accounts is really where the focus is to create that value expansion in the company. Phil Cusick : That\u2019s helpful. Thanks, guys. Mike Sievert : Thanks, Phil. Yeah. Operator, next question, please? Operator : Our next question comes from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed. Mike Sievert : Hey, Simon. Landon Park : Hi. This is Landon on for Simon. Thanks for taking the question. Mike Sievert : Okay. Landon Park : I am wondering if we could start on the home broadband side. Maybe can you talk about how you are seeing churn in the different cohorts there and what your latest thoughts are on some of the fiber trials you have been running, as well as the latest thoughts on a potential millimeter wave overlay on that front? Mike Sievert : Yeah. I will start and then we will see who wants to jump in. There\u2019s a bunch there. First of all, you are asking about our fiber trials. And I don\u2019t have a lot new to report there, other than this is a team that, obviously, through our leadership in high-speed Internet and 5G is very committed to being winners in broadband. And so for us, being able to get involved, learn, understand what drives CLV, understand the service models, the technology models, et cetera, is something that\u2019s very important and you see us continuing to do that. We haven\u2019t taken any decisions beyond that other than anything we learn there is accretive to us being in this business and you see that we are already in this business as a major player in the 5G variant. As it relates to what we are seeing in the business itself, I am very pleased. I mean Net Promoter Scores for this business continue to be higher than average cable and higher-than-average fiber in the country. So people love what T-Mobile is serving up to them and that\u2019s important and it informs the churn models, as you are saying. Now we have a very young base and so to your point, we look at it on a cohorted view and some of those aging customers from earlier, we really like what we are seeing in terms of their retention. So really pleased and you can see Net Promoter Score as kind of an indicator of that. Mike, why don\u2019t you jump in, anything else you want to share on that? Mike Katz : I would just say to Mike\u2019s point, as the customer base is growing as we are seeing more cohorts in the longer tenures, we are seeing sequential decreases in churn. And it really does start with what Mike said, this is a great product. It\u2019s a product that really that doesn\u2019t require any trade-offs from customers. It\u2019s got a great NPS and you are seeing it pull heavily from cable. Cable is the biggest contributor to our customer base in this business. And we have built a model and a go-to-market process that now is reliably delivering plus or minus 500,000 customers a quarter, which gives us a lot of confidence in this number that we talked about a couple of years ago of us getting to several millions at the end of this planning period. Mike Sievert : Okay. And last part of your question was about where do we go beyond our current model and I want to remind everybody what the current model is before answering that, because it kind of speaks to the opportunity here, because others have side eye to what we are doing and said, well, you know there\u2019s a limited opportunity to that. What they are doing over there, and we are like, well, right. I mean we have said that all along. We expect this to be a 7 million unit to 8 million unit opportunity the way we are doing it right now, which is essentially selling excess capacity on our network. So remember, the way this works is, we have created a nationwide mapping of every household in this country, map them to every sector on every tower and determined which sectors no normal amount of mobile wireless use will take up our rapidly expanding capacity and that is where we approve applicants for high-speed Internet on 5G. So we are essentially selling our excess capacity. We see that, that takes us into those high single-digit millions of households in the planning period. Now the question that you asked about millimeter wave is really part of a broader question that says, whether for millimeter wave or not, would we entertain the idea of a capital burden to 5G home Internet plan. And yeah, we would entertain that. It would have to be smart. We would have to have a way to make it capital efficient. We haven\u2019t taken any decisions on that. I don\u2019t know if you want to share a little bit of our thinking or kind of what we see as the opportunity of, but the short answer of it is we haven\u2019t taken a decision on it, but of course, we are interested in it. Neville Ray : Well, thanks, Mike, and great question, Simon. And I would say that our 2.5 spectrum that we are using today is serving us so well, because we have so much excess capacity. We are moving now from 200 -- this quarter we are reporting 275 million POPs covered by with this mid-band spectrum and we are moving towards 300 coverage by the end of the year, giving us new opportunities also to serve other HSI opportunities. Then I would say that we are always looking at millimeter wave when we are doing trials and testing, but it\u2019s limited in reach and we have to remember that it\u2019s limited in reach and we will put it into an economic formula over time to see if it makes sense to pursue it. Mike Sievert : Terrific. Thanks for joining the call. Landon Park : Thank you very much. Mike Sievert : All right. Operator, next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from John Hodulik with UBS. Please proceed. Mike Sievert : Hi, John. John Hodulik : Great. Hey, Mike. Maybe a couple of questions. First just on the competitive environment. You mentioned Verizon has been a little bit sort of ladder from an advertising statement. I think from a promotion standpoint, too, and Comcast we had some success with their sort of free line offer similar what Charter has been doing. Just how would you characterize the competitive environment in wireless as it stands today and sort of what gives you the confidence to sort of raise the postpaid numbers as we look into the rest of the year? And then on the buyback, a bit higher than we thought and you are sort of pretty far along on the authorization, should we expect the buyback to slow through the year as you bump up against that existing authorization? Thanks. Mike Sievert : Great. So competition and buyback. I will start on competition and then turn to Jon Freier. I would say, it\u2019s competitive out there. And that being said, I have probably done 50 of these calls for T-Mobile and that\u2019s been the case for all 50 of them. It\u2019s competitive out there and we have made it more competitive through the creation of this version of T-Mobile. What I said in my prepared remarks is that we have demonstrated time and time again that regardless of the competitive mill, we find our way through to accretive profitable growth, and that\u2019s because our strategy is so differentiated. So I am not going to repeat all that here, other than to say, of course, it\u2019s really competitive. I find the industry a rational level of competition, even the competitors you talked about have been pulsing in and out. Some of the offers have been eyebrow raising but they pulse in and out. I think to me, it feels competitive and rational and we look at our differentiated strategy. And what we have within our control and we see our way through to increasing our overall guidance for the year. But maybe tell us on the ground, Jon, what your team is seeing as we compete last quarter and this quarter. Jon Freier : Yeah. You bet. So, yeah, like Mike said, it is a competitive environment, but that\u2019s nothing really new for us and we are seeing -- continuing to see real solid demand out there. When you look at our overall traffic, when you look at the interest, we are seeing incredible demand that you can see, obviously manifested in our Q1 numbers. And even so far in Q2, we are seeing really strong demand and like we said earlier in our prepared comments, not only strong demand as a whole, but strong demand around prime customers and the fact that we had our highest mix of prime customers. We are continuing to see a very healthy activating revenue number in terms of new accounts switching to Magenta MAX and now Go5G Plus, and since we even launched that on Sunday, we are seeing really good numbers kind of an early peek into what\u2019s happening there. And then I would just tell you, too, from what\u2019s happening in the marketplace is, again, our differentiated position in what we are doing in smaller markets and rural areas. And one of the things that we talked to you about in 2021 at Analyst Days, we had this ambition to move from 13% share of households to 20% by the end of 2025. And what we are really excited about is that we are already halfway there. We are now at 16.5% in terms of our share in household position. So more than halfway there or halfway there, but in less than half the time over that planning horizon. And when you look at what we are doing relative to others, it\u2019s really coming down to four things in smaller markets, rural areas. One, is we are building out this -- the markets out there with network and distribution. We are now playing in two-thirds of smaller markets in real areas, 140 million people, 50 million households, 40% of the U.S. Two, we are really unlocking switching and getting switching moving. Last quarter, I told you that switching was up 350 basis points on a year-over-year basis, we are sustaining that with now postpaids win share in the upper 30s. Three, is when you look at what\u2019s happening with high speed Internet, we talked about that just a few moments ago, but that\u2019s a new front door for us that gets, even before people are thinking about switching mobile, we can get into the household as a catalyst for customers to be thinking about moving their mobile services into T-Mobile from AT&T, Verizon, et cetera. And then lastly, what we have that\u2019s different in those particular markets is we have a dedicated and focused team where we are building out hundreds of stores about a little bit more than 400 stores since we have started this venture out in the smaller markets and rural areas. So when you look at what\u2019s happened under the ground, strong demand really getting after it in 40% of the U.S. from smaller markets and real areas and then when you look at the overall health and the quality of the customer that we are talking to, it\u2019s never been better. Mike Sievert : So it\u2019s been two years and we have made our way halfway from 13% to 16.5% market share and we are only really competing in two-thirds of the space. It\u2019s just been this rapid fire deployment, and it\u2019s -- you should be so proud of what\u2019s happening there. Jon, at the risk of filibustering your competition question, I have one more thing. I feel like we shouldn\u2019t answer a question about competition unless we talk about cable. Jon Freier : Right. Mike Sievert : And we are a very competitive company, so one thing I will give our team a little bit of credit on is that, we have pretty good diagnostics and telemetry on what\u2019s going on in the marketplace and so we are able to kind of see what happens with each of the competitors as the quarter unfolds and I can make a couple of predictions for you. You saw it in Comcast numbers this morning, very strong. Charter had a blockbuster quarter, we think, in phone net additions and we saw that unfolding through the quarter. But one of the things we try to do when we sort of make out -- at least for us, when we make our operating decisions is we try to figure out, well, what\u2019s behind it and double click into it. And what we see going on is that, for example, in this big number, they are about to report, about 75%, we think, of the uptick from prior normal levels, let\u2019s say, a year ago, are in non-parts sort of printed net adds, like drop you a free line in the bag or kind of low calorie net adds. And so we try to kind of adjust for that when we make our operating decisions as to how fast to run and where and how to compete, because they are really -- it\u2019s kind of a quantitative easing happening in the marketplace. There\u2019s just new adds being printed that don\u2019t appear to be coming from any of the incumbent players. So it\u2019s kind of important to adjust for all that, at least for us, as we make our operating decisions. It looks to us about 75% of the uptick has been those kinds of nets. So you actually asked two questions, yeah, your second question was about the buyback. John Hodulik : Right. Mike Sievert : And let me say a couple of things and I will turn it over to Peter. Like, I wouldn\u2019t read too much into how fast we are going and I cannot make any predictions for you as to how that will play out in the future. I could just tell you that generally speaking, we are going fast because we think we are getting a relative great deal on the stock and it\u2019s not normal for management to talk a lot about valuation. But since you have hired us to conduct this buyback on your behalf, we have to make operating decisions with an idea in mind about whether or not we are getting a relative value. And our team thinks and our Board thinks it is and so we have authorized moving quickly, because we look at this rapidly developing cash flow picture and a lot of people are increasingly valuing T-Mobile on our value relative to cash production and we see a lot of potential ahead for a diminishing opportunity for us to be able to grab shares at these share prices and so we are moving really fast. I cannot predict for you, though, what that means going forward, obviously, we are going to take it one step at a time. Peter Osvaldik : Yeah. The only thing I\u2019d add, Mike, is, of course, we -- I am personally very excited about how it\u2019s gone and while we can\u2019t speak about anything more than the $14 billion target, that\u2019s been approved by the Board, remember, what allows all of that is the cash flow generation of this business, as you have mentioned. And frankly, both with regards to the longer term and the underpinning of that opportunity for up to $60 billion in share buybacks through just the end of 2025 and here we are in 2023 already. Remember, this machine and this free cash flow production continues into 2026 and beyond. But the one thing I look at is that is the underpinnings that allows the shareholder return machine to go and you just saw us once again raise what was already ambitious guidance for the year based on our confidence just a quarter in. So in that regard and how the share buybacks are progressing, I am very pleased. Mike Sievert : Okay. We better keep moving. We gave you quite an answer there, John. John Hodulik : Okay. Thanks. Mike Sievert : Operator, next question? You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from Jonathan Chaplin with New Street Research. Please proceed. Mike Sievert : Hey, Jonathan. Jonathan Chaplin : Hey, guys. I am going to ask two questions as well, if that\u2019s okay. The color you just gave us on small markets, some of the progress you are making on market share is super helpful. I am wondering if you can give us exactly the same context for business in terms of where you are in share and any color you can give us around sort of the number of business accounts or business lines you have would be super helpful? And then on the Phone Freedom Plan which looks like it really has the potential to unlock trapped customers, as you suggest. Can you help us understand what the impact of that is on EBITDA expectations for the rest of the year? You have got, on the positive side, obviously, you are pushing people into higher ARPU plans. But then presumably to trigger a higher upgrade rate and so that\u2019s a cost against it and how do those two things net together in the guidance? Mike Sievert : Okay. Sounds great. Well, let\u2019s go first to Callie. I will just say she\u2019s going to give you exactly what you asked for, which is some color on what\u2019s going on, but probably not what was behind what you asked for, which is lots of racking and stacking of market share numbers and things like that. We are moving really fast here and we want to keep it competitive as to some of the details. But maybe tell us what you are seeing in the marketplace? Callie Field : Yeah. Thanks, Mike, and thanks, John, for the question. You know we have a longstanding goal to be the growth leader in business and I am really pleased to see that we are making very nice progress towards doubling our market share. We are growing in customers and in revenue. And we are taking share from AT&T and Verizon. In fact, in Q1, as Mike mentioned in his opening remarks, our business account growth, our phone net adds and our phone churn were all better than Verizon. And while AT&T reported declines in FirstNet quarter-over-quarter, we saw a 2.5 times growth in Connecting Heroes. So we are winning and we are winning across every segment. In Enterprise, we were selected to be the exclusive partner nationwide for AAA to develop roadside connectivity using partners like Dialpad with a collaboration tool and in our phone solutions. Siemens Energy selected T-Mobile their exclusive partner, UPS, Oracle, Dell Resorts. These are all companies that are choosing T-Mobile, because of the quality, the value and the performance of our network. In the government space, I will add, I am actually really proud of the team for the work that we have been doing with Veteran Affairs. The VA just selected T-Mobile as a primary partner for nine years with over 50,000 phone lines, as well as to create health care 5G solutions in the vertical. So we are very excited about that. In SMB, what I can say in SMB is that, we have seen net positive port trends versus Verizon for four quarters straight in a row. So it\u2019s great profitable rates, great CLVs, competing not only like I said, on the best value, but also a superior product and experience. You know businesses buy because they have tested the product and we surpassed the competition. Mike Sievert : It could be a little bit of a canary in the coal mine for us, too, because of that fact, that last fact that you just shared, Callie, that businesses aren\u2019t going so much on brand reputation. They actually check out the phones, like sometimes hundreds of them before making these decisions and compare us head-to-head. And so businesses through their testing now that we now have the best network and we do get questions about, well, how are you going to keep competing if the incumbent guys just keeps slashing their prices to hang on to those customers. And what is missed in that dialogue is that that\u2019s not actually the only factor going into this decision process. Callie Field : Yeah. Mike Sievert : I mean businesses have corporate liable lines for a reason. They want to take responsibility for this connection, because it\u2019s mission-critical and we can save them some money. I mean we are the Un-carrier, but they are picking us because we are the best network. And that\u2019s been a breakthrough that I would say was not the case the same way a couple of years ago. So you are hearing a lot of optimism there. One thing we did here as we listened in, were some in the industry is kind of saying, hey, there\u2019s a sort of a sector decline happening, lots of layoffs, companies aren\u2019t interested in business lines anymore, there\u2019s sort of a pause going on. That is not our experience and you can hear that in the optimism of what Callie is saying. Okay, your second question was about Phone Freedom and what\u2019s going on there. So maybe we will start with Mike and then there was a particular EBITDA outlook question associated with Peter. Mike Katz : Yeah. Like I mentioned before, Phone Freedom kind of had two big components to it. One was the rate plan Go5G, Go5G Plus, which, Jonathan, as you indicated, has this benefit of upgrade built into it. And then the second thing, which I think is also an important input to the second part of the question you asked is, we launched a promotional program called the Easy Unlock. And what the Easy Unlock, the insight it\u2019s really going off of is both what Mike talked about in terms of the dissatisfaction that AT&T customers have, 50% more reports that they want to leave their current carrier than in Verizon and T-Mobile. And when they want to leave, it\u2019s incredibly difficult, both because of long-term contracts, but also because they have the most customer unfriendly unlock process in the entire industry. And what we wanted to do is make switching incredibly easy and that\u2019s what we did with that program. And I think that\u2019s one of the things that will really help us unlock the switcher pool a little bit, which when we know happens, T-Mobile is the disproportionate winner. Peter Osvaldik : Yeah. And with regards, Jonathan, to the EBITDA guidance, I mean, frankly, even at year end, we had already assumed a certain level of opportunity here. Customers were clearly telling us, especially through the back half of last year that they are looking for what this best value, best network combination can provide in the form of Magenta MAX at the time. And so that was an inspiration that we said we were going to pack an even more fully featured plan out there. So I\u2019d say all of the revenue assumptions around this, as well as customer acquisition leading to high CLVs is all packed into core EBITDA, the guide that we provided to you. I know there was also a question on social around -- well, how does that impact the contract asset, and frankly, to say that was -- the contract asset went up sequentially from Q4, but that was really some of the promotions that we had in place and continued into Q1, as well as some of the business promotions. But in the current core EBITDA guidance that we put out there, there\u2019s an assumption actually that the contract asset will decrease to quite an immaterial net impact for the year, and again, in the current guide that we gave. Mike Sievert : Good stuff. Okay. Jonathan Chaplin : Great. Thanks, guys. Mike Sievert : How do we go over to the ones coming in on Twitter. So all get ready, there\u2019s -- you are always popular and your topic is always popular online. Let\u2019s see. I will go to Bill Ho [ph], I want to talk about the network. And this is really about -- he\u2019s giving some stats here, but I think the question is really about, can you tell us about depth and breadth. So we have 275 million people covered by ultra-capacity 5G mid-band and we are going to 300 million. How easy or hard is it in these last 25 million or how easy or hard is it in the last 100 million and that\u2019s kind of interesting if you compare to where the competitors are right now and what\u2019s still ahead of them. But then in that, can you also talk about the depth, how much spectrum is where we are going? Ulf Ewaldsson : Right. I mean if we start with the breadth, we continue to build out and we are now reporting the 275 million as you catch here and we are -- have about 25 million to go. We are very confident that we are going to reach the 300 million by the end of the year. It gets harder and harder. And as a rule of thumb, I would say that, it\u2019s about 3 times harder for every 10 million that you add. So that\u2019s about how hard it gets. And the reason is, of course, the geography of the U.S., where it\u2019s a very vast geography with a very high population density in some communities. So it\u2019s very easy when you start out and it gets harder and harder to do it. But we are very confident that we are going to reach that with the build plan that we have today. When it comes to the depth of the network, it\u2019s just amazing how we continue to just move more and more frequency assets over from LTE to 5G. We today have 150 megahertz dedicated on our mid-band, which is giving us tremendous speeds. We have increased our speed advantage on the downlink speeds compared to competition in this last quarter and we are actually going to end up the year with 200 megahertz of dedicated spectrum just on the mid-band. So it\u2019s just fantastic to see that journey moving forward with our tech team. Mike Sievert : Which means with each passing day, the overall capacity of this network is rapidly expanding. It\u2019s a fascinating thing when you listen to what Ulf says too, about how the easy part is that first 100-and-something million POPs, right, which generally corresponds to where our competitors are. And so we get questions a lot about, hey, you guys jumped out with a couple of year lead in 5G, aren\u2019t they catching you. And hopefully, you can understand when you see where we already are and where we are at the end of the year. Now there\u2019s still years behind us because that last part is really difficult and it\u2019s really important for the overall perception that a customer has about the brand. You have to be great outside the core urbans with a high capacity offering for somebody to believe you have a high capacity offering. And that matters to them even if they don\u2019t leave that space all the time. So it\u2019s really important, and it\u2019s one of the many reasons why we have a durable leap. Okay. Should we go back to the calls? Let\u2019s do it. Operator, next question, please? Operator : Our next question comes from Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. Brett Feldman : Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. Mike Sievert : Hi, Brett. Brett Feldman : Hi, Mike. So you made an interesting observation when you were talking about churn. You pointed out that you had the best year-on-year improvement in churn, but you also noted that you don\u2019t yet have the lowest churn in this category. And that\u2019s interesting because you also noted that you have very large cohorts in your customer base and as a group exhibit a lower churn profile than comparable cohorts at your peers. So it certainly seems like there\u2019s an opportunity to keep driving churn down across the base. So when you look at the pockets of your customers where the churn profile is still elevated, why is that -- how do you think about how much of an opportunity that is and is it actually part of your underlying business plan to continue driving churn lower or do you think you have hit some sort of plateau? Thanks. Mike Katz : Yeah. Thanks, Brett. Listen, I think, we are at a fascinating sort of historical moment in the history of our company. If you think about it, we have spent six years on the chapter of our company comprised of dreaming about and then completing and then integrating the merger that would allow us to leapfrog AT&T and Verizon from being last place in the LTE era to first place in the 5G era. And now we have generally gotten that done, we have the best network in the country, we have the best values and we have generally completed that merger. And so now we have work to do to convince the American public that it\u2019s true. And to me, I am inspired a little bit by the journey of standalone T-Mobile that did achieve the lowest churn rates in the industry, even without the advantages of the network strength. And so now you see us really focused on prime customers. We have the highest prime rate in the history of our company right now. You see us focusing on business customers. You see us focusing on travelers, some of the best customers in the industry now waking up more and more to the fact that T-Mobile is the best choice for them and that\u2019s a journey, convincing the country that what\u2019s true is true, will take some time. But let me tell you this, our goal -- the answer to your question is, yes, our goal is to have the lowest churn in the industry on postpaid phones. And we already have it on prepaid, we are going to have it on postpaid phones. Of course, we should. I mean we have the best network and the best prices. That means we should have the lowest churn. And so we have been through this worst to first journey before we standalone T-Mobile. We are kind of midway through it with the new version of the company and full of optimism about where it can finally land. Those big sort of quarter-by-quarter kind of merger-driven lurches forward are mostly behind us, right, because the integration is behind us. So now it\u2019s that hard slog just like we showed you we could do when we were standalone T-Mobile. Brett Feldman : Okay. Thank you. Mike Sievert : Okay. You bet. Great. Next question, please? Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Rollins with Citigroup. Please proceed. Mike Sievert : Hey, Michael. Michael Rollins : Thanks and good afternoon. Hi. Two questions. First, going back to the customer unlock opportunities, where is the industry and T-Mobile on eSIM capabilities and is this a topic that\u2019s important to helping you propel unlocks and switching opportunities? And then just secondly, do you have visibility on whether or not DISH will exercise its option to buy your 800 megahertz spectrum, and if they don\u2019t, what is the next steps for T-Mobile with respect to that spectrum band? Mike Sievert : Great. I will start with the DISH one and then give Mike a chance to think up and answer on the eSIM one. The -- no, we don\u2019t have visibility into it yet. DISH asked for an extension in the decision. We didn\u2019t object to that of about 60 days. And the way our consent decree works is it\u2019s entirely up to them. We are here to support them and so we will wait to hear what they decide. I am in touch with Charlie. So as I learn more, we may engage and be able to be helpful in that. But it\u2019s -- the way it works is it\u2019s entirely up to them and so if they want the spectrum under the terms of the consent decree, it\u2019s theirs. And if not, the way it works is that it would go to auction and it would maybe be in the hands of someone else. And so we will wait and see how it all unfolds and we are here to support whatever decision that they make. On eSIM, this is fascinating how this has all happened across the industry and there hasn\u2019t been that much discussion about it. One of the limiters has been this phone locking phenomenon that we are talking about with Phone Freedom. Because what happens with an eSIM is on a locked phone, even though that second SIM is available, if the phone is locked, you still can\u2019t use that second SIM very easily and so there\u2019s been some barriers to the friction coming out of the system, the way eSIM may be promised. But we are big fans of it. You saw us a few months ago, introduced great switching capabilities for you to actually try our network on the second SIM if your phone allows that. That\u2019s been a lot of fun for people to be able to test drive our network. But, Mike, maybe you can give some color on what we are seeing. Mike Katz : Yeah. I was going to say something really similar. We are big fans of eSIM, really for two big reasons. One, we think it\u2019s a much better customer experience. You don\u2019t have to deal with plastic and switching in and out of your phones every couple of years when people are upgrading. And for a company that wins when switching happens, eSIM does make switching easier and we have tried to take advantage of that with the technology that Mike mentioned earlier, where we launched an app where you can easily test the T-Mobile network side-by-side with your incumbent network on the same phone and when you are ready to switch, you can just do it in a couple of clicks. So we are fans of eSIM. We are really supportive of it, and we are optimistic that it will help accelerate even programs that we talked about today with that Phone Freedom. Mike Sievert : Okay. How about\u2026 Michael Rollins : Just real quick\u2026 Mike Sievert : \u2026 twitter, Roger Adler [ph] want to talk about T-Mobile for Business. I think we hit most of that, unless you want to provide any color on what we are seeing with HSI in T-Mobile for Business. And then a separate question about, with our new Go5G plans, they are raised prices, do we think that will impact our subscriber growth. And I am glad you asked that, because, no. And in fact, the way we kind of did this is we added these plans and that won\u2019t be immediately obvious to everybody, but we added them. So if you present at retailer online, you can still get Magenta and Magenta MAX. But these new plans in the early days, now that we have put them out there, they are really turning out to be very popular and so I am not worried -- even notwithstanding the fact that they are being added, I am not worried at all. These are going to be really popular plans, because we design them right to the needs that we are hearing customers want in the marketplace. And this is really an interesting thing, because we called it Go5G for a reason. Our 5G customers are using massive amounts of data on our network. And people say, what\u2019s the killer app of 5G. There are a lot of killer apps of 5G, but one of them is usage on your smartphone, which if you have T-Mobile and Magenta MAX or now Go5G Plus, you have massive connectivity and customers are soaking it up and that\u2019s a real differentiator for us. And so we want to play into that advantage and encourage that kind of usage, because once they see what their phone can do, they are not going to want to live without it. We are already seeing that now at scale with millions of customers at Magenta MAX or above. Okay. So let\u2019s go back to the phone, Jud. Jud Henry : Let\u2019s do it. Mike Sievert : Operator, next question, please? Operator : Our next question comes from Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson. Please proceed. Craig Moffett : Yeah. Hi. Two questions, if I could. One is I want to stay with the DISH theme for a minute. It\u2019s becoming more and more openly discussed that DISH may eventually be a liquidation story. If that were to happen and if the FCC were willing, how much appetite do you have for more spectrum? And it sort of leads into my second question, which is just with respect to 5G, the new applications have been somewhat slower to develop than might have been expected. I wonder if you could just update us on 5G usage growth and how quickly the consumption of network resources is proceeding with 5G and if that is the differentiator you had hoped and expected it to be given your spectrum and network advantage? Mike Sievert : Yeah. Look, on the first one and I will turn to Mike for the second one. On the first one, Craig, I am not going to answer it, because my friend, John think he kind of did answer it and I think he was very unfairly misquoted. He gave an innocent answer to a hypothetical kind of along the lines of any time there\u2019s spectrum, of course, we are interested and there are all kinds of headlines whether he wants to buy a DISH of the spectrum. Listen, first of all, I will say, I think, it\u2019s a little premature question too. I don\u2019t count DISH or Charlie out very easily. I have known him for a long time. So I think it\u2019s a premature question. But then finally, it raises a larger issue. And if you reframe it this way, which is, does this wireless industry have enough spectrum over the long haul for American competitiveness. I\u2019d say never, always there\u2019s an opportunity for more and that speaks to public policy. The FCC lost its auction authority this year and T-Mobile and others have been urging Congress to restore that, because we need our strong regulatory body to be able to work with other agencies, create an ongoing long-term pipeline of spectrum for all the players in this industry so that we can continue to have connectivity in this country that\u2019s the best in the world. And I know the FCC feels that way. I presume my competitors feel that way. But I think it\u2019s very important that we get back on track with this and that actions that are completed get put to use for the American consumer, because there\u2019s work that\u2019s pending there and that the FCC regains its authority quickly to be able to lead in this space going forward, the way they have done so well in the past. And I think that\u2019s very important for our company, for our competitors, but also for American competitiveness. Your second question is about apps in 5G. 5G -- it was sort of -- it kind of came out and I will say our competitor\u2019s kind of led the way on this with a lot of hype and euphoria around 20 gigabit connectivity in millimeter wave and it\u2019s going to change the world and we are all going to be kind of human cyborgs and stuff like that. And we kind of never felt that way. I mean early on, we went right to 5G is a much better, like 10 times better at least 4G and that the killer apps are going to be smartphones at first and they are going to be our ability to get after home broadband. And we focused on the mid-band asset and eventually the rest of the industry followed. We were right. And the average T-Mobile customer is getting 10 times the connectivity that they got in 2018, 10 times faster. That\u2019s amazing. And so what they are doing with it is amazing and so that obviously is unfolding. But there\u2019s still the kind of side eye questions people get, which is where is all this augmented reality you said would come? And I\u2019d say, well, first of all, our job is to create a great network and we have the best in the country. And as hardware and software developers look to a network to create innovations around, I think, they will choose T-Mobile. Whether they are moving faster or slower than predicted, doesn\u2019t directly affect our business that much. We need to be the network that they choose as they get inspired with massive connectivity, not just in fits and starts and parts of the country, but all across this country the way T-Mobile can uniquely provide and that\u2019s why we work with developers the way we do. But the rate and pace they go, that\u2019s up to them. Anything to add? Mike Katz : The only other thing I\u2019d add is that, let\u2019s not forget about HIS, because HSI, I do think is still one of the big killer apps for 5G that you are seeing play out right now. 3.2 million customers running their home Internet in their house over our 5G wireless network and using hundreds of gigs a month on average, both in the big top 100 markets. But also importantly, many customers in rural areas, some of which this is the first high-speed option that existed and it only happened because of 5G. So I don\u2019t think we can forget about HSI being one of those big killer 5G applications. Mike Sievert : Terrific. That\u2019s right. Craig Moffett : That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Jud Henry : All right. Operator, we have got time for one more question. Mike Sievert : Oh! It\u2019s the last one already. We are just getting warmed up. Operator : All right. Great. Our next question comes from David Barden with Bank of America. Please proceed. David Barden : Thanks so much guys. Yeah. Hey, Mike. Thanks for taking the question. I am glad you are warm. The -- I guess the first question would be with the stock. The performance of the business has been great and the stock kind of just keeps bumping up against this 150 level. And I want to come back to this notion of the SoftBank top-up shares 48.8 million. Has there been any evolution in your thinking or conversations between yourselves and DT and SoftBank about using the remaining buyback authorization to simply clean that whole exercise up? It seems like it would be the most elegant and non-disruptive way to do it, and I\u2019d love your comments on that? And then the second question is and I kind of know what your answer is, but I just kind of want to hear how you frame it, which is that you originally for most of the states, not every state, pledge that you would not raise prices in T-Mobile for three years and that expired in April 1, 2023, and then you came out with your new Un-carrier plan. But it\u2019s within your toolkit now to be able to raise prices if inflation or other things happened, could you kind of give us a sense as to how you think about that relative to kind of T-Mobile\u2019s brand positioning in the market? Thanks. Mike Sievert : Yeah. Sure. We maintain and have for the entire decade long journey of the Un-carrier an envelope of superior pricing versus our benchmark competitors and we intend for that to continue. Now as things shift and move, we maintain that envelope and it\u2019s not a matter of sort of a static price or being dogmatic about price has always got to be static, but we always want to be a relative value. And we can do that sustainably because we have a great balance sheet, we have the right capital structure, we have the right spectrum structure and other advantages that allow us to continue to profitably have a pricing envelope superiority versus our benchmark competitors. But as things move in the market with inflation or otherwise, of course, there\u2019s an opportunity for us to move along with those things. But we have the customers are North Star and our brand value proposition to take care of. That\u2019s why you have seen us so focused on offering higher value offers that customers self-select up to and it really shows their love for our brand that when we put something out there like Magenta MAX or now Go5G Plus, they flock to it. They -- our customers are buying up our rate card voluntarily in an era of inflation, because they appreciate the value of what we are putting in front of them. That speaks a lot about the brand and about the covenant between us and our customers on this brand. Okay, your first question was about the SoftBank true-up shares. And just to kind of remind everybody, there is this 48 million some shares that would trigger upon $150 stock price being at an average 45-day VWAP. And the short answer to your question is, of course, I mean, of course, we talk to them. They are a close partner of ours. We talk to DT all the time. We are aware of this question and this issue. But we have nothing to report. And so -- but I mean it\u2019s of interest, and it\u2019s not lost on us why you are asking the question. If there ever was to be a transaction, it has to be something that would work for everyone. I will say this, and the earlier question about our buyback pace, we have already bought back more shares than this potential dilution event and we intend to buy back a lot more shares going forward, should our capital program continue to support that as we have outlook it would. And so this is actually a fairly small potential event in the grand scheme of the shareholder remuneration that our cash flow production supports. And so anyway, with that, anything to add to that? Peter Osvaldik : No. Great. Mike Sievert : Perfectly said. Anything to add to the whole show? Peter Osvaldik : The show must go on. Mike Sievert : All right. Well, we appreciate you guys. Thanks for tuning in and for asking all these questions. I am so proud of our team. It\u2019s a fascinating year. It was fascinating for us to watch how it all started and the different perceptions people have. But one thing I hope that you take away from us is that, we are a team maniacally focused on delivering for you what we promised you we would do and that\u2019s what we show up and try to do every single time and I am so proud that this was one more quarter where we were able to put down great results and outlook for you in 2023 that we are going to be proud of. So thanks for tuning everybody. See you later. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the T-Mobile first quarter earnings call. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a pleasant day everyone.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : [Starts Abruptly] [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jud Henry, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations for T-Mobile US. Please go ahead, sir. Jud Henry : Welcome to T-Mobile's second quarter 2023 earnings call. Joining me on the call today are Mike Sievert, our President and CEO; Peter Osvaldik, our CFO; as well as other members of the senior leadership team. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. We provide a comprehensive list of risk factors in our SEC filings, which I encourage you to review. Our earnings release, investor back book and other documents related to our results, as well as reconciliations between GAAP and the non-GAAP results discussed on this call can be found in the Quarterly Results section of the Investor Relations website. With that, let me turn it over to Mike. Mike Sievert : Okay. Thanks, Jud. Hi, everybody. Welcome to the call. As you can see, we're here with several members of our senior management team. We're coming to you live from Bellevue, Washington and we're ready to take your questions. But first, let me share just a few comments. If you'll recall at our Analyst Day in early 2021, we shared our strategy to build the best network, couple it with a leading un-carrier value proposition and customer experience and grow our share in areas where T-Mobile was massively underpenetrated relative to our peers. That strategy and our approach has remained remarkably consistent and our Q2 results continue to show that it's working better than ever. In fact, T-Mobile delivered our highest Q2 postpaid phone net adds in eight years, fueled by both industry leading gross adds and the lowest postpaid phone churn in company history. And importantly, we did this while industry growth normalized, proving that the growth opportunities and durable advantages we've been sharing with you really are unique to T-Mobile. We also told you that if we delivered the best product and the best value and the best experiences, there was no reason we couldn't get to the lowest churn in the industry, remember that. And in Q2, we did it. For the first time in our history, T-Mobile reported the lowest postpaid phone churn in the industry. That is a remarkable statement and it's a testament to the work our team has done to build the best network. And to further our value proposition to deliver even better experiences to customers. Now I'm sure there's still going to be some back and forth between us and the other guys before we consistently put them in the rearview mirror for good on churn, but all the same, it is great to get this first win. We also continue to run the business in a smart and sustainable manner, translating our industry leading customer growth in Q2 into industry leading service revenue growth and core adjusted EBITDA growth, while growing free cash flow by more than 60% year-over-year. This industry leading customer and financial growth led us to raise guidance for the year again. And we're fortunate to deliver these industry leading results within the context of a vibrant wireless industry, with growing industry service revenues and industry cash flows and healthy competition that continues to deliver more value and better networks to customers. In fact, on network, we not only defended, but extended our leadership in both overall and 5G performance. With the latest third-party reports showing that T-Mobile's lead is widening. Looking at Ookla data. T-Mobile once again swept every category for overall network performance with median download speeds, more than double our closest competitor. We've long talked about how our dedicated 5G spectrum assets with superior propagation would result in a demonstrable advantage in customers' everyday lived experiences even as the competitors try to catch us. T-Mobile's head start, our dedicated 5G spectrum assets and our technology leadership are the things that allow us to stay meaningfully ahead as in like two years or more ahead in 5G reach and overall network performance and to stay ahead for years to come. And the most exciting part is that many prospective customers are only just beginning to notice, which means lots of the benefit from this is in front of us. And importantly, these things also allow it to do it all with the best capital efficiency in the industry. Now we also continue to build on our fame for providing the best value. Our latest un-carrier move Phone Freedom, freeze customers locked up into those 3-year contracts at the carriers. And our new go 5G plus rate plan delivers the best value in wireless. The response from customers has been really amazing. In fact, Go5G Plus instantly became our most popular plan, and we're seeing improved porting ratios against every competitor including yet another quarter of year-over-year improvement against cable. In fact, total postpaid porting ratios for us have improved every month since we launched Phone Freedom including in July. As more and more customers learn that they can break free from those three-year contracts come to a better network and get a better value at T-Mobile. All of these catalysts, coupled with our unique growth opportunities in underpenetrated markets are what enable a differentiated and profitable growth strategy that separates us from the competition and you're seeing it again in these Q2 results. We added 299,000 postpaid account net adds, the highest reported in the industry showing that we continue to win the switching decisions in the market. And we had postpaid net additions of 1.6 million again leading the industry by a wide margin. This included postpaid phone net adds of 760,000, our highest Q2 in eight years, even as the industry sees more normalized levels of growth. Our increased share was driven by our industry best phone gross adds, which grew over last year's Q2 as well as the lowest postpaid phone churn in our history. And as I mentioned, the lowest in the industry for the first time ever at just 0.77%. In T-Mobile for Business, we had a record quarter with best ever phone net adds and our lowest ever phone churn. Enterprise and government customers buy based on their own rigorous testing of the networks, not just price, and our network leadership, innovative solutions and customer experiences are driving major wins and fueling our momentum in these segments. We're attracting profitable customers with CLVs in the hundreds of dollars each and still growing. As I mentioned, consumers are beginning to take notice of our network strides as well, as we're winning prime network seekers in the top 100 markets who increasingly recognize that T-Mobile offers the best combination of network coverage and capacity to meet their needs. We saw our share of switchers in the top 100 markets increase both sequentially and year-over-year. In smaller markets and rural areas, where we continue to bring the first and in many places, only 5G network, we're seeing an incredible response. We're capturing a win share of switchers in these areas in the upper 30s, which shows we're not only on track to meet our goal of 20% share in 2025, but it gives us confidence we have room to run in the years beyond. In addition to mobile wireless, we added 509,000 high speed Internet customers. Notably, we've continued to grow our gross adds every quarter since we launched over two years ago as demand for the product just continues to grow. And we saw a sequential improvement in churn again this quarter and Net Promoter Scores that remain multiples higher than cable, demonstrating how our high speed Internet resonates with and satisfies an important target audience within this larger broadband market. We also celebrated another major milestone in our Sprint merger integration as we are now substantially complete with both the billing migration and retail rationalization, well ahead of our year-end target. At every step of our integration journey, the customer has been our primary focus. As you know, this has allowed us to not only unlock synergies bigger and faster than expected, but also to deliver industry leading growth and record low churn at the same time. I could not be more proud of what our team has accomplished in this area. Okay. I'm going to wrap it up. We are pulling into the station halfway 2023 with great momentum. Our postpaid phone net adds year-to-date are right on track with last year, which was a growth record year for us. We continue to extend our durable network and value leadership over the competition, which fuels our growth opportunities. And our profitable growth strategy continues to translate into the highest core adjusted EBITDA growth and year-to-date cash flow conversion in the industry. Listen, in our industry, change is a constant, but our team navigates it definitely with the customer as our North Star. And because of that, there has never been a more exciting time to be at T-Mobile. Okay. Peter, over to you to talk about our key financial highlights and an update on our guidance for 2023. Peter Osvaldik : Absolutely. Thanks, Mike. Q2 was another quarter of best-in-class profitable growth, which underpins the updated guidance that I'll share with you in a moment. It starts with the best postpaid service revenue growth in the industry, up over 5% year-over-year driven by continued increases in both postpaid accounts and postpaid ARPA. Our disciplined focus on profitability resulted in an 11% year-over-year increase in core adjusted EBITDA and we grew our core adjusted EBITDA margin by over 300 basis points year-over-year. In addition, free cash flow was up 64% year-over-year and with the highest free cash flow to service revenue margin relative to our peers year-to-date. We expect this to be a durable and differentiated unlock of shareholder value going forward. This strong financial performance also supported our share buybacks as we repurchased 25.2 million shares for $3.5 billion in Q2 with a cumulative total of 83.5 million shares repurchased for $11.8 billion as of July 21. All right. Let's jump into the details of our increased guidance for 2023. We now expect total postpaid net customer additions to be between 5.6 million and 5.9 million, up 250,000 at the midpoint, reflecting growth across all of our market opportunities and we continue to expect roughly half of postpaid net adds coming from phones for the full year. Our focus on profitable growth allows us to fund those higher customer net adds and still increase our core adjusted EBITDA expectation, which we now expect to be between $28.9 billion and $29.2 billion. This is up 10% year-over-year at the midpoint based on higher service revenues and merger synergies and excludes leasing revenues of approximately $300 million as we transition substantially all remaining customers off device leasing by year-end. Our merger synergies are expected to be approximately $7.5 billion in 2023, achieving the full run rate synergy target provided at our Analyst Day a year ahead of schedule as we build towards the full run rate synergies of $8 billion in 2024. We continue to expect merger related costs, which are not included in adjusted or core adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $1 billion before taxes. And we now expect cash merger related costs of $1.6 billion to $2 billion for 2023 as they have underrun the P&L recognition to date. Net cash provided by operating activities, which include payments for merger related costs is now expected to be in the range of $18 billion to $18.3 billion and we now expect cash CapEx to be between $9.5 billion and $9.7 billion delivering a capital efficiency unmatched in our industry, unlocked by our network leadership. We expect CapEx to taper in Q3 and then further in Q4. The slightly higher operating cash flows fund the increased CapEx resulting in strong free cash flow of $13.2 billion to $13.6 billion, which includes payments for merger-related costs. This is up approximately 75% over last year, thanks to our margin expansion and capital efficiency and does not assume any material net cash inflows from securitization. This also represents a free cash flow to service revenue margin, which is multiple percentage points higher than peers with further expansion expected next year. We continue to expect our full year effective tax rate to be between 24% and 26%. And finally, we now expect full year postpaid ARPA to increase slightly more than the 1% we had previously guided for 2023 as we continue to expand our account relationships across products and services as part of our land and expand account strategy to grow service revenue. Before I wrap up, I want to remind folks that we closed the sale of our wireline assets to Cogent on May 1, which had a partial impact on our results in Q2 and we expect the full run rate impact beginning in Q3 as I laid out last quarter. In closing, we continue to extend our network leadership and further scale our differentiated profitable growth opportunities to deliver the highest free cash flow conversion in the industry and unlock shareholder value. And with that, I will now turn the call back to Jud to begin the Q&A. Jud? A - Jud Henry : All right. Let's get to your questions. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll start with a question on the phone. Operator, first question, please. Operator : Certainly, thank you. That will come from the line of Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Jud Henry : Hi, Brett. Brett Feldman : Thanks for taking the question. And it was great to see -- great to see the strong cash flow in the quarter. In light of that, we've gotten a few questions around why you decided to downtick a little bit on the buyback. And I guess maybe the higher level question we're getting now that you're much further into the program. How do you think about managing that program going forward? I mean cash flow is obviously an input. You're going to be making some payments for C-band spectrum this year. So what's the right way for investors to kind of frame your expectations around how you're going to manage that on a go-forward basis? Thank you. Mike Sievert : That sounds great. Thanks, Brett. I'll start and then maybe hand it to Peter for some comments. The way I think about it is, we're buying at a pace through -- mostly through predesigned 10b5-1 programs in order to be able to meet the authorization during the time frame of the authorization. So if you recall, the initial authorization of this program is a $14 billion program that takes us through September. And if you look at some of our activity early in the year where we were able to grab some additional run rate. Now the remaining funds relative to the remaining time suggests a run rate where we have it. So it's not really a downtick so much as just kind of a programmatic view. And then -- and maybe Peter can pile in on the second part. The way we think about it broadly is that there's essentially been no underlying change to the thesis we've been communicating all along. Now our Board hasn't made a determination yet about the second step, but the inputs to those steps have to do with the free cash flow development of this company, which, as you mentioned in the premise of your question is right on track. We're guiding to 75% year-over-year cash flow growth this year. And the underpinnings of the growth in the business, as you saw from our fantastic Q2 momentum suggests another good year in '24. And so -- as the cash flow develops, that's what gives us the confidence that, that original thesis of around $60 billion through 2025 is intact. But maybe you can also comment, Peter, on kind of how we think about this from a dedication of resources to this versus spectrum and other things as Brett asked. Peter Osvaldik : Yeah. Absolutely, Brett. One of the things that we had underpinned at Analyst Day is that it's up to $65 billion of free cash flow that's going to support the $60 billion of potential shareholder remuneration. And within that, we had some room and had reserved some capacity for spectrum purchases and other things. And of course, we'll fundamentally continue throughout this whole period, one to deliver because the underlying delivery of the free cash flow is what allows everything to happen. And, of course, always look at opportunities before us for the highest value creation opportunity. With your question on C-band, that was already included in our assumption here. So when we continue to say, we have optimism around the program in totality, C-band is fully contemplated within that. Brett Feldman : That's great color. If I can ask a quick follow-up question as we're talking about overall liquidity. Any update on the spectrum option that DISH hold and if that were to get exercised, how do you think about putting that proceeds to work? Thanks. Mike Sievert : Sure. Well, the first thing I would point out is that any proceeds from that have not been contemplated in the long-range cash planning. So if there's cash that comes from that soon, that be incremental to the planning expectations. We're still awaiting DISH's decision. So just as an update, and I think our filings made some of this clear. The deadline has come and gone for them to determine whether or not they would exercise their privilege to buy that spectrum for $3.6 billion. But they asked for some additional time of the DOJ and we did not object to that. And so we have committed that we would not terminate their agreement and right to do that at any time before August 11. But in fact, we\u2019re in discussions with DISH about whether or not there might be a win-win that\u2019s different from their initial privilege. And if there is that would be wonderful. But obviously, that deadline is coming. So \u2013 but our view was it was worth taking the extra time, especially since they asked for it in case there\u2019s a bigger win-win to be had here. Brett Feldman : Thank you. Appreciate it. Jud Henry : Operator, next question, please. Operator : Thank you. That will come from the line of Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson. Your line is open. Craig Moffett : Hi. Thank you. Two questions. One, as long as we're on the topic of DISH. Outside of the 800, if the opportunity came up, would you have an appetite for more mid-band spectrum, either from DISH or perhaps any other source. And what we're talking about sort of meaningful size chunks here. And then second, if you could just talk about the pacing and trajectory of fixed wireless, as you now with a little more experience under your belt, as you look out towards your long-term guidance, how do you think about the pacing to get to 8 million or so households? Mike Sievert : Sounds great. Well, I'll tackle the first one and then maybe hand to Mike Katz for the second one. And I don't mean to be flip, Craig, but I think you've been following us for so long. You know we've never met spectrum, we didn't like. And so of course. And -- but one thing that distinguishes us from other providers is that when we get our hands on spectrum, we put it to work right away for the benefit of the American consumer. And so -- that's not only in the public interest, but that's in the interest of T-Mobile and our customers. And so you see that in how we're deploying so ambitiously the 2.5 gigahertz that are the proceeds of the merger, having built the best 5G network in history on that spectrum acquisition that came through the merger. So look, I mean, we're always on the hunt for other ways to add capacity to our network because it allows us to do amazing things like not only continue to take share and grow and meet ever rising needs of customers on their smartphones, but also to get after the subject of your second question, which is fixed wireless access. And -- to the first part of your second question, nothing has changed in our aspiration. We're still on the hunt for that single-digit penetration. And maybe Mike could comment about what we're seeing in the marketplace and the rate and pace of our growth versus our expectations. Michael Katz : Yeah. Thanks, Mike. Thanks, Craig, for the question. We couldn't be happier with what's going on with this HSI business. You probably saw from all of our results, we just crossed over 3.7 million customers in this business. And this pacing that we're on, which we told you last quarter and the quarter before, right around where we were in Q2, right around 500,000 customers. We -- it gives us confidence that the 7 million to 8 million total customers that we committed to at the end of this planning period that we've got high confidence that we're going to get there. One of the things that Mike mentioned in his comments that I think is worth reiterating is, we saw in Q2 again, our highest gross adds. And our gross adds have increased every single quarter since we launched this product. And then again, in Q2, we saw sequential decreases in churn. And I think that really speaks to the fact that this is a great product. It's a great product that customers are really, really loving. And you see that both in this sequential churn decrease, but also just in the overall NPS scores, which continue to be the highest amongst any broadband category in America. So we're really thrilled with where we are with this product. Mike Sievert : Back to my comments, upfront, I said things have been remarkably consistent with what we rolled out to you at our Analyst Day in '21. This is one of those things. We said we saw a potential here of 7 million to 8 million subscribers based on the excess capacity profile of our built mobile network. That means it\u2019s not capital burdened. And because of that, we can make profit there. And so it plays a role. It\u2019s a single-digit penetration role, and we\u2019re on our way to going and seizing it for the benefit of our shareholders and our customers and it\u2019s right on track. Craig Moffett : Thanks. Jud Henry : Thanks, Craig. Operator, next question please. Operator : That will come from the line of Jonathan Chaplin with New Street Research. Your line is open. Jonathan Chaplin : Thanks very much. Wonder if you can give us context on a couple of things? So firstly, how are you thinking about the evolution of upgrades in the second half of the year as we go through a new iPhone cycle? And kind of what have you factored into your guidance on EBITDA for that. It looks like upgrades to the industry have been coming in sort of lower than expected, much lower than historical trends. I'm wondering how that shifts in the second half of the year. And then, wondering if you can give us a little bit more context on fixed virus broadband churn. You mentioned that it's come down sequentially, which isn't surprising in that it's always lower in the broadband market in the second quarter. But what does it look like on a year-over-year basis? Maybe you can give us some context around the kind of levels that it's at for the mature portion of the base that's been with you maybe for a year or more. Mike Sievert : Yeah, Jonathan. You're spot on in the premise of the question that looking at the aging of the base is the way to get at it. We'll come to Mike on that in a minute. But first, on upgrades, historically low upgrades, Peter, what's contemplated for the rest of the year and maybe a little commentary on why do we think we're seeing that. Peter Osvaldik : Yeah. Well, let me start with why do we think we're seeing that. And fundamentally, we believe we're meeting customers' needs and desires. And if you look at what we've talked about from a network perspective and a value perspective, it makes a lot of sense. You come onto this network and you have a 5G device. Remember about two-thirds of our postpaid base already has a 5G device. And they get experience on this network that is just phenomenal in the broadest sense of the word, much more than the competitive sense can bring. And we think we're just meeting their natural demand. Customers are happy with their devices. They're happy with their devices from a longer perspective, Remember, we continue to have two-year financing constructs, so they have the ability to upgrade earlier than the competition, one of the unlocks of Phone Freedom that we put out there that led to the port ratio changes. So fundamentally, we think we're exactly meeting what customers need. In regards to the second half, the second half always tends to have slightly higher upgrade rates. And you mentioned that you have new product introduction from Apple. You tend to have promotional constructs and a little bit higher switching in the second half, and we're typically the beneficiary of that. We also obviously make very, very solid offers to our base from an upgrade perspective. So we do have higher upgrade rates contemplated than what we saw in Q2, but we don't specifically guide to those other than directionally. Mike Sievert : Okay. And Mike, over to you on a little bit more color on high-speed Internet churn. Michael Katz : Yeah. I mean I think building on what you're saying, Mike, what -- we have the youngest base of broadband customers in America. And like I think we said in a couple of calls, the churn curves that we see for customers like in our mobile business tends to be higher in the earlier tenure months and then reduces as customers achieve greater tenure lengths with us. And we're seeing the exact same thing in our broadband business. And customers that have been with us for some months, their churn has decreased to the point that was right where we expected it. So it's looking right on where our plan was, and the behavior has been just right in line with what we expected. Mike Sievert : Okay. Terrific. And maybe, Jud, tell us when it\u2019s time to go to Twitter. So we\u2019re not ignoring the people coming in on Twitter because we always do some of that as well. And \u2013 but while you\u2019re thinking about it, we\u2019ll go operator to one more online. Operator : That will come from the line of John Hodulik with UBS. Your line is open. John Hodulik : Great. Thanks, guys. Two questions, if I could. First, on margins. Obviously, a lot of progress there at 300 basis points, but you guys still trail AT&T and Verizon by about 500 basis points. And do you see that closing over time or is it really just a bunch sort of lower ARPU and in fact or sub growth? That's number one. And number two, Mike, I think you said that your porting versus cable has improved. And I don't think you've called that out before. But maybe just some commentary about what you're seeing in terms of competition in wireless and cable. I mean, they're talking about sort of more and more bundled offerings. And I guess Comcast was sort of flattish on a year-over-year basis, but just what the posture is there and what's driving that improvement in porting from cable? Thanks. Mike Sievert : Okay. I'll take that one, but Peter, we'll start with you. Peter Osvaldik : Yeah. Certainly, on the margin question, it's a lot more than an ARPU differential. It's really some structural differences that we always call out. For example, the whole leased versus own the backhaul strategy. The other thing that'll always note is that with this significant higher switching that we see and the net add production that we're giving, obviously, we have more S in SG&A than the competition does. We have a very dense network built out. So there's fundamental some structural differences that also mean there's a CapEx OpEx differential and when you compare AT&T and Verizon and us. And that's why it's always important to fundamentally look at conversion of service revenue into free cash flow. Free cash flow is the value generation engine that allows you to further invest, return capital to shareholders or do all sorts of other things to create value. And that is the measure by which we're really comparing ourselves to the competition to get rid of all the structural noise. And on that regard, you heard what we announced today already there from a year-to-date basis in terms of beating them on the conversion ratio when next year anticipated to expand that ratio further. So that's how I think about margins. Mike Sievert : It's interesting that when you listen to Peter that and you hear that even with our superior growth and our lower prices, both of which hit margins, we have the superior cash production per service revenue dollar in the industry year-to-date and that's rapidly expanding. 75% year-over-year guide, this year, you're on our way to higher cash flows next year. And so it really shows you the power of this model based on this team's ability to execute, but also based on the balance sheet, the incredible assets that we control, the track record of execution, the head start and many other benefits. Okay. Great. The second one was -- second one was cable. So John, let me come back to that. Yeah. We did make a very light comment on it, but it was light that we had been seeing improvements in our port ratios with cable last quarter because we wanted to provide some commentary because cable and Q4 started to see some pretty big net add trajectory changes. And so we kind of double clicked into that. Because you kind of have to do that as a competitor to figure out, is this going to come from us or what's going on. And it's kind of interesting, you fast forward to this quarter. And I'll remind you that even in a world where cable is now a pretty big share taker in overall postpaid, T-Mobile produced the highest postpaid phone net additions for Q2 in eight years and not only the lowest churn ever in our history, but the lowest in the industry. And that kind of answers a question as to whether or not this dynamic from cable is coming from our side, right? I mean we're performing better than before they were in the industry. But obviously, there's a dynamic that affects others, both of our two look-a-like competitors, plus prepaid. There's a lot of brands that have been affected by this, and they're viable competitors to be taken seriously. But it's just, as you can see in our performance, not affecting our results. Okay. John, do we -- what do we have coming in online? Jud Henry : We've got a question from Roger Entner on how strong was the business growth this quarter. Maybe we can and tee that one up. And then we've got a follow-on question around enterprise sector as well so we can hit those. Mike Sievert : Okay. Great. So Roger Entner asked how strong was business growth this quarter. Can you talk about the VA? And any additional color on overall business growth. We also have Chetan Sharma (ph) coming in. Congrats on another great quarter. Thank you. I was wondering if you could provide some color on traction you're seeing in the enterprise sector beyond connectivity. What about vertical industries, people using 5G, 5G advanced services, et cetera. So maybe, Callie, why don't you start on both of those and anybody else can jump in. Callie Field : Okay. Thanks, Mike. And thanks, Roger, and Chetan for the questions. As Mike mentioned earlier, we delivered on our highest phone net adds and lowest phone churn ever, handily being Verizon again. And we're seeing profitable growth in all three segments. In SMB, we achieved positive port trends against AT&T and this makes five consecutive quarters against Verizon and we grew ARPU quarter-over-quarter again. As Mike mentioned in his opening remarks, in enterprise and in government, our business is good business with very profitable CLVs, but roughly 60% to 70% relative to consumer and they're rising year-over-year, quarter-over-quarter. And Q2 for enterprise, for instance, we welcomed both the largest global asset management firm and yet another leading global bank as new accounts. We also added two huge government contracts with the EPA and the IRS and continue to double our net adds quarter-over-quarter with first responders, most significantly in rural areas where an older LTE network just doesn't cut it for critical response. So a lot of really good growth this quarter from an incredible team in the business group. And then for the VA question, if I could just take that one for a second. I wanted to say, as you may remember, we took Verizon share back in 2018. And now because of our network, we've taken the pole position and have added roughly 20,000 phones year-to-date supporting more than 50% of the VA phones today. And I'll note to our contract also includes T-Mobile's 5G Internet for the VAs community-based outpatient clinics. So we're able to provide health care for veterans in rural areas because of the network that we have built. So just wanted to add some clarity on the VA subject. And then one last thing on use cases for 5G applications outside of pure connectivity. I'll start Chetan with some of the verticals where we're seeing the most traction. And that would be in retail, where we many use cases for fixed 5G solutions where people are looking to look at better costs and less truck rolls and support or perhaps older wireline services and are replacing that with T-Mobile's 5G in multiunit national retailers. And then in health care, this is another area where we're seeing CTOs and CIOs from large hospitals come to us and say, look, we need ubiquitous connectivity, both indoor and outdoor. We need more of a programmable network. We need certain places in our buildings where we want to designate private networks. And because of our public 5G network and the solutions that we can offer with our stand-alone core, we're able to offer a hybrid solution that's really working in a place like a hospital that has lots of different variations to the types of connectivity they need. And then lastly, I'll say we're seeing some traction in education. Large campuses that want to provide connectivity for their students, but also ways to use their data differently and to get in all of the dorms and places in the campus and rooms and libraries and perhaps older buildings, where there's really a need for ubiquitous coverage throughout the campus. So for the 3 hours that really pop out to me. The last one I would say is in the federal use cases with the Department of Defense were not a surprise to anyone, lots of areas for us to begin to deploy hybrid networks and private networks for use cases specific to the military. Mike Sievert : Well, hopefully, that answers it and more. I mean if you listen to Callie, it just reinforces what I said in my upfront remarks, which is some of the biggest and most sophisticated and profitable customers are choosing T-Mobile because of the sophistication of our advanced network capabilities and our ability to translate that into solutions for their business. And that's just so different from where we were a few years ago. It's a complete 180 in and it's fueling momentum. In fact, all-time record results in our business group. So hopefully, that answers the question, guys. Terrific. Should we go back to the phones? Jud Henry : Let\u2019s do it. Operator next question, please. Operator : Thank you. That will come from the line of Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Phil Cusick : Hi, guys. Thank you. Hi, Mike. The wireless industry is still running maybe hotter than many expected at the beginning of the year. Certainly, your momentum is strong. Are you seeing improving porting ratios versus other MNOs and maybe the MVNOs or do you think there's a growing mix of customers who are coming in without a phone history or a number? And then second, if I can, CapEx, Mike, you talked about tapering in the second half. Does that jumping off rate in the fourth quarter indicate a much lower '24 CapEx level. Thank you. Mike Sievert : Okay. Great. I'm going to let Peter answer the second CapEx question. The first one is really interesting. The answer to the question is yes and yes. Both are true. So yes, our port ratios are improving each and every month since we launched Phone Freedom against each and every competitor, including cable overall and cable individually. And that's a really interesting fact that it shows that not only are people starting to discover our network advantages, which has sort of been a slow improvement over the last 1.5 years. But we have really sparked intrigue with consumers around this idea that we can free them from being trapped with the other guys. And cable in some ways, actually is helpful in that in a dynamic competitive industry, more people are jump balls. And more people are saying, should I be with one of those two look like kind of old line providers? Or should I be with somebody new? And when they get asked that question, they are picking cable by and large. They're picking T-Mobile, as you saw we had the industry-leading postpaid phone net additions. Now what is happening is cable is growing very rapidly and faster than I think a lot of people expected. But specifically to your premise of your question, our port ratios with cable have been improving for year-over-year for nine quarters in a row. And what you see is that the big step forward they started to take in Q4, according to our analysis, about 80% of the year-over-year increment in their performance from the same period a year ago, Q4, Q1 and Q2 is from non-ports. So they're actually not growing the porting side of their business at the same rate as the non-porting side of their business, instead kind of printing postpaid ads. They might be coming over from prepaid. They might be just simply net new. They might be kind of dropped in the bag. I don't really know. There's probably several different factors to it. And we just -- we don't know quite how to unpack it because we don't have all the information. I mean, we double-click into things like Verizon's wholesale revenue and note that it's not growing. That's sort of an interesting diagnostic for us that helps us understand what might be happening. So anyway, hopefully, that helps it. Our industry-leading account growth of 299,000 shows that T-Mobile is winning the switching decisions in high-quality prime paying families, the kind everybody is going for. Peter Osvaldik : Yeah. And on CapEx, Phil, the way I think about next year, although we're not specifically guiding is we're still comfortable in the 9 to 10 range that we gave out. Remember, I wouldn't take Q4 as a jumping-off point because really, the way Ulf and team have built this is a very lean manufacturing approach to the build one of the secrets to our capital efficiency there. And so it isn't that I take a run rate and an exit run rate and projected, but $9 billion to $10 billion feels about right for next year at this point in time. Mike Sievert : On speaking of a lean network performance machine, I think it would be a good time to just stop and take note of what's been delivered with this incredibly capital-efficient profile that you're asking about. Ulf and team, you guys deserve incredible credit. We've now reached 285 million people with ultra-capacity 5G. This is something that neither of our competitors -- principal competitors have promised to ever do, certainly not in the next two years. And so we've been talking about this idea of being two or more years ahead in the 5G race. But if anything, it's expanding. Maybe you could share a few of the statistics of kind of where we are and also a little shadowing of where we're going. Ulf Ewaldsson : Well, thanks, Mike. And yes, the last quarter, we actually pulled ahead in our leadership. And 285 mid-band POPs, we're heading towards 300 by the end of this year. We have to remember that we reached 200 mid-band POPs two years ago in 2021. On our low band, we reached 300 two years ago, where others are now pulling into the station. It gets harder and harder with the POPs as you grow through every 100 million POPs takes about 3 times the efforts in terms of upgrading and building new towers to be able to deliver the same POP growth. So this network is just fantastic and we are so proud of it, and we're proud to support also what Callie commented on earlier, 5G being capable of not only being that tremendous consumer driver, it also drives now more and more of the business inside the enterprise space, which is a dream for Oliver [indiscernible], who has followed the 5G for many, many years. On top of that, we have lots of room to move ahead. We have today 255 megahertz of spectrum that is dedicated to 5G on our mid-band. And you have to remember that our low band is all dedicated to 5G. When others are talking about their coverage, they're sharing this between LTE and 5G, and we're not -- we're dedicating spectrum. The mid-band megahertz will grow to 200 megahertz dedicated to 5G by the end of the year by migrating more LTE spectrum over to 5G. And then we haven't even started on what we can use for '24 and beyond, which is our C-band. We can use our 345 auction results. We can use our 108 auction results, which is enhancing our 2.5 capabilities even more, and we have yet to re-farm spectrum, for example, on AWS as well. So there is just so much more for us to run at and I couldn't be more excited that we're extending our lead in terms of our network. Mike Sievert : Well, it's a good thing you are because we're filling it up. So what's interesting is that with 3.7 million high-speed Internet customers and rapidly growing, the average speeds on our network are not just twice as fast as our competitors, but growing. We're speeding up, not slowing down on this network in terms of the average person's lived experience. And that's just phenomenal. And it's -- and we've got tons of capacity that we have not yet rolled out, which opens up more and more opportunity on our way to not only the 7 million to 8 million high-speed Internet customers, but our ability to, with the best network, continue to take share from our competitors. We said at the beginning, we had a two plus year advantage, and we would have it for the duration of the 5G era, and you\u2019re proving us right with that work. So thank you. Operator? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Simon Flannery : Great. thanks a lot. Good evening. Just following up, if I could, on that spectrum deployment. I think in the past, you've talked about rolling out fixed wireless to a majority of the U.S. Perhaps you could just help us understand where you are on coverage today with the base offer and how that should evolve over time now that you're at 285 going to 300. And I guess a related question is for Ulf. You didn't mention the millimeter wave. I know you've been looking at potentially a macro overlay product. How are you thinking about that at the moment or attacking MDUs with millimeter wave. Thanks. Mike Sievert : Well, let's start with the millimeter wave question and we can come back to the coverage on fixed wireless. I can touch on that one. Ulf Ewaldsson : Right. So we are actually using millimeter wave today. We have deployments that we early on started off in Manhattan, for example, in Los Angeles in some areas where we really have that extraordinary capacity need we can use the tool of millimeter wave. Our general strategy is not based on millimeter wave. It's based on a macro strategy, which is our layered approach, we're our low band in our mid-band and now also being our PCS spectrum for 5G. But millimeter wave could also be potentially an interesting play for us when it comes to enhancing capacities that could be used, for example, for HSI. And we are working with our vendors, and we are working through our OEMs to figure out if we can make a viable economic and technical performance case out of that with them. Mike Sievert : And that kind of bridges to your second question. Maybe this is a good time to remind everybody how our capacity model works for fixed wireless access. Essentially, right now, we serve about the potential of about 50 million homes, but they're not in certain geographies. They're geographically dispersed all over the U.S. because the way our model works is we're selling excess capacity sector by sector. And so what we do is study every sector from every tower in our network and determine what amount of normative smartphone usage will there be over the next several years. And in areas where there's still excess capacity, we today approve applicants for home Internet use. And right now, there's about 50 million home addresses, where if you were to go into our tool and apply to be our customer, we'd say, yes, out of the 145 million in the country. But what's interesting is if you and several of your neighbors all did the same, the end person would get a no because it's a dynamic model. What we're selling is excess capacity. And because of that, what we -- our modeling shows us that we will get to, as we said at the very beginning, about 7 million or 8 million households with this excess capacity model that's not burdened by capital. And since it's not burdened by capital with an already built mobile network that you need for great coverage and competitiveness, we're able to profitably build this business at very low prices. It's just a win-win for a sort of single-digit penetration part of the market. Now to the premise of your question and what Ulf was getting into, of course, we're studying whether there are ways to go beyond that initial excess capacity capital free model, capital-free ish model. And we haven't drawn any conclusions about that yet. I mean, we're looking hard at millimeter wave. We're looking at whether or not dedicating mid-band spectrum to HSI would make sense, whether they're nonstandard-based solutions. And we just haven't drawn any conclusions. It's not immediately obvious that there are economic ways to grow this business beyond its initial single-digit penetration. But you may see us doing trials in the marketplace as we experiment with this and try to crack the code. And so you'll hear about us trying millimeter wave things or MDU strategies or non-standards-based solutions to see if there's a way to get after it. And you see us trialing fiber, whether or not there's a way for our team, our distribution, our brand to add value in the fiber ecosystem and I've made mention of that before. All these things are things we're doing to try to learn. And the good news is we've got some time because we'll hit this kind of initial terminal sizing of HSI, still we've got two more years to run. So our heads are down seeing if there's a way to crack the code on this. Peter Osvaldik : And of course, any of the things we do there that we just talked about, a capital burden model or something with fiber or all things that would have to be accretive to our Analyst Day guidance that we put out there. Mike Sievert : Good. All right. Operator, next question. Operator : That will come from the line of Tim Horan with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Timothy Horan : Thanks. Just curious, why wouldn't you be raising fixed wireless prices now? It seems like you have very, very strong demand from everything we hear out there and you kind of have somewhat limited supply. And I guess related to that, the Go5G plan, can you give us some color what that means for ARPU growth in the next couple of years? Thanks. Mike Sievert : Okay. Let's start with the second one on Go5G and where is ARPU going and ARPA and all that stuff. Peter, we can start with you. Peter Osvaldik : Yeah, absolutely. I'll let John comment on the success of Go5GPlus. But as I always say, when we think about ARPU and you saw a sequential increase of about $0.20. And we continue to believe on a year-to-year basis, ARPU will be generally stable. There's probably some potential for sequential increase again from Q2 to Q3. And since it is such a mix-driven metric, and you have to put everything into it, whether we're talking about all the benefits we see from Go5GPlus whether we talk about the benefits we see from a segmented approach, whether it's military, 55 plus and how those might be lower ARPU customers than the average that we see but are high CLV customers coming in very high-quality customers. Similarly, in Business. Business, you tend to get enterprise, government, large accounts that have very, very great CLVs but would have, given the nature of the volume purchasing, lower ARPU. So all of that blends into ARPU that we see is generally stable. But it's the ARPA strategy that we have. It's the switching attracting accounts into T-Mobile and then the land and expand ARPA strategy, which you just saw an exciting update to the guide from plus 1% to slightly over 1% on a year-over-year basis there. And that's really the focus point for us. But -- the question on Go5GPlus, and then I hand it to John for a moment because it's been a phenomenal success. Jon Freier : Yeah. And then I think, Peter, just to remind everybody, the Go5GPlus is really kind of a front book initiative. We're not going into the base and asking people to migrate to Go5GPlus and doing all of that within the base. It's really kind of a front book initiative. But this is going fantastic. And we had an opportunity to mention this on our Q1 earnings call back on April 27, when we launched phone freedom, Go5G, Go5GPlus in mid-April. And like Mike said a few moments ago, when you look at the overall porting ratios and the attractiveness of this offer, and what's happening that we've increased our porting ratios every month against every competitor and have followed that through so far in July. And over 60% of the accounts that are joining T-Mobile are now subscribing to Go5GPlus. And there's a utility that's different than Magenta MAX in terms of hotspot data that we've increased in terms of high speed, roaming in Mexico and Canada, across North America that we've increased. But the big pain point that I think Go5GPlus is solving is that new and to promise. First of all, paired with the easy unlock in helping people get out of AT&T and Verizon, mostly AT&T given the unlocked devices, helping people get out of that switch in to T-Mobile, but this three-year contract cycle that AT&T and Verizon has. We knew this was a big insight and a big opportunity that even I underestimated how big of a pain point that is, the fact that you can basically go to law school and complete law school faster than you can complete a phone contract at AT&T and Verizon. And so that's a huge pain point in the promise of Go5GPlus of being able to get in a new device same device software as a new customer every two years. It\u2019s a differentiated and unique proposition in the marketplace that\u2019s really different and is really resonating with customers. Mike Sievert : Well said. Okay. And your last question was about HIS pricing. I\u2019ll just answer it briefly. I don\u2019t normally give sort of forward-looking commentary on pricing. So I\u2019ll answer it this way instead, which is do we see ARPU and are we interested in ARPU enhancement for HIS. And the answer is yes, of course. But generally, when you look at our track record, our philosophy in the past as to how to get about that isn\u2019t to jack up people\u2019s prices, is to add value to their life, bring new services, show them increased offers and let themselves select their way up. And obviously, we\u2019re interested in that in this space. Timothy Horan : Okay. Good. Jud Henry : Next question, please. Operator : That will come from the line of Michael Rollins with Citi. Your line is open. Michael Rollins : Thanks and good afternoon. Just following on the earlier comment, on some of the integration milestones that you've hit. What are the activities that are left to get to the full synergy run rate of $7.5 billion for this year's guidance, $8 billion next year? And can you unpack and maybe even size some of the opportunities for further cost efficiencies that may be embedded in your multiyear plan to drive that longer-term margin expansion. Thanks. Mike Sievert : Okay. Great, Michael. Well, let's talk about where we are on synergies this year and what's left to be done. I mean on the what's left to be done front, not much the major milestones are behind us, but that doesn't mean the synergy run rates are quite there yet. So maybe you can comment on that dynamic, Peter. Peter Osvaldik : Yes, exactly. A few things in there. Of course, we said we have a small tail of customers to still get over and that will allow the final decommissioning of systems and things to that, whether it's front office, back office, those are the things that are kind of left to do. Certainly, from a cost perspective, there's a little bit in terms of physical decom while the sites are shut off, there's still physical decom happening. And on the synergy development, as we get from $7.5 billion to the $8 billion next year, really, the big chunk of that is avoided costs. So we'll realize the vast majority of the run rate synergies by the end of this year, which you'd naturally expect given we're saying we're substantially done. And then the shift to next year will be fundamentally those avoided site build costs. Mike Sievert : Okay. Great. Michael Rollins : And then just one other. Can you just share how T-Mobile is looking at the role and mix of online distribution and how you're viewing the durability of customers wanting a physical retail location to buy an upgrade devices? Mike Sievert : Yeah, absolutely. And it kind of goes to the premise of your follow-on question, your initial follow-on question, Michael. I mean, obviously, across consumer markets generally, customers want a transaction that's fast, transparent, simple and mostly digital. And our industry has been very stubborn on that front, mostly due to the complexity of the offers across all the providers. And so that's something that we're very focused on. And I know everybody in the industry is. Our digital capabilities are rapidly improving, especially as it relates to self-service for our customers. It's incredible what's going on left to right in our company as to how we're already applying AI technologies and machine learning to speed things up, serve customers in a better way. And we can get into some examples around that. But because of emerging technologies, there's a lot of potential over the coming years to not only meet customers where they are finally in this industry because we've been kind of slow in this industry due to the complexity of our offers, but also to potentially realize some efficiencies over time. And that's a good thing because the cost of competition is high. And as you've seen over the last few years, it's gone up. And so it's all about us seizing opportunities to be able to continue this formula that works so well. And for us to continue to do what we do with this flywheel of success, we can't sit on our hands. We have to be able to seize new opportunities, not necessarily to outperform the promises we made you. Those promises were really high, fall some promises, but in some cases, to achieve them in light of what we have seen in the past, which is some increased cost of competition. So at the end of the day, it\u2019s great for consumers. Jud Henry : All right. Thank you. Next question, please. Operator : That will come from the line of Rick Prentiss with Raymond James. Your line is open. Richard Prentiss : Great. Thank you. Couple of questions. I want to follow up on the private network question. Where do you feel that private networks -- 5G private networks will become a material enough number on the revenues, an associated question do you feel customers, whether it's consumer or enterprise really understand what 5G means for them and why they should choose you with your head start. It just seems like the market is still just kind of like, oh, I'm not sure what 5G is. Mike Sievert : On the consumer piece, I kind of agree and what people want is a really strong, powerful signal everywhere they go. That's what they want. And 5G is a means for us to get that better than anyone else. Whether or not they give us credit that the thing that got them that was 5G, I really don't care. But we have the highest performing network with incredible reach of the high-performing parts of our network, 5G than anybody else. Like by far, like twice the land mass covered of ultra-capacity 5G than our next closest competitor and rapidly expanding, as Ulf explained. And you're right, they don't really give 5G credit for that. But what they want, make no mistake, is a very powerful signal everywhere they go because they're watching video more than ever, they're glued to their TikTok and their Instagram stories and their sports and their YouTube and their videos and their zooms and they don't want buffering. They want that signal with no latency and no buffering and no jitter and that's the power of 5G, whether they give it credit or not. On the Business side, I'll say the short version, which is we don't really know. I mean whether -- to your question, literally material means something in our company, and that's big. We're a big company. We don't know when it will be bigger than a bread basket, but we do know that we're best positioned to capture it. And as Peter pointed out, back at our Analyst Day, 2-plus years ago, we actually did not, for that reason, factor a lot of revenues in or really any at all from some of these advanced 5G network services. Our strategy was, let's make sure we are best positioned to capture them. And Kelly, I think, very deftly explain some of the things that we're doing in this area with early adopting customers. But when it becomes something that's bigger than a bread basket and really contributes, we don't really know. And because we didn't know, we made you no promises in our long-range plan on it. But I can tell you this promise, as that market develops, we are beautifully positioned to capture it. Richard Prentiss : All right. Great. Thank you. Jud Henry : It looks like we're right at time. So I appreciate everybody joining us today. If you have any further questions, please reach out to either Investor Relations or the media relations department. Again, we look forward to talking to you again soon. Thank you. Mike Sievert : Thanks, everybody. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the T-Mobile second (ph) quarter earnings call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect and have a pleasant day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jud Henry, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations for T-Mobile US. Please go ahead. Jud Henry : All right. Welcome to T-Mobile's third quarter 2023 earnings call. Joining me on the call today are Mike Sievert, our President and CEO; Peter Osvaldik, our CFO, as well as other members of the senior leadership team. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements which involve a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. We provide a comprehensive list of risk factors in our SEC filings, which I encourage you to review. Our earnings release, investor fact book, and other documents related to our results, as well as reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP results discussed on this call can be found in the quarterly results section of the investor relations website. With that said, let me kick it over to Mike. Mike Sievert : Okay. Thanks, Jud. Good morning, everybody. If you're watching on our webcast, you can see we're coming to you from New York City and, here with several members of my senior leadership team, and we're looking forward to discussing another quarter of great results. Our strategy to deliver the best network coupled with the best value and the best customer experience has remained remarkably consistent. And our Q3 results again show how well that strategy is working with another quarter of industry leading customer and financial growth. I want to thank our amazing team nationwide. We have tackled a lot of change together recently to position our company for success in the future, and it hasn't all been easy. But this team showed once again what loving customers looks like and how that simple philosophy translates into success. I'm sure you've seen the numbers already. So I'm going to spare you the greatest hits album of all the quarterly results and just a couple of things with a few comments so that we can get [Technical Difficulty] First, as we announced yesterday, I am so proud of our network team for reaching our audacious goal of 300 million people covered with dedicated mid-band 5G over two months ahead of our year-end target. We announced this goal nearly three years ago. And then we got to work and got it done. And to this day, no one else in our industry has stated any plans to match it at any time in the future. I know it may get confusing with others celebrating their C-band deployments, which might have a casual observer. Believe, our network lead could be narrowing, but the opposite is true. In fact, even after their C-band deployments, according to Ookla, T-Mobile's nationwide median speeds were double the next competitor's speeds in September -- double in September. And our mid-band 5G square mile coverage is also double the next closest competitor, meaning, others still have a lot of wood to chop beyond just population dense pockets to ever reach the expansive geography where T-Mobile is today. And we have more spectrum dedicated to 5G than anyone else. Before we've even begun to deploy our C-band, our 3.45 GHz spectrum, or Auction 108 2.5 GHz licenses, let alone re-farming our AWS. Listen, we started the 5G era two years ahead of the competition and today we remain two or more years ahead. And I predict that two years from now, we still will be. What all this translates to is a superior customer experience. We're rapidly putting our spectrum resources to work for the benefit of consumers and businesses. And we're doing it with the best capital efficiency in the industry. Most exciting part, many prospective customers are only just beginning to take notice that T-Mobile is the overall network lever, leaving lots of growth runway ahead. And we're also expanding on our long-held fame for delivering the best value. Our latest Un-Carrier move is freeing customers locked into three-year contracts, and our new Go 5G rate plans are delivering the most feature-rich options in wireless. Phone freedom has turned out to be one of our most exciting Un-Carrier moves ever, and it continues to bring high-quality switchers to T-Mobile, as you could see in our industry-leading postpaid account growth. We're also executing on our ARPA revenue growth strategy, posting another strong quarter well over plus 1% versus a year ago and revenue per account on the strength of Go 5G plus and multiple products. Some have asked, if our new higher value rate plans are most popular with consumers, then why isn't ARPU growing faster too? And I'll point out that consumer ARPU does continue to grow even after offsets from growing segments like 55+ and military. And consumer overall is being partially offset by profitable growth in the enterprise space at somewhat lower ARPUs, but attractive CLVs, a development that's contributing well to our financial growth. And we're doing all of this within a backdrop of a wireless industry that continues to grow service revenues and cash flows, while simultaneously seeing customers win from healthy competition that delivers more value and better networks. In fact, this industry produces cash flow and EBITDA much higher than five years ago, while at the same time, customers are enjoying 3 times more data at 4 times higher speeds, while paying just a fraction of the price per unit consumed versus before. And that's before factoring in the expanded device promotions now routinely offered. A vibrant profitable business delivering rapidly improving network service and value. That's the win-win 5G dividend nobody's talking about, and it helps to showcase why T-Mobile's 5G leadership is so important. This is certainly true in T-Mobile for Business, where we have the highest ever account net ads overall and our highest ever postpaid nets in enterprise based on the strength of our 5G enabled solutions. Consumers are also choosing T-Mobile above all others. Prime network seekers in the top 100 markets increasingly recognize that T-Mobile offers the best combination of network coverage and capacity to meet their needs. And for the first time ever, T-Mobile also won the highest share of switchers in smaller markets and rural areas in Q3. Broadband also had another strong quarter. We now serve over 4.2 million customers who are enjoying a great experience with net promoter scores that remain more than 30 points higher than cable, with churn improving year-over-year as well. We remain very much on pace for our longer term goals with 5G broadband. Overall, our customer growth strategy remains differentiated and durable, resulting in industry leading service revenue growth both at the total company level and at the postpaid service revenue level where most of the value is created, which grew more than 6% or more than 1.5 times the growth rate of peers. That top-line leadership coupled with our synergy realization and focus on cost efficiencies drove double-digit growth and core adjusted EBITDA with the highest free cash flow conversion in the industry. This allows us to not only raise our guidance for this year again, it also gives us excitement and confidence in the future. With our significant growth opportunities continuing to scale, with lots of room to run, it sets us up for sustained leadership in both customer and service revenue growth as we look ahead. And we see opportunities amid the rapidly changing technology landscape as well, all across our business, to drive further revenue growth, margin expansion, and free cash flow growth that will allow us to fund our growth investments in our customers and network, as well as provide the potential for substantial ongoing shareholder returns. This amazing customer-loving team continues to perform beautifully with so much exciting potential ahead, showing why it's not just a tagline when we say that for customers, employees, and investors alike, it's better over here at T-Mobile. Okay, Peter, over to you to talk about our key financial highlights and an update on our guidance. Peter Osvaldik : All right. Thanks, Mike. Our ongoing delivery of best-in-class customer and financial growth quarter after quarter enables us to increase our guidance once again. So let's jump into the details. We now expect total postpaid net customer additions to be between 5.7 million and 5.9 million, up 50,000 at the midpoint. This reflects continued progress across all our core growth initiatives, partially offset by the deactivation of lower ARPU postpaid other data devices in the education sector, the largest of which arose during Q3. As you know, our ability to uniquely solve customer pain points led to significant connection growth in the educational sector during the pandemic, supporting the rapid need for remote learning solutions. As things are increasingly returning to normal, we had anticipated many of these connections to roll off in 2023 and do not expect the deactivation of these educational connections to have any material impact to service revenue looking forward. Included in the 5.7 million to 5.9 million is our expectation of approximately 3 million postpaid phone net additions for the full year. Our focus on profitable growth allows us to fund those higher postpaid phone net ads and still increase our core adjusted EBITDA expectation, which we now expect to be between $29 billion and $29.2 billion. This is up over 10% year-over-year at the midpoint, fueled by higher service revenues and synergies, and excludes leasing revenues of approximately $300 million as we transition substantially all remaining customers off device leasing by year end. Our merger synergies are expected to be approximately $7.5 billion in 2023, achieving the full run rate synergy target provided at our Analyst Day a year ahead of schedule as we build towards the full run rate synergies of $8 billion in 2024. Now with the merger integration now substantially behind us, we will discontinue reporting synergies separately from overall business results going forward. We continue to expect merger-related costs, which are not included in adjusted or core adjusted EBITDA, to be approximately $1 billion before taxes. And we now expect cash merger related costs of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion for 2023 as they have under run the P&L recognition to date. Net cash provided by operating activities which include payments for merger related costs are now expected to be in the range of $18.3 billion to $18.5 billion. We now expect cash CapEx to be between $9.6 billion and $9.8 billion, delivering our network milestones ahead of schedule at a capital efficiency unmatched in our industry. The higher operating cash flows not only fund the increased CapEx, but also allow for a slight increase to free cash flow, now expected to be between $13.4 billion to $13.6 billion, which includes payments for merger-related costs. Not only is this up approximately 75% over last year, thanks to our margin expansion and capital efficiency, but also represents a free cash flow to service revenue margin, which is multiple percentage points higher than peers with further expansion expected next year. Consistent with the entire year, the updated free cash flow guidance does not assume any material net cash inflows from securitization. Turning to income taxes, we continue to expect our full year effective tax rate to be between 24% and 26%. And finally, we continue to expect full year postpaid ARPA to increase slightly more than 1% as we continue to expand our account relationships as part of our land and expand account strategy to grow service revenue. In closing, our differentiated and profitable growth strategy continues to deliver industry-leading growth and service revenue, core adjusted EBITDA, and free cash flow along with the highest free cash flow conversion in the industry to unlock shareholder value. And with that, I'll now turn the call back to Jud to begin the Q&A. Jud Henry : All right, let's get to your questions. You can ask a question via phone by pressing one followed by four or via XTwitter by sending a tweet to @T-MobileIR or at Mike Sievert using #TMUS. We'll start with a question on the phone. Operator, first question please. Operator : Thank you. Our first question is from the line of John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead. John Hodulik : Great. Thanks. Two question if I can. First of all, the comments on the rapid share gains in the rural markets were sort of new this quarter. Mike, anything you could tell us about sort of where you are and sort of how much room you have to go to penetrate these markets. And then secondly, maybe for Peter, there was a comment in the 10-Q about the workforce reduction and the fact that it would drive OpEx down on a year-over-year basis in 2024. I guess two parts there. One, are there any way you could quantify the OpEx reduction and are there other factors involved that are potentially allowing you to see that OpEx reduction on a year-over-year basis? Thanks. Mike Sievert : Okay, John. Let's start with Jon Freier who maybe can give a little color on what we're seeing in smaller markets and rural areas. As you heard in my prepared remarks, this is a huge milestone, because T-Mobile achieved leadership in share of switchers for the first time ever across the entirety of what we call smaller markets and rural areas, which is about 40% of the country. Jon Freier : Yes, you bet, Mike. So yes, just to pick it up on that, 40% of the country, everything outside of the top 100 markets is how we define smaller markets and rural areas. It's about 140 million people, 50 million households, and again, 40% of the market. And we just could not be more delighted. I've been talking to you about this for a couple of years now relative to our ambitions in smaller markets and rural areas and bringing real 5G. When you think about a lot of the places that we're playing, we're bringing the only 5G network into town. And given the announcement that we just made a couple of days ago around 5G Ultra Capacity now bringing that to 300 million people across the entire country. So it's a huge opportunity when we bring the network, we're bringing the distribution, we're bringing our marketing and our special sauce relative to our value proposition and more choice to smaller markets and rural areas. It's been fantastic. It's a huge milestone for us to be across all these markets now the leader of share of port ends. We're not playing in all the markets, just as a reminder. It's about 70% of the markets that we're playing in. We're not even playing across all the markets. And even with that, now we're the share leader in terms of share taker, I should say, not necessarily share leader, but share taker. And I mentioned this a few times. We've had a dedicated team as a big part of our success in smaller markets, rural areas, really getting at to this with our dedicated team that's focused on driving the kind of commercial success that we're looking for. And our overall ambition is unchanged. And we're right on track to hit 20% share of household by the end of 2025. Mike Sievert : You take these last couple of quarters and drag them right, we'll be the share leader soon enough in smaller markets and rural areas. Peter, any comments on OpEx for 2024? Why don't you just go ahead and roll out the guidance for 2020? Peter Osvaldik : Yes, exactly. [Multiple Speakers] Yes, so I got up too early to roll out 2024 guidance, that's for sure. But in your question of workforce transformation. Look, I think Mike touched upon it at the beginning, and you saw us comment around this before. This is really about a tough set of actions, but as we got through the balance of the integration, we had to make some changes. That's what this team does. It looks around corners and it says, we need to make sure we create clarity in the operating of this organization, bring that entrepreneurial spirit back and make sure that we're looking at what are the headwinds and what are the tailwinds. As we think about what we laid out at Analyst Day, which seems like so long ago with respect to 2024 and what we were going to do there. A lot in the world has changed, but it's a set of all of these tailwinds and actions that we've created that still gives us confidence that we think, certainly from a core EBITDA perspective, again, I'm not going to roll out all the 2024 guidance, but we're going to come right in there in the middle of the range. And these are the kind of actions that are necessary to create that opportunity and keep bringing the ability to invest in customers and the network and the business as we are. Mike Sievert : I was kind of kidding, but you did roll out the guidance. Okay. That's pretty good. It is remarkable that we did this Analyst Day years ago, I think, early in 2021 and laid out several years of expectations. And as we sit here today, knocking on 2024, we're able to outlook a year next year that looks just like we had anticipated, right down the middle. And that's something that I'm particularly proud of, given that it's not at all like we thought. I mean, it's really different than we thought. And yet we make course corrections as we go to keep the promises that we made to you front and center, a vibrant growing business, developing EBITDA and cashflow, and doing breakthrough things for customers and businesses. And that's what's happening. So we couldn't be more excited about next year. Operator, next question. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Simon Flannery : Great. Thank you very much. Good morning. Mike, you talked about some of the additional growth opportunities and perhaps you just revisit the fiber [pilot program] (ph) and how that's going, how you're thinking about that? There's been a lot of speculation about different assets. I think you've talked in the past about asset light. And then related to that, fixed wireless expansion and analyzing millimeter wave, overlay solutions and other ways to add capacity, any updates on that. It sounds like you've still got C-band and 3.45 to bring to bear on that. But any color there would be great. Mike Sievert : Yes. Thanks, Simon. Well, nothing's changed in terms of our philosophy and approach as it relates to broadband. And just to take you back, what we had said still holds, which is, we are conducting all kinds of experiments in the space, including observing our national performance in 5G home broadband, which, if anything, that performance and the resonance of our brand and our team's ability to execute in the space, along with the trials that we're doing in fiber, only bolster our confidence that our brand and our team belong in this market. But nothing has changed in terms of our philosophy. We like this business model, and to the extent we make investments or partnerships in the area, our view is, it should be capital light, generally off balance sheet, et cetera. Speculation, I know is out there. I can't clarify we're not the partner to [JANA] (ph) in the transaction that was rumored a couple weeks ago. Although we remain interested in partnerships like the kinds we have rolled out pilots around and other constructs that are generally capital light, generally off balance sheet. And that's for a reason. We're performing really well and demonstrating through our tests as well as our broad scale performance in 5G home broadband that our brand and our team belong in this space and we can create value. As it relates to new ways to do wireless broadband, you said it at the very end there, and I mentioned in my remarks, Ulf and team, now that they've reached 300 million people with mid-band Ultra Capacity 5G are now setting about the task of deploying all of our spectrum resources to that base. And we're only just beginning. We have the bulk of our 2.5 GHz now rolling out. But our target is to be at 200 megahertz around the end of this year deployed against the 300 million people. And then more room to run next year, because as I said, we have Auction 108 proceeds still pending, we have C-band that we haven't deployed, 3.45, as well as refarming potential from spectrum being used for LTE right now, like AWS. And so lots of room to run as it relates to pouring new capacity into this network. And that means, we right now at a broad scale are not looking at alternatives to that from a wireless standpoint. We use millimeter wave pretty strategically in very dense places and so far that's a great use for it. I will say, as we said last time, so no change, that we remain open minded to whether there are techniques that would allow us to deploy capital specifically for 5G broadband and make a great return for you. But so far, we haven't drawn any conclusions that that's a scalable opportunity for us. Simon Flannery : Thanks Mike. Mike Sievert : You bet. Jud Henry : All right. Next question please. Operator : Our next question is from the line of -- pardon me, Phil Cusick with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Phil Cusick : Two if I can. One, Peter can you talk about potential savings from the layoffs in August and will those hit the fourth quarter or should we think of that all next year? And then maybe one for Callie. Can you talk about the contribution of business to subscriber growth numbers and what's the typical ARPU of your business phone lines? Thank you. Mike Sievert : Okay, let's start with Callie on business. And then we'll come back to another crack at OpEx. So what's going on in business, Cellie? Callie Field : Well, thanks Phil for the question. And I'll tell you, as a result of our network leadership and the solutions that are built for today's unique challenges of a CIO, we continue to deliver highly profitable growth. One of our highest postpaid phone net ads and lowest phone churn quarters in history and delivered results once again that outperformed our benchmark competitor. This quarter also we delivered our highest enterprise postpaid net ads ever. So we're seeing growth in all segments, in small business and in enterprise. As for the macro environment, while there's probably a portion that are price sensitive. We know from years of experience that price alone doesn't determine a win with enterprise and government who are uncompromising when it comes to network performance and complete solutions. Solutions like we recently deployed at Boston Children's Hospital, which is the healthcare industry's first ever hybrid 5G network solution for over 18 buildings which is supporting critical applications not only reliable connectivity, but also with security and MDM solutions for doctors to provide telehealth services to their patients. So let me pause there and Mike, see if there's anything else. Mike Sievert : Yeah, and specifically on ARPU, we said in our prepared remarks, it's somewhat lower than consumer, but highly accretive from a CLV and value creation standpoint. So these are great customers. We are finding, as Callie said, that enterprises are not picking us because we're the lowest price, although we compete ambitiously on price. They're picking us because of the solutions that Callie's team has brought to the market. And that's very helpful from a value creation standpoint for us. So we continually look at the customer lifetime value, net of all the costs to serve these customers, and find that enterprise customers are highly attractive, and therefore contributing to our financial results. And that's why Peter always warns you, ARPU is a mix-driven metric. And we're not solving for it, we're solving for value creation and return on our effort and investment and enterprise is a great place to put our effort and investment. Peter Osvaldik : And then Phil with regards to the [indiscernible] crack at OpEx. So again, the actions that we took really ways for us to create tailwind and further fuel the growth of the company. And so I'm not giving specific line item, OpEx guides, all of those actions were then contemplated in the updated guide for 2023 that we gave, and again, kind of the teaser we just gave about 2024 and core EBITDA there. Phil Cusick : Thanks, guys. Peter Osvaldik : You bet. Jud Henry : All right. Next question. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead. Craig Moffett : Hi, thank you. You guys recently took a price increase for legacy plans and we've heard a bit about -- it certainly drew some unwelcome press, and we've heard a little bit about pulling back from that a little bit. Can you just talk about the kind of response you've had and how you think about industry pricing going forward and the ability to walk some of your ARPUs higher? Mike Sievert : Yes, of course, Craig. And by the way, that was sort of not very accurately reported. So let me just kind of clear it up. As you guys know, because you follow us so closely, more so than the press. We tend to do tests and pilots of things quite a bit to try to figure out what's the right answer. In this case, we had a test cell to try to understand customer interest in and acceptance of migrating off old legacy rate plans to something that's higher value for them and for us. And we had planned to test and did some training around that. And then it leaked. And it leaked as if it was a broad national thing. And it kind of wasn't. Now, I don't know that we still have to do that test cell, because to your point, we did get plenty of feedback, thanks to the erroneous context of the leak. And I think we've learned that particular test cell isn't something that our customers are going to love. Now, exactly none have rolled out. So even to your question that we recently rolled out, we didn't. We had planned it -- we had planned it as a test cell, and then we aren't doing it. Because I think we got plenty of feedback. But maybe Mike, you can talk about our philosophy on pricing, things we're interested in, what we're hearing from customers, and also what we're seeing with Go 5G Plus and Next. Michael Katz : Yes. Maybe I can start with that. Go 5G Plus and Next have been, like we've talked about the last couple cycles, incredible successes for us. And it really starts with the fact that these are hands down the best value in this industry. If you look at all the features that come with those plans, there's hundreds of dollars of value for customers on a monthly basis with the streaming benefits and the in-flight Wi-Fi and roaming benefits are on those plans. But in a time when the market and customers are so focused on device value, there is not a plan in the industry that gives customers more flexibility and more value on device than the Go 5G plans do. And you really saw that in this last iPhone cycle where we really differentiated with the flexibility on upgrade. When the rest of the market is at three years, we had offers for customers that allowed them to upgrade as frequently as one year. Those plans really create the platform for our core pricing strategy, which is, how can we give customers more and more value and allow them to move up our price card because they feel like they're getting something additional from us. So that is the foundation of our core pricing value. As Mike said, we conduct tests and pilots all the time, all the time, and we will continue to do so because we still think there's opportunities both to deliver more value for customers in a bunch of different ways, but also look for opportunities to simplify our overall portfolio. So I would expect to see more of those kinds of tests from us, because it's been a consistent practice throughout the entire un-carrier journey so that we get it right for the experience for our customers. Mike Sievert : Yes. Although that particular test cell doesn't need to be executed now we remain very interested in rationalizing our legacy rate plans for IT purposes, simplification purposes, revenue realization purposes, customer satisfaction and retention purposes. So we're going to stay at it, but that particular idea will probably do something different. Good, okay. Craig Moffett : Can you just comment on just the industry pricing environment overall and what your sense is about the competitive intensity on the rate plan side? Mike Sievert : Yes, absolutely. In fact, I'll give a broader picture, rate plan and device promotions, which have become a big part of the competitive milieu over the last couple of years. It's intense. It's really competitive. And it's pretty consistent too. I mean, I think it's been consistently competitive all year. And you saw we delivered an incredible Q2 and Q3 in that context. Some of the best performance in our history, the lowest churn ever for a Q2 and for a Q3 in our history. We continue to lead in postpaid net additions and delivered EBITDA performance and outlooks on EBITDA that show that we're monetizing that growth as well. So we're really comfortable in this competitive dynamic and it's stable and consistent. So that's what's going on out there. It's intense. We like it that way. And, I would say, we're entering typically very intense seasonal period around the holidays, and I expect it to be a slog out there just like it is every year. Craig Moffett : Thank you. Mike Sievert : All right. Jud Henry : All right. Next question. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Brett Feldman : Thanks for taking the question. During your prepared remarks, I think you'd mentioned that your fixed wireless churn has come down. I was hoping you can maybe give us a little bit of insight into what's driving that? Maybe broadly speaking, what you've learned about what creates churn and what causes greater levels of retention across that base? And do you think you're getting to a point where churn is getting into a mature run rate or is there still opportunity to keep driving that lower? Thank you. Mike Sievert : Yes, I'd love to take credit for that. I think a lot of it's just the math of the aging of our base. So this product was great when we launched it. And that's because we had made sure it would be great before we took it national. And so, it's generally been pretty consistent. One of the ways you can look at that is the net promoter scores, which have been pretty consistent. Michael Katz : Yeah, in fact, leading industry of all kinds of -- different kinds of broadband products. Yes, I think there's two things. One is the one that Mike just said. And we've talked about this previously, that when you have a new broadband business, one that literally has doubled in size year-over-year, that we have many more customers that are brand new customers that churn at a higher rate. That's just the way that the churn curve works on products like these, including wireless. Early 10-year customers churn at a higher rate. And as customers mature and our base matures, we expected to see a decrease in churn, which we, in fact, have seen. Additionally, across all of our 10-year cohorts, we've also seen churn come down. And a lot of that is because as we get more mature in our execution and as we get more feedback in data from customers about their performance, we've been able to tune our execution. We've been able to do things and address things like common things that cause confusion for customers either with install or with peripheral devices being attached to their CPEs. We've created better tools to be able to troubleshoot for customers. And those things have had an impact on churn. And I do expect as we learn more, we'll get better there as well. So, our goal with all of our businesses is always to be the best in churn, and that's no different for us than in the HSI business. Brett Feldman : Thank you. Jud Henry : Okay. All right. Next question, please. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Jonathan Chaplin with New Street Research. Please go ahead. Jonathan Chaplin : Thanks. So Mike, when you talk about why your business is so great, it always starts with the discussion of the fact that you have the best network and it's built on this incredible spectrum portfolio that's unmatched across the industry. Is there something about the broadband business that means you don't have to own and control the underlying asset in order to have the same kind of defensible position in broadband, and I'm thinking specifically of fiber here as opposed to fixed wireless access? Mike Sievert : Well, it's a great question. For me, in the wireless space, you have this national competitive intensity where brand trust around this intangible value and network is really, really important. And we have so carefully built that brand trust over so many years that we think it's somewhat transferable. People believe in this brand, being an advocate for them, putting them first, changing the rules in their favor. And in wireless, there's a big intangible on network, which is, you can't really buy three phones and then travel the whole country. There are services that do that, and people make advertising claims based on what those services find, but people don't believe all that stuff. So it really comes down to their own lived experience and the covenant -- sort of the contact and the connection they have with the brand that they use. And what we're finding in our work is that, that brand is highly transferable into adjacent spaces because of that trust. And so, we're interested in the space. We're finding that our brand really resonates, but we're not interested in changing who we are from sort of a capital structure standpoint. And that's why we've talked about fiber the way we have. Jonathan Chaplin : A quick follow-up, Mike. Can you just update us on how many homes you're addressing with fixed wireless access and how that's changed over the course of the quarter? Mike Sievert : Yes. And I'll address it, but I will remind you, it's a bit of a different metric than homes passed in the broadband and fiber space. We generally talk about marketing to about 50 million homes right now. But it's a dynamic number and it changes based on penetration of given neighborhoods. And so what happens, I'll remind you is that on every sector of every tower, we have an assessment of capacity, not just now, but out into the future, assuming ongoing wireless smartphone share taking and ongoing rapid increase in wireless consumption per smartphone. And once we plot all of that out, there are sectors of towers where no normal amount of share taking or wireless smartphone consumption will use up our capacity anytime soon. And in those places, and only those places are we approving applicants for our home broadband service. And what that means is, we're essentially monetizing and selling excess capacity through this initial 5G broadband strategy. And so those are the \"homes passed\". Now, if three people in your neighborhood sign up, or four or five people, depends on the sector, the whole neighborhood comes off our list until such time as we've got that excess capacity again. Now, as I mentioned earlier, Ulf is rapidly rolling out new capacity enhancements, and we're only part way into it. I think as we wrapped up the quarter, we had what, Ulf, about 155 megahertz deployed against our Ultra Capacity? Ulf Ewaldsson : That's right. And we continue -- I mean, we have now 70% of the payload is 5G on the network. As we continue to see more and more 5G traffic, that means we can move over frequencies that are used for LTE into 5G. And as you said earlier, we have this enormous spectrum asset in mid-band, which is where the home Internet products are residing that we can continue to leverage. We have more spectrum than anyone else has on mid-band as a potential. By the end of the year, we are approaching 200 megahertz that we will have dedicated for 5G products. Mike Sievert : So that gives you a sense of how rapidly this is changing in terms of how we're deploying capacity. It sits in the high 150s now. It's on its way to 200 around the end of the year against Ultra Capacity 5G. And that's before broad deployments of C-band, 3.45, most of the Auction 108 proceeds, which we don't have yet, and ongoing refarming from LTE. So lots of room to run. Jonathan Chaplin : So Mike, that 50 million is about the same as it was last quarter. So the acceleration in net adds must have come either from gaining share of decisions within the 50 million or from the reduction of churn that you mentioned earlier. Mike Sievert : Yes. And net adds have been relatively consistent. I mean, I know it was in the high 500s this time. Every quarter will be a little different. But I would say net adds have been pretty consistent. Jonathan Chaplin : Awesome. Thank you. Mike Sievert : You bet. Thanks, Jonathan. Jud Henry : All right. Let's go to social. We've got a question from [Bill Ho] (ph). Given the 3Q iPhone launch and 3Q take rate, how does Q4 look for existing subscriber upgrades on devices and plans? Mike Sievert : Okay. Well, let's start with Jon and maybe talk about what we're seeing out there in the consumer space with upgrades and what's driving that. Jon Freier : Yes, you bet. So like we said in Q3, we had a great overall quarter when you look at what's happening with the iPhone. First of all, this iPhone 15 is a fantastic device. And it drove a lot of switching in the marketplace as you saw relative to our results. And not just iPhone 15 on a differentiated 5G network that I talked about just a few moments ago, but a different iPhone 15 because of some capabilities that really work on our network versus others. When you think about 4-carrier aggregation, when you think about voice over new radio, 20% download speeds that are faster versus an iPhone that doesn't have that. That's all great. Customers love it, et cetera. And it drove a lot of switching activity. Now relative to our existing customer base, what you're finding is you're finding us landing upgrade offers with people who need it, and not necessarily with people who don't need it. Because remember, our overall base is about 70% with the 5G handset that's out there today. And when you think about customers that are having a great lived experience today on an incredible 5G network, they look at upgrades as an opportunity to, am I really going to improve my experience. For a lot of customers, that's not really happening relative to the network that they have out there and relative to our overall positioning with our 5G devices. Remember, we had a lot of upgrades back in 2021 and 2022 in the Sprint base. We got a lot of that upgrade base happening at that time. So like we said, when you look at the overall iPhone 15 launch, I feel fantastic about that. When you look at upgrades, it's a little lower. You've seen the upgrade rate at 2.7%. It's a little lower. But also with against the backdrop of the lowest Q2 churn we've ever had followed up with the lowest Q3 postpaid phone churn that we've ever had and I like how those dynamics are playing out. Peter Osvaldik : Yes, and I would just add, Bill, to that question. I think I had expect the same dynamic to play out in Q4. That same meeting consumer demand exactly as it is. That same dynamic of because of the 5G device penetration and how the lived experience on those network actually exists for those customers. I feel equipment revenue, which as you know, isn't the value-creating element of the company, that's service revenue, that will continue to have industry-leading growth. On the equipment revenue side, I'd expect it to be in the same kind of low $3 billion range for Q4 as a result of that dynamic. Mike Sievert : It's been a nice tailwind for us to see these upgrade rates so low and yet our churn so low at the same time. And it really speaks to the everyday experience that T-Mobile customers are having on the most advanced 5G network. And they just don't feel as compelled to take action because they have a 5G device, and it's working remarkably well. And that trend could continue because, as Jon said it kind of fast, but the newest iPhones take advantage of four-way carrier aggregation on T-Mobile because our network is so far ahead with standalone 5G and core 5G capabilities that are much more advanced. Now the devices are starting to take advantage of those things, which means they're very future-proofed. And so, it's great to be at T-Mobile because these advanced phone features take advantage of advanced network features and may mean that you don't need a new one again as quickly as you might otherwise. For some people, that's what they want. They just want a new one every year. I'm one of those people and T-Mobile reaches that audience as well with our breakthrough plans like Go 5G, Next. So we feel like we're speaking to the right audiences with the right offers here. Jud Henry : Okay. Great. Operator, let's go back to the phones. Operator : Certainly. Our next question is from the line of David Barden with Bank of America. Please go ahead. David Barden : Hey, guys. Thank you so much for taking the questions. I guess, two threads, if I could. Mike, I just wanted to follow up on your comments. I mean, in the past, you've historically said that the higher switching environments were environments where T-Mobile thrive, because you were bringing your value proposition to the market more frequently. But now that upgrade rates and churn is falling across all the telco players, does this mean that you're getting just super normal switcher share from the telcos? Or is some of this now coming to you from cable as that base kind of ages in their experience in the cable industry and the promotions come off? And then I guess the second question if I could here, you kind of talked about how these headcount reductions in the summer were part of some of this larger plan for transformation of the business. Is there more to come on the transformation and maybe for lack of a better word, synergy realization as we look into the 2024-2025 period? Or are we there now? Thanks. Mike Sievert : Yes. Thanks, David. Well, let me comment first on the competitive dynamic. You're right. I mean, we love a dynamic where there are more jump balls, more people who are category and tenders. And let me clarify, though, that devices and upgrade rates are only one input to that. So devices can be a great catalyst for switching carriers, but they're by far not the only one. And so, our job through our offers is to create those moments where people stop and say, hey, maybe I'd be better off. Maybe it's better over there at T-Mobile. And that's something we've consistently done in our Un-carrier moves have always been a technique we've used. This latest one this year, Phone Freedom and all the related offers around it is really resonating with people. We looked into it and found that AT&T, for example, was experiencing really low churn and yet high intentions to switch by their base, and that told us that people felt trapped. And so, we released an offer that was about untrapping them. And that's been the kind of thing the Un-carrier has always done. So we're out there competing ambitiously and it's working as you can see in our industry-leading postpaid phone net additions and other metrics. We are also seeing, mostly due to the aging of the base, as you said, that switching relative to cable has been improving quarter-over-quarter for several quarters in a row. That's good to see. There's no real new dynamic there with cable. They've been pretty consistent since about a year ago, and we expect that to continue. And you can see how well we're competing in a dynamic where cable is out there doing what they do relatively consistently. And then finally, you were asking about transformation and what's going on there and what we see. Do we have room to run? In many ways, we're really just getting started. Peter Osvaldik : Yes. And you kind of asked it in the context of workforce transformation. There's no broad plans to do any more of that in 2024. But on transformation and efficiency, absolutely and how we'll grow core EBITDA and continue to expand that. Two elements there. One, as you know, we made significant investments in the last couple of years, whether it's in network and the pull forward that we did there, that now we're able to leverage. Similarly, in smaller markets and rural areas where you had distribution expansion and that investment is things that you can now leverage. And beyond that, of course, I mean, that's one thing this team does phenomenally well is looking at how do you harness the latest technologies? How are you really looking around corners to create the efficiency so that we can have that reinvestment into customer acquisition and profitability. So there's more of that on the runway ahead of us for sure. Mike Sievert : Yes. And I'll just add one thing. I mean, obviously, we're not the only company that has noticed this, but the technology landscape around us is rapidly changing. And so, that means there's an opportunity for us in our post integration era as we plot the next chapter to think about recrafting our company, taking advantage of the technologies that are now available to us to become much more deeply data informed, much more AI-enabled, much more digital first, those kinds of things. And so we're -- that's taking up a lot of our team's time and attention now to reimagine how can we create a business model that really creates a fantastic experience for each customer individually, but at the same time is more efficient to operate and that's where we have ambitions. David Barden : Thank you. Mike Sievert : Okay. Jud, where do we go now? Jud Henry : Next question, please, operator. Operator : Certainly. Our next question is from the line of Kannan Venkateshwar with Barclays. Please go ahead. Kannan Venkateshwar : Thank you. So Mike, I just wanted to push you a little more on the capital allocation [indiscernible]. When we think about the broadband business in the next couple of years, you'll probably be either the number three or the number four biggest player in broadband. And that could either mean that you need more capacity spectrum or get an opportunity to update to the fiber. And then, of course, there is the opportunity -- I mean, [indiscernible] to maybe expand [indiscernible] So think about it mix over the next few quarters, but if we were to look at a wider lens over the next few [indiscernible] could you help us think through how you evaluate some of these opportunities longer term in terms of both fiber as well as these asset [indiscernible]? Thanks. Mike Sievert : Yes. Thank you. And I'm really sorry, your line is really garbled. And so I'm going to paraphrase what I think you're asking, but we really couldn't hear the words. I apologize. I think you're asking about longer term, how do we think about playing in the broadband space. I made comments about wireless over the next year and kind of how we think in the immediate term about fiber, but what do we see as the bigger picture, especially given the finite nature of capacity in the wireless space. And I'd say we haven't taken decisions about that. We are interested in whether or not there are techniques that are capital efficient that could extend the capacity and competitiveness of wireless into the future. And we've not yet cracked the code on that. But our team is working hard on that to see whether there are techniques that would work to do that, and that would be -- that would support a business model where we could make a fair return. So we're hard at work on that. We're hard at work executing our current strategy centered around mid-band spectrum and competing ambitiously towards that high single-digit target that we had talked about. And that seems to be very much on track. And then as we said, we're interested in fiber. And to the premise of your question, fiber is a technology for the decades. And that's not lost on us. We know that fiber will serve households and businesses a long time from now. And we also are rapidly, I think, gaining confidence that our brand and our team belong in the broadband space. That being said, we don't have an interest right now in changing the basic capital structure of this company nor the philosophy of it nor the centricity we have around wireless. And so we're looking for ways that we can, over the next couple of years, continue to learn, continue to expand, bring our brand to fiber through partnerships, through capital-light methods, investments, collaborations, those kinds of things. And they won't all be as small probably as the small pilots we're doing now. We may get after it little more significantly because our confidence is building in the space. And then -- and I know you want a longer-term vision for it, but I think we go do that for a couple of years and get good at it and execute and prove we can give returns and also get through some of that initial capital intensity period and then kind of see where we are. What this team is very focused on is making sure that the efforts that we embark on, on your behalf, deliver a great return back to you. And we're in this phase now in wireless where we're starting to realize the benefits of a disciplined strategy that has balanced growth and profitability so well over the last few years that we are now into a major shareholder return phase. And we think that's a great place to be. Kannan Venkateshwar : Thank you, Mike. Mike Sievert : You bet. And I'm sorry, we couldn't hear your question as well. I hope I got close. Jud Henry : Operator, next question, please. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Michael Rollins with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Michael Rollins : Thanks and good morning. First on the capital investment side. Can you discuss a little bit more over the course of the year, what were the activities that drove the incremental investment? And maybe you can give us an early read on how 2024 looks from an investment perspective and how those spending activity may be similar or different to the current year? And then just one other quick question. In the past, you discussed the mix of postpaid phones to overall postpaid net adds, I think being around 50% for 2023. But in the third quarter, that percentage ticked up because of the educational sector deactivations. So just curious if you can give us an update on how you're thinking about the mix of postpaid phones within the total postpaid net add guidance? Thanks. Mike Sievert : Okay. Let's start with the easy one at the end because I think you gave some specific numbers there, Peter. But then if you don't mind, why don't you talk about our capital philosophy for next year, and then I'll hand it to Ulf to talk about how he's going to spend all that money. Peter Osvaldik : Very wisely, as he always does. Yes. You're right, Mike. Q3 was kind of a unique phenomenon, which is why we gave more specific guidance as to the subset of the overall that will be postpaid phone, the approximately $3 million total for the year. And that's because Q3 in and of itself is kind of that period where we anticipated more of these educational deacts to come through and they did. So I wouldn't read through Q3's mix of phone to other, but really take it in the context of what we gave with regards to the $3 million overall for the year. And turning into everybody's teasing out 2024 guidance from me. But as we hand it over to Ulf to talk about how the investments have been made and how the shift is really into this customer-driven coverage, very data-driven, informed build to make sure that we're focused on where the best ROI is, where the best customer experience benefits will come, we've seen a lot of benefit from that. The way we're able to deliver you just saw with 300 million POPs delivered and yet we are the most capital-efficient company in the industry. And so when you turn to 2024, we continue to believe that that's really the mechanism that's going to drive capital investment, particularly with regards to the network. And so, I could see us maybe -- we gave a 9 to 10 as a range for 2024 previously. I could see us probably being on the lower end of that. We'll see what transpires in the longer term. But that's kind of the early read on where we think 2024 could land. Mike Sievert : Yes. And I want to hand it to Ulf and team and Neville before him. We have really built thanks Ulf to your leadership, a really different approach on how to deploy capital. And it is lean, it's efficient, it's planful. And we're realizing real benefits from that right now. And we can see it in all of our diagnostics, how we're getting more for less. And so, I'm just really, really proud of that. And maybe we can talk about what the priorities are for 2024. And as a part of that, we can also hit tech life channel at Tech Life 32, congrats on the 300 million. What's the progress on the new site builds 10-K we had talked about in the merger plan. Will that complete this year? Or will that run into 2024? And tell us about the capital priorities for the network next year. Ulf Ewaldsson : Yes. Thanks, Mike. And I couldn't be more delighted that we were able to pull into the station months ahead on this 300 million POP coverage. And as you said, Mike, it's very much attributed to how we do this. We do this different from other operators in the world. I would say, with our lean just-in-time process, which is focused on lead times and deliveries of precise upgrades where we need them on the ground. And that's why we were able to pull in on that. We will continue to refine this process. And now it's becoming with the teams much more of having input from AI, from all the data we have, from the market on precisely what the biggest and best returns on investments are as we continue to build and upgrade the network. We have a lot of room to run that was said earlier here in terms of putting frequencies to work in our mid-band, the mid-band that actually creates this enormous experience, the Un-carrier -- sorry, Ultra Capacity on the phone that you see with the UC. That experience, we will continue to enhance. Let me remind everybody that we got our C-band left and we got 3.45 left, for example. Those will need capital next year, and we're looking into a precise deployment of those. But we also have more LTE spectrum, as we said earlier, to put at work, more 600 with a current or a newly announced lease with Comcast that we are putting to work as well. But those actually don't need capital because we have smartly built this network in a way that we can just with commands upgrade the network to make use of those into next year. So a very effective year in terms of staying very competitive, being staying ahead of others a couple of years as we are on our 5G advantage with capital efficiency. Mike Sievert : That's fantastic. And I know every company is being asked, how are you taking advantage of emerging AI technologies and it's really exciting that this is one of the areas where our business can benefit because the team has already begun making capital deployment decisions, as Ulf just said, based on an AI analysis of network usage and how it correlates to individual churn and satisfaction patterns at a person-by-person level. It's very exciting stuff. And that, and many other things, including the breadth of our portfolio, lead to a capital efficiency profile. So we'll see. I know Peter teased you, we don't know. It's not time to guide on next year yet. But our hope is that because of that capital efficiency and what we're now seeing, we may be able to accomplish everything we set out to accomplish next year at the lower end of that capital range. So we'll see and we'll give you an updated view as we get into next year. Michael Rollins : Thanks. Mike Sievert : You bet. Jud Henry : All right. Yes, lots of congratulatory on social on 300 million. So great job, Ulf. All right, operator, let's take our last question from the phone. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Greg Williams with TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Greg Williams : Great. Thanks for squeezing me in. I know the industry has asked this question for quite some time, but you just had 850,000 phone adds. You're the third [indiscernible] solid phone growth. Cable's going to announce their numbers in the next 48 hours. But just getting your latest thoughts on where these additional phones are coming from and how you see industries for growth playing out in 2024? Second question is just on private networks. One of your competitors spoke yesterday saying that perhaps private networks could move the needle in 2025. We've been down this road before. But you talked constructively on advancing 5G in the past and curious this year you're seeing similar views on 2025 for private network? Thanks. Mike Sievert : I mean, well, first of all, let's start there. I mean, for some competitors with standalone 5G capabilities, private network are here now. We're just aren't managing it through press release and vaporware. We're just quietly serving customers. Maybe, I don't know if you want to talk about any of those, Callie, that we're doing. There's a lot of exciting examples nationwide. Customers who are benefiting from this today at T-Mobile, and then we'll get to your second question. Callie Field : Well, I mentioned this earlier, Mike. And when we think about the challenges ahead of CIOs today, they're looking for ways to take a campus, like Boston Children's Hospital that I mentioned before and take the millions of connections with WiFi and say, hey, we've got to have something that meets the needs of the data and the connectivity in our business. And so we have a very real-time example in the health care industry and several more that we're building out that are allowing doctors and nurses and their patients to have reliable connectivity, but also with security and MDM solutions. Another thing that we -- is real for us today is the first commercial offering of a network slice that will deliver an incremental layer of security and control for our customers, combined with T-Sim Secure, which is a SIM-based [SaaS] (ph) solution, reducing complexity for IT administrators. So we're able to take these solutions and pair that with a hybrid 5G network solutions, sometimes in parts of the campus private, some parts utilizing the incredible public network that we have. So these are very real deployments today that have significant pull-through on other types of connectivity that we offer and really meet the challenges that CIOs are looking for, not to cut off a couple of dollars on a phone connection, but to really look at their entire solution for data and connectivity, and that's where we're playing because of the 5G standalone core that we have. Mike Sievert : I mean, it's well timed because CIOs are interested in secure connections more than ever before, and they're interested in saving money, not necessarily on a per smartphone subscription, but broadly in their system of connectivity and our solutions do that. And so it's great to see and obviously an all-time record quarter for enterprise for us. And then you asked about the overall postpaid phone growth rate. And yes, it's turned out to be more resilient than a lot of people predicted. We didn't predict. We told you when you asked us last year that we weren't going to predict the whole category. But overall, postpaid phone growth continues to roll on, although at slightly more modest rates. And there's lots of things driving that. You see enterprises carrying two lines, sometimes on the same phone, sometimes on separate phones. You see postpaid growing at the expense of prepaid. That trend continues, although T-Mobile continues to grow our prepaid base across all types of connections. So we continue to lead in that space. All the donations are coming from someplace else. And then what I called in the past kind of low-calorie net adds that you see principally at some of our competitors, including newer competitors. And thank you for giving me the opportunity to go ahead and pre-announce cable's results for them as I usually do. No, I'm kidding. We do have telemetry that tries to show us all quarter long what's happening with our competitors and I think it's a remarkably consistent trend. So you see intense competition out there, probably not a lot of big surprises. And you saw us perform yet again with a market-leading, very high-quality, mostly prime 850,000 postpaid phone net additions in a quarter where we experienced an all-time record Q3 churn. So just really proud of how we're competing in an ongoing competitive dynamic. Jud Henry : All right. That's a good place to wrap up. All right. Thanks, everybody, for joining us. Really appreciate all your support. And if you have any further questions, please feel free to reach out to both the Investor Relations or the media relations department. Again, thanks again for joining us today. Operator : This concludes the T-Mobile Third Quarter Earnings Call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect, and have a pleasant day.",

[Operator Instructions] You may also submit a question via X by sending a tweet to @TMobileIR or @MikeSievert using the $TMUS. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jud Henry, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations for T-Mobile US. Please go ahead, sir. Jud Henry : All right. Welcome to T-Mobile's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Earnings Call. Joining me on the call today are Mike Sievert, our President and CEO; Peter Osvaldik, our CFO; and as well as other members of the senior leadership team. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. We provide a comprehensive list of risk factors in our SEC filings, which I encourage you to review. Our earnings release, investor fact book and other documents related to our results, as well as reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP results discussed on this call can be found in the Quarterly Results section of the Investor Relations website. With that, let's get it over to Mike to tell us about our results. Mike Sievert : Thanks, Jud. Welcome, everybody. As you can see, if you're viewing online, I'm here with a good cross-section of our senior team once again. We're coming to you today from Bellevue, Washington and looking forward to a great discussion. But first, I'd like to take a moment to reflect on a historic year for T-Mobile and the exciting momentum that we bring into 2024. '23 was another year for T-Mobile of industry-leading growth in both customers and key financials, including all-time record results across many metrics. It was also a year where T-Mobile became established as the overall network leader. Built on our extensive advantages in 5G. And it was the year that we effectively completed the biggest arguably the most successful telecommunications merger integration in the world, delivering synergies bigger and faster than even our own ambitious goals and doing it while also accelerating 5G investment in this country to the benefit of consumers and businesses. Our remarkably consistent, best value best network strategy, delivered industry-leading postpaid phone net additions of 3.1 million in 2023. This was driven by our highest postpaid phone gross adds in company history, up 2% for the year and up 6% in Q4. And by our lowest postpaid phone churn in company history for the year. Our net adds essentially matched our great results from '22 despite industry postpaid phone net adds decreasing year-over-year. You know what that means? It means that our unique formula enabled us to take a higher share of postpaid phone net adds than a year ago. In fact, '23 was our highest share of postpaid phone net adds since the merger, showing the ongoing durability of our differentiated strategy. And we finished the year on a high note, with Q4 postpaid phone net adds of 934,000 highest in the industry by a wide margin, and we did it with rising ARPA, up almost 2% delivering industry-leading growth in postpaid service revenue and core EBITDA in Q4 while also nearly doubling our adjusted free cash flow. Let's talk about Broadband. We added over 2.1 million customers in '23, our biggest growth year yet with more net new customers than the other largest providers combined, as our product just continues to resonate in the market. And we finished strong with 541,000 nets in Q4, making us one of the largest ISPs in the nation with 4.8 million customers and counting at year-end. At T-Mobile, our network is the key enabler of our growth, not only for the success that we've had to date, but also for years to come. I predicted years ago that our well-established 5G leadership would eventually translate into overall network leadership, and that was proven loud and clear in 2023. By leading third parties like Ookla and OpenSignal, time and again, with T-Mobile sweeping every category of their test for overall network performance. Listen, it boils down to this. T-Mobile has the broadest and the deepest and the most advanced 5G network in the US today. And we have the assets and capabilities to further extend our network leadership in '24 and beyond. Okay. One final network point, we recently celebrated a pivotal moment in our ground-breaking alliance with SpaceX. By kicking off testing of direct satellite to cellular communications, our teams are really excited about what's coming. Let me just remind you of one thing. Our network leadership still isn't yet fully recognized by millions of network seekers who are still potential future customers for T-Mobile. And yet that same network leadership is already driving our strong win share, particularly in underpenetrated areas like enterprise and government and also in smaller markets and rural areas in our consumer business. Let me just double-click on that growth momentum. T-Mobile for Business, delivered the highest postpaid phone net adds in company history in 2023. And we exited the year with great momentum, with Q4 being our highest quarterly net adds ever. Meanwhile, in our Consumer Group, we continued to grow our share of households, both in smaller markets and rural areas where we are well on our way to our 2025 targets and even in the top 100 markets, where we grew our share year-over-year on the strength of our network and our compelling value proposition. We're executing our balanced growth playbook with great and consistent success. And the best part is we still have a lot of room to run. All of this added up to delivering the highest consolidated service revenue growth in the industry in '23. And it was an industry that continues to grow service revenues and cash flows while simultaneously seeing customers win from healthy competition that delivers more value and better networks. On that all-important postpaid service revenue metric, we delivered 6% growth in 2023, way above our next closest competitor. That growth led to core adjusted EBITDA growth of over 10% and free cash flow growth of nearly 80%. All of this enables our substantial stockholder return model, which has returned $17 billion to stockholders so far through the end of '23, including our first-ever quarterly dividend in Q4. Now Peter will share our guidance with you in a moment. But the short version is this. We see continued strong customer and revenue growth, translating into rapid growth in cash flows in 2024 and beyond, and supporting our ambitious plans for shareholder returns that we've already shared with you. Before I wrap up, because this is a year-end report, I want to touch on some of the ways we're building a connected world where everyone can thrive. We believe reliable and affordable wireless and internet service is a necessity for all in today's highly connected and digital world. And that's why we are so proud to have connected nearly 6 million students. And provided $6.4 billion in products and services so far under our flagship initiative Project 10Million and our other education initiatives. We've also partnered with Welcome.US to provide service through Metro by T-Mobile to refugees entering the US as part of a multiyear commitment of 200,000 lines. It is difficult to imagine restarting a new life in a new country, without the connectivity that most of us take for granted. We are also working hard to create a more sustainable future, and we are proud to be the first US wireless provider to commit to achieving net zero emissions across our entire carbon footprint by 2040 using SBTi's net-zero standard. All right. Let me just wrap up with why I am so excited about what's ahead. We are now entering a period of tremendous value creation at T-Mobile, driven by ongoing growth leadership and having -- and by having completed both a historic merger and a massive 5G network build that are foundational to unlocking the cash flow potential of this business. Our network is now a differentiated competitive advantage that complements our well-established value leadership. This unique and powerful formula means that our significant growth and value creation opportunities only continue to scale, and they have lots of room to run. As we enter 2024 with momentum, I could not be more proud of this team and of our employees who remind us every day that it's better over here at T-Mobile. All right, Peter, over to you to talk about our key financial highlights as well as our 2024 guidance. Peter Osvaldik : All right. Well, thank you, Mike. As you can see, our 2023 results highlighted our strong execution and accelerating our merger integration while leveraging our network leadership and fame for value to deliver industry-leading growth in both traditional postpaid and broadband customers. Our Land and Expand strategy also led to industry-leading growth in postpaid account net adds as well as ARPA growth of 1.3%. Before I jump into our guidance, I would also like to take a moment to note a couple of items impacting our Q4 earnings per share. In December of 2023, we issued 48.8 million shares to SoftBank as the 45-day VWAP of our stock price reached the threshold price under the letter agreement from 2020. This obviously increased our share count, which impacted our diluted EPS and as it is treated as if those shares had been issued for the full quarter. We expect that dilution to be more than offset by our ongoing share repurchases in 2024. We also accelerated depreciation on certain technology assets in Q4 and would anticipate a year-over-year increase in depreciation and amortization of approximately $500 million to $1 billion in full year 2024, as we continue to modernize our network and technology systems and platforms. Mike already highlighted our best-in-class growth in both the top line and the bottom line and how our industry-leading conversion of service revenue to free cash flow continues to differentiate T-Mobile. So let me jump into how we expect that growth to continue in 2024. Starting with customers. We expect total postpaid net customer additions to be between 5 million and 5.5 million the same starting guidance as last year, reflecting continued focus on profitable growth as we execute our differentiated strategy even while expecting total industry net additions to moderate. This assumes roughly half of postpaid net adds will be phones. And the guidance also assumes the final portion of deactivations of our lower ARPU postpaid other data devices in the education sector with most of that impact already having been accelerated into the second half of 2023. As we noted last quarter, we had always anticipated many of these connections, which supported educational institutions through the pandemic would roll off as the emergency connectivity program wound down and things return to normal. Turning to core adjusted EBITDA. We expect it to be between $31.3 billion and $31.9 billion up nearly 9% year-over-year at the midpoint and above the midpoint of our Capital Markets Day guidance for 2024. This is three times the growth rate of peers and a year-over-year dollar increase comparable to what we delivered in 2023 despite no material incremental merger synergy benefits in 2024. Our sustained growth represents the power of our industry-leading service revenue growth, the operating leverage of our profitable growth model and the opportunity to continue to drive operating efficiencies in the business. We would expect slightly different shaping across the quarters now that we are past the integration. For example, we would expect slightly less sequential improvement from Q4 2023 to Q1 of this year than we saw last year as we achieved full run rate synergies in Q4 2023 and no longer have that as an incremental sequential factor as we had in past Q4 to Q1 progressions. We would expect the operating leverage and efficiencies to drive EBITDA this year to build throughout the year, layered against the seasonal trends of the business. We expect cash CapEx to be between $8.6 billion and $9.4 billion as we deliver a capital efficiency unmatched in the industry on the back of our network integration and 5G leadership. Our pull forward of CapEx into 2022 and 2023 has provided us with a broad multilayer 5G network on which we can now deploy additional spectrum for capacity across those existing radios without material incremental CapEx required. Our capital-efficient and data-informed customer-driven coverage approach guides us as we continue to enhance and further expand our network. Our expectations for free cash flow, including payments for merger-related costs is in the range of $16.3 billion to $16.9 billion. This is up approximately 22% over last year at the midpoint and five times the expected growth rate of our next closest competitor. Thanks to our margin expansion and capital efficiency and does not assume any material net cash inflows from securitization, and this also represents a free cash flow to service revenue margin multiple percentage points higher than peers. We expect Q1 free cash flow to be approximately 20% of that full year midpoint given several items that fall early in the year. First, we expect Q1 to be the peak CapEx quarter at probably 30% of the full year midpoint of the CapEx guidance I just shared with you. Second, we expect approximately half of the $600 million to $700 million of anticipated full year '24 cash merger-related costs to be in Q1. Third, we have cash severance for workforce actions taken late last year or if the monthly payments to Cogent following the Wireline sale will taper after April. And finally, there are working capital seasonality elements coming off the higher holiday sales period. And finally, as we continue to execute our strategy of winning and expanding account relationships, we expect full year postpaid ARPA to be up approximately 2% in 2024. Further acceleration of the growth we saw in 2023. In closing, we expect '24 to be another year of profitable growth as we continue to extend our network leadership and further scale our differentiated growth opportunities. We expect this to continue to translate into industry-leading growth in service revenue, core adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow delivering the highest free cash flow margin in the industry to unlock shareholder value. I couldn't be more excited about the continued enormous value creation opportunity that we have in front of us for years to come. And with that, I will now turn the call back to Jud to begin the Q&A. Jud? Jud Henry : All right. Let's get to your questions. You can ask a question via phone by pressing star then one and via X by sending a tweet to @TMobileIR or @MikeSievert using $TMUS. We'll start with a question on the phone. Operator first question please. Operator : The first question is from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Simon Flannery : Great. Thank you very much. I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more update on where you are on some of the smaller markets in terms of your market share gain and how that's factoring into your guide for this year and the same sort of thing for enterprise and government? And where are we in that status? And perhaps on fixed wireless, it was a strong result despite some seasonality. Where are you in terms of exploring additional capacity options on a cost-effective manner? Thanks. Mike Sievert : Okay. Let's start with smaller markets and rural areas. Jon, why don't you jump in? Jon Freier : Yes, you bet. Hi, Simon. I'm just delighted with what's happening here in smaller markets and rural areas. I've been talking to all of you about this since our Analyst Day event back in March of 2021. And back in that time, we were at a 13% share of household position. And we set this incredibly ambitious goal to get to 20% by the end of the year 2025 across the entire segment, which, by the way, is 140 million people, 40% of the US, about 50 million households. And I updated you last time when we, during our Q3 earnings report about our share-taking progress in those markets and some of the really good results that we're seeing. And I'm pleased to tell you that, we've now arrived at a share of household position in smaller markets of rural areas of about 17.5%. And so I'm really, really pleased by that. And the last time I talked to you about this was about nine months ago, and we were at 16.5%, so a full percentage point since that time. And when you look at what we're doing with the 5G network build that Ulf and his team have been doing the distribution expansion and bringing this incredible marketing infrastructure out to smaller markets and rural areas. People are just loving what we're doing. We're having a lot of fun doing it. And I got to tell you that it looks like we're really in a place where we can achieve that 20% goal by 2025 based on where we are, but I'm really more excited and I think the more compelling opportunity is what we can do beyond the 20%. I don't have anything to tell you about right here right now about that. But I tell you, I'm getting really excited about what we can be doing beyond this 20% goal as you think about our continued velocity in these particular markets. Mike Sievert : Absolutely. Great, Jon. And also on Fixed Wireless, the product is just really resonating. Maybe Mike, you can say what, some of the things that we're doing is to respond to this ongoing growth and the acceptance of the product in the marketplace. Michael Katz : Yes. I mean one thing that is kind of just amazing when you look back at it, we've essentially been in the market with our Fixed Wireless product for two years. And in two years, we've gone from a launch product to what you saw at the end of Q4, which is nearly 5 million customers on Fixed Wireless, making us one of the largest ISPs in America with a product that still leads versus every other industry in customer satisfaction. So we're really proud of what's been built here and continued momentum. We saw gross adds this year, the highest they've ever been. So we have a lot of demand for this product. And so one of the decisions you saw us recently take was reverting back to our standard pricing in our Fixed Wireless product. We've been so moving away from our promotional pricing that we've been on for the last two years to our standard pricing which we put into market earlier this month. And we think that still offers the best value inside the broadband business and the best experience as demonstrated by the NPS scores that I just talked about. So we think there's still room to grow in HSI. We still, with a 5 million customer base still runway in front of us to grow both in new customers but also in services. We think having a 5 million customer broadband base gives us the opportunity to bring more services into the home, which the team is actively exploring. Mike Sievert : And then finally, Simon and not to steal your thunder off just to make the short version. We haven't drawn any new conclusions versus what we previously told you about possible models. Beyond this initial capital light model that we have for high-speed Internet. As you know, our forecast all along have said that model takes us to 7 million to 8 million subscribers. We're well on our way. We'll monitor that as we get closer. And we got a lot of time left. So stay tuned if we're able to provide you with an update on that in the future, but no update today. Simon Flannery : All right. Thank you. Mike Sievert : All right, Simon. Jud Henry : Operator, next question please. Operator : The next question is from Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead. Mike Sievert : Hi, Craig. Craig Moffett : Yeah, hi. Thank you. You just talked about the pricing of FWA and the move to your standard pricing. I wonder if you could just talk about the outlook for pricing of your mobile service as well? How do you see ARPU playing out over the course of 2024? And there's been a lot of talk that we're in a market where prices are rising generally should we sort of think about baking that into our expectations for the coming year? Mike Sievert : Thanks, Craig. A couple of things. First of all, you heard Peter guide a confident guide on 2% growth in ARPA on the year. And that's terrific to see. And obviously, there's this ongoing trend that customers who buy T-Mobile can't get enough of it, and they're moving up our rate card. And that's great to see. So we're in a great spot. And before I say more about what opportunities we might see, I'll remind everybody listening that we're in an era of unprecedented value that consumers and businesses are realizing from this category generally. I've mentioned previously that typically today across the category, not just at T-Mobile, customers are getting three times more data than just five years ago. And at four times greater speeds industry-wide than five years ago. So there's tremendous value being given to customers in this category and if there are ways for us to find optimizations in terms of how we deliver that enormous value so that we can be more competitive and more efficient at how we operate including looking in our rate card and looking at our rate plans and looking at our policies and procedures, we'll find those opportunities. Q4, we took some of those opportunities. We found a more efficient way to handle auto pay discounts with our customers and fully put that through the base throughout Q4, and that's an important optimization. Right now, taking a lead from Netflix as they've changed their portfolio, we've made changes to the Netflix benefits that we give, which have been well accepted by customers. So there's a theme here. We may find optimizations, but we will be guided by a couple of things. One, what customers accept and appreciate because that's really important. And number two, we have no intentions of sacrificing our brand position as the value leader in terms of what you get for what you pay in this marketplace. That's always been a differentiator for us, and we will defend that jealously. But I'd tell you, there's opportunities that could be there in an era of unprecedented value being seen by consumers and businesses. And if we can take those and meet those guidelines that I've laid out, we'll do so. Peter Osvaldik : Yes. And Craig, with respect to ARPU, I mean, as we've talked about multiple times, it's very much a mix-driven metric. And on the consumer side, we have seen continued growth in ARPU. Now that's offset with some of the success and tremendous value creation that we've had in enterprise and government. Those are obviously lower ARPU customers with high CLVs, larger ARPAs. And so that's why the focus on one, the customer value differential that we're bringing and our ARPA playbook, we believe is the right way to go, and you can see that demonstrated in what we delivered in 2023 and Q4 from a postpaid service revenue perspective, that's where you're kind of focused in with postpaid ARPU. And frankly, what we see from a service revenue opportunity in 2024 is even larger percentage growth than what we delivered in 2023. So more than the 3.1% full year growth we'll see in '24 despite, of course, some slight ongoing headwinds in wholesale with the offset of TracFone and other carriers. So we couldn't be more excited about this is the right playbook that delivers the most value creation in the industry. Craig Moffett : Thank you. Jud Henry : All right. Next question. Operator : The next question is from Jonathan Chaplin from New Street. Please go ahead. Jonathan Chaplin : Thanks, guys. Actually just a few sort of housekeeping questions actually. I'm wondering if you can give us what the number of ACP subs in your bases and whether you're sort of anticipating using some of those if the benefit goes away? And how that sort of factored into guidance? And then ditto on bonus depreciation. If bonus depreciation gets extended, how would that impact your free cash flow guidance? Thanks so much. Mike Sievert : I'll start on ACP, and I hand it to Peter to finish on ACP and take the bonus depreciation question. When it comes to the number of subscribers in our reported base, it's substantially none. There's a very, very small amount of Metro customers, and that's it. So it's constrained to our Assurance Wireless business, which is not reported as subscribers and to our wholesale business. And as it relates to ACP and what's happening to it, obviously, that's in motion. You may have noticed that our EBITDA guide was a tiny bit wider this year. I would tell you that all the outcomes that we see for ACP are fully embedded in the guide that we gave you on EBITDA. And look, our risk profile around ACP is a little different than, say, a broadband company. They went very big into it, committed lots of customers and numbers to it. And also, I think one subscribers that may or may not stick around. Mobile is different. Mobile is a product that customers will keep. And if they lose that discount our job, and I think our team is up to the task is to go win them over with our high-value offers. And we have some of the best brands in the space with incredible value propositions. And as other wireless providers see the same thing happen, we will get after it and position our brands as the place that those people land. So there's a risk profile around it for T-Mobile, but I think much smaller than with other players, and it's fully embedded in the guidance. That's that, I'll let Peter pick up there as well as talk about the bonus depreciation. Peter Osvaldik : Yes. And just housekeeping wise, again, we don't participate in ACP on the postpaid side. We have a little immaterial amount through Metro and the rest, Assurance isn't reported in our subscriber counts and of course, wholesale customers are not either. So that's it with respect to ACP. And on bonus depreciation, look, we're continuing to monitor the developments. And of course, we're very supportive of a tax regime that stimulates investment into the network into US leadership on this front. With regards to '24, we're not anticipating to be a significant cash taxpayer, so it wouldn't impact the guide for 2024. And we'll see where it goes. And of course, as it develops, we could update you later in the year for outer years. Jonathan Chaplin : Awesome. Thanks, guys. Operator : The next question is from John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead. Mike Sievert : Hi, John. John Hodulik : Hey, thanks, guys. Hey, good afternoon. Hey, if we could talk a little bit about competition, that would be great, I guess, from, we can take it from both sides. First, from a gross adds standpoint, you guys saw some acceleration in phone gross adds. Quarter-to-quarter. So just what you're seeing in terms of sort of competitive offers in the market in the fourth quarter and maybe into the first quarter. And then on the other side, churn ticked up for after the first time in a while, I think. So what's potentially driving that in terms of postpaid phone churn? And do you expect it to that to remain elevated or keep moving in that direction? Or what should we expect there? Thanks. Mike Sievert : I'll start on churn and maybe hand it to Mike on competition. Churn was up 9 basis points sequentially. And if you look at the last several years since we completed the merger from Q3 to Q4, the average is 10 basis points sequentially. So it's right in line, maybe even a little better than past sequential moves. Our business tends to be seasonal, with Q4 being a higher time period of churn. And that being said I was really pleased with getting the 9 basis points given some of the optimizations that were fully implemented in Q4 that I mentioned in response to an earlier question. Look, there's no question in my mind that we are on a journey towards the best churn in this industry. And that's because we have the best value and the best network and a history of being able to treat customers with respect. And so we'll find that journey making its way. '24 is going to be an interesting year because as I mentioned earlier, there are optimizations across the board that we may find are in our best interest to take. As long as they don't put at risk, our superior value proposition as long as there are things that will be well accepted or even appreciated by customers. And so I can't give you specifics on the guide. I can tell you that with this churn, 9 basis points higher sequentially, we delivered a big beat in postpaid net additions on phones of 934,000, bigger than we guided even during the middle of the quarter. And so we're very comfortable with the formula. And we're comfortable with the formula in part because competition has been remarkably consistent. I'll let Mike talk about what we're seeing. Michael Katz : Yes. This has always been a really competitive environment in the industry and dynamic and competitive. And honestly, that's the way we like it. For us, when there's lots of competition and customers are looking around shopping, T-Mobile ends up being the net winner. And you see that both in '23 with, and in Q4, specifically with T-Mobile having the highest share of net adds. And you saw it consistently throughout the year with the account growth that T-Mobile posted, which was highest by far in the industry. What we saw in Q4, I would describe as generally consistent with what we saw last year. Offers were pretty much the same, very aggressive, but pretty consistent with previous year. I think what's been different is the way that T-Mobile or what's evolved, maybe I should say, is the way that T-Mobile competes. Mike and Peter both talked about this value proposition we have of best value, which historically has always been the thing that T-Mobile has owned. And then more recently developed the best network. And those two things together really creates a unique value proposition that's unmatched in the industry and is resonating with customers. You saw it again in Q4, and you continue to see us enhance it as we did this year with the launch of the Go5G plans the launch of Phone Freedom, which in a shopping time like Q4 as customers are looking to upgrade, we think, really resonated, and you saw it in the net add performance. John Hodulik : Okay. Thanks, guys. Mike Sievert : You bet. Thanks, John. Jud Henry : Thanks, John. Next question please. Operator : The next question is from Michael Rollins with Citi. Please go ahead. Michael Rollins : Thanks. Good afternoon. Just two questions, if I could. First, when you look at the core EBITDA margin profile, are you still targeting to get to a margin at or above 50%? And how do you see the pacing to get there? And then second, was there anything specific that influence the pace of share buyback dollars, I think it was down a little bit year-over-year, down sequentially and maybe put that into the context of your current capital return goals that you highlighted a few months back. Thanks. Mike Sievert : All right. Let's start with core EBITDA and core EBIDTA margin. Peter? Peter Osvaldik : All right. Well, Mike, certainly, our long-run aspiration is to continue to see margin expansion in core EBITDA. But much like you see us focus really, the primary focus here is to continue to be the leader and continue expanding in our ability to deliver free cash flow margin relative to service revenue because that takes out all the noise of relative differentials and how P&Ls are recognized, backhaul, et cetera, and really provides a true color for value creation. And that's where we're already in a leadership position and continue to see more expansion opportunity there. Mike Sievert : Great. And you obviously saw us in Q4 take some investments to make sure that we could have a beat on customers and revenues, and that's just helping with our confident guide in 2024. So when we see opportunities like that, we take them. We've talked with you many times about that in the past. Second question was about share buybacks. What happened in Q4? There was a little bit of a slowdown. What are we seeing now? What do people expect? Peter Osvaldik : Naturally, Mike, I think what you saw was a little bit of a tapering. We're not going to talk about day-to-day dynamics, but a little bit of a tapering of the share buyback program. As we were nearing that issuance and that trigger point of the SoftBank share. So we're past that now. I think we're confident in our ability to deliver what we've signed up for here, which is another incremental up to $16 billion currently authorized in share buybacks and dividends for 2024 and pacing towards that. Michael Rollins : Thanks. Peter Osvaldik : You bet. Thanks, Mike. Operator : The next question is from Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Eric Luebchow : Appreciate it. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe I just wanted to touch on the cost side of the business. I know you mentioned you're at your target merger synergy run rate and you had the head count reduction earlier this year. What other initiatives are on the table to kind of help you keep moving leverage up in the business, either on the technology side in distribution of small markets or anything else that you could comment on? Thank you. Mike Sievert : Yes, I'll just start by kind of reminding everybody that, as Peter already pointed out, the '24 guide at the midpoint is higher than our earlier Capital Markets Day guide, and it's 9% year-over-year, which is three times the expectation of our peers. And so it's really terrific to see this business scaling and without the incremental year-over-year benefit of big expansions and synergies, that's mostly behind us almost entirely. And so that's really great to see. It obviously comes from ongoing progression of valuable customers, some of the best customers with the best payment records in the industry as well as efficiencies that we can see in how we run the business. Peter Osvaldik : Yes. And on to that, as we said, a big part of this is also the service revenue growth leadership that we anticipate, that we expect to increase in 2024 on a growth basis relative to '23. And then there's, it's across the business. I mean we've made tremendous investments as we are expanding the network as we are expanding distribution. We're reaping some of that. But make no mistake, this is a very scrappy team that's looking at not only just currently where can you continue to drive efficiencies. But how do you take advantage the network modernization of technology modernization of all the buzzwords that you hear these days around AI and other things, but how do you do it in an uncarrier fashion with the customer at the center of it while driving efficiencies out of the business. So we see a lot of room to run here over a multiyear arc on this front. Eric Luebchow : Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Bryan Kraft with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Bryan Kraft : Hi. Good afternoon. I had two, if I could. First, can you talk a little bit about your expectations for upgrade rates as they relate to this year's free cash flow guidance? Do you think these low upgrade rates we're seeing across the industry are going to begin to tick up anytime soon? And are you doing anything proactively in retention that might drive it up? And then separately, Mike, you mentioned that you're in testing with SpaceX on their device, direct-to-device solution. When you do get to the commercial deployment of the service. Just curious as to what your expectations are for the products capabilities for customers how it fits into the product set? And also, if you have any sense for how much of your base this feature or this capability is actually important too? Thank you. Mike Sievert : Terrific. Great. Well, let's start with upgrade rates. We don't see big catalysts for change here. Around the edges, there may be some, and we can talk about those. For example, we have a brand-new rate plan called Go5G Next, which offers upgrade benefits, could change it on the margin and other things. But generally speaking, people are keeping their phones longer. And they're doing that because the phones are very expensive, and they're very capable. For our customers, 75% of them have 5G phones that are able to take advantage of the vast majority of our advanced network capabilities that we already have implemented. And so those kinds of things are a great position to be in, and I don't think there's a big catalyst for change in 2024. As it relates to SpaceX, yes, we're really excited about it. And way back when we announced it, we talked about the capabilities, starting with text messaging, peer-to-peer text messaging, the ability to reach people if you can see the sky. We expected to cover the Continental US big parts of Alaska, big parts of the world's oceans and be able to allow you to stay in connection with your loved ones. That will progress into picture messaging and eventually talk and other capabilities. And the beta we expect if things go well, we should have these capabilities in customer hands this year. As it relates to who it appeals to, look, anybody that finds themselves on occasion in one of the 500,000 square miles in this country, not covered by any of the networks. And that's most of us. And so there's something about the peace of mind of knowing that if you can see the sky, generally speaking, you're connected. And that's our dream. That's the aspiration that we set out when we announced this partnership, and it's great to have the first satellites in the sky. Bryan Kraft : Thank you. Mike Sievert : You bet. Operator : The next question is from Kannan Venkateshwar with Barclays. Please go ahead. Kannan Venkateshwar : Thank you. Two, if I could. First is on Fixed Wireless. Earlier in the year, I guess, in '23, I think we all thought that the second derivative might slow down a little bit and in terms of growth rates, it might be closer to 500,000. But when we look at the second half of the year, it feels like there is still some second derivative growth left. And so it would be great to understand if this is demand driven or to some extent, as you open up spectrum and as your distribution channels become more efficient, this is more supply driven. So it would be good to understand the mix of what's driving that growth? And then secondly, on the ACP side, sorry, one more housekeeping question. I mean as you explained, I mean, it's not a big impact, and it's mostly on the wholesale side. But the general article today mentioned some of the wholesale providers and their exposures, which seemed pretty big, and I think some of them use your network. This is a high-margin revenue stream. So is there any way for us to understand if there is any time line around when we might see this. As you mentioned, it's not material. So maybe it doesn't matter in the full year scheme of things, but I don't know if it changes the cadence of EBITDA in any way? Mike Sievert : Okay. Great. We don't know whether it will be material. But we do know that, and are reasonably confident that it's fully embedded within all of the outcomes that we provided in our guidance range to you. But let's start with Fixed Wireless and go to Mike. And then Mike, if you want to transition to what we're seeing with ACP and Peter will probably pile on. Michael Katz : Yes. I think on the Fixed Wireless side, like I mentioned earlier, we've seen steady demand for this product since it's launched. And a lot of the things that you mentioned are absolutely true. Like our execution has gotten better. We have built more stores. So like we've got distribution closer to customers in areas like rural areas. There's more awareness of the product, both generally and the overall market but also within our base. All of those things certainly have been factors. I think the other big thing that's been a factor is churn. Because remember, the net additions are the difference between gross adds and the number of customers that churn. And we've seen a steady improvement with churn with HSI year-over-year, really across every single 10-year cohort. We knew that churn would come down as our base aged and got into later cohorts, which we see the later cohorts of customers in this churn at a rate that's pretty comparable with cable. We knew that churn would come down as our base age. But what's really exciting is as the product has improved itself and as the experience has improved and frankly, as our execution has improved, even the early 10-year cohort churn has started to reduce, and we've seen that consistently throughout the year. Peter Osvaldik : Yes. And I would just add on to that to your point, remember, we're well on our way to our 7 million to 8 million target and hence, some of the moves we made to really optimize value creation. And so I'd probably expect on a quarterly basis, nets might be in the 400,000 range is really what you need to get to that ambition, while creating more value given some of the promotional pricing that we've now pared back. On ACP, I think the important element is we'll see where it goes. But our anticipation with everything that Mike highlighted around the category itself is the outcomes inclusive of should ACP not continue on, is embedded in the core EBITDA guidance range that we provided as well as in our expectation that service revenue growth will be larger in full year '24 than 2023. So that's all embedded in the guidance that we provided. Kannan Venkateshwar : Thank you. Peter Osvaldik : All right. Operator : The next question is from Ric Prentiss with Raymond James & Associates. Please go ahead. Ric Prentiss : Thanks. Good afternoon. I want to follow along those same lines a little bit. Can you help us understand, obviously, track loads coming off maybe some DISH coming off on the wholesale side as well. How much magnitude should we be expecting wholesale might drop this year knowing that you have some ranges out there? Peter Osvaldik : Yes. We haven't specifically guided to that. And remember, we have a little bit of visibility given some of the MPGs, which do trail off with respect to DISH. But I'd expect a continued year-over-year sequential decline, but not a specific guide on wholesale. Mike Sievert : And that's obviously factored into the guidance that we've provided. Peter Osvaldik : Absolutely. Ric Prentiss : Right. And then any update on Mint? I think we're going on, what, 10, 11 months. And what is their position on ACP? Peter Osvaldik : Yes. So Mint, we anticipate Mint to close in Q1 and that is included in the guide itself. And of course, that will result once it does close and a little bit of service revenue and cost geography changes with minimal net impact to core EBITDA, as we talked about earlier. But all of that including ACP contemplation is considered in the guide that we gave. But it wouldn't be appropriate for me to speak specifically about Mint as we haven't closed yet. Ric Prentiss : And last one for me is, you talked a lot about your net adds doing strong service revenue, adjusted EBITDA, particularly versus the peer group. Will we ever hear you guys talk about EPS because clearly the peer group talk to EPS as well. I know you say there are some things that make it tough. But will there be some day where you think about talking to us about an EPS guide? Peter Osvaldik : Yes. I think that they will come. Obviously, we're still in this period in 2023, we had significant merger-related costs. We're going to have a little bit of merger-related costs in 2024, probably 150 in Q1 and 50 in Q2. But you are going to see us have more and more focus on EPS. And obviously, there was a couple, as I mentioned, a couple of catalysts, including the 48.8 million shares for Q4, but you'll see us more and more focused on EPS. Look, the margin expansion is going to flow into the bottom line. And you'll see us there. We're not quite there yet. Little bit more work to do with the merger-related costs and other things, but it's definitely something we keep an eye on, and it's important. Mike Sievert : And the shareholder return program that we have underway really helps with it overall. Despite this dilution event that we saw, the overall trend is anti-dilution as we retire shares through the program. So it's a good trend to be on. Ric Prentiss : Okay. Thanks. Jud Henry : All right. We've got a lot of activity on social. Janice, do you want to tell us what we're seeing? Janice Kapner : Yes. I think there's one we're seeing this theme in a few places. So I'll take this question. So first of all, congratulations on a great year. But could you provide more color on your enterprise business, especially beyond connectivity and revenue and traction? And I know we haven't really covered that yet. Jud Henry : Callie? Callie Field : Okay. Well, thanks, Janice. And let me just tell you we're in a different phase in our business? Last year, my leaders transformed the talent and activity of our sales team. And we've upgraded our product portfolio with solutions like T-SIM Secure and our connected workplace managed services with Cisco Meraki that we just announced yesterday. We've moved from transacting with lower-level procurement employees to sitting at the table with CIOs as their trusted partners for connectivity solutions. And also, business customers, as we talked about before, they test our network before purchasing. And what they find is the most modern, the most distributed nationwide tri-band 5G stand-alone commercially available for slicing network and they've determined its superiority. And all of this translates right back into our core business. So we delivered on our highest quarter and year ever in business postpaid phone net additions and gross adds. And our results outperformed our benchmark competitor once again. In enterprise, we delivered our highest win share rate with postpaid phone net additions. And our results allowed us to bring on new customers like SalesForce and REI and deepen our relationships with Delta, DoorDash Meta, UPS, just to name a few. And in the public sector, we drove double-digit growth in our new public safety accounts, especially with first responders who recognize that we at T-Mobile provide a more secure, prioritized connection over a faster and larger network. We continue to grow and compete successfully in small businesses, best quarter and year yet and saw positive porting trends versus both of our principal competitors in the third consecutive quarter in a row. So we're bringing in, as Peter mentioned earlier, both highly profitable customers with attractive CLVs, and as it relates to revenue outside of phones, we also saw some key wins in our Advanced Network solutions this past quarter with Formula 1 in Las Vegas, where we successfully demonstrated our commercial application of network slicing with 230 points of sale that was incredible, Ulf, and also signed a deal with PJM Americas, where we're the official 5G innovation partner enhancing how players and fans both experience the game. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of insight on what we're seeing. Mike Sievert : It's kind of neat to see that if you just listen to that, that essentially our whole business effort has just kind of grown up. And we're now competing to solve really important organizational problems for enterprise and government. With the corner office. And that's just a different place for us. And it's been interesting to see you've had to retool all the skills and the capabilities and the solutions. And now we have this business that is just breaking records. So there's a lot of room to run because we're at the very beginning, I think, of CIOs and organizational leaders rethinking their connectivity in the era of AI. And when they start to assess who's best positioned in this era to provide reliable, secure connectivity with dedicated spectrum, it's T-Mobile. And so it's just, we're lucky to be in this moment at the very moment that everyone is rethinking everything in technology thanks to the advent of AI and related technologies. So it's a great place to be. Okay. Jud Henry : All right. Let's go back to the phones. Operator : The next question is from Peter Supino with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Peter Supino : Hi. Thank you. Wondering two things. What about Fixed Wireless. You talked a bit about a slowing net add growth rate still obviously at a really attractive level, with better price and value for you. I wondered as you get closer to your target thinking out a couple of years, do you manage this business at a high rate of speed right up to the target and then slam on the brakes? Or is there some organizational benefit to a more gradual deceleration? And then a second question related to postpaid phone ARPU, I know that you're not guiding to it. And just wondered if you could discuss the drivers in '24 and how they might differ from '23? Thank you. Mike Sievert : Sounds good. I'll take the first one and then maybe hand it to Peter. As we said in response to an earlier question, it's kind of too early to tell what's going to happen as we start to get towards that initial goal for our Fixed Wireless business of 7 million to 8 million subscribers, as Jon reminded us. And right now, we want to make sure that we're serving mainstream customers with a fantastic product at a fair price, and we start to ease our way towards that moment. But we also don't know, as we said earlier, whether that's really the final destination or not, whether or not there may be other models that allow us to extend past that. And so look, we'll learn more with each passing quarter. But I think the moves we've made that Mike outlined, I think, well, a few minutes ago, this is the right time for them to make sure that we're serving mainstream customers with our great product. We're meeting the demand appropriately and that we're correctly monetizing it so that we're able to continue serving customers in the best possible way. So I'm really happy with where we are. The demand for this product based on the quality of the product has just been phenomenal. And I think a lot of it now is word of mouth. Because that's what happens when you get 4.8 million customers using this product every day at very high nearly the best in the industry, Net Promoter Scores. Well, what they do, they tell other people that they've discovered something great. And that just feeds on itself. So that's a really good place to be. Secondly, unpacking ARPU? And is there anything different in the dynamics for '24 versus '23? Peter Osvaldik : Yes. '24, we'd expect to be generally stable to 2023. And in terms of dynamics, it's going to be the same set of dynamics. You have growth in high-value creating enterprise and government customers. You have growth in tremendously great CLV segment customers like 55+ and Military on the consumer side, which Jon has just seen tremendous success with. You're going to see uptake of our highest tier, highest value rate plans continue at a great clip. And then it just becomes a mix-driven metric. And again, we tend to solve for ARPA and ARPA growth and overall service revenue growth as the focus point. So that's, it's going to be more of the same with regards to ARPU. Peter Supino : You bet. Thanks so much. Mike Sievert : You bet. Hopefully, you can tell we're trying to get to absolutely as many questions as we can as time so let's keep moving. Jud Henry : All right. Next question. Operator : And the next question comes from Timothy Horan with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Timothy Horan : Thanks, guys. You had a goal a few years ago of a 15-fold increase in wireless capacity. Could you give us an update kind of where we are at this point and just what 5G is meant for maybe latency or anything else with the network. And I know you talked touched on network slicing. What was Formula 1 in PGA doing kind of before you kind of came along for wireless capacity? How much of improvement was us at this point? Thank you. Mike Sievert : Well, first, on overall capacity, it's a good opportunity to turn it to Ulf and maybe you can say what we're seeing now that we're substantially complete with the initial build. Ulf Ewaldsson : Yes. Thanks a lot, Mike, and thanks for the question. Well, overall, the network capacity on this fantastic network is outstanding and keeps increasing on 5G as we are pivoting over frequency from our LTE customers over to 5G. And we keep doing that all the time. That's why we can stay ahead of the curve, both with our HSI customers being inside that mobile umbrella, but also making sure that we have enough capacity to grow for all the traffic growth on the network. And as Mike alluded to earlier, we just see an increasing usage. People use more and more of the goodness that we provide. I'll also say that this is across our entire geography. We have to remember that our network is much, much larger in size than 5G than any of our competitor in this country. We have on our 5G coverage more than twice the area of our closest competitor on our ultra-capacity, which is what provides all that capacity. When it comes to the second question, which was around network slicing in Las Vegas, and as Callie alluded to, this was a true success story. We were the only operator in the world or in the country that could provide a true beta version because of our stand-alone core that we have in this network -- of network slicing. In other words, we can program our network to make sure that services work while all the other services and serving all the other customers on the network at the same time. We were able to provide network slicing during the start of the race, which means that we could both make sure that all those points of sales had full service to everything they were doing at the same time as hundred thousand customers per day were using our network during that start the rate, watching their apps, doing all the activities that they will be doing. This has almost never happened in Formula 1 history. It's normally very congested, very difficult to do anything when so many customers are accessing the network at the same time. And that's what network slicing was proving to do in Las Vegas, and it's just started early to come. We're going to roll these kind of things out to much more events in the future. Mike Sievert : As it relates to your specific question on the 15 times, I actually don't have the answer at my fingertips. So I'm going to look into that. I can tell you that when we made that estimate, what we had in mind were the commercial results that we have delivered in space, being able to see phone usage grow the way it has grown at T-Mobile, it's now more than triple what it was five years ago. Four times the speed and then some and being able to handle this massive home broadband business on top as well as all the growth that we see in enterprise. So as we laid out this network, that way back in 2018 and planned it, we have met every single expectation that we laid out there, including some stringent commitments that we made to the FCC as part of the merger process and just completed a massive nationwide drive in order to be able to make those goals. So I would be surprised if it's anything other than the 15x has been achieved, but I'll have to double check on that. As it relates to the F1, it's fascinating, you hear Ulf talking about Network Slicing and what it's doing for people. And there have been lots of applications. We talk about F1 because it's very public and it's going to be great case study for all of our executive briefing center visits, et cetera. But there have been lots of these now. And look, your previous options were either string wires everywhere, which was not ideal or rely on Wi-Fi. Where you have no control over the radio spectrum and it's a best efforts service with a shared spectrum. And so this is a breakthrough for organizations that they need mission-critical distributed connectivity. Network slicing on 5G is a breakthrough solution for that. We're going to see lots of applications like powering the commercial operations at F1, where it's the perfect solution. Timothy Horan : So Mike, do you think there's a way that the industry can grow ARPA faster? I mean, we've been kind of growing way, way below inflation for a long period of time, but we're seeing major improvements in the network. I mean is there any way to kind of get to inflation-type ARPA growth longer term? Mike Sievert : I mean this industry gives remarkable value, and we've been talking about that a little bit during the call. As it relates to T-Mobile, we're always looking for ways that we can serve customers better and make sure that we build a profitable business around that. And we have to do that smartly so that we defend and extend our fame as the value provider because that's so important, and we have lower costs. So that should be defensible over the long haul as evidenced by things like a lower debt structure and lower cost to service that debt than anybody else in the industry. So it's a defensible place, but we have to defend it by making smart decisions. And we have the best network, and that should allow us to find the right optimization to be able to serve customers better. We can't give you predictions over the long haul other than to say that in 2024, we see opportunities, and that's why we've got a confident guide in 2% year-over-year gain in ARPA. And over the long haul, we'll see what happens. But I will tell you that I'm pleased that customers are getting such incredible value from this category, and that certainly does open up opportunities for us to make sure for T-Mobile that if there are opportunities for us to monetize that in smart ways that it will be appreciated by customers, we'll find ways to do that. Timothy Horan : Thank you. Jud Henry : All right. I think we've got time for one final question, operator? Operator : And that question comes from Greg Williams with TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Gregory Williams : Great. Thanks for squeezing me in. First question is just on the industry as a whole. It's the third carrier to report this week and showing some strength here. In your postpaid add guidance, I'm just curious to what degree do you expect the industry to soften up in 2024? Is it sort of the same level of softening you saw in 2023? Second question is just on capital allocation. Just curious how sacrosanct is your buyback if I think about, say, fiber M&A materializing and your thinking rates could potentially come down over time, would you consider cutting the buyback for M&A? Or again, is it sacrosanct and you consider levering up and keeping the buyback? Just curious to hear your thoughts. Thank you. Peter Osvaldik : All right. In the context of the guide for the industry as a whole, we do expect some moderation year-over-year, probably a little bit more moderation in our expectation than what you saw in '22 to '23. But look we look at it from a number of scenarios and kind of give a range. And our job is to within whatever happens in there, to continue to be the share-taking leader. And when we see accretive opportunities to go above and beyond, much like we did in Q4 and all of 2023, we'll deliver on those. So that's kind of what we look to and work within. In terms of capital, I mean, we talk about fiber and all of that. If you recall, what we said is we thought it was the right time and a prudent thing to do in the rate environment and what we saw to delever a little bit more rapidly to the 2.5 point by the end of 2024. We're there at the end of 2023, but there are some puts and takes in terms of timing of payments, for example, with respect to Columbia Capital, but it was the right thing to do there. But even within that, which allowed that envelope that we've announced of share buybacks and dividends, there was some room for investment. And so we'll look within there. But, the capital allocation methodology that we look at is the same it's always been and will continue to be. What are the highest value creating opportunities that we can see as a management team, investing in the network, investing in growth of the core business, the adjacent businesses. And then, of course, we'll look at all other things beyond that, whether that's in the fiber space, whether that's the US cellular we'd look at that process and see are there value-creating opportunities. That would be the right thing to do and invest in. But we have a little bit of wiggle room in there in terms of an envelope for investment even within the guide that we gave you. Mike Sievert : And if it's further comfort, I will tell you, obviously, we're going to be guided by what creates value, and there are no absolutes there. So, but I will tell you, we're not pursuing to the premise of the example in your question, we're not pursuing a big like on-balance sheet transaction in this space. There's no big deal on the horizon that we see that would knock us off our pace. And I think that's important calculus. If something presented itself, it made a lot of sense for shareholders, our jobs to bring it to you. But right now, we don't see it. Gregory Williams : Got it. Thank you. Mike Sievert : You bet. Jud Henry : Thank you, Greg. It's all the time we have today. Really appreciate everybody joining us and we look forward to speaking with you again soon. If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to either the Investor Relations or Media Relations departments. And with that, thank you very much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the T-Mobile Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect and have a pleasant day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jud Henry, Senior Vice President, Strategic Adviser, Investor Relations for T-Mobile US. Please go ahead, sir. Jud Henry : Welcome to T-Mobile's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. Joining me on the call today are Mike Sievert, our President and CEO; Peter Osvaldik, our CFO; as well as other members of the senior leadership team. During this call, we'll make forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. We provide a comprehensive list of risk factors in our SEC filings, which I encourage you to review. Our earnings release, investor fact book and other documents related to our results as well as reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP results discussed on this call can be found in our Quarterly Results section of the Investor Relations website. And with that, let me turn it over to Mike. G. Sievert: Okay. Thanks, Jud. Good afternoon, everybody. Welcome. If you're watching online, you can see that I've got a good part of the senior team here. We're coming to you from Bellevue, Washington today, and we're looking forward to a great discussion. And as you can see from our Q1 results, we are off to a great start in 2024. The year is unfolding right in line with what we expected across the board, and in fact, better in some areas, and we're increasing our guidance for the year accordingly. I'll briefly touch on a few highlights, and then we'll get right to your questions. First, a comment on growth. We continue to take share in Q1 just as expected with postpaid phone net adds that were right in line with Q1 last year, while industry net adds were lower by a double-digit percentage. Our best value, best network proposition continues to resonate in the market with our postpaid phone gross adds up year-over-year for the fourth consecutive quarter even while industry gross adds were down. And we matched our best ever Q1 postpaid phone churn, showing that customers love the Un-carrier value proposition and network.  Second, a comment on those lowest ever postpaid upgrades for phones in Q1. I think this metric showcases our ongoing winning formula by demonstrating that customers choose to stay with T-Mobile for the best-in-class value and network they enjoy, which is the only retention strategy that drives profitable growth over the long term. The network is an increasingly powerful part of our customers' loyalty as 3/4 of our postpaid phone customers already have a 5G smartphone, and they're having a differentiated experience on the T-Mobile network. It also demonstrates how we put our investments where they can have the greatest customer impact, letting natural customer demand drive the pace of upgrades. Overall, from consumers in major metros to smaller markets and businesses from large enterprises to SMBs, T-Mobile's durable, differentiated growth momentum continues across the segments. And the most exciting part is that there are still many years of market-leading growth runway ahead for our core business. Okay. Let's talk broadband. Home broadband customers love a great value on a great network, too. That's been the formula that's made us the fastest-growing broadband provider for the past 2 years. And we did it again in Q1 as our 405,000 nets are expected to represent a higher share of industry broadband net adds than even a year ago and are expected to be more than half of all nets from the major providers once again. Our broadband strategy is unfolding exactly the way we said it would. And we now proudly serve over 5 million high-speed Internet customers.  And as we previously announced, we're also growing the value of that customer base, successfully sunsetting our [ launch era ] promotions and attracting customers at our nominal price points. In addition, our new rate plans for home mesh networks and for on-the-go usage are just the latest ways we intend to continue to enhance the value of this space and find new ways to serve customers better. Okay. Let me comment on fiber. I've been saying for a while that smart fiber partnerships would allow us to profitably serve even more broadband customers. And today, we announced a joint venture with EQT that will acquire Lumos. Consistent with everything we've said for the last year, this JV is the latest example of a capital-light model, and we're excited to have such great and experienced partners. EQT is one of the leading infrastructure investors across the U.S. and Europe and brings a wealth of knowledge to the table. The Lumos management team under Brian Stading is outstanding and has years of experience building fiber in an efficient, cost-effective and targeted build model. We're really excited to be able to accelerate what Lumos has already been doing to reach more and more households in the years ahead.  Together, we target 3.5 million homes passed by 2028, and T-Mobile expects to invest about $950 million upon close, which we expect less than a year from now, and another $500 million between 2027 and '28 to get there. T-Mobile will be a 50% owner of Lumos and will own the customer relationships, including their existing fiber customers at close, as Lumos will convert to a wholesale model. This is exactly the type of value-creating investment that we had contemplated with our strategic envelope of funds that we set aside back when we shared the current stockholder return program with you last fall. And we expect to remain on track as it relates to our stockholder return ambitions. Lastly, I am so happy to report that we have received regulatory approval to acquire Mint and Ultra Mobile. And we, therefore, currently expect to close on May 1. We are really looking forward to welcoming them to the Un-carrier family. And I know they're going to fit in because they are hyper-focused on offering customers compelling products at a great value. We'll work to further fuel their success while also learning from their team who are absolute rock stars in the direct-to-consumer and value segments. Financially, in Q1, we again showed how T-Mobile translates profitable growth into market-leading consolidated service revenue growth and core adjusted EBITDA growth that was double the rate of our principal competitors. And T-Mobile again delivered the highest free cash flow margins in the industry. So to wrap up. Our model is working. It's consistent. And our confidence in it only builds with each passing quarter of success. We remain focused on continuing to take share in wireless and broadband while delivering industry-leading growth in service revenue, profitability and cash flows. I couldn't be more excited about what's ahead for T-Mobile. And I want you to know that we plan to have a Capital Markets Day this fall, where we look forward to going deeper with you on topics like the big opportunities that we see coming, how we're seizing them and how that will translate into enormous value creation for our company in the years ahead. And I think you're going to see once again that in many ways, we're just getting started. Okay. Peter, over to you to talk about our key financial highlights and an update on our guidance. Peter Osvaldik : Well, thank you, Mike. All right. As you can see, we kicked off 2024 with great momentum. Mike already highlighted our best-in-class growth in both the top and bottom line and how our industry-leading conversion of service revenue to adjusted free cash flow continues to differentiate T-Mobile. So let me jump into our updated expectations for how that growth will continue in 2024. Starting with customers, where we now expect total postpaid net customer additions to be between 5.2 million and 5.6 million, up 150,000 at the midpoint. We now expect full year postpaid ARPA to grow up to 3% in 2024, a further acceleration of the growth we saw in 2023 from both the continued execution of our strategy to win and expand account relationships and as we anticipate taking further rate plan optimization actions within the base. There is no change in our expectations for postpaid phone net adds from our original guidance last quarter with Q1's strong growth coming in as we expected and because we anticipate slight year-over-year headwinds to postpaid phone net adds in Q2 and Q3 related to those rate plan optimizations, which are accretive to the business on an all-in basis. Core adjusted EBITDA is now expected to be between $31.4 billion and $31.9 billion, up 9% year-over-year at the midpoint. And as I mentioned on the last earnings call, we expect our industry-leading service revenue growth to accelerate at a higher rate in 2024 than we delivered in 2023 even with the discontinuation of the Affordable Connectivity Program that appears imminent at this point in time and is contemplated within the increased guidance. We continue to expect cash CapEx to be between $8.6 billion and $9.4 billion as we deliver a capital efficiency unmatched in our industry on the back of our network integration and 5G leadership. Lastly, we now expect adjusted free cash flow, including payments for merger-related costs, to be in the range of $16.4 billion to $16.9 billion. This is up 23% over last year at the midpoint and 5x the expected growth rate of our next closest competitor, thanks to our margin expansion and capital efficiency and does not assume any material net cash inflows from securitization. This also represents an adjusted free cash flow to service revenue margin, which is multiple percentage points higher than peers. So in closing, we continue to expect 2024 to be another year of differentiated profitable growth as we continue to extend our network leadership and further scale our unique growth opportunities. We expect this to continue to translate into industry-leading growth in service revenue, core adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow along with the highest adjusted free cash flow margin in the industry, unlocking shareholder value. I couldn't be more excited about the continued enormous value creation opportunity that we have in front of us for years to come. Okay. Before we open it up for Q&A, I just want to take a moment to announce a changing of the guard in our Investor Relations leadership. After 11 years and an unbelievable 44 earnings cycles in IR, I'm tremendously excited for Jud to take on a broader role within our finance organization. And I'm equally excited to introduce Cathy Yao as our new SVP of Investor Relations. Many of you may know Cathy, from her time on the sell side at MoffettNathanson or on the corporate side at Altice USA among other roles on her fabulous resume. We look forward to Cathy continuing T-Mobile's strong tradition of Investor Relations excellence. And with that, I will now turn the call back to Jud to begin his last Q&A. Jud? Jud Henry : Thanks, Peter. All right. Let's get to your questions. [Operator Instructions] We'll start with a question on the phone. Operator, first question, please. Operator : The first question comes from Michael Rollins with Citi. Michael Rollins : Congrats, Jud, on the new role. Just a couple of questions, if I could. So first, you mentioned that you may be taking some pricing actions and that could affect some of the subscriber performance in 2Q, 3Q. Can you unpack the plan on how you're approaching those actions and how to think about the net benefit? And then just secondly, taking a step back, if you can give us an update on how you're seeing the competitive landscape, how you're seeing the switcher pool and how T-Mobile is navigating some of these changes with the industry seemingly having lower upgrades, lower churn. G. Sievert: Okay. Great. Well, why don't I jump in, and I'll give a comment on -- or a lack of a comment on the first question, and then I'll hand it to Jon Freier for the second one. No, we're not really going to announce any particular plans today. I will tell you that nothing we do is going to question or challenge our long-standing strategy of being the value leader in this market. But surely, over the span of many years, what that means kind of changes over time. Costs have risen. Changes have happened in a broader industry context. And we're going to jealously guard that value leadership. And I think customers understand that if there are changes around the margins once every many years in a world where costs change, they'll understand and accept that. We've actually made changes here and there over the past 6 months. We've understood what that looks like and what that takes. And there may be more changes, particularly with older rate plans. But we're not here to announce anything. I will tell you that all the outcomes that we see from all of that on the customer side as well as on the ARPA side and on the EBITDA and revenue side are contained within the guidance that Peter just shared. Do you want to add anything in the first question before we go to the second one? Peter Osvaldik : I think you got it. G. Sievert: Okay. Competitive context on up -- what are we seeing on upgrades? What's driving that? What's happening with the competition, Jon? Jon Freier : Yes, you bet. So I'll tell you a little bit about what's happening competitively. It's been an intense competitive environment in the marketplace, but it's been generally consistent as you look at this overall competitive intensity. And for our business, we continue to have these differentiated growth opportunities, whether that be smaller markets and rural areas, whether that be within our high-speed Internet or in our overall enterprise and government space that Callie can talk about in just a few moments as well. And so during that overall competitive context, we have these unique growth vectors that we continue to be underpenetrated on, driving a lot of good success so far but continue to have a lot of runway in front of us. So while that competitive environment is intense, sometimes one competitor is leaning in. Sometimes one competitor is leaning out. We're always navigating that. Things are always changing. Sometimes it's a little bit more device oriented. Sometimes it might be more rate oriented in terms of how the competitive environment is unfolding. But we've navigated that for years and years now and continue to be very comfortable with how that overall competitive environment is playing out. With respect to upgrades, we continue to meet the natural demand of upgrades. As you can see, the upgrade rate is a low 2.4% at the same time when we're matching the best Q1 postpaid phone churn performance in the company's history. We've been more targeted than surgical with some of our upgrade offers, for sure. But the overall natural demand and the upgrade cycle is lengthening. It's really kind of the best of both worlds when you have customers that are staying at incredible rates, record low rates and not staying for free devices exclusively. They're staying for this differentiated value proposition, the network and the overall experience, something we're very, very pleased with how it's unfolding. G. Sievert: I'll just add one last thing. As I said in my prepared remarks, 75% of our customers have 5G devices, and those customers are having a very differentiated experience with T-Mobile's lead in 5G. And we can talk more about that, I hope, during the call. I'm so pleased with what's happened. We continue to extend our lead. And so that -- the impetus when you're having a fantastic experience on your phone, to prematurely swap it out, just isn't there. And they'll do it in a stepwise way. They continue to do it. And you can tell we're upgrading people fast enough by the fact that all those people have 5G phones, which is right at or even above competitive benchmark. So our customers continue to upgrade at just the pace that we think is appropriate. Operator : The next question comes from John Hodulik with UBS. John Hodulik : Maybe first on the Lumos transaction. Firstly, should we expect similar deals in other parts of the country? And you talked about 3.5 million homes passed. Is that about -- I mean that's just in one small part of the country. Should we expect something similar as we look at the rest of the U.S.? And then in the release today, you guys had a line about not being able to meet all the demand for broadband with your fixed wireless network. Can you talk a little bit about how much growth there is left there and if you're seeing capacity constraints in any particular areas? Janice Kapner : What kind of partner ecosystem are you building to execute on your strategy? G. Sievert: Let's go straight to Callie. Callie Field : Well, thanks, [ John ], for the question. We saw very strong growth in Q1, outpacing our benchmark competitor again in postpaid phone nets. And to comment a little bit on the question that Jon was answering in the business category if we're seeing pressure in that category, I think it might be us. And one of the interesting things, I think, that's going on in our business right now is that not only are we delivering on top line growth but also on CLV growth across all segments. And in enterprise, we just delivered our strongest postpaid nets ever in the history of the company. We also delivered our lowest churn in enterprise. In SMB, we had our highest ever port ratios, and we're net positive for 7 consecutive quarters. So we're really liking the pace of the business. We've really graduated from just being a price comp to really a solution-oriented sale for customers. And we see that with partnerships with Dialpad Ai with delivering mission-critical push-to-talk. And I know, [ John ], you also asked who are some of the partners that we're working with in building our ecosystem. Obviously, we're partnering with the largest OEMs, working with Ericsson and Cisco as well as industry segment experts like [ OCS ] when it comes to serve our government customers. So really building out our ecosystem that allows us to really focus on enterprise solutions, enabling them to innovate and to love their customers at scale. I will mention just a couple of key wins in the Advanced Network Solution business. You might have read about our partnership agreement with Delta, where they named us as their preferred wireless provider. But we're also deploying a 5G hybrid network solution at their Atlanta headquarters, which we're really excited about. Also the U.S. Coast Guard is working with us build out a private network to deliver seamless secure connectivity from ship to shore. And then with Ericsson, not only as a strategic partner, but we're also working with them to deploy our first network slice on a SIM-based SASE solution within a 5G connected laptop. So we're really excited about the kinds of solutions, the sort of enterprises that we're bringing on and the momentum in the business overall. G. Sievert: It's really interesting when you hear us talk about enterprise, how different it is from 4 or 5 years ago. I mean we were trying our best to sell SIMs to companies that would take meetings with us like the procurement department. And what's happened in this 5G strategy as it's unfolded is Callie and team have built solutions to some of the most pressing connectivity problems that enterprises of all kinds face. And suddenly, we're in strategic conversations because we have capabilities like network slicing, like SIM-based security and many other emerging 5G capabilities that are way out in front. And that's not just giving us revenues in those advanced 5G services, but it's also winning us all those smartphones that we used to struggle so hard and back then have to price so hard to win. So it's been this really nice evolution. And make no mistake, we love low prices, and we're going to be the value leader here. But today, we're solving some of the most complicated connectivity problems that enterprises and organizations face. And that is a great place to compete. Callie Field : Yes. Thank you, Mike. Totally agree. Jud Henry : Okay. All right. Let's try this again. Operator, can we get a question? Operator : The next question comes from John Hodulik with UBS. John Hodulik : Okay. Great. So I have a couple of questions on the Lumos transaction. So first of all, should we just think of this transaction as sort of a one-off? Or should we expect other deals similar to this in other regions? And then of the 3.5 million homes that you guys are talking about passing, how big could that get over the next 5 years? So that's first. And then second of all, in the release, you guys talked about not being able to fulfill the demand that you're seeing in broadband on the fixed wireless side. How much growth is still left in fixed wireless? And are you seeing areas today where you're running out of capacity? G. Sievert: Okay. Let's start with the second one. All along, if I remind all of our listeners, I know you know this, our fixed wireless strategy has always been about selling excess capacity, where we predict normal cell phone usage won't suck up that 5G capacity. And so this gives us the opportunity to serve broadband customers. And now at scale, we're serving millions and millions of them under this strategy. We had originally said we saw this strategy leading to about 7 million to 8 million total customers in terms of opportunity. We don't have any updates on that. I've said several times, we're working on thinking about examining ways that we could try to extend that, and we haven't drawn any conclusions yet. We have to make sure it's done in an economic way, and we have to make sure it's done in a way that customers will love, and they have a fantastic product experience. That being said, what's interesting about fiber, fiber can be a strategy that relieves some pressure on the 5G network and extend the TAM, if you think about it, right, because some customers will -- where we offer fiber in the future, will be able to naturally graduate up to fiber, which is really a totally separate category. And that obviously opens up an opportunity for their neighbor to then become a 5G customer. So there's some TAM expansion there. And then to your point, even in places where Lumos currently operates, we have a long wait list of people who applied. They put their address in our system. They applied to be a fixed wireless customer, and we haven't accepted them yet because their address isn't one of those places that I described where we have the predicted excess capacity. So there's lots of opportunity there. As it relates to your first question around is this the first of many, et cetera, look, we don't have anything to say about that other than our strategy is to opportunistically find ways that are very capital-light, very smart to put our brand in this space, and we've done that here. And we think this will lead to millions of homes passed. And that's a great place for us to be. We're going to continue to learn, grow, expand. And we're open-minded about this. But we're not interested in any wholesale changes that basically change who we are. No big on-balance sheet acquisitions are currently being examined. It's not something that -- we know our investors like our fast, efficient, capital efficient, high capital return strategy, and we have no intentions of changing all that. That being said, if we can lay track for the long term in a very capital-efficient way, we're open-minded. And we really like this model that we've struck with EQT and Lumos, and can't wait to get started and get this approved through the regulatory bodies and begin to see this build out and accelerate. Operator : The next question is from Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson. Craig Moffett : First, Jud, congratulations. But thank you for all those 40-some-odd quarters of your able support and help. And congratulations to Cathy if she's on the call. A question about ACP just because that's the obligatory topic this quarter. Can you just talk about what you expect with ACP, how you think that might affect your business, especially perhaps your prepaid business, but whether you think it will have an impact on your postpaid business as well? And you just introduced a plan where you no longer do credit checks, which I think was a head scratcher to me just coming right before the expiry of ACP. I wonder if you could just talk about how you plan to sort of ensure that ACP customers without government support won't upend that kind of an offer. G. Sievert: Well, let's start out with Mike Katz so we can disentangle some of these offers for you because there could be some misunderstanding out there. And then we'll go to Peter and talk about the financial, what we see in the financial picture as it relates to the expected turndown of ACP. Michael Katz : Yes. Thanks, Craig. First, to answer the first part of your question on what our expectations are with ACP, at this point, we're expecting that the program funding is going to end. And the impact of that is fully contemplated in the guidance that Peter talked about and shared earlier. And as a reminder, I think it's important to contextualize like how T-Mobile has participated in the ACP program. First of all, we have not participated in any form in postpaid across any products. It's nonexistent in our postpaid business. We have a small amount. I think we've said a couple of hundred thousand inside of our prepaid, our owned prepaid portfolio. And the vast amount of our participation is inside wholesale via wholesale partners that we work with. So for -- so just to contextualize where our participation is. That being said, we are both in the small amount that we have in our own prepaid business but also with the wholesale partners, working with them on communication and plans to help those customers transition. We think wireless is not a category that customers are going to walk away from. So these customers need another alternative, and we're working closely with the partners and with the customers to find them another alternative, whether it's other plans or other programs like Lifeline. So we're deep in doing that. And look, like we think if you look at T-Mobile, and Mike talked a lot about our passion around and focus around guarding our value position and the brands in our portfolio like Metro and soon to be Mint, these are all value brands that are focused on delivering value. And we think that's a great opportunity, both to help customers inside of our wholesale partners to transition, but honestly, customers that also may feel stranded from competitors to come to find a value to continue their wireless services. So I hope that's helpful for the question you're answering. Peter Osvaldik : Yes. And let me maybe add to that just a little bit on your other questions, Craig. And I think Mike really highlighted our thinking around this well. Of course, it's in front of us, more so than behind us. No new activations as of February, but it's in front of us, but we think it's fully baked into the guidance range that we gave you, the range of outcomes that we anticipate. And when we think about -- you asked about the no credit check. And I can tell you, one, that we continue to see very healthy levels of bad debt. We continue to actually be the leader compared to our peers in terms of bad debt as a percentage of total revenue. So we're very happy with what we see there. We're always testing and trying new things. For example, we have a way and an ability for prepaid customers who have a certain number of on-time payments to graduate into postpaid without an incremental credit check. And that's because we have data and know exactly how those customers behave over time and what the really data informed credit risk around those consumers are. So we're always going to be testing around edges what is really beneficial for consumers while being very thoughtful around, of course, risk protection for the entity, and that's why we sit at the bad debt rates that we do. G. Sievert: And that's not new. We've had that program in place for many years. Peter Osvaldik : Of course, yes. Absolutely. Absolutely. Craig Moffett : Is there any risk, though, that ACP customers who've been essentially getting their bills paid by the government and therefore have good credit histories might be higher credit risk as ACP ends? Peter Osvaldik : Yes, absolutely. You're absolutely right, and that's thoughtful around -- remember, as Mike Katz said, the amount of ACP customers that are sitting in our prepaid base and Metro is very small. So that's a very small exposure. G. Sievert: And the amount in the postpaid base... Peter Osvaldik : Zero. Postpaid is absolutely 0 for us. And so it's really finding products. And you saw us probably launch out there some ways to help consumers and think about can you get into other programs like T-Mobile Connect or other low-cost opportunities or Lifeline type of construct. So look, we're going to be very thoughtful around making sure customers in this critical category stay connected while being, of course, very thoughtful around the risk profile to T-Mobile. G. Sievert: Yes. As Mike pointed out, it's not just our customers that are facing this, right? Everybody else is. But we've got this incredible portfolio of brands that are famous for value. And we're going to make sure that those brands are in front of people because we're going to stand up and serve them at a time when they might find that they need a new offer, and we will be there with incredible offers for them. Operator : And the next question comes from Jonathan Chaplin with New Street Research. Jonathan Chaplin : Congratulations to Jud and Cathy. That's fantastic news. Since it's Jud's last call, I've got 9 questions to ask. I'll try and consolidate them. So Mike, I'm wondering if you can give us just an update on the sort of the fiber strategies that you're collecting together in aggregate. So you've announced so far pilot, the Lumos deal. I think there are deals out there with Tillman, Intrepid and SiFi. How many -- when you put all of those together, how many homes passed does it amount to? And for the Lumos deal specifically, can you -- how much cash is EQT putting in? We're just trying to get a sense of sort of the total capitalization here. And then how much comes from sort of incremental debt? And then my last question on this is, how do you see -- all of the deals that we've had about so far seem to be focused on guys building new infrastructure. How about -- how do you think about those sorts of assets versus partnering with guys who have existing copper infrastructure that they're upgrading? G. Sievert: You bet. We won't be able to give you too much on sort of broad strategy here other than the fact that we're opportunistic. The strategies we've employed so far, both across wholesale, which we got started on in a very small way already, as well as this new partnership, are about putting the T-Mobile brand and team to work, selling a fiber product that complements our wildly successful 5G product. And to us, that's a great strategy because we believe we have an opportunity to generate superior returns than a purely disinterested investor could do by virtue of our assets and our know-how. And we've proven that know-how to ourselves through our success with 5G Home Internet. You think about our incredible distribution, our leading brand, our tens of millions of customers, our incredible team. We have very insightful data that our customers give us permission to use to put relevant offers about their T-Mobile experience in front of them. These are all advantages that are purely financial or disinterested investor wouldn't have. And so when we look at this area and say, can we extract a return that's better than others could, we have some confidence. And so we think about it from that opportunistic standpoint, not from a convergence defensive standpoint. We believe that our T-Mobile offers stand tall and stand alone and don't \"need\" convergence. We just think that this is a place where we can make customers happy and generate a superior financial return and that it complements a leadership product that we already have out there. Beyond that, I can't say much more about the strategy other than what I said earlier. We like this partnership. We're very excited about where it could go. Maybe Peter can comment on the capital structure. But one of the things I do like about it is that we decided as we formed this to fund it and give it the wherewithal with some additional debt to have everything it needs from an equity standpoint to get to the 3.5 million homes passed, which we think is a nice threshold for us. It will be a multistate footprint. It will be big enough to matter. And of course, that will be through a combination of debt and equity. Peter Osvaldik : Yes. And again, Jon, I can't give you all the details because we have counterparties involved in this. First, it is a 50-50 joint venture. It will be unconsolidated for us. So it's an equity method investment for us. So everybody kind of captures that fine point. And then as Mike said, there -- just given that it's a 50-50, there will be, obviously, cash infusion from EQT as a partner in this as well. And when you think about that incremental 500 million, for example, that would be an equivalent cash infusion from EQT. And there is -- given this is an infrastructure and a great anchor tenant in the form of T-Mobile having the retail customers, there is an ability to also lever the entity up. And the overarching thought process is this is about a maximum of 2 :1 debt-to-equity ratio, but it will be based on what the funding needs of the entity actually is to get to that 3.5 million. Jonathan Chaplin : One quick follow-up, Peter, if I can. You mentioned at the beginning that you sort of set capital aside for things like this in 2024. You haven't used up that whole sort of reservoir of capital yet. If you look at what's left there, is it more directed towards fiber transactions like this or spectrum? Like how do you sort of balance between those 2 assets? Peter Osvaldik : It really is looking at what the best return profile for T-Mobile is. And sometimes, as you know, spectrum opportunities may come up. They may not come up. We could have some of the 2.5-gig leased spectrum come up, and then we have rights of first refusal around those. So it's still a balance. We don't have line of sight to how we would use every dollar of what's still remaining in that bucket. But as opportunities come up, we're going to tumble it through the normal capital allocation thought process that we have that we've described very many times, and that's exactly how you think we should think about it. G. Sievert: And nor should we, right? So I mean one of the reasons why we were this transparent, maybe unusually transparent with you, is that we wanted you to know that we could, in the normal course, pursue opportunities and yet still honor our stockholder return ambitions. And we wanted to make it clear that, that -- nothing has changed in that. And that's why we put an envelope out there at the beginning so that you would have confidence that whether it was spectrum, partnerships like this, other things that we would see that we could use our know-how and embedded assets to be able to extract a superior financial return and delight customers that we would have the wherewithal to seize those things within that range. So we're really pleased to have been able to bring this one to fruition and can't wait to get started once we get approval. Operator : And the next question is from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Simon Flannery : Great. And best of luck, Jud. Thanks for all the help. And welcome, Cathy. Peter, I wanted to talk a little bit about margins, if I could. You had nice EBITDA growth of 8%, margins up nearly 200 basis points year-over-year. I think in the past, you sort of suggested the cadence would kind of ramp through the year. So perhaps just talk a little bit about margin trajectory, both this year and just longer term, the opportunity? I think, Mike, you said we're just getting started here. So talk about the cost side, if you could. And then maybe on spectrum, just any update you can give us on the status of the 800-megahertz spectrum. Given we passed the DISH April 1 deadline, what should we expect in coming months from you in terms of auctioning that off to third parties? G. Sievert: You take the first one, and I'll take the second. Peter Osvaldik : Yes, absolutely. Thanks, Simon. It's a tremendously exciting story, actually. One of the reasons, as we've talked about before, is we've now achieved as of Q4 of last year, in this tremendously successful merger integration, the run rate synergies, which we raised a couple of times during the pendency of the deal and execution itself. And so now though, we continue with this guide to see run rates EBITDA increases that are significant, in fact, quite similar to what we had during those synergy unlock days. And there's a couple of things that create that. One is continued outsized profitable share taking, of course, taking those fixed costs and leveraging the fact that we're continuing to take outsized share and turning that into outsized service revenue growth. So when you have postpaid service revenue growth like we delivered this quarter of 6.5% year-over-year on a lot of fixed cost nature of the base, that obviously gives you leverage. Besides that, we're going to continue. And really, it's a culture. It's kind of a flow of thinking here that we have around continued optimization efficiencies, where can we extract efficiency out of the business so that we can plow it back into customer acquisition, margin expansion. And most importantly, and we've talked about this, we tend to think about it as service revenue to free cash flow conversion. That free cash flow is what unlocks all the ability for further value-creating investments, whether it's spectrum purchases, whether it's capital returns. And so we're hyper-focused on how do we make sure that we create efficiencies in the expense profiles and how do we make sure that in our CapEx profile, we're making every single dollar count and delivering the next best tranche of value for us. And I think we have some really bespoke unique ways that we approach that. But that's how we continue to see this expansion, particularly in that service revenue to free cash flow play out over a period of time. G. Sievert: I hope it doesn't sound like we're sort of flogging our book when we say we look at cash flow margins. We are. But also, I think cash is king, and a view that doesn't look at cash flow margins would miss the fact that we have, we think, a durably more capital-efficient strategy than our benchmark competitors. And therefore, from a geography standpoint, EBITDA margins don't tell the whole story, even though I'm pleased we're up 200 bps almost, and we're making great progress there. But the cash margins are the story because they are inclusive of what we think is a durably superior capital investment profile. And we'll talk a lot more about what we think our secret sauce is with you at some point when we have more time. But this is a strategy we have growing confidence in that it's going to be durable. Okay. So the second question around 800. Well, first of all, I will just remind you what Peter, I know, has told people in the past, that we've chosen our business plan to be pretty conservative as it relates to how to think about the 800. And what I mean by that is we didn't include any proceeds from this auction in our financial plan so that they would be found money going into that reserve fund. We were talking about a few minutes ago with Jonathan. But secondly, we also did not put the usage of that spectrum into our network planning and capacity plan. And so kind of no matter what happens here with this auction, which has begun. We either get found spectrum and capacity that we get to keep and figure out a way to use. And this is a great spectrum, nationwide, contiguous low band, lots of interesting things we can do with it, especially with emerging technologies. But also, this action may conclude successfully. And if it does, we'll have cash on hand that enhances our profile. So what's the update? We have commenced. We have interested parties. We have nonbinding indications of interest. There's reason to believe that we will meet the reserve. So it's a little too soon. Everything is nonbinding, but we'll have more to say after we get past kind of the binding parts of this. So stay tuned. But again, whichever way it shakes out for us, it's a win because of our conservative planning. Operator : The next question is from David Barden with Bank of America. David Barden : Perfect. Congrats to Jud and Cathy. So I guess my first question would be related to the comments in the results about how kind of going after the business market has kind of impacted the ARPU calculation, and that's been trending down for a couple of quarters. And so I was wondering if you could kind of maybe unpack the kind of subscriber number that we're watching evolve here and how it balances between consumer versus business. Obviously, I'm obligated to ask you how free lines and other things contribute to the reported postpaid number. And the second question, if I could, maybe, Mike, just to go back to this Lumos situation. You're basically saying that today, you're prepared to invest about $1.45 billion between now and 2028 to own 50% of basically 2.5% of the households in America. And if you got 50% of that, you would have slightly around under -- between 1% and 1.5%. So what is the point? Like why is it worth the brain damage to spend the money, the years building the organization to get something that looks realistically so small in the grand scheme? G. Sievert: Yes. Thanks, David. Well, let me start with the second one, and then I'll hand it to Peter on the first one. Look, I'm really excited about this because I think we're getting a lot and enabling this company to accelerate growth. And if you think about close to $1.5 billion spread over in time, 3.5 million passings being the goal for that funding, from what we -- the capital we put out, that's less than $500 per passing. And to the premise of the question, that's not for sort of like half of it because the other way it works is that T-Mobile is the branded entity for all of those passings. And it's up to us to make sure that it stays that way and we perform and so on. But our strategy is to be able to get augmentations to an already nationwide multimillion customer broadband strategy. And this is a smart way to do that. And I signaled we're open to constructs like this around the margins. And so maybe in the end, it'll add up to more than this, and certainly, 3.5 million isn't where this probably ends. This is a growth engine that could continue into the future. We're not obligated for it, too. So I love the strategy. And I think it's about getting a better return based on our embedded assets and complementing a complementary product that's already scaled, and that makes it very appealing for us to think about the efficiencies of how we would go to market. And we are the go-to-market entity in this construct as Lumos pivots into a wholesale model. So hopefully, that helps. To your first question on ARPU, maybe you could unpack it a little bit vis-a-vis business versus consumer and then answer once again the age-old question of free lines and all that stuff. Peter Osvaldik : Yes, absolutely. And Dave, as we've been long saying, our focus is primarily on ARPA, drive accounts, land them, expand them. And we just gave an updated guide with respect to ARPA, both from that as well as those continued rate plan optimization. And we'll probably see that more unfold in the second half of the year. But that trickles down into ARPU as well. So I'd say probably this year, we're expecting ARPU to be up, say, maybe 0.5%, again, more weighted to the second half of the year. But it is very much, as you say, a mix-driven metric. And now we don't separately disclose consumer versus business, but there's just so much goodness in terms of ARPA, both accounts and ARPA accretion, that you would expect us to go heavily after, as Callie was talking about, the enterprise space and the government space where naturally, ARPUs are lower. But account and CLVs and enterprise value creation is really great and strong. So you see success in -- even in the consumer space with segmented consumer offers like in the 55-plus segment in the military segment. Once again, we're willing to do lower ARPUs because you have great CLVs with those types of customers for differential reasons each in their own segment. So we're going to continue to pursue this strategy. But again, now we expect about probably 0.5% increase in ARPU. Now this whole age-old free line question, I understand because there's some stuff that's happening in the industry. As you know, we don't do first free lines. Now we've long had a construct in our rate plan constructs that encourages higher number of lines in terms of our accounts because the higher number of lines get to be more sticky, generate more ARPA and greater lifetime value. But there's really been no trajectory change there at all from a year-over-year sequential perspective. In fact, I would say it contributed less this Q1 than it did last Q1. But that to me is very much a rate plan construct. And again, we don't do first free lines. And so that's kind of -- it's not really any sort of a contributor to what you see have happened year-over-year in terms of our net add performance relative to the industry. Operator : And the next question comes from Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo. Eric Luebchow : Great. Just a follow-up on the fiber-to-the-home strategy at a high level. As you look at potential future opportunities, is the goal to target areas where you might be underpenetrated in either fixed wireless or traditional mobile to kind of expand your addressable market? Or is it in part to provide an alternative for existing FWA subs to offload to a higher capacity option? Any color there would be helpful. And then secondly, just on the network positioning today, maybe you could talk about how you're sequencing capital to put additional spectrum to work between C-band, the DoD spectrum, 2.5 gigahertz, refarming AWS. Just anything -- any color you could provide on how you're working to maintain your network advantage, particularly as your 2 large peers have made further progress in building out mid-band spectrum. G. Sievert: Sounds good. Let's start with the second one about network. I mean I am really pleased with what is happening with Ulf and team. We continue to actually extend our lead. If you look nationwide, don't look at somebody's favorite denominator, but just look nationwide at all of the customers and all of the experience that all the customers are having. We're actually pulling ahead, and our average speeds are double our competitive benchmarks. And so -- and one of the reasons for this is that it's not just looking underneath the 5G, but it's looking at the availability of that 5G that for us is in so many more places reaching so many more people. And with that full layer cake, which keeps the customers connected to 5G, all that results in a fantastic experience. Maybe you can give a little color on what's been unfolding, talk about Auction 108 and how we're deploying advanced technologies, Ulf. Ulf Ewaldsson : Well, thank you, Mike. And yes, we're very excited about the network and how it keeps advancing. And you mentioned C-band. So some of our competitors have launched C-band and put it out there. And in the areas where they launched it, we do see that the gap between us and them narrowed a little bit even though we are still way ahead. But as you said, we also noticed that the overall median downlink speeds, we are gaining another quarter again. And the main reason for us doing that is really the unique way we've built and constructed the network. We are the only one in the country who has 3 completely dedicated bands towards 5G. We have 2.5. We have 1,900 now. And we have 600. And that gives us that big advantage together with the stand-alone network and the larger deployment in the footprint that we have. In fact, we have now 90% of our sites capable of 5G. We have, traffic-wise, about 85% of our traffic on these tri-band sites that are all working with stand-alone technology and working with carrier... G. Sievert: Let's talk more about that one. Somebody -- so 85% of the time, our people are attaching to a site with all 3 bands of 5G. And how does that affect the quality of the connection and the reliability of the 5G connection? Ulf Ewaldsson : Well, very much so because out of that, we also have -- and this is an even more remarkable stat. We have 93% of the traffic on mid-band, which means that there is no toggling. It just creates a much more consistent experience. There is no toggling between when you're an LTE. In fact, you're staying in 5G the entire -- no targeting between low band and mid-band. So another factor of no toggling. The other one is that we have a grid, and this is a unique thing for T-Mobile. We have a grid that is based from the beginning on a mid-band experience. So when we deploy 2.5, we get a very consistent experience between our towers as opposed to some of our competitors who has a low-band grid and therefore -- and a higher band on the C-band. C-band is higher than 2.5. That creates a less -- more sort of interrupted, not so clear and consistent experience. G. Sievert: That's why we are differentiated with somebody experiencing a cell edge condition of 5G, right, because our grid is tighter and our spectrum reaches further. And the net effect of those 2 things is you're on 5G and a high-quality 5G link more of the time. And 85% of the time, you're seeing all 3 bands where a lot of the time, we use advanced carrier aggregation techniques so that you get the benefit of all those bands in terms of your signal strength like the uplink might be in the low band, the downlink might be in the mid-band, et cetera, et cetera. And these are all advanced techniques that the rollout with our competitors is quite variable. But we're really focused on giving everybody a consistent experience. Ulf Ewaldsson : That's very right, Mike. And it's recognized. I mean we saw in the Ookla measurements another quarter where we came in at the overall network leader. We were also recognized by Opensignal as having the most reliable experience. So I think those are remarkable facts showing. And then you mentioned also our 108 auction and how quickly we deployed. It took us 2 weeks to get it all lit up in our entire network. Over a population of about 60 million, we were able to shoot up our 5G median linked speeds by about 20% or a little bit more even. So really a good result and very quickly and shows that we can deploy our spectrum very fast. G. Sievert: Well, thank you all for joining our fireside chat about network. And -- but I did want to make sure because there is this kind of misnomer out there that everybody is catching up and the party is over. And it's -- and I've been saying this for years. We remain 2 years ahead of the party on 5G, and our customers are having a radically differentiated experience. And you can see it in the data, not just in the rhetoric. So really glad you asked about that. Now there was another question, though, about fiber and where we intend to target. Look, I can't help you much on that because we don't have -- we're not rolling out a plan that this is the beginning of a big wave of initiatives here. We're really happy about this initiative and how it augments 5G broadband. And we intend to go put our energy into it. So -- but look, I do want to remind people that this isn't a regional thing for 5G Home Internet. It's really a sector-by-sector assessment, neighborhood by neighborhood as to where will we have excess capacity because that sector gets hung in order to give the kind of competitive experience that we were just coffee talking about. But then if mobile usage isn't predicted to soak up all that capacity, then individual households get approved for home broadband. And so now if those neighborhoods are neighborhoods where we roll out fiber, then we can actually have some of those neighbors be added to the 5G who wouldn't otherwise be added. And that's TAM expanding, potentially. But we're really focused on these things right now. Very happy to have this initiative out the door and nothing further to report about it. Jud Henry : That was great. I'm sorry, I didn't bring my popcorn for that one. Operator : And the next question is from Sam McHugh with BNP Paribas. Samuel McHugh : Just on fiber to begin with, on the existing wholesale agreement you have, can you give us any color on what kind of penetration levels you're seeing kind of year 1, year 2, so we can think about the potential in the new JV? And then secondly, I think on FWA, I've seen some reports suggesting you might start selling notifications to people who move the products from the home address. Do you think that will have any impact on the kind of net adds going forward? And I guess more broadly, how should we think about that cadence of FWA through the rest of this year? G. Sievert: Thank you. And we'll go to Mike for both questions. Michael Katz : Yes. So first, on the fiber question. Remember, a lot of these wholesale markets that we've launched are brand new and haven't even been existing for a year. But when you heard Mike talking about the assets that T-Mobile has and how we think that those give us advantage relative to other investors, that is exactly what we're starting to see play out in these wholesale markets. Remember, at small scale, we're in parts of about 16 markets spread around the country. But what we're seeing is a pace that would get us over 20% in the first year inside those markets. So we're really pleased with the penetration that we're seeing there. G. Sievert: Now on your FWA question. And specifically, earlier this week, we launched a couple of new products. And let me just give a little bit of context to those. Mike talked about us moving over 5 million customers in our home broadband business this quarter, which obviously is a huge milestone for us. And we now sit at the center of millions of homes with the most important technology in their house. And we think that gives us an opportunity, and I think I've mentioned this in the last couple of calls, to look at opportunities to expand into other products and services inside the home as well as give us tons of insight from what we're hearing from customers of additional needs. So earlier this week, we launched a program called Whole Home, which gives customers the ability to -- in addition to the CPE and router that we provide in our regular HSI package, they can expand that and add mesh that integrates into our CPE. So they can give themselves a much larger WiFi footprint inside their home. We also include some additional support for all the peripheral devices that attach to your network. So if you've got a laptop or a printer that you need support on, we'll offer that as part of this program. And then secondly, we offered a new program called Away. And I'm really excited about this one because one of the things we've heard from customers is because this is a product that only requires power, we're not running a wire into your house or anything like that, it just requires power. And we see customers that want to use this on their boat or in their RV or while they're camping. And we created a couple of new plans specifically for those use cases that allow customers to move this as their life move along in their RV. The other thing I'm really excited about in combination with that is we struck a partnership with Camping World. And Camping World, if you're not familiar with them, is the largest camping and RV retailer in the country, and they're going to be partnering with us on these Away programs to sell to their customers and to integrate our HSI routers inside RVs that they sell. Michael Katz : And you can send your orders for our new Away product at mike.katz@... G. Sievert: By the way, you asked one last question, which is about what we're seeing with the wholesale fiber penetration rates. It's all very early because remember, these are greenfield projects. And so these were -- our partners were starting out after the wholesale partnerships were struck. But so far, so good. At a small scale, we're seeing year 1 penetration rates trending to 20%. That's above industry benchmarks. That's a good sign on your way to terminal penetration rates that are much higher than that. So everything we're seeing from these small scale so far anyway, it's going to grow. But so far, small-scale pilots in the wholesale range was very positive. And that's adding, of course, to our confidence to do news like today. So hopefully, that covers your question, Sam. Samuel McHugh : Just the cadence on FWA. G. Sievert: Cadence, tell me one more time what that part's about. Samuel McHugh : In terms of kind of net add development through the rest of the year. We've obviously seen some moves from T and others. Kind of how we should think about growth going forward. G. Sievert: We don't guide on it. But one thing we did do when we made the changes around sunsetting our [ launch era ] promotions is we indicated that this quarter would be more like 400,000 instead of the 500,000 we've seen in the past. And that's what happened. We delivered 405,000. We haven't guided on the rest of the year, but we've said we're well on track to the goal that we have always anticipated being by the end of 2025 in that 7 million to 8 million customers range. And what's interesting is that 400,000 and 500,000 net additions this quarter actually represented, as I said in my prepared remarks, a higher percentage of total broadband net adds than last year's 500-and-some thousand. And so we're sticking right in there with a very competitive more than half, that means more than all the others combined, number of net adds in the space. And so we're really happy with where it is because at the same time, we're seeing the value of this customer base start to appreciate, and that's also important, not just through pricing or promotion sunsets but through the kinds of value-added services that Mike just summarized. Jud Henry : Operator, let's squeeze in one question, please. Operator : And that question comes from Kannan Venkateshwar with Barclays. Kannan Venkateshwar : Congratulations, Jud and Cathy, once more. Mike, I'm trying to maybe nudge you along a little bit more on your prior response on broadband. You now have scale in broadband, and you're already one of the biggest operators in this market through fixed wireless. But you seem to be hedging your comments a little bit on fiber in terms of the scale or the kind of ambitions that you might have here long term. So could you maybe talk about what the ultimate scale ambitions here are? Are you viewing this as a cheap option at this point and you want to test out the market a little bit to see where it goes? Or is there a longer-term vision behind this in terms of how you see the company as a whole evolving in terms of its business mix? G. Sievert: Yes, I can say a couple of things. And one of them -- and this will be a little unsatisfying, but I do plan to lay out a more long-term view on how we think about this space at our Capital Markets Day that I mentioned would be this fall because I know that people want a multiyear view. Even that view will include an element that we intend to be patient, opportunistic. And it will also include an element that says we have no interest in fundamentally changing who we are. We are a highly successful mobile business that's mobile-first that's generating superior cash flow returns in this industry because of our superior strategy. And we're embarked upon a shareholder return program that we think makes a lot of sense in this piece of our life. So look, we're going to -- we like this area for all the reasons I said on this call. But it's premature for us to lay out kind of a detailed strategy on where we expect to be. And even when I lay it out, there will be some element of it that you'll have to be patient with us because we're going to be patient. We're going to be smart. We're going to be opportunistic because we have so much confidence in our core strategy. And hopefully, you see that patience on our part as a sign of our confidence in our core business. Jud Henry : Well, that's all the time we have for questions, and we definitely appreciate everyone joining us today. It's been an absolute privilege working with you. And if you have any additional questions, please reach out to either the Investor Relations or Media Relations departments. And with that, have a great day. G. Sievert: Thanks, everybody. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the T-Mobile First Quarter Earnings Call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect, and have a pleasant day.",

[Operator Instructions] You may also submit a question via X by sending a post to @TMobileIR or @MikeSievert using the $TMUS. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kathy Au, Senior Vice President for Investor Relations for T-Mobile US. Please go ahead. Kathy Au : Good morning. Welcome to T-Mobile's second quarter 2024 earnings call. Joining me on the call today are Mike Sievert, our President and CEO; Peter Osvaldik, our CFO; and as well as other members of the senior leadership team. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. We provide a comprehensive list of Risk Factors in our SEC filings, which I encourage you to review. Our earnings release, investor fact book and other documents related to our results, as well as reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP results discussed on this call can be found in the Quarterly Results section of the Investor Relations website. With that, let me turn it over to Mike. Mike Sievert : Thanks, Kathy. Hi, everybody. Welcome to the call. We're coming to you from New York today. If you're watching online, you can see I'm with several members of the senior team ready to discuss these strong quarterly results and our recent news, and of course to take your questions. This T-Mobile team just continues to demonstrate strong execution across the board. We're taking up our customer growth and cash flow guidance for the full year once again. I'm going to begin with a comment on customer growth because this quarter not only represented our highest ever Q2 postpaid phone net ads in company history, but we also pushed past a major milestone, 100 million customer connections. This growth was once again balanced geographically across both smaller markets in rural areas and top 100 markets. We also grew our postpaid phone gross ads at the highest rate in nearly three years. At the same time, we delivered yet another, record low upgrade rate this quarter, speaking to the strength of our customers' experience on our differentiated 5G network. Speaking of experience, let me now turn to that network leadership. We swept every category for overall network performance in the latest Opensignal and Ookla tests. According to Opensignal, T-Mobile's download speeds are up to three times as fast as peers, alongside having nearly six times the 5G availability as our next closest competitor. Our network was also awarded the most consistent by both independent third parties, a key indicator of an overall superior network experience. We continue to invest thoughtfully and in a highly capital-efficient model to extend our network leadership, and it shows. It is really a privilege to see our team's hard work show up in recognition like this and to share it with you. Okay, turning to broadband. Our fixed wireless offering continues to resonate with customers, leading us to capture a record share of industry broadband net ads this quarter. And now we have an incredible 5.6 million fixed wireless broadband customers. I hope you all saw our news from last week, as I'm excited to talk to you about our partnership with KKR to acquire Metronet. The Metronet team is the nation's fastest growing pure play fiber provider. This is a unique company and asset. They already reach over 2 million homes today, and with this partnership are expected to grow to 6.5 million homes passed by 2030, bringing consumers greater choice where they need it most, and we are equally excited to work alongside KKR's expert infrastructure team on this project. As with our Lumos JV, T-Mobile will leverage our scale, brand, distribution, and existing customer relationships to grow faster and to do it smarter. I can't highlight enough how both the Metronet and Lumos JVs represent best in class partnerships in the fiber space. Because of the partners that we've chosen and T-Mobile's unique assets and capabilities, I believe this is going to be a very successful initiative for our shareholders. Now going back to the current business and our financials. In Q2, we once again demonstrated our ability to deliver profitable growth in customers and translating that to industry-leading service revenue growth and industry-leading core adjusted EBITDA growth. That, combined with our capital efficiency, has led to a record adjusted free cash flow quarter that grew 54% year-over-year and once again led the major wireless companies in free cash flow margins. I could not be more proud of this team's results this quarter. Okay, to sum it all up, we are staying true to our Un-carrier DNA while focusing on smart and profitable growth, delivering record financial results. Our durable and differentiated model continues to outperform and I look forward to sharing more about the Un-carrier's next chapter on value creation at our Capital Markets Day, which will be in the second half of September. We're going to get that on your calendars very soon. So Peter, let's hand it to you to talk about our key financial highlights and an update on our guidance. Peter Osvaldik : Thank you very much, Mike. As you can see, we delivered yet another strong quarter. Mike already highlighted the momentum in our wireless and broadband business as well as our impressive financial results. But, before turning to our outlook, I wanted to briefly touch on our acquisition of Mint Mobile and Ultra on May 1st. We couldn't be more excited for them to join Team Magenta. From a financial perspective, the acquisition resulted in a one-time prepaid base adjustment of approximately 3.5 million customers. Subsequent to the close, the incorporation of Mint and Ultra also resulted in approximately $100 million in net additional service revenue relative to Q1, which is net of the reduction in wholesale revenues and also resulted in a small benefit to core EBITDA as the revenue was largely offset with SG&A expenses as we made additional investments into the business to drive customer growth. All right, let me shift to an update on our expectations for the remainder of 2024. Starting with customers, we are excited to raise our total postpaid customer net additions to now be between 5.4 million and 5.7 million, up 150,000 at the midpoint relative to our prior guide. We now expect the total postpaid phone net customer additions component to be approximately half of our total postpaid additions, up from our expectations last quarter, and as part of that, we anticipate normal seasonal postpaid phone churn trends in the second half, as we saw a year ago. We continue to expect our full year postpaid ARPA to be up to 3% higher year-over-year, and our industry leading service revenue growth to accelerate at a higher rate in 2024 than we delivered in 2023. We now expect our core adjusted EBITDA to be between $31.5 billion and $31.8 billion for the full year unchanged at the midpoint, which is up 9% year-over-year. This includes our latest estimate on the impact of ACP, as well as funding our higher postpaid customer guide. On ACP, we now expect the year-over-year impact to be in the range of $350 million to $450 million, driven primarily by what we're seeing at some of our wholesale providers. Okay, turning to cash CapEx, we now expect to be between $8.7 billion and $9.1 billion as we continue to invest and lead in network performance with unmatched capital efficiency. While our longer-term expectations continue to be in the $9 billion to $10 billion range annually, as we discussed before, 2024 is a bit lower given certain capital efficient network activities such as spectrum refarming and deploying additional 2.5 gigahertz licenses from auction 108, benefiting from the significant 5G radio deployments during our merger integration. We would expect Q3 to be the low water mark for the year before we accelerating in Q4 with more site upgrades and build activity. Lastly, we now expect the adjusted free cash flow, which includes payments for merger related costs to be in the range of $16.6 billion to $17 billion, up $150 million at the midpoint and up 24% year-over-year, driven by both margin expansion and capital efficiency and translating to an industry-leading service revenue to adjusted free cash flow margin. In closing, we delivered another strong quarter and expect another year of durable and differentiated growth as we continue to extend our network leadership and further scale our unique growth opportunities. We expect this to continue to translate into industry-leading growth in service revenue, core adjusted EBITDA and adjusted free cash flow, along with the highest adjusted free cash flow margin in the industry. We are looking forward to sharing more on our multi-year plans to continue to unlock shareholder value at Capital Markets Day this fall. And with that, I will now turn the call back to Kathy to begin the Q&A. Kathy. A - Kathy Au : All right, let's get to your questions. [Operator Instructions] We'll start with a question on the phone. Operator, first question, please. Operator : The first question today comes from John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead. John Hodulik : Great. Good morning, guys. Can we talk a little bit about the fiber strategy? I mean, obviously, you guys have two big deals you announced and a number of other partnerships. Should we expect more deals sort of similar to what we saw with Lumos and Metronet? Then can you give us any color on what you've seen in some of your pilot markets in terms of penetration rates and maybe the benefits of convergence, both in terms of matching broadband and wireless and what that does to maybe your wireless penetration in those markets? Thanks. Mike Sievert : Yeah, John. Sure, let me start. I'll just ask the team to jump in. First of all, we're just really excited about where we are. This was a terrific transaction for us to be able to partner with KKR to acquire Metronet on top of our previous transaction to partner to acquire Lumos. So, now we have the beginnings of a critical mass in the space. For me, this is big. I mean, these two transactions taken together with our partnerships in the wholesale arena are going to allow us to reach millions of homes. The Lumos transaction, we see 3.5 million homes passed by 2028. The Metronet transaction, we see 6.5 million homes passed by 2030. There's probably a couple more million in the wholesale partnerships we have so far. So, that's a pretty significant footprint that we put together. More importantly, we've chosen the best assets in the space. We're very excited about this. Now, to the premise of your question, I think what people can see from our strategy are a number of things. One, our bias is pure play fiber, the simplicity and elegance of that model. It's doing it with partners so that we can get more leverage on our equity dollars. It's about best in class assets that are performing and growing like we're seeing. We have some further appetite, but not much. I want to make that clear. I mean, these transactions that we have done get us millions of homes past and do it in a way that we think is really smart and positive for our shareholders. So, while we're open-minded to things that fit this strategy, it would have to be the right deal. Our appetite is somewhat limited for more. I can tell you we're not currently working on another transaction like this, and since they've been coming every month or two, I want to make that clear as well. But we're really excited about this. This is a chance for us to make a big impact in the space and to do it with teams that are already the best in class out there. So that's that piece. The second you asked about performance. We can talk about our pilot markets. Those are going well. They're earlier in phasing. So, it's hard to see, but absolutely on track. To me, what's more interesting is looking at the performance of these already in-market teams that we are now going to be partnering with. Like Metronet, we see penetrations in the upper 30s and they're more mature markets because they already passed over 2 million homes. So, we can see at more scale how that asset's performing. Now, our thesis has always been that our brand and our distribution, our embedded customer base and our know-how can actually add performance to a partner like that in a very cost-effective way. But it's on top of a team that's performing very, very well. John Hodulik : Got it. Thanks Mike. Mike Sievert : You bet. Kathy Au : Operator, next question please. Operator : The next question comes from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Simon Flannery : Great. Thank you very much. Thanks for the disclosure on ACP. Perhaps you could just give us a little bit more color on how that flows through. How much of that $350 million to $450 million was in Q2 and that impacts into Q3 and beyond? Then have you seen any benefit in terms of winning customers, say, in the Metro brand or anything like that? Then, Peter, you talked about the expectations for churn, and so for the second half of the year, what are you assuming in terms of an iPhone cycle? There's obviously a lot of excitement about an AI iPhone, given where your customers are, another load up, a great quarter. Do you think we're waiting for a bigger surge or do you think this will be looking fairly similar to last year, which is, I think, what you said? Thanks. Mike Sievert : So, Peter, I'll turn to you on the ACP question and maybe I'll comment on the upcoming cycle. Peter Osvaldik : Okay. Yeah, and thanks, Simon. As you know, and just as a little bit of a history lesson for us, is we didn't participate in ACP through our postpaid brand. So there were no subscribers added there, and through Metro, we had a very small amount of customers. We primarily serve these customers through our Assurance brand, which didn't include subscriber counts and through supporting our wholesale partners. If I think about the arc of the $350 million to $450 million impact, given, of course ACP was still in play in Q1 and partially in Q2, I\u2019d see the majority of that impact happening in the second half and even more of it in Q4 than Q3, because still a little bit of a tail coming in Q3. So, that's the best view. Primarily the majority of that, again, is going to be in wholesale and other service revenues. I'd expect Q4 to be probably the biggest impact there. Mike Sievert : Simon, our prepaid nets of 179,000 were the best quarter we've posted in years. Part of that is obviously joining with Mint and Ultra. But part of that is that we have a fantastic portfolio of brands that meet the needs of value consumers. To the premise of your question, this is a year when value consumers, because of these changes, will be re-entering the market. So, we think we're very well positioned there. Then to your question about the upgrade cycle. Look, I'm really excited about this year. I think AI is on every customer's mind. I think we're seeing the major companies really pushing ambitiously in the space. There was a lot of excitement around Apple's launches. Now, some of those technologies are good on legacy phones as well, like last year's phones we are told from those announcements. So, we'll have to see. I'm not really here to predict cycles. I'll tell you that we're very, very excited about what's coming. I want to remind people that our model isn't really dependent on that cycle. So, we've been benefiting from very low upgrade rates. In many ways, that's good for the efficiency of our model. But should upgrade rates take off due to a larger cycle based on excitement of a new phone launch, which we certainly hope for, that's a share-taking moment for us. So you either have a moment where we're able to be efficient like the last few quarters with some of these very low upgrade rates or because we are the net share-taker in this industry, a chance for more jump balls. So we design our business plan to be responsive to what happens, and at the same time, we're excited about with AI and we think consumers are excited about AI. We're looking forward to seeing what happens. Simon Flannery : Thanks Mike. Kathy Au : Operator, next question please. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Rollins with Citi. Please go ahead. Michael Rollins : Hi, good morning. I'm curious if you can unpack a bit more of where you saw the strength of the postpaid phone net ads in the quarter. You mentioned, I think, some diversified impacts during the quarter, but maybe a little bit more on where you stand on the rural market penetrations versus the top 100 and business versus consumer in terms of impacts. Then secondly, where is T-Mobile in terms of the multi-year return of capital goals? It's still up to $60 billion. And is there any change in timing or magnitude as you look at the performance in the second quarter and how much is left over the next, call it one and a half to two and a half years, if you are looking now at \u201826 to get to the destination? Thanks. Mike Sievert : Sounds great, Mike. So I'm going to start with Jon Freier to talk about what we're seeing in the consumer space and where are those customers coming from? Jon Freier : Yeah, you bet. So it's been a fantastic quarter, as you guys saw, with 777,000 postpaid phone net additions in Q2, our highest Q2 ever in the company's history, as we talked about just a few moments ago. When you look at smaller markets in rural areas, which is 40% of the U.S. population, our business continues to be incredibly responsive. As a matter of fact, in Q2, we had the highest switching that we have ever seen that quarter, and so that's great to see. We've been building a business as I've been talking to you about for the last three years, in smaller markets and rural areas with the network expansion, distribution expansion, bringing our value proposition into these markets. It's really, really doing incredibly well. So well, that we're just excited about the next turn and as we're setting our sights on ultimately getting to our fair share in the marketplace. So that's going really well. In addition to the growth in smaller markets and rural areas, we're seeing growth in the top 100 markets as well. So this is where we \u2013 Legacy, have been very successful over the last 2.5 decades, and for us to take the share position we have today and continue to build on it with more and more account growth is just great to see. Why that's really happening is because we have prime customers that are continuing to seek a better network experience. With the best-in-class 5G network and ultra-capacity, capabilities that we have in the top 100 markets, in addition to smaller markets, rural areas as well, we're really attracting those prime customers into our overall franchise. So we're just really excited about the overall growth. We're seeing good geographic responsiveness across the entire set of segments. Mike Sievert : The other thing that we said in our prepared remarks, Mike, is that we took the highest percentage of broadband nets ever in our history this quarter. 75% or so and that's huge. That adds to all this. So we're obviously now resonating with customers on multiple topics. That plays on itself in some ways. So that's terrific to see. So you're looking across geographies, across customer segments, and even across product lines and seeing strength and those things start to play on each other. Okay. And your second question was about capital allocation strategy. Maybe we can start with the highest level, Peter, on how we think about this. Peter Osvaldik : Yeah, absolutely. We've been remarkably, I think, consistent on this Mike, with regards to the multi-year arc. How we think about capital allocation has always been invest in the core business, drive the differentiation, particularly in network performance, so that we can continue to have that unique combination of best value and best network. After that, it was look for higher value accretive opportunities to create value over the long term for shareholders. When I think back around just from the last Analyst Day to now, it's been a significant amount of opportunity for us, whether that's been spectrum purchases to enhance the long term, continuing network leadership opportunity that we have, whether that's been things like Mint and Ultra and bringing that great brand into the Team Magenta family, whether that's some of the announced acquisitions of U.S. Cellular, Metronet, Lumos. So that's been great, and all while doing that and delivering the results we have, we've also now had significant, already to-date, shareholder returns. Almost 150 million shares already repurchased and shortly here, our almost fourth dividend by the end of this year. So I couldn't be more excited about what we've done here. You know, in terms of exactly what day we'll finish any sort of up to $60 billion, that's really hard to predict for you. We kind of put a mid-2026 timeframe out there, because we're going to be focused on exactly that strategy, that capital allocation. And the underlying business itself has so much free cash flow generation and unlocked there that that's the exciting part here, is we can do all three of these things in our capital allocation framework and drive significant shareholder value. I think you asked about also Q2 progression. That I will say, you saw a little bit of a different arc in Q2, and that's nothing more than just, as we think about how to set strategies in place. Much like any prudent company, we do a multi-month 10b5-1 plan, and the particular plan we had in place hadn't anticipated maybe the pace of the run-up and the share price, and so we got out of the market there because of that one plan. But now that we're past the blackout, we certainly anticipate being back in the marketplace and delivering that up to now remaining $8.7 billion, inclusive of dividends for the year. So, well on pace. The business itself is what allows all of this capital allocation and investment, and we're very proud of what we've done to-date and what the future looks like here. Mike Sievert : Well said, Peter. So, I mean, for us we're really pleased to be able to try to have it both ways here. So many incredible opportunities have presented themselves, and we have seized on those things. That's certainly what you want us to be doing, and yet at the same time, we have these ambitions for shareholder returns that are principally unchanged, and to be able to have it both ways is amazing, because you would expect the trade-offs, but that shows you the strength of our business. And we've been talking for some time, that it would take us probably into 2026 to realize the business support for that up to $60 billion in shareholder returns, and that's certainly the case as we look at all these transactions that are adding long-term value to the company. But stay tuned, and we'll do the best we can to keep that cash flow rolling in for years to come. Peter Osvaldik : That\u2019s right. Michael Rollins : Thank you. Kathy Au : Thank you, Mike. Operator, we're ready for our next question. Operator : The next question comes from Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Jim Schneider : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Two if I may. Now that you've begun to gain appreciable broadband scale with fixed wireless, can you comment on your penetration of mobile wireless subscribers inside your broadband base on fixed wireless? And then secondly, could you comment on the overall pricing environment and long-term sustainability of pricing actions and the extent to which you contemplate additional actions given the well-controlled churn of your reported in the quarter? Mike Sievert : Okay, great. You can do the math on the first one. We've now reached $5.6 million homes with our broadband product. It's just an amazing result. The strength continues with this quarter's performance being perhaps our best ever in the competitive context. And what's interesting is, our customers love this product. So we're also winning so much great feedback from third parties and from customers as to how this product performs. It gives us lots of confidence for the long-term legs of the initiative. And you can do the numerator and denominator math. We have said the majority of that $5.6 million is from existing T-Mobile customers. That means they also have mobile, and so they'd be part of our mobile accounts, but we haven't broken it out in exact numbers for you. And the rest represent kind of a land and expand strategy that we've been talking about, which is people coming in from the top 100 markets, also from smaller markets in rural areas, and choosing T-Mobile through the broadband front door, and then giving us an opportunity to sell wireless, which is a cool dynamic to see. But Mike Katz, maybe you can talk about how this product is resonating in the marketplace, because I think it's one of the things that might surprise some people. Michael Katz : Yeah, and you said it at the beginning. I think the key to the success of this product is it's a great product. And one of the things that we're seeing, and we've seen this for some time, is the satisfaction rates on our FWA product lead the industry, and every other category of broadband, including fiber, 3x higher than cable. And that is not just staying flat, it's actually improving. The delta of satisfaction between T-Mobile US, FWA, and the rest of the industry is expanding, which we're really excited about. And that's translating exactly into the results that we just talked about, where you saw the biggest share of broadband growth in Q2 coming from T-Mobile US, both because we're attracting more customers, and because we're seeing churn decrease across every 10-year cohort within the base. And it's because it's a great product, and it's serving a need in markets where there's been very, very little choice. So it's a just fantastic job by the team. Mike Sievert : James, onto your second question about pricing, I can tell you that our strategy, which has been in place for so many years, is not a strategy that we have any interest in changing. We are the service revenue growth leader in this industry. We are the post-paid service revenue growth leader by a wide margin, and we do that because we have a value proposition that customers trust us around. And that's not to say that we're not going to make changes. We made changes this year to keep up with the times, first in a decade. But we like being the value leader, and that translates through our unique strategy into industry-leading revenue growth performance. Now, what you also see is the growth of per-customer revenues rising. We talked about our average revenue per account growing at well over 2%. And those kinds of things are great to see, but I want to make sure that people don't misinterpret our actions as anything other than keeping up with the times and reinforcing our strategy, which is a deeply trusted covenant with the world's consumers, American consumers, that we are and will be the best value in the marketplace. And that sometimes includes changes that we'll make along the way. And you saw us do that, and I think you saw us perform through it, because of that trusted relationship that we have with our consumers. Jim Schneider : Thank you. Kathy Au : Thanks, Jim. Operator, next question please. Operator : The next question comes from David Barden with Bank of America. Please go ahead. David Barden : Hey guys, thanks so much for taking the questions. Just a couple of follow-ups, if I could. I want to kind of come back to Simon's question. Mike, obviously with the Wall Street Journal article out there, suggesting that the reason you are being coy about the fiber strategy is because that's the straight, you know that's the game theory. You don't want people to believe that you have a bigger fiber strategy. In the Metronet press release, you called out, it was unique, it was capital light, but you kind of said the same thing about Lumos. So you had a $1 billion capital light transaction, then you had a $5 billion capital light transaction. Is there a reason to believe that you either need to do a $10 billion capital light transaction or a $20 billion capital light transaction? Or is there a reason that you definitely will not do those things? If you could kind of put a stake in the ground on that, I think a lot of people would be listening to that. I think the second follow-up would be just, I think in answer to, I think it was Mike's question on sources of postpaid phone growth. I know that you guys had some real success in enterprise. Hopefully, if you could elaborate a little bit on how that contributed to the quarter, it would be great. Thank you. Mike Sievert : Sure Dave, we'll do both of those things. First of all, I'll just go back to my comments from a few minutes ago and reiterate. Our appetite for further transactions in this space is limited. We really like the ones we've done. They give us a material footprint, and we're not currently working on something else like it. That being said, we're open-minded. You hire us on your behalf to be pragmatic, practical, strategic, and I think people can see our strategy. And if there's the right partner, the right asset, the right pricing on it, the right strategy, a bias and preference for pure play, we would be open-minded, but with a limited further appetite. And part of that is we're balancing all of our objectives. You heard Peter talk about our capital allocation strategy. We take that seriously. We think our investors like the fact that we have a pure play elegant model. As we step into fiber, we're keeping the elegance of that with a pure play fiber model. We want to be an outstanding execution machine that's able to execute really, really well in the marketplace. And we don't have any interest in changing the complexion largely of who we are as a company, because we perform so well. So, we're open-minded, but our appetite is limited from here on out. David Barden : Thank you. Mike Sievert : Now, second question, we'll turn to Callie Field to talk about what's going on in the business and enterprise space. Callie Field : Thanks Mike. I appreciate the question, Dave. I'll start with, once again, we outpaced our benchmark competitor in overall phone nets and phone churn. And we saw, once again, positive port trends across all segments against all of our competitors. Our CLVs are healthy. We're very pleased with the contribution of the business to overall growth. And what I'll also mention is that in S&B in particular, we had our best quarter ever in postpaid phone nets, up almost 20% year-over-year. In enterprise, our win share continues to be our overall share. And I'll also mention, our prices are competitive. We continue to be a value leader, but customers are choosing us because we're the best. We have the best, the fastest, the largest, the most reliable, most consistent network. And what we've seen is that CIOs and CTOs at large enterprises and even in the federal government space are really seeing what a 5G standalone core, what a commercially available network slicing and advanced network solutions can do for them. And we're starting to see some growth in our funnels and customers really coming to us to evaluate our entire solution portfolio. And so we see both growth, but also opportunities to expand our existing relationship with customers in growing ARPA. And some examples of that that I'll just share really quickly is, the largest oil and gas company in the United States chose us to provide advanced network solutions in their innovation lab, but they also for all of their mobile workforce selected T-Mobile to provide phones and tablets and then added onto that, our SASE T-SIM secure products. So that's an example of how we're expanding our relationship with our customers in a way that's profitable and we're very pleased with the business overall. Mike Sievert : Well said. David Barden : Thank you both. Kathy Au : Thanks Dave. Next question please. Operator : The next question comes from Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead. Craig Moffett : Hi, good morning. I want to return to the fiber strategy for a second. Can you talk \u2013 I know you've said in the past that this is not really part of a convergence strategy, but it's been so much talked about by your peers and competitors. You've obviously learned quite a bit in offering a bundle of wireless mobile and fixed wireless access with your FWA product. How are you thinking about convergence and the need for a converged offer? Because again, we go back to the same conversation we've been having about what to expect going forward. The two deals you've got give you eventually 10% coverage of the country by the end of the decade. Is that a sufficient strategy for you or do you need to think differently about what your converged offers and coverage will be? Mike Sievert : Hey Craig, great question. Like I said, over the long haul, we're open-minded. We're very proud of these transactions. We want to execute them extremely well. We want to get them closed and we'll take a wider lens and see where we are and what we've learned. One thing we feel very strongly about, and I'm not sure I like the phrasing \u2018not believers in convergence.\u2019 I'll parse it differently for you. One thing we feel very strongly about is that these transactions are not defensive of our mobile business. We believe our mobile business stands strongly alone. Consumer choice has been made very clear that wireless is a deeply considered sale. It's the primary purchase decision in a connected life and that people will choose the wireless company that is right for them. And we believe we will compete effectively as a pure play wireless company, regardless of our simultaneous participation in broadband. That being said, convergence is real and that the customers that buy both, buy them together, and we have bundles today. Many of our 5.6 million broadband customers today purchased that in a bundle and realized discounts by doing so and there's nothing wrong with that. We think that's a dynamic that makes sense. Customers love discounts. Discounts make sense to customers, but they can come in many forms. And so I want to \u2013 convergence is happening and that some people are buying these things together and they kind of like that. It's not happening in the sense that if you don't have this product, you can't compete in mobile. We have zero evidence to support that thesis, and so I want to make sure that we parse it that way. And then secondly, of course, over the long haul we're open-minded about this. I just want to make sure that we're really smart about how we do it. And for us, joining with some of these very, very high quality teams who are doing this the best in the country and are doing it in an elegant and pure way, and at a pace that's really impressive, is a fantastic way for us to step into this. We're not going to make further decisions about where to go from here until we're able to get more experience in the ground. Kathy Au : Thanks Craig. Operator, next question please. Operator : The next question comes from Jonathan Chaplin with New Street Research. Please go ahead. Jonathan Chaplin : Thanks Mike. Just one follow-up on Craig's question. So AT&T said they are seeing 500 basis points of additional mobile market share in markets where they've got fiber. I take it from what you just said, sort of zero evidence of a convergence benefit to mobile, that you are just not seeing that. Would you think that there's sort of the benefit that AT&T's seeing there is really just sort of a selection bias? And then I have a bunch of questions on the Metronet deal. I'm hoping you guys can give us some more details. First on, how much of the $4.9 billion went towards buying the retail business versus the network? How much of the $4.9 billion stays on the balance sheet to fund the future investments? How much cash is coming in from KKR and Oak Hill alongside your cash? And how much additional debt you expect to take on in order to get to the $6.5 million? Mike Sievert : Okay. Well Peter, why don't you just shift the spreadsheet over there to go? Honestly Jon, let me answer the first one. First of all, it's very hard for us to tell, and I think even for others who are saying those things to tell what's causal. And so it does appear that the statement is true that that competitor's share is higher where they also have broadband, but they have broadband in places of their historic strength, and including back when their broadband product wasn't that interesting and so it's hard to tell what's causal there. The one thing that does appear to be linked in a way that's somewhat causal is that churn looks to be lower. And when people buy these bundled offers, there does appear to be a marginal impacted churn, which is attractive. And again, that's one of the thesis for why we like this. We think we can outperform a purely disinterested financial investor because of the embedded customer base. But remember, churn and wireless is already historically low. So there's only so much benefit you can count on from that on the wireless side. And it's one of the reasons why, again, we don't think it's necessary as a defense of our mobile business far from it. Peter Osvaldik : Yeah, and on the Metronet Deal, before I ship over the spreadsheet to everybody, I think, if we step back to your point, there's a number of components of the $4.9 billion. And one of those is, of course, 50% ownership in the JV itself. Another element of it is actually acquiring all of the residential customers as well as the exclusive rights to distribute, service, etcetera, residential customers in the future as the build continues. And then the third part is funding the JV itself. So that, to get to that 6.5 million households past number, that business plan as it stands, actually contemplates the need for no additional equity contributions. Of course, the JV itself will be appropriately levered, and this is a JV that's off of our balance sheet with counterparty. So I can't unfortunately disclose all elements of this, but those are the three main components. And in fact, not only does it not require additional equity contributions, we anticipate, that again to meet that business plan of 6.5 million households past that will get dividends back from the JV during the pendency of this through 2030, well in excess of a $1 billion. So yeah, I can't parse every element of it for you out, but it is all three of those together, as well as kind of the dividends coming back and the great pre-funding to keep this build machine going and get to that 6.5 million. Jonathan Chaplin : Got it. One last sort of follow-up question, just on \u2013 okay, great. Thanks K. Mike Sievert : That's okay, Jon. Go ahead. Jonathan Chaplin : You'll take it? Just on the business consumer mix question, on fixed wireless broadband, can you give us a sense of how much of the ads coming in are from business and how that's evolved? Mike Sievert : Sure, yeah. We have \u2013 we saw this product across all of our major brands and segments and so we have post-paid consumer, we just have prepaid consumer and we have business. And so far it's been predominantly, the majority of it has been post-paid consumer. It's going really well, and it kind of speaks to the ongoing opportunity that we have in the other segments, and so that's just how it's been flowing in. The product is really resonating with post-paid consumers and I talked earlier in the call about how these things tend to kind of feed on themselves. And inside of this segment, we're benefiting from so much person-to-person talk value. As people get this, they tell their friends about it, how much money they're saving. You heard from Mike about how this product is resonating. I mean, it's really performative and that surprises some people pleasantly and so those things kind of feed on it. So I think a lot of that opportunity might still be in front of us on the business side. Jonathan Chaplin : Got it. Thanks guys. Kathy Au : Okay. Thank you. Next question, please. Operator : The next question comes from Kannan Venkateshwar with Barclays. Please go ahead. Kannan Venkateshwar : Thank you. So Mike, maybe on the fiber part, it could be helpful to understand how you think about the build plan. In the sense that, is this maybe a strategy to open up capacity on the fixed wireless side by maybe migrating some subscribers over from fixed wireless to fiber, or is this just an additional opportunity to expand the footprint? And so in that sense, do you really need to have an overlap as you think through the fiber build plan with your fixed wireless footprint, or could you just think about this completely independently? And then, Peter, maybe from a housekeeping perspective, there's a lot of puts and takes in terms of EBITDA guidance this year. We obviously have Mint, and there is ACP, the price increases. So maybe if you could just parse out the components, just to understand what the core trend lines look like, that would be very helpful. Thank you. Mike Sievert : Okay Kannan, those are great questions. First of all, on the fiber and the interplay with our fixed wireless business, actually a fantastic question. I'll turn to Mike Katz. Michael Katz : Yeah, it is a fantastic question, because we see \u2013 one of the reasons why we're excited about fiber is we do think it is quite complementary to our fixed wireless business. Both, in situations where customers that are looking for a different kind of performance, like symmetrical speeds, have an upsell path. But also because, remember, our fixed wireless business is an excess capacity model. So we sell fixed wireless in places in the network where we have excess capacity that won't be consumed either now or in the future by normal mobile usage, and that's where we sell fixed wireless. And in places where we deploy fiber, there's an opportunity for us to take some of the demand that we're seeing in fixed wireless, where those excess capacity pockets don't exist and move them to fiber. So there's really a bunch of complementary features to it. I think to your question, I think it's a really interesting one. I can tell you, it's not the primary thesis of why we're doing fiber. I think we're doing fiber for all the reasons that Mike and Peter talked about. We think our unique asset set allows us to drive enterprise value and gives us advantage in fiber, that's the primary thesis. But I think a really unique potential tertiary opportunity is the one that you pointed out, where fixed wireless users as they migrate to fiber, opens up potentially additional spots for fixed wireless, because of the nature of the excess capacity model. So I think it's a really interesting point and probably an opportunity for us as we deploy more fiber footprint. Mike Sievert : And to illustrate that, we have a long, long list of people who have expressed interest in our fixed wireless product that we're not able to serve, because we only put it in places where there's open capacity. Michael Katz : Yeah, that's right. I think that's one of the assets that we bring here, is that we have demand in some sense that exceeds supply because of excess capacity that we can immediately move into fiber. Mike Sievert : So, great question, and on to the second piece Peter. Peter Osvaldik : Yeah. I think it's a really astute question in terms of what's happening underneath and what are all the puts and takes of the EBITDA guide and how should I think about the core business underneath, so very, very important. And of course, predominantly what's happening with core EBITDA and the ongoing tremendous growth, 9% year-over-year at the midpoint of the guide is continued profitable share taking from a customer perspective. You see, not only our ability to deliver, of course, outsized customer ads, whether that's in postpaid phone or total postpaid or the prepaid side of the house, but also translate that vis-a-vis ARPA and other initiatives into service revenue growth that's outsized as well from an industry perspective. So the vast majority of what you are seeing on the trend line of EBITDA growth, is the continued execution by this team on outsized customer share taking and translation of that into financial performance. I'd say the counter to that in terms of a one-year impact. So EBITDA perhaps would be even better had it not been for ACP, and the impacts of the wind down of the government program, which again, that is that $350 million to $450 million range, which we'll see primarily in the second half of this year. And that'll distort the trend line until that fully winds down, which we anticipate be fully gone by Q4. And then we'll see be back to kind of this profitable growth element of it taking over without this one-time distortion. Kannan Venkateshwar : Good. Thank you. Mike Sievert : Shall we take a moment to see what's online, Kathy? We do have questions coming in online. We could hit in a rapid fire manner. Tech Life Channel, are you completely averse to copper assets or would you consider them as a way to achieve more fiber? I think the words I would use is, strong bias. We love the idea of the elegant model of a pure play fiber asset. The teams that have that are performing beautifully, so it's a bias. It's not a complete aversion to the premise of your question. Roger Entner, how is TFB progressing? Callie, you spoke earlier about enterprise strength. What about small and medium business? You want to talk about that briefly? Callie Field : Yeah, we continue to see strong growth. Obviously our legacy business began in S&B. It's where we have the most share. It's where our channels and assets really shine in our core wireless business. And something I'm really pleased that our team has been able to do is to, as I was mentioning in enterprise, build a broader solutions portfolio that really addresses the needs of small businesses. So in both small and medium sized business, we continue to grow share. We continue to see very attractive CLVs and I'm pleased with the pace of the business. It's also a place where we see continued quarter-over-quarter growth in our fixed wireless business and still have opportunities to go back to our base and open up more opportunities in fixed wireless. So a lot of really good things going on for our small businesses there. Mike Sievert : The strong CLVs across both consumer \u2013 sorry, across both small and medium and across enterprise really points to the fact that customers are buying this product for the reasons you outlined, which is just a great product. It's also a great value, but they are buying it because it's a great product and you see that in the strong CLV development, so great point. Walt Picheck [ph], the U.S. is a big opportunity. So why not more fiber? Why stop there? Kabletown, with a K, would say this confirms the questionable return on investment. Look, we're open minded over the long haul, as I said, and I would take exception to the questionable return on investment as it relates to T-Mobile. I really don't know enough about this to know whether or not in the absence of T-Mobile, a lot of the companies out there are going to perform with great ROIs. But T-Mobile can outperform, because we have billions of dollars and years of embedded investment to create a capability and know-how that we bring to the game. And so you could actually \u2013 the things could be simultaneously true. I don't know. Cable could say, look, these guys will struggle. We don't plan to struggle. We bring a lot to the fight. Bill Ho, what's the long-term trend of ARPA service revenue contribution? We talked about revenue development, but I think talking about ARPA and where we see ARPA going as a key measure of revenue per customer. Any comments on that, Peter? Peter Osvaldik : Yeah, of course, I won't update long-term guidance here, but much like what you saw in 2024 and what our guide is, our strategy has been to continue to increase ARPA. And it's because this network, consumers businesses are hungry for more of the experience that this network creates and provides, whether that's in the postpaid phone category itself, whether that's in other connected devices such as fixed wireless, watches, tablets, new connectivity solutions out there. That is what's driving ARPA expansion. And that's the strategy, share-taking combined with ARPA expansion, earned ARPA expansion with the network experience that they have and the value leadership that we provide, to continue to drive for the long haul ARPA growth. That's the strategy here. And of course, we'll have more on longer-term trends at another time. Callie Field : Thank you. Mike Sievert : Cathy, back to the chorus. Callie Field : Sounds good. Operator, we're ready for the next question on the phone. Operator : The next question comes from Brian Kraft with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Brian Kraft : Hi, good morning. I had two if I could. First, volumes have obviously remained very strong across the industry so far this year. Every company has beat on net ads, including cable. Based on what you're saying, just curious as to where you think the industry volume strength is coming from and how sustainable it is from here. And then secondly, Mike had talked about the adaptability of the business plan to respond to opportunities that arise in the market. I just wanted to ask, when we think about the EBITDA guidance, what is that assuming broadly about upgrade trends and/or industry switching activity in the second half of the year? Is there room in there for those to increase or if we did see an uptick in upgrades in industry switching, could that put some incremental pressure on EBITDA? Thank you. Mike Sievert : Okay Brian, I'll take the first one and ask Peter to comment on the second. You'll find it a little unsatisfying as an answer though, which is we find the industry level kind of hard to predict. The Q2 came in higher than we had expected in some cases and our business landed right about where we were planning. But if you look at the wider lens, the industry context was a little hard to predict and you kind of see that in our guide. We were able to flow through our Q2 beat versus consensus in our guide. It was a very strong quarter for us. You see that in the second half where we're sort of side eyeing that industry question because we just don't know. We're very confident in our plans for the second half. as: But maybe Peter, you could talk about what upgrade rates are assumed, generally speaking. Peter Osvaldik : Generally speaking, yeah. I mean look, [Multiple Speakers] I'll just send out all of my spreadsheets and we'll be in a good place, but that's exactly right. It's hard to predict. Again, if it's a higher upgrade rate, higher moment of switching, that creates higher ultimate customer value and enterprise value for us as well being the share taker. So that's part of the reason why we're always in a range scenario with EBITDA. Yes, we have the ACP element of it, but we also have the element of what is the opportunity going to be. If you see an opportunity where industry share taking can flow to our benefit more than we think, of course, we'll take it. You saw that happen in Q2 as we saw opportunities, we made investments and we took more shares. So that's part of the range. We are excited, of course, much like we all are at every holiday season and every new iPhone introduction as a moment of potential share taking. Can't predict exactly what's going to happen. But the EBITDA range gives us flexibility to achieve exactly what we want to with the plan. Kathy Au : Thank you. Brian Kraft : Thanks to you both. Kathy Au : Next question, please. Operator : The next question comes from Peter Supino with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Peter Supino : Hey, good morning. A couple of questions on broadband. In FWA, I wonder if you could describe how the mix of your gross ads has shifted, say from \u201823 maybe looking out to \u201825 or at least 24. I'm wondering if the percentage of gross ads or number of gross ads in dense metro and higher value, more dense suburban areas is falling and whether it's rising in smaller towns. Then another FWA question relating to the longer term of the fallow-capacity model. Using one cell as an example, today's fallow-capacity doesn't necessarily equal fallow-capacity three years from now to the extent that consumption across mobile and home is rising. And so as cells that today have room in the future get busier, is densification sometimes the right answer? Thank you. Mike Sievert : Great. Well, let me start with the second one, which is the way our fallow-capacity model works is pretty sophisticated. We look at every sector and, in fact, smaller geographic elements than a sector and look at the predicted, not current, capacity usage of that sector, assuming ongoing share taking in line with historical norms of share taking in mobile phones, and assuming dramatic growth of usage of mobile phones on a per mobile phone basis, and ongoing growth in line with historical norms of usage for the actual broadband customers that we bring on. We take all that forward and drag it right, years, and then approve applicants for broadband only when that capacity will still be there. So that's one of the reasons why we have hundreds of thousands of people waiting for this product on waiting lists, because right down to your particular address, unless we're convinced that product will serve you for years to come in a way that drives your happiness and does it without interrupting anybody's mobile service, we don't accept your application. It's a very sophisticated model. One of the online questioners said that Verizon commented that they are balancing and capping at 400,000 a quarter in order to avoid disrupting mobile subs. Are you doing the same thing? And the answer is, no, because our broadband subscribers don't do that by virtue of how we do this. So it's a really sophisticated model that we're quite proud of. Now I forget the second half. Peter Osvaldik : Yeah, it was really a question around the breakout of gross ads and are we still seeing the same amount coming from urban, suburban high quality? And the answer is, relatively yes. Of course, as we continue to build into smaller markets from rural areas, which again, I remind everybody for us, it's 40% of the population of the top 100 markets and everything else is smaller markets or rural areas, which has a lot of geography, a lot of great customers in it. So overall, yeah, the majority is still coming from cable. The breakout between smaller markets and rural areas in our top 100 is relatively the same, and they continue to be and more so very high quality ads. In fact, ARPUs are up year-over-year. Churn is down year-over-year. Obviously Mike Katz spoke a little bit about customer sentiment towards this product. So we couldn\u2019t be more proud of how the gross ads are continuing to flow in, and the makeup of those and the value that we are creating for customers as well as for T-Mobile itself. Peter Supino : Thank you both. Kathy Au : Thanks Peter. Operator we have time for one last question. Please go ahead. Operator : The last question today comes from Sebastiano Petti with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. Sebastiano Petti : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Just a quick couple of housekeeping questions. On FWI, I think you are currently in the market with an online promo, I think for $55, but you had raised prices earlier in the year. Just help us think about the strategy behind that to the extent of how it fits into the overall strategy, particularly Peter, what you just kind of described to Mike, what you've been talking about on the call as well. Then another housekeeping question, you'd mentioned, I think Peter in your prepared remarks, that you expect normal seasonal postpaid phone churn trend in the second half of the year, similar to a year ago. Should we be thinking about that on a sequential basis or more relative to the prior year? Just trying to get a sense of what you meant there in terms of the guidance. Thank you. Peter Osvaldik : I\u2019ll start with the second one. Yeah, on the churn, I really meant kind of sequential trends. So what we saw last year was Q2 to Q3 sequentially was up 10 bps and Q3 to Q4 sequentially was up 9 bps, and so those are generally the sort of trends we'd expect. So as you think about what we just delivered in Q2, I'd anticipate a similar sequential increase in terms of number of bps, and similarly then from Q3 to Q4 of this year. So that's kind of the housekeeping around that. Mike Sievert : But we kind of wish it was that precise. Peter Osvaldik : Yeah, it's not that precise. That's the general expectation for sure. Mike Sievert : On the 5G broadband pricing, I would say you were asking what should be read into that from a strategy standpoint, and I would say nothing. What you'll see from us is we try things, we learn, we have test cells, we do things online, we do things in markets, and we're always looking to see kind of what resonates and what people respond to. But overall, the general trend for us, is that we are post the period where we were discounting every customer all the time during the introductory years. We've moved back to a normative pricing that we think is highly attractive, and we like to understand those elasticities. So you'll always see us doing things. Before I hand it to Kathy to wrap things up, I will just tell you, thank you for all these great questions. It's just an absolute pleasure to be able to talk about this team's outstanding performance quarter-after-quarter. We kept our prepared remarks to just 11 minutes so we could get to lots and lots of your questions. That's because we love you and we listen to you. So we try to be responsive. And Kathy, we\u2019ll let you wrap this up. Kathy Au : Thanks Mike. That's all the time we have for questions, and we appreciate everyone joining us today. We look forward to speaking to you again soon. If you have any further questions, you may contact the Investor Relations or Media Department. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the T-Mobile second quarter earnings call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect and have a pleasant day.",

[Operator Instructions] You may also submit a question via X by sending a post to @TMobileIR or @MikeSievert using the $TMUS. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kathy Au, Senior Vice President of Investor relations for T-Mobile US. Please go ahead. Kathy Au : Good afternoon. Welcome to T-Mobile's Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. Joining me on our call today are Mike Sievert, our President and CEO; Peter Osvaldik, our CFO, as well as other members of the senior leadership team. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. We provide a comprehensive list of risk factors in our SEC filings, which I encourage you to review. Our earnings release, investor fact book, and other documents related to our results, as well as reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP results discussed on this call, can be found in the quarterly results section of the investor relations website. With that, let me now turn it over to Mike. Mike Sievert : OK, thanks, Kathy. Hi, everybody. Welcome to the Q3 call. We're coming to you from Bellevue today, and I'm joined by several members of our senior leadership team to talk about another outstanding quarter for T-Mobile. Now, given our recent Capital Markets Day, Peter and I are going to keep our remarks pretty light so that we can get right to your questions. And before I get into our quarter, I do want to take a moment to recognize our team for their hard work around the clock to help our customers, fellow employees, and communities to get back on their feet in the wake of hurricanes Helene and Milton. It was devastating to have back-to-back storms of this scale form in such rapid succession, but I am so proud of how our team showed up. From readiness to recovery, their tireless efforts and use of innovative technologies made a huge difference in affected communities. Okay, turning to the quarter. In short, it was a really strong one. In fact, Q3 is an example of the consistent execution we talked about a few weeks ago as a core enabler of our bold multi-year plan. As you know, achieving that plan is predicated on delivering strong results reliably and repeatedly to keep pace with our ambition. And we did just that in Q3, empowering us to raise our 2024 guidance yet again. I'll start with our mobile business. We delivered the best Q3 postpaid phone net adds in a decade, fueled by record low Q3 postpaid phone churn and continued year-over-year growth in gross adds. We also continued to lead the industry in share of switchers, and we grew share of households in both top 100 and smaller markets and rural areas. Our powerful combination of our best network, best value, and best customer experience continues to be a winning formula. We believe we have lots of room to run in our underpenetrated areas and segments, including among those who shop primarily on network attributes all across this country. Now, you heard us lay down some pretty audacious digitalization goals at our Capital Markets Day event, and we're making steady progress. I'm proud to share that our total digital mix of iPhone launch sales in Q3 is up 40% just year-over-year, and that for the first time the majority of T-Mobile branded iPhone pre-orders this year were digital. This highlights the early progress we've already begun to make in further simplifying and digitalizing and transforming the customer buying experience, and it validates the appetite our customers have for buying online, when they are given the option for a more seamless process. Our customer momentum also continues in broadband, where we delivered industry-leading net adds once again and reached a major milestone of 6 million customers in just three years. We're now halfway to our long-term target of 12 million customers by 2028. Our performance is fueled by our leading 5G network, which was recently awarded once again as having the best 5G availability in the world by Opensignal. And our industry-leading technology will continue to further differentiate us, as more and more new handsets come into the marketplace that can take advantage of our new technologies like voiceover new radio, our incredible four-way carrier aggregation technology, and so many other things. Across the board, our team is doing awesome work to further extend our 5G network leadership, for the benefit of customers. And they're noticing the superior speed, capacity, and consistency relative to our competition. Okay, moving on to our financials. In Q3, we once again demonstrated our ability to deliver profitable customer growth, which we translated to industry-leading service revenue growth, including year-over-year post-paid service revenue growth about 2 times that of peers, driven by our highest ARPA growth in seven years, as we continue to deepen customer relationships. Our core adjusted EBITDA growth of 9% led the industry by a wide margin. That combined with our unparalleled capital efficiency led once again to industry leading free cash flow conversion. I said I'd keep it brief, so let me sum it up. Our formula for generating outsized value creation from focusing on smart and profitable growth continues to work really well. We have lots of runway ahead of us to continue to deliver profitable industry leading growth as we drive forward on the ambitious plan we shared with you last month. Okay, Peter, over to you to provide an update on our guidance, please. Peter Osvaldik : All right. Thanks, Mike, and thanks everybody for joining us. As Mike highlighted, we delivered yet another fantastic quarter and are raising our guidance yet again. So let me provide a quick update on our expectations for 2024. Starting with customers, we are once again raising total postpaid customer net additions and now expect between $5.6 million and $5.8 million, up $150,000 at the midpoint relative to our prior guide. We now expect the postpaid phone customer net additions component of that total to be approximately 3 million for the full year. We expect our full year postpaid ARPA to be up around 3% year-over-year with industry-leading service revenue growth continuing to accelerate at a higher rate in 2024 than we delivered in 2023. We now expect core adjusted EBITDA to be between $31.6 million and $31.8 billion for the full year, up $50 million at the midpoint. Turning to Cash CapEx, we now expect to be between $8.8 billion and $9 billion, unchanged at the midpoint. Our longer-term expectations continue to be in the $9 billion to $10 billion range annually, as we outlined for you at our Capital Markets Day a few weeks ago. And finally, we now expect adjusted free cash flow, which includes payments for merger-related costs to be in the range of $16.7 billion to $17 billion, up $50 million at the midpoint, driven by both margin expansion and capital efficiency, resulting in industry-leading service revenue to free cash flow conversion. In closing, when we spoke with you all a few weeks ago at Capital Markets Day, we outlined an ambitious plan of evolving from challenger to champion. One that requires consistently strong execution. Our Q3 results are another proof-point on that journey with our unique combination of the best value, best network, and best experiences, continuing to resonate with customers. And with that, I will now turn the call back to Kathy to begin the Q&A. Kathy? Kathy Au : Okay, let's get to your questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator, first question, please. Operator : Our first question comes from Simon Flannery from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question. Simon Flannery : Great, thank you very much. Good evening. I wonder, Mike, if you could just talk to the buyback or Peter, the pacing of that. It sounds like you were very active in the last few weeks, but less so in Q3. I remember last quarter you'd been active in June. Was that the grid -- was that Capital Markets Day? What's the thought about this and how you think about the rest of this because obviously it's been sort of stop start for a little while here. And then Peter, maybe just help us on wholesale. You'd message that there would be impacts there from ongoing secular factors from ACP, from Mint Mobile, just help us level set as we see this down to the sort of [$700 million] (ph) at quarter level. Is there still some more to go there? How should we think about that going forward? Thank you. Mike Sievert : I think, Simon. First of all, I'll hand it to Peter for both those questions. But first of all, I just want to say congratulations to you on your retirement and thank you -- first of all, for keeping us all honest. But I also know that investors have hung on your every word for many years, and you've served them so well. So we're all going to miss you. And I thought maybe your last question would be a softball. But instead, come on, Peter. What happened with those buybacks? You don't ever disappoint there, Simon. Peter Osvaldik : Yeah, thank you so much, Simon. You know, what happened, both on the Q2 call, we anticipated to be back in the marketplace, And we saw a similar dynamic happen after our Q2 call, as we saw before Q2. And that was our trading plan really didn't anticipate the faster than expected or earlier than expected run up in the share price. And what that meant for us is really, it gave us an opportunity after that happened a second time to step back and rethink strategically how we wanted to approach the buybacks. And we did that. And now you see something that's less informed by quick movements towards where we think it's going and more of a consistent execution. Still thoughtful of many factors. Of course, I can't get into all of those, but it's a little bit of a change in strategy. And that's what you saw happen after that strategic change. Since that point, we've been in the market place consistently. So that's the buyback story. And you know, on wholesale, much like I said, in 2025, what we expect is the trough of wholesale and other service revenue. And underpinning that though, there's actually growth in wholesale and our partnerships if you consider, as you mentioned, both the ACP decline, which we now expect to be towards the higher end of that [$350 million to $450 million] (ph) range that we gave previously. And of course, the long planned transition of TracFone away to Verizon, as they complete that merger integration. So the underlying dynamics are great when you take out the ACP and the TracFone. And that's what we expect as we hit that trough to continue to fuel growth past 2025. Simon Flannery : Great. Thanks a lot. Mike Sievert : You bet. Okay. Kathy Au : Operator next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from John Hodulik from UBS. Please go ahead with your question. John Hodulik : Hey, thank you. Maybe two if I could guys. First on spectrum, there's been some, you know, some move -- you guys have made some moves in the market. It looks like you're trading some of your 3.45 for some 2.5. Just any thoughts on the strategy there? Obviously Verizon buying some spectrum from USM. Are you guys also in the market for additional spectrum at the right price? Maybe an update on the 800 megahertz spectrum. That's one topic that didn't come up at your Capital Markets Day. And then secondly, some good info on the digitalization efforts, Mike. I mean, is there a way for you to sort of frame or quantify maybe the potential upside or improvement in costs you can get as you sort of work through that process? Thanks. Mike Sievert : Well, let's do the digitalization one first, John. If you recall at Capital Markets Day, we laid out a pretty ambitious plan for value creation over the years. And Signal Day 2027 core adjusted EBITDA, about $10 billion at the high point of our guidance above 2023 levels. And so that kind of shows you the potential. Now a lot of that's revenue growth, which is partly driven by digitalization. And a lot of that is recrafting the underlying operation, getting more precise in our marketing, preventing customer problems that are a source of so much value loss in this industry. And so we didn't unpack all the details of which parts to drive which parts. But I can tell you that we arrived at that plan after working on it for almost two years. And after detailing out a 14-quarter quarter-by-quarter detailed plan of what will land when. So that we have the barometers of knowing if we're running ahead of our plan that we can increase our promises to you. If it looks like we're going to be running behind, we can course correct, that's how we do these things. And if you go back to our 2021 plans when a lot of people thought what we said back then was unbelievably ambitious, and we did it. But we did it because we had a detailed plan. We don't always provide a lot of transparency. I think we do a good job there. We provide more than others on transparency, but we also have to keep some of the secret sauce to ourselves for competitive reasons. To make sure you saw the barometers underneath that, though, we put some markers out there. We said we wanted person-to-person customer service interactions to be reduced by 75% in the planning horizon. That's a big marker. We said we wanted the majority of all activations to be digital and many other markers that we put out there. And one of the things that Peter said was that the actual business plan that we laid out didn't assume full achievement of each of those KPIs. So in a world where we deliver each and every one of those KPIs, there is upside beyond the guidance range. And so we try to put out a plan that's realistic, but at the same time, ambitious. And that's kind of what we mean by Challenger to Champion. It's a plan for the future that's an evolution from Challenger to Champion that really causes us to have to do things that nobody's ever done and really rethink how this industry works, as you see us doing in so many ways. And hopefully, that came across well at Capital Markets Day. Now switching to spectrum. You asked a couple of different questions. One of them was about 3.45 specifically, and I'll just ask Ulf to talk about what's going on there. Ulf Ewaldsson : Right. Well, thanks, Mike. Well, on our journey, when we are building our network, which is a dense 5G multilayer network. We are always working with our different layers and the different spectrum assets we have. We have a superior sub-6 gigahertz holding, today which is providing us with our enormous capacity benefit. And in that, we always value spectrum short-term, long-term and mid-term. And we see that 3.45 is not part of this plan. So that's why we did it. Then this transaction goes through a number of different approvals and so on, and we will see. But the way we did it, we are very satisfied, I could say, with how it came out. On the 800 band, we concluded the auction without really a bid that was qualifying. That gives us now new optionality really. We can either deploy it or we could look at doing something to benefit monetarily from it. So we have those optionalities as we go forward. We're always working on our spectrum portfolio and continue to build this leading 5G network based on it. Mike Sievert : Hope that answer the question, John. Kathy Au : Okay. Thanks, John. Operator, next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from David Barden from Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question. David Barden : Hi guys. Thanks so much. So I guess to start, I guess, would be for Mike, you were in Germany at the DT-CMD, where they kind of elaborated on the hope that they would see that their interest -- ownership interest in T-Mobile would rise. I think they said to the high 50% range from the current levels. Can you elaborate a little bit on your understanding of how that timing might work because that will impact how the mechanics of the buyback on the float work, and it could magnify that effect and make it much more beneficial for the US investors? And then the second question, if I could, Maybe, Peter, your 3 million postpaid phone net kind of target for the year implies about 100,000 reduction in year-over-year nets in fourth quarter versus flat year-over-year in the third quarter. Is that just being conservative? Or is there something else to watch out for? Thank you. Mike Sievert : Okay. Well, I'll start, Dave. And I'm sorry to disappoint you without being able to really answer the question much. I guess the prototypical answer would be, you kind of have to ask them. I will say that in this long journey, being an independent company with DT, as our controlling shareholder. We've seen their position range from the 40s to the mid-60s. They've maintained controlling stake the entire time, and that governance structure for us, from our lens has been pretty unchanged. In other words, the Board structure the people involved. We have all been together a long time. At this point, TMUS is a very, very important part of what they do, and they're very clear about that. We're much larger as a company than they are now, et cetera. And I think from a standpoint of governance, it really works. What's good for us is generally good for them, especially because of the relative value and size, et cetera. They've been incredibly supportive of our strategy. They're a great Board, I feel that having industry experts on our Board from DT has been very helpful to us. I think a lot of companies in our space don't have that benefit of insiders that are really able to ask the three layers of whys on all the things we want to do. And at the end of the day, this management team and this Board have made a lot of moves together that have created enormous value and success. Now they did mention that they wanted to -- they have multiple strategies and multiple capital allocation strategies that may result in them concentrating their position over time. But how -- when that happens, how that happens, whether that happens, you'll have to ask them. As to your second question? Peter Osvaldik : Yes, Dave, on the 3 million, so it's approximately 3 million from a postpaid phone perspective. And as you know, Q4 has a unique attribute in that the last couple of months, which are really in front of us here are a period of really great activity. We have certainly positioned well, as you saw in Q3. And of course, we have ambitions to outperform what we put there. But we're always cautious with the two biggest months of Q4 ahead of us, in terms of putting a guide out there that's achievable for us. So somewhere approximately in that 3 million, not right on with, of course, the ability and aspiration for us to get after it. David Barden : Perfect. Thank you guys. Kathy Au : Thanks Dave. Operator next question please. Mike Sievert : I will say, while we're teeing up the neck, we almost always get that question at this time of the year -- and because it's weird to have a guy with only two months left. But you also have to remember that the biggest part of the quarter is the part that's still in front of us. So every year at this time, and we do get accused of being a little cautious. I don't think it's cautious. It's just that so much is unfolding later in the quarter. I will comment that our quarter-to-date trends are spot on our plan and looking really strong. So no question marks there whatsoever. Kathy Au : Thanks, Mike. Next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Rollins from Citi. Please go ahead with your question. Michael Rollins : Thanks good afternoon. Two questions, if I could. First, curious if you could give us an update on the journey for deepening penetration in the SMRA markets as well as within the business vertical. And then secondly, with respect to postpaid phone ARPU, it looks like it was up, I think, 1.8% year-over-year. And if I remember correctly, just from some of the discussions in the past, the base case expectation for the back half of the year may have been up 1%. And just curious if you could impact the strength in ARPU? And is there something to take from this strength as we look at future quarters? Thanks. Mike Sievert : Okay. It turns out to be a three-part question. So I'm going to ask three different speakers to try to keep it tight. But we're going to go to Jon on SMRA, quickly to [Callie on] (ph) business and then back to Peter on ARPU, and I'm going to predict he's going to pivot you to ARPA. But, Jon? Jon Freier : Yes. Hi, Mike. So just smaller markets in rural areas, I always take a moment to remind everyone that this is 40% of the market, 140 million people, 50 million households. We could not be more pleased with the progression of our growth in this space. Q2 was our highest win share quarter that we've ever delivered. And here in Q3, we beat Q2. And so we've got a great series of momentum happening in the marketplace where we're driving switching, winning those switching decisions, Number #1 in terms of win share in the marketplace in smaller markets and rural areas. And like I talked about at Capital Markets Day, too, the thing that built a lot of confidence for me is that our overall Net Promoter Score in smaller markets and rural areas is now number one, and it's 20% higher than the next highest competitor. For me, that builds ongoing customer advocacy, customer loyalty and continues to build that overall growth momentum that we have in that particular marketplace. And that's why we're continuing to build net new accounts in the top 100 markets as well. So we're having a lot of fun doing this. I've been talking about it for three years, and we're continuing to drive new highs in our switching activity in smaller markets and rural areas. Mike Sievert : And I know you didn't ask out this, Mike, but one of the things we reminded you of at the Capital Markets Day is we deaverage that top 100 set of markets for you a little bit. And this dynamic that Jon is talking about that has been a huge tailwind for us in SMRA is present in a lot of those top 100 markets. There's a big part of those. Well, we're not Number #1, and some of them were not even #2. And so there's big tailwind potential there. And in all 3 types, where we're #1, where we're #2 or even while we're #3, T-Mobile is growing. So it really shows that our formula works across the board. And now to the second part of your three-part question, what's going on with the business. And by the way, Callie, while you're talking about that, maybe you could hit Chetan Sharma\u2019s question about enterprise solution deals, what are we seeing? Could you name names, what's going on out there? Callie Field : Okay. We'll do. Well, Jon mentioned that they're having a lot of fun. And I got to tell you, so is this TFB team. We beat our benchmark competitor again in postpaid phone net adds in postpaid net adds and invoice churn. We're continuing to see profitable growth, rising CLVs in all segments. And we also just declared our ninth consecutive quarter of positive [port trends] (ph) in all segments against our competitors. In enterprise, let me narrow in specifically on a couple of the segments and some customer wins and use cases. Enterprise, we had our best activations on record. So considerable growth across all of our solutions and working with existing customers like American Airlines, where we're developing BTS solutions for their airplane operations or new logo growth with New York Life Insurance, where we are helping them combine solution with Smarsh, to make sure that their voice communications are secure. In government, we saw double-digit growth quarter-over-quarter and net adds across phone, BTS and in HSI. And a lot of that growth is supported by wins in the Fed via the Spiral 4 contract. So we are growing and winning with the Army, the Air Force and the Y-12 National Security complex. And then when I think about HSI in particular, this is one of our strongest quarters ever, highest net adds in fixed wireless. And we're doing really well. So we saw a lot of wins this quarter with retail multisite. So new customers include Lowe's, Spirit Halloween, PetSmart and then in education, where we're able to solve some connectivity problems with some of the largest school districts in the country like Houston ISD. And then again, like I mentioned before, bringing our fixed wireless solutions to the Department of Defense. And we certainly have more room to run. With [A&S] (ph), we had some really cool deployments this year. We're starting with advanced network solutions to really see our pipeline continue to grow and then continuing to see more and more deals closed each quarter, which the team is working hard against that target. Oxy Petroleum is an example, Chetan to answer your question online, where we deployed a hybrid A&S solution across of 20 of their manufacturing plants. And so that's some of the work that we've been doing this last quarter, part 3. I'll hand it to Part 3. Mike Sievert : Great. Thanks. Well done. And ARPU trying to --. Peter Osvaldik : Part 3, well, I'll definitely be truthful and redirect you to ARPA in just a second. But honestly, we do see strength there. And previously, what we had said is, from an ARPU perspective, we see probably about 0.5% year-over-year increase probably now see about 75 bps of that, so a little bit of strength there. But the reason we don't focus on ARPU as much as you know, is because it is very much a mix-driven metric. And so things like the success that Callie just described in the business group where you don't have high ARPUs, you tend to have lower ARPUs with higher ARPUs, very, very strong CLVs, segment plans, things like that. That's why we pivot into ARPA and again, continued strength there and just increased our guide very exciting to be at 3% year-over-year increase from an ARPA perspective. Kathy Au : Thank you, Mike. Thank you, Peter. Operator, next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from Jonathan Chaplin from New Street Research. Please go ahead with your question. Jonathan Chaplin : Two, one for Ulf on the 800 megahertz again. We've seen some challenges to your request to use PCS spectrum for the direct-to-device service with Starlink. Wondering if you think those challenges posed a real sort of headwind you're being able to use that spectrum and whether 800 megahertz might be an alternative? And then, Mike, a question for you. AT&T said something that totally shocked us today that at some point, they think they could open their network, their fiber network to wholesale. I'd love to get your perspectives on that. Would it make sense for you guys if they did that to leverage their wholesale network to self-bundled products? Thanks. Mike Sievert : Okay. Great. Well, I'll start out on -- I guess, on both of them and then see if Ulf wants to add anything. On the direct-to-sell, there -- no, we don't really see any barriers to progress there. We're very much looking forward to getting our beta underway during the hurricanes, we were able to test with a temporary authorization and saw hundreds of thousands of successfully completed text messages to people that otherwise wouldn't have seen them even though our network was recovered at a remarkable pace. And so it's just -- it's getting closer and closer. We have over 200 satellites in the air. I think this will work itself out despite the obvious process that has to happen through the FCC. I think this is a fundamental good and we will be off to the races very soon. As it relates to 800, as Ulf said, there's a lot of optionality for 800 now. We were required to sell it as an artifact of the merger and the consent decree and to auction it under a set of auction rules. We did that and there wasn't a qualifying bid as defined in the consent decree. And so we're no longer are required to sell it. That gives us optionality. I'll remind you of a few things that Peter has said, one, proceeds from selling it are not currently in our financial plan. So should we sell that spectrum, that will be, in essence, incremental. And secondly, in Ulf's network plan, utilizing that spectrum is not currently in the plan. So the reason I point this out is that just we have a lot of optionality and that's valuable spectrum. It's important spectrum. And you'll have to stay tuned as it relates to our resolution on how we plan to use it. As it relates to fiber and open fiber, one of the things that has made cable kind of interesting is that you do see a certain amount of collaboration in that space because there aren't overlaps. Look, it's hard to predict what the future will look like. This is a very, very competitive market. I think it always will be very, very competitive. And that being said, a lot of things will unfold over the years, and we'll have to see what's the very best way we can serve consumers and businesses. But we're open-minded to all future constructs. I can tell you that we are very, very excited about our fiber plans, and we intend to compete vigorously with them. Our strategy is to be first to fiber in the places where we go and that's why we teamed up with some of the fastest moving players in this industry, so that we can race with abandon to provide this incredible service we know we can provide. That being said, I wouldn't speculate more on the future than that. Kathy Au : Thank you, Jonathan, for the question. Next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from Craig Moffett from MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead with your question. Craig Moffett : Sure thank you. And first, let me embarrass Kathy by wishing you a happy birthday today. Mike Sievert : Yes. Happy birthday, Cathy. Kathy Au : Appreciate it. Craig Moffett : I know you are not going to forgive me for that, Kathy. Let me ask the regulatory question about upgrade rates because you like your peers, continue to see very, very low upgrade rates on handsets. My guess is the kind of the debate about whether we are going to see a big handset upgrade rate this year is largely already settled. But as you look out to next year and what at least the handset makers have said is expected to be a more robust AI-driven upgrade cycle. How do you think about that? How do you prepare for it? And how do you -- as a share gain or how do you potentially benefit from it? Mike Sievert : Yes, a great set of questions, Craig. Why don't we start with Mike Katz and talk about the upgrade rates we're seeing and little future casting? Michael Katz : Yes. I mean in terms of the current upgrade rates, like you said they were low. And a lot of that is just because of what we've been talking about the last several quarters that we see customers having their natural demand met by virtue of the way that our upgrade programs work. And by virtue of how good the T-Mobile version of the 5G devices are, both in terms of penetration, we have over 80% of our customers using 5G devices. But also -- and maybe Ulf can comment on this later, some of the unique capabilities that are available in some of these devices because of our stand-alone 5G network. So what we see is customers having devices that generally work better and devices that are becoming more expensive and lasting longer. And we think all those factors have come into play affecting and you are seeing the outcomes of the upgrade rates. Looking forward, look, it is hard to predict. A lot of the OEMs don't share their long-term plans and what their devices are going to look like next year. But like -- just like going into this iPhone cycle, I'd say the next -- the same thing about next year's cycles, both with iPhone and with other OEMs. We think we're really well positioned on whether it's a big upgrade cycle or not. In the case of a big upgrade cycle, T-Mobile has constantly been the winner when there's a lot of switching in the marketplace. And we saw that again during this last iPhone launch, and it's demonstrated in a lot of the results that you saw here in Q3 with 315,000 net new accounts by far, the most out of anybody that reports in this industry. So we think in a world where there is a lot of switching because of a new device that creates a lot of upgrades because of this unique proposition of best network, best value and best experience when customers are shopping, T-Mobile is going to win. And that's, I think been demonstrated quarter-over-quarter for many years now. Mike Sievert : Okay. Anybody want to add to that? Ulf Ewaldsson : Well, the only comment there on the phones that Mike mentioned is that many phones are coming up and getting 2-carrier aggregation, 2-carrier aggregation in the uplink. This gives enormous benefits. It's 30% higher speeds in the downlink, 15% in the uplink. So this stuff performs really well on our network. And just a reminder on what Mike brought up is that we are the only one who has pure stand-alone core. We've had it since 2020. It's well tuned. It's rolled out over entire network, and it allows us to do these things. It allows us to the 4-carrier in the downlink, it allows us for the 2-carrier in the uplink with all those benefits for the new devices coming out. And it also allows us now to use voice over the new air interface as you mentioned in your opening, that's a huge thing. It really leads to much better call setup times. It leads to better quality, and it gives us the opportunity for more effective spectrum use. Mike Sievert : So it is interesting, why do we say these things? Well, first of all, we pointed out for the reason Mike said, which is when people are having a fantastic experience that's differentiated with their current device at T-Mobile, then they are not as compelled to move. They're having a great experience, so they shop less. That's great. We have low upgrade rates as a result. When they wind up switching, we win because we win the switching moment. So there's not enough talking in this industry about switching, but it's very clear that these numbers show once again we're the switching winner. And if there's a super cycle in the future and that spurs switching that will be great for us. And this point that Ulf that you're pointing out around the newer devices, taking advantage of our advanced capabilities, it really speaks to another issue. At Capital Markets Day, we were pretty clear that we don't expect to just defend this 5G network lead. We expect to extend it over time. And the evidence continues to back us up on that. We are much -- our margin of superiority is greater today than it was two years ago. And one of the drivers of this is not just the rate and pace of our deploying technologies but it's the tailwind represented by the fact that a lot of the devices out there today in people's hands don't take full advantage of the network. For example, the latest iPhone 16 has advanced capabilities that are uniquely unlocked by T-Mobile's network. And the more those get in people's hands, the more it will unlock the embedded technology we've already rolled out, creating a tailwind for us to further extend our lead. And that will be a great dynamic down the road when people have those in their hands and they're faced later with weather to upgrade further and they're going to be very happy with what they have. So really nice trends unfolding there. Hope that helps, Craig? Peter Osvaldik : And maybe I would add just one little bit because of those dynamics that we're seeing what Mike described, as I think about Q4, we'll probably see the same seasonality from an equipment revenue perspective that we saw last year. So the same kind of absolute dollar increase that we saw Q3 to Q4 is, what I expect to happen from Q3 to this Q4. Obviously, higher than Q3 with that holiday seasonality happening there, but that's the trend that we'd expect. Kathy Au : Thanks, Craig. Next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from James Schneider from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Jim Schneider : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could maybe comment on your plans for network upgrades on the wireless side for next year. Maybe talk about the relative prioritization of your three-plus gigahertz 5G upgrades, as well as how much you plan on doing in terms of rural and markets outside of the Tier 1 against any other priorities you may have? Thank you. Mike Sievert : Thanks, Jim. This might be a good opportunity for Ulf to kind of remind that we have a different approach for how to do this than many. And it's algorithmic, it's driven by deep data. And in that sense, the planfulness around big macro topics like that are a little bit different for us. In other words, we're looking now at a much more micro level than kind of a broad secular level without as much preference for whether it is rural or whether it's urban et cetera, but maybe you can explain customer-driven coverage and how it drives our priorities into 2025. Ulf Ewaldsson : Right. And first of all, I mean, we have the greatest assets, as I said before, on the below 6 gigahertz those assets are allowing us to build a very consistent network. So means that also all the towers that we have and we have more than 80% of our towers are equipped very similarly. We are the only player in the market who has three layers dedicated to 5G. In that, when we are allowing us to build and expand this, we are using a methodology that we call customer-driven coverage. And customer-driven coverage is something we have spent about 1.5 years about developing a methodology. It's an algorithmic [etiology] (ph) based on AI where we're using billions and billions of data points that we are assessing from customer experience data across the network. We're correlating that with business data and with real customer outcomes. In other words, what customers decide to do on our network. And then we are assigning a CLV value, a customer lifetime value to a grid across the country, more than 4 million little hexagons that we have created across the country, 165 meter-wide hexagons. We are signing those values relative to competition to allow us to know exactly where we can build to please customers. Because at the end of the day, this is not a pop drive where you're just chasing populations and where populations live, it's a much more complicated art to figure out exactly where customers will value most our build. And that's what we're doing on our capital allocation. And to answer your question, Jim. It's really what we're doing on our capital allocation for next year. We're taking full advantage of our customer-driven coverage. Now looking then at our assets and our -- to your question about the 3 gigahertz band. How much do we really need to deploy that? Well, today, we have a -- and we went very smart into the auction around C-band, where we selected 50 markets where we really could see that this spectrum fits very well to our grid. So when we deploy it, it will be optimized for our grid, our tower-to-tower distance in a way that makes it very effective. And it's very -- in markets where there could potentially over time, be a need to expand our capacity. But as we see it now, it is not needed. We have so much more room to run. We are only about 60% deployed on our mid-band spectrum to 5G today. And we have much more other things that we can take an action in among the others, the technology leadership that you just explained, Mike. So that's where we are on our C-band plan. Mike Sievert : Perfect. So Jim, what you can take away from that are a couple of things. One is with apologies. What you can take away is what you just heard. We keep a little close to the vest. How and when we will deploy each band and exactly where we will deploy. And we do that for all kinds of reasons. But one of the transparency we attempt to offer you is the following : One, we outlooked at Capital Markets Day that the $9 billion to $10 billion capital envelope is sufficient with our detailed planning to not only defend but to extend our 5G leadership and to meet the goals that we established in our business plan. We've modeled this at a very detailed level. The way -- the lens is different. The set of tools are different. They're not blunt tools like let's go after the countryside and let's go after -- it's much more algorithmic, both just described that we have tens of thousands of projects. They might be small upgrades, they might be reorientations, they might be adding C-band in the future to the premise of your question. We have tens of thousands of future projects that gets stacked-ranked based on some practical concerns like zoning permitting but mostly based on the outputs from our AI-driven algorithic model called customer-driven coverage. And the result of that will be that we will stay ahead of the demand curve and continue to extend our overall performance and 5G experience leadership in the country within the CapEx envelope that we provided to you. Jim Schneider : That's very helpful color. And then just as a quick follow-up, can you maybe comment on whether you see anything in either your macro indicators or your underlying consumer data have you at all concerned that we are about to see a significant deceleration in the overall kind of gross add environment in the consumer wireless space. Thank you. Mike Sievert : Okay. And again, I'm going to apologize. I feel like you've asked me two in a row that I'm not all that well equipped to answer. And the reason why the second one is difficult is that we have sort of determined that T-Mobile or maybe even our industry writ large, is not really that great of a canary in the coal mine on macroeconomic things. And part of that is, I think, the essential nature of our service. And so we are not going to be the guys to ask to give you early indicators of changes or nuances and consumer behavior. And one of the -- and that's borne out by our numbers. Our customers are kind of per category, per segment paying at traditional norms, valuing the service, just no real secular changes there -- that are noteworthy. As it relates to growth in the industry, there are weird dynamics that are hard to predict there. We've done a pretty good job predicting our business, almost remarkably good job predicting our business. But predicting what happens sort of in the \"market growth\u201d has been more difficult. And a lot of that is because some of what gets added to the industry is kind of questionable sort of lower calorie net adds, et cetera. And it's one of the reasons why we focus so much on switching. We focus on the core business, our families on postpaid traditional plans who've been in this industry for a while and who switched to us from another provider, that continues to be just sort of at a modest rate and pace, the bread and butter of our superior revenue growth story. The other dynamic we focus on is an ongoing transference from prepaid to postpaid. Now this one could possibly be a canary in the coal mine you're looking for because we have seen over the past five years during these vibrant economic times, lots of transference from prepaid to postpaid. In this most recent quarter, we saw it yet again a strong -- I think it was 175,000 net transfers from our prepaid to our postpaid showing that, that trend just continues that one -- maybe that one would be an indicator if you see that slowdown because this is a demonstration that customers are qualifying for postpaid plans over these last five years. So that's one to watch and it continues to be in recent trends in recent history consistent with. Okay, you bet. Kathy Au : Operator, next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from Peter Supino from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead with your question. Peter Supino : Hi, and thank you. A question that's a bit longer term in nature on spectrum costs. your stock valuation multiple expansion shows a lot of market confidence in your growth outlook. And if you put your investor hat on, may you agree that the other key value driver is the cost of that growth. And so I want to ask you about a distant but potentially expensive issue, the 6G cycle. 4G and 5G costs, each of the major MNOs, tens of billions of dollars, your 5G solution with Sprint was quite elegant. I'm wondering if you'd share your view on that and whether anything about your business today sets up the long run for a different level of spectrum and RAN costs than we saw for the 4G and 5G cycles. Thanks. Mike Sievert : Well, it's a great question, Peter, and it's -- the premise of your question acknowledges this, it's a little premature. But there's a lot of reasons to be optimistic about the long-term trends. And that's one of the reasons why we wanted to talk with you at our Capital Markets Day about our vision for what comes after this current 5G cycle. AI-RAN and what it can be. And yes, there's a potential big cycle coming. But on the other hand, it may be a cycle that's fundamentally more efficient to roll out than prior cycles. And the promises of Open RAN that have been made for years may finally be realized at scale in the AI RAN era. And this allows you to offset potential future cost of replacement of future technologies with fundamental efficiency, and so we're optimistic. We were able to indicate that for our planning horizon over the next few years, this $9 billion to $10 billion CapEx area makes sense. Now that's not full-scale 6G time frames yet. But at the same time, we wanted to put down markers about our vision for what comes next with AI brand because it's so promising on the ability to do more. One of the things that we drive our plan around is the two core metrics, which is technology over time should allow us to extract more and more network performance per CapEx and OpEx dollar and it should allow us to extract more and more network performance per unit of spectrum. And that's what has happened, and that's what we think will continue to happen. But this next cycle may be more efficient than the big verticalized 5G cycle was. I will also say that the net cost of 5G involved a big part of that cost involved our competitors rushing in to spend an inordinate amount of money to try to get mid-band spectrum and that was caused by the extra competition brought on by our merger. Had that unfolded differently, it may have happened over time. And it really showcases how much competition our merger brought to this industry and how quickly. And today, customers are the beneficiaries of that. But so is the industry. One of the things I've talked about in the past is that yet while 5G has been costly for some, overall, you see industry cash flows at or around all-time highs. And yet you see consumers benefiting with 3 times to 4 times more speed and 3 times to 4 times more data usage at similar price points to 5 or 6 years ago. So consumers are -- are giant winners from the 5G cycle, but the industry remains quite healthy as well. And I think the future bodes very nicely for 6G. One of the things we intend, like we did in 5G, when we looked around corners, and we saw that it would unfold on smartphones and in mid-band, we intend to be a company that drives the future on 6G as well. And that's why we've struck our unique partnership with Ericsson, Nokia and NVIDIA to help invent AI- RAN and bring the future about in a way that disproportionately benefits T-Mobile customers. Kathy Au : Thank you, Peter. Thanks, Mike. Operator, next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from Sam McHugh from BNP Paribas. Please go ahead with your question. Sam McHugh : Maybe just a follow-up on that in some ways. It's good to hear about like the consumer benefits that your scale through the Sprint deal brought. How is engagement going with different parties on the US Cellular deal, ever as much you could add on that? And then a second, just quick follow-up on the ARPU growth. I know ARPU, not ARPA. But in terms of the upside surprise, is that more of a mix effect of the gross adds? Or is it the price rise that's landed better than maybe you anticipated? Thanks very much. Mike Sievert : Okay. I'm going to start with Peter on ARPU and ARPA. And is it mix driven? Or what's it driven by and then probably turn to Mike Katz to talk about how US Cellular is unfolding? Peter Osvaldik : Yes. ARPA is a number of factors, as you know. On the consumer side, it's a continual expansion of the relationship, including with 5G home broadband, other connected devices, really seeing strength in growth and expansion of customer relationships. Callie spoke a lot about the success in T-Mobile for business across the segments and how you see ARPA expansion there. In terms of the rate plan optimization, that was a very minor component of the year-over-year ARPA change and certainly not the driver for the 3% increase now that we anticipated really is core expansion of customer relationships that's so exciting. Mike Sievert : Okay. And maybe while you're at it Mike, you can talk about not just US Cellular, but you might as well talk about Metronet and Lumos. We've been pretty busy out there. So what's going on with these new combinations that we have? Michael Katz : Yeah. We have several transactions. And I would say all of them are in the process and the processes are going really well. In terms of Lumos, we expect that to close in the first -- the first part of next year. US Cellular, which is also in the process, maybe the middle part of next year. And then Metronet, we also expect to close in 2025. So good progress through the whole regulatory process. There's obviously several different groups that have to review and approve them and feel like those are going really well so far. Mike Sievert : We happen to have at the end of the table, one of the nation's most accomplished antitrust layers. So our General Counsel, Mark Nelson, any commentary on things we're learning as we go along. Mark Nelson : Yes. And we've cleared -- both Lumos and Metronet have cleared the DOJ review process. They're still pending for the FCC, and that will take a little more time, as Mike just indicated, on U.S. Cellular. We think this is great for consumers. It's going to lead to lower pricing, especially for the US cellular customers. It's going to lead to better coverage for all customers. So we're confident in that, and we think we'll get clearance in due course. But we're working through the process with the various agencies right now. Mike Sievert : We have begun some planning with the counterparties, particularly US Cellular and because that's a more complicated set of planning that we have to do. And we've met the teams, they're fired up. I can tell you that they are excited about that core premise that Mark just reminded everybody of. This is a -- and this isn't always the case. This is a transaction that very clearly will result in both lower prices and better network. Both T-Mobile and US Cellular customers will have a better network experience. There's no question about that. And US Cellular customers will be offered lower prices as they migrate to the T-Mobile plans. And that's just a classic win-win. So we are very confident, but we have to keep our heads down and go through the process and explain our case to all the parties involved. Very exciting time. Sam McHugh : Great. Thank you. Kathy Au : Thanks Sam. Our next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from Kannan Venkateshwar from Barclays. Please go head. With your question. Kannan Venkateshwar : Thank you. Maybe one on pricing. Mike, when you look at pricing across the industry right now, it just seems like it's taking much better than expected. I mean, churn is not as high when these price increases are taken, and we've seen multiple price increases, of course, from your peers. Does that make you think that the value gap is maybe bigger in wireless and maybe this becomes a recurring opportunity? And related to that, when you think about your volume growth, you're over-indexing versus the rest of the industry by a significant amount. And that's obviously great from a share perspective, but it does come with its own cost in the form of working capital and equipment margin rate and so on. So is it a third that if prices are making better, then maybe the balance can shift a little bit more towards price and drive the rest of the P&L and cash flow in a slightly different direction. Thanks. Mike Sievert : That's a great question. Thanks for it. Our strategy here has been remarkably consistent. And as it relates to, for example, the working capital and other P&L impacts of a growth orientation, that's kind of very much in the run rate. It's true this quarter, we had the best Q3 in a decade, so that's on the margin, helpful. But it's in the same area code. I mean we're growing methodically, consistently, repeatedly, and that's what you want to see from us, as we chase these very ambitious goals for the out year. I will put our revenue growth plan up against anybody's. It -- our plan is one that favors customers that focuses on value that promises value and that has resulted in service revenue growth and postpaid service revenue growth that lead the industry by a wide margin. So I want to make sure to caution us because the strategy we have, which is to emphasize value and network and experience, as this team keeps reminding in every answer, that really works. And so we're very cautious about putting that at risk. That being said, we have to keep up with the times. You've seen us doing some of that. I think you could even be said that, that's gone very well. But we have to make sure that anything we do now and in the future is consistent with our vision that the Un-carrier stands for superior value. And to your premise of your question, that may leave room. What it means to be that may allow us to make changes over time, but we will make changes with the North Star being true to our brand should there be changes in the future. Kathy Au : Thanks, Mike. Before we go to our last question on the phone, I'm going to take one question from social media probably for Peter. Given the nice EBITDA take-up for the year, can you help us understand what's driving that? Is it the rate increase? Or are there other puts and takes we should think about? Peter Osvaldik : Yes, absolutely. Thank you, Kathy. There's a number of things. Of course, we're at that time of the year when the year guide is the Q4 guide. And so maybe I'll just focus on all the puts and takes within Q4. Of course, there's more adds for the year as we just raised guidance yet again on total postpaid as well as total postpaid phone. And then there is a few puts and takes as I think about, while the net is an increase in the midpoint. There is a non-cash spectrum swap gain as that deal has closed. That's about $137 million. But that is primarily offset by slightly higher ACP decline. So as I mentioned earlier, we'll be at the higher end of that $350 million to $450 million range. And then, of course, there's hurricane costs that we're incurring in Q4 to make sure that we get the network back up and running and serve customers as quickly as possible on that front. So with all those puts and takes, we still saw a nice increase of $50 million at the midpoint and I'm very excited about that. Mike Sievert : Every guidance we give is fundamentally driven by the underpinnings of the business, right? And every quarter has sort of some tailwinds and some headwinds that are onetime, and this one is no different. Good one. Was that question from Kathy's birthday online or --. Kathy Au : Okay. All right. Last question. Thanks, operator. Operator : Our last and final question comes from Eric Luebchow from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question. Eric Luebchow : Hi, great. Appreciate it, you squeeze me in. So I just wanted to maybe touch on the high speed HSI or fixed wireless business. Obviously, you updated your guide at Capital Markets Day [$12 million] (ph) aspiration. And I know we talked about it implies a modest decel in net adds if we straight line it, but you've been pretty consistent at this [400,000] (ph) quarterly run rate. So does that still feel like an achievable number near term? And maybe, any other color you could provide on kind of how gross adds versus churn have trended? And then any geographical split kind of between urban versus suburban versus rural areas where you rolled it out? Thank you. Mike Sievert : Sure. The majority come from cable. The majority come from -- with existing T-Mobile customers. The broad trend lines haven't changed much. As we grow, gross adds have to grow in order to outrun even if churn is consistent. Broadly, every quarter is different. But broadly over time, our churn trends have looked very nicely as this cohort has aged. So that's really good. Every quarter, we'll be a little different on that front. But generally, I've been pleased with that over the last 1.5 years. But gross adds have to keep rising. And so that's one of the reasons why there is a difference between the current run rate and the terminal size by 2028 \u201cat least for now\u201d. And we'll have to see how it goes. You're right. It's been remarkably consistent, consistent in that. We've been gaining more net adds than anyone else in the industry, some quarters more than everyone else combined. And one of the things that gives us a lot of confidence here is that people just love this product. This is the highest Net Promoter Score by some measures, product in the country. And so that gives us a lot of confidence. Our average speeds are just like the cable averages. Our usage is 0.5 gig or 0.5 terabyte a month and growing. The average speed and experience is triple what it was three years ago. So it's not a static thing. It's rapidly improving. And again, it matches cable, but it's a lot -- it's differentiated versus other fixed wireless offerings as well. So we're just really confident in the product, and we will keep investing time and energy in the customer experience to make sure it remains truly great. And so far, so good. Kathy Au : Thank you, Mike. That's all the time we have for questions, and we appreciate everyone joining us today. Mike Sievert : Thanks, everybody. Kathy Au : We look forward to speaking to you again. And if you have any further questions, you may contact the Investor Relations or media departments. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the T-Mobile Third Quarter Earnings Call. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect, and have a pleasant day.",
