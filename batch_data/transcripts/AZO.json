Operator : Mr. Rhodes, you may now begin. William C. Rhodes: Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for AutoZone's 2014 First Quarter Conference Call. With me today are Bill Giles, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, IT and ALLDATA; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax. Regarding the first quarter, I hope you've had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not, the press release, along with slides complementing our comments today, are available on our website, www.autozoneinc.com. Please click on Quarterly Earnings Conference Calls to see them. To begin this morning, I want to thank all AutoZoners across the globe for another very solid quarter. This morning, we reported our 29th consecutive quarter of double-digit earnings per share growth. That's an amazing accomplishment, and it highlights the consistency in our industry, our impressive business model and most importantly, the dedication and superior execution of our team of more than 70,000 passionate AutoZoners. Regarding the quarter, we've embarked on several key initiatives and tests and we are proceeding aggressively. As we discussed in our last quarterly call, we are testing several new inventory initiatives. I also mentioned we would be introducing a new version of Z-net that has now been deployed. Over the last couple of years, we've reset our expectations in regard to technology investments in an effort to leverage technology to enhance the customer experience and leverage operating efficiencies. The enhanced Z-net is the first of those efforts to be implemented. Finally, I mentioned our goal is and remains to be growing market share in 2014 while continuing to deliver solid earnings. Our organization understands the importance of balancing investments and returns, and we have to invest our time and capital accordingly. Over the last several months, we have significantly increased the pace of strategic assessments, design of potential enhancements, deployment of tests and implementation of new concepts or initiatives. This is vitally important work. It is intellectually stimulating but it's also very hard work. I want to say a special thank you to the many AutoZoners across the organization who have redoubled their efforts to complete these very important efforts. Each of these AutoZoners has a full-time job in addition to this work. They have worked very hard, are doing a great job and are leaving no stone unturned. Their pace of progress has been amazing to me. For the quarter, we reported a total sales increase of 5.1% while same-store sales were up 0.9%. This overall sales performance was generally consistent with our Q4 results, but our DIY performance was a bit worse than Q4. Part of the deterioration in DIY was due to a calendar shift resulting from our 53rd week. Our DIY same-store sales would have been 87 basis points higher if we were comparing to the same weeks last year. In Retail, we experienced stronger trends in our failure-related categories, while we saw weaker trends in the sales floor and more discretionary categories. These trends were pretty consistent nationally. In Commercial, our business accelerated nicely and the trends were generally consistent throughout the quarter and regionally. Our Commercial business is predominantly a hard parts business and consistent with our DIY results, these categories also performed well in Commercial during the quarter. Our consumer remains under pressure. We have yet to anniversary the reinstatement of payroll taxes, which occurred at the beginning of the calendar year and the government shutdown during the quarter was not helpful. However, there are some macro factors that have been helpful. Gas prices have begun to abate and we believe this can have a positive effect on our customer's ability to spend on routine maintenance. With approximately 10 billion gallons of gasoline consumed monthly in the U.S., any sizable move in price can have a material stimulus on the economy. Currently, gas prices are approximately $3.30 a gallon or about $0.15 a gallon below last year at this time. As we are heading into what is forecast to be a more normal winter weather pattern, we are optimistic. We would assume the most pronounced effects would be felt in the Midwest and Northeast markets. We mentioned during our last quarterly conference call that we lost some share in retail. I'm pleased to report today our data is telling us we're slightly gaining share in retail. While the data reflects only the last couple of months, we feel the initiatives we're working on are making a difference. We've enhanced our electronic catalog to better serve our customers by further highlighting related items necessary to do the complete job. We believe these enhancements will improve the customer experience and will complement the knowledge of our AutoZoners. This new system was implemented throughout our domestic store base in Q1. While training on the new system is ongoing, the feedback we are receiving from AutoZoners is very encouraging. Regarding DIY ticket and traffic trends. Our trend didn't change materially from last quarter. Our traffic counts continued to be challenging, but improved from the trends we experienced from April 2012 to April 2013. The more significant change from historical trends has been a much slower growth rate in average ticket than we have experienced over the last several years. We haven't experienced the same rate of growth in commodity-based inflation that we have seen in recent years. Currently, we don't see any indications of that trend changing materially in the short term. While that is very good news for our customers, it has certainly challenged our results. If the winter weather projections come to fruition, that could certainly benefit our traffic trends. Overall, we can't control the macro factors that impact our business and that is why we have intensified our efforts on enhancing our offerings. Ultimately, we control our destiny and we are excited about the many initiatives we have underway or intent. We're pleased with the progress we are making in our Commercial business, which showed an acceleration in growth versus last quarter. Our sales increased 13.9% from last year's first quarter. And as you can see, we opened more programs this quarter. The 125 programs we opened this quarter marks the largest number of openings we've had in a first quarter in the last decade. While some of these openings simply reflect a pulling forward of program openings from Q2, we expect to open a similar number of programs throughout the year as we did last year. Our all other businesses increased approximately 75% over last year as a bulk of this increase was driven by the yet-to-anniversary acquisition of AutoAnything we completed at the end of the calendar year 2012. To remind our listeners, this segment of business includes AutoAnything, autozone.com and ALLDATA. Regarding all these businesses, we've introduced the idea of being more digitally integrated. As the auto parts landscape continues to evolve, it's important we think more broadly. Therefore, we've made this one of our 4 strategic growth priorities along with Retail, Commercial and International. We have a tremendous amount of data and content available to us across all of our segments. We are making a priority to combine forces across the board and look at our customers, their opportunities and challenges on a more holistic basis. This remains an early-stage effort, but we believe this can be an important and significant opportunity for us to deepen customer relationships and grow sales. I'd like to spend a few minutes updating you on some of our newest initiatives and test their focus on improving inventory availability. We have several tests underway at various stages. It is important to note that some of these tests compete against each other as we are working to identify the most economical means of increasing our ability to fulfill our customers' needs. Our first initiative was tested last spring in summer and it is in the process of being implemented. We have improved our algorithms that determine store SKU placement. This includes adding additional inventory while simultaneously removing unproductive inventory. Net-net, it will increase our store level inventory. In the first quarter, about 40% of our per store inventory growth is attributable to this initiative. We are deploying these new assortments by category and it will take about a year to complete, but the majority will be in our stores by the spring-selling season. We've also been testing additional inventory in our hub stores. We continue to find the opportunities to add productive inventory to all of our hub stores and we expect this to continue, especially as we further penetrate the highly fragmented and hard parts-focused commercial market. Additionally, we are testing a much deeper product offering in a select few hub stores and these locations are leveraging that inventory across a wide network of additional hubs and satellites. This allows us to significantly broaden the depth of the product offering closer to the customer. We are also testing both broader SKU assortment in our distribution centers, as well as more frequent deliveries to both select hub and satellite stores. All of these efforts are designed to assess the most effective way to service our customers' needs and to reduce the amount of unproductive activity we have transferring products from store to store. It is still very early, but we have learned, as expected, that more inventory closer to the customer increases sales. We don't yet know if it is a wise financial decision or the most economical way to accomplish this objective. That's why we're running these tests. We expect to continue these tests for the majority of this fiscal year. We will modify some, expand some and likely implement others. Ultimately, we believe we have opportunities to improve, but it is important that we find the optimal solution. We will keep you abreast of developments in this area as we progress. We continue to execute on our strategies to improve the customer shopping experience. We expanded 8 additional hub locations during the quarter to take our total remodeled hub locations to 100 locations. These remodels entail expanding the size and capacity of these locations, ensuring they're in the right physical location and adding additional inventory into the market that benefits both Retail and Commercial. We also opened 2 new hubs locations, finishing with 157. Over time, we do expect to open more hub locations, but we believe our strategy on inventory deployment at the store level allows us to keep the number of openings at a moderate level. With the continued aging of the car population, we continue to be optimistic regarding trends for our industry in both DIY and DIFM. While new car sales have been very strong these past few quarters, we have seen those traded-in vehicles be resold to new owners, who are repairing or enhancing their \"new vehicle.\" With gas prices declining a bit recently on a year-over-year basis, we believe miles driven can increase heading into 2014. Historically, lower gas prices and an improving economic outlook have led to more miles being driven. We expect that trend to reemerge. We remain bullish on our industry sales growth opportunities on both the Retail and Commercial fronts over the long term. As the vehicle population remains at an all-time high and consumers continue to look for good values while maintaining their vehicles, we see AutoZone's opportunity to sell to those customers only growing. Now let me review our operating theme priorities for 2014. Our overarching theme this year is Creating Customers for Life and the key priorities for the year are : one, Great People Providing Great Service!; two, profitably growing our Commercial business; three, leveraging the Internet; four, leveraging technology to improve the customer experience while optimizing efficiencies; and five, improving inventory availability. On the retail front this past quarter, under the Great People Providing Great Service! theme, we continue with our intense focus on improving execution. With the rollout of our new Z-net software, we spent a great deal of time training AutoZoners on the system enhancements. We've tried to make the system as intuitive as possible, but along with change, we have to spend time teaching and discussing those changes. We also learned from our store AutoZoners how to improve the way the information is presented on the screen. This mutual respect for operations and technology will lead, in our belief, to a superior selling tool in our stores. We should also highlight another strong performance in return on invested capital as we finished Q1 at 32.7%. While slightly below last year's Q1 ROIC, excluding the acquisition of AutoAnything, we would have been slightly higher than last year. We are very pleased with this metric as it is one of the best, if not the best, in all of hard lines retail. However, our primary focus has been and continues to be that we ensure every incremental dollar of capital that we deploy in this business provides an acceptable return well in excess of our cost of capital. It is important to reinforce, we will always maintain our diligence regarding capital stewardship as the capital we invest is our investor's capital. Now let me turn the call over to Bill Giles. Bill? William T. Giles: Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everyone. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to talk more specifically about our Retail, Commercial and international results. For the quarter, total auto parts sales, which includes our domestic Retail and Commercial businesses, our Mexico stores and our 4 stores in Brazil, increased 3.6% over the 12 weeks. Regarding macro trends, during the quarter, nationally, unleaded gas prices started out at $3.61 a gallon and ended the quarter at $3.29 a gallon, a $0.32 decrease. Last year, gas prices decreased similarly at $0.35 per gallon during the first quarter, starting at $3.78 and ending at $3.43 a gallon. We continue to believe gas prices have a real impact on our customers' abilities to maintain their vehicles and we will continue to monitor prices closely in the future. We also recognize that the impact of miles driven on cars over 10 years old, the current average, is much different than on newer cars in terms of wear and tear. Miles driven data, reported by the Department of Transportation, are available only through September. However, for July through September, the data shows positive trends, up between 1.3% and 1.6% each of the 3 months. The other statistic we highlight is the number of 7-year-old and older vehicles on the road, which continues to trend in our industry's favor. Another key macro issue facing our customers today is the reinstitution of payroll taxes back to historic norms. This reduction in our customers' take-home pay began at the beginning of the new calendar year and it has been difficult to objectively quantify the ramifications of this change. However, we believe this is -- and will continue through December to be a headwind to our consumers' spending habits. For the trailing 4 quarters, total sales for auto parts stores was $1,744,000. This statistic continues to set the pace for the rest of the industry. For the quarter, total Commercial sales increased 13.9%. And for the first quarter, Commercial represented 16.7% of our total company sales and grew $43 million over last year's Q1. Last year's Commercial sales mix percent was 15.4%. As we have said previously, overall, we have been pleased with the progress we are making in our Commercial business, both operationally and financially and we remain on track with our plans. We believe there are ample opportunities for us to continue to improve many facets of our operations and offerings and, therefore, we are optimistic about the future of this business. We believe we can grow revenues in existing stores while opening additional commercial programs. This past quarter, we opened 125 new programs versus 37 programs opened in our first quarter of last fiscal year. We now have our commercial program in 3,546 stores supported by 157 hub stores. Approximately 1,070 of our programs are 3 years old or younger. With only 73% of our domestic stores having the commercial program, we believe there is further opportunity for additional program growth in addition to improved productivity opportunities in current programs. Further, we recognize that our Commercial sales productivity per program is well below our peers. However, we believe the maturation of our marketing programs, plus the inventory assortment additions we are making, will allow us to close the gap. As we look forward, we're focused on building upon the commercial initiatives that have been in place for the last few years. We have a very talented sales force and we are enhancing training and introducing additional technology to optimize the productivity of the sales force. We have increased our efforts around analyzing customer purchasing trends and in-stock trends. We've also seen, with our inventory assortment tests ongoing, an improvement in hard parts sales to commercial customers. Historically, we've seen retail sales impacted as much or more by inventory additions to stores. The more recent tests are showing commercial customers are disproportionately taking advantage of these inventory additions. This is exciting to us, as we believe we're on the right track when it comes to our ability to climb the call list to become the customers' first call. In summary, we remain committed to our long-term growth strategy. We have accelerated the growth of our commercial programs, having opened over 1,000 programs over the past 36 months. Effectively, 30% of the programs are 3 years old or younger. We believe we are well positioned to grow this business and capture market share. Our Mexico stores continued to perform well. We opened 1 new store during the first quarter. We currently have 363 stores in Mexico and our returns and profit growth continue to be in line with our expectations. Regarding Brazil, we opened 1 new store in the quarter and have 4 stores opened at the end of the quarter. Our plans remain to open approximately 10 stores over the next couple of years and then reevaluate our development as we refine our offerings and prove that our concept works for our customers and is financially viable. At that point, we will talk more on our long-term growth plans. Recapping this past quarter's performance for the company. In total, our sales were $2,094,000,000, an increase of 5.1% from last year's first quarter. Domestic same-store sales or sales for stores opened more than one year, were up 0.9% for the quarter. I will point out here, on a shifted basis, our same-store sales were slightly higher at 1.5%. While this is a larger percentage than the unshifted comp number, we feel over the year, things even out and probably not worth making a large point of. The difference of approximately 0.5 point of comp came from the retail portion of the business, due mainly to losing a summer week comparison this year and picking up a late fall week in November. Gross margin for the quarter was 51.9% of sales, up 3 basis points versus last year's first quarter. The improvement in gross margin was attributable to lower acquisition costs that were offset primarily by the inclusion of the recent acquisition of AutoAnything. In regards to inflation, we have seen modest decreases in costs year-over-year. This is different than in past years. At this point, our assumption is we'll experience subdued producer pricing heading into the calendar year and therefore, we feel costs will be predictable and manageable. We will remain cognizant of future developments regarding inflation and we'll make the appropriate adjustments should they arise. Looking forward, we continue to believe there remains opportunity for gross margin expansion within both the Retail and Commercial business. However, we do not manage to a targeted gross margin percentage. As the growth of our Commercial business has been the steady headwind on our overall gross margin rate for a few years, we have not specifically called out the headwind quarterly. But rather, we recognize that it is an integrated part of our business model. Additionally, AutoAnything has been a drag on our gross margin as this business model operates at a lower gross margin rate. As we anniversary our acquisition of AutoAnything during Q2, our margin comparisons will become more consistent. Our primary focus remains growing absolute gross profit dollars in our total auto parts segment. SG&A for the quarter was 33.5% of sales, lower by 5 basis points from last year's first quarter. The slight improvement in operating expenses as a percentage of sales was primarily due to a shift in the timing of advertising expenditures. I just want to take a moment to thank our entire team for their diligence on cost control, which has always been a key part of our corporate DNA. We continue to believe we are well positioned to manage our cost structure in response to our sales environment. EBIT for the quarter was $384 million, up 5.6% over last year's first quarter. Our EBIT margin improved to 18.3% or up 8 basis points versus the previous year's first quarter. Interest expense for the quarter was $42.4 million compared with $41.1 million in Q1 a year ago. Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $4,174,000,000 or approximately $370 million more than last year's Q1 balance of $3,802,000,000. Our adjusted debt level metric finished the quarter at 2.5x EBITDAR. While on any given quarter, we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on management's opinion regarding debt and equity market conditions, we remain committed to both our investment-grade rating and our capital allocation strategy and share repurchases are an important element of that strategy. For the quarter, our tax rate was approximately 36.1%, lower than last year's first quarter of 36.8%. This quarter benefited from the settlement of certain discrete tax items. Net income for the quarter of $218 million was up 7.2% versus the prior year's first quarter. Our diluted share count of 34.7 million was down 7.7% from last year's first quarter. The combination of these factors drove earnings per share for the quarter to $6.29, up 16.2% over the prior year's first quarter. Relating to the cash flow statement, for the first fiscal quarter, we generated $357 million of operating cash flow. Net fixed assets were up 8% versus last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $83 million and reflected the additional expenditures required to open 9 new stores this quarter. Capital expenditures on existing stores, hub store remodels, work on development of new stores for upcoming quarters and information technology investments. For all of fiscal 2013, our CapEx was approximately $415 million and we'd expect our CapEx to be in line with that for fiscal year 2014. With the new stores opened, we finished this past quarter with 4,843 stores in 49 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico; 363 stores in Mexico; and 4 in Brazil for a total store count of 5,210. Depreciation totaled $55.8 million for the quarter versus last year's first quarter expense of $50.7 million. With our excess cash flow, we repurchased $292 million of AutoZone stock in the first quarter. At quarter end, we had $177 million remaining under our share buyback authorization. Our leverage metric was 2.5x this past quarter. Again, I want to stress we manage through appropriate credit ratings and not any one metric. The metric we report is meant as a guide only as each rating firm has its own criteria. We continue to view our share repurchase program as an attractive capital deployment strategy. Accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 116%. Next, I'd like to update you on our inventory levels in total and on a per-store basis. We reported an inventory balance of $2.9 billion, up 9% versus the Q1 ending balance last year. Increased inventory reflects new store growth, along with additional investments and coverage for select categories. Inventory per store was up 5.4% at $566,000 per store, reflecting our continued investments in the hard parts coverage. Finally, as Bill previously mentioned, our continued disciplined capital management approach resulted in return on invested capital for the trailing 4 quarters of 32.7%. We have and will continue to make investments that we believe will generate returns that significantly exceed our cost of capital. Now I'll turn it back to Bill Rhodes. William C. Rhodes: Thank you, Bill. We are pleased to report our 29th consecutive quarter of double-digit earnings per share growth. Our company has continued to be successful over the long run. That success is attributable to our approach to leveraging our unique and powerful culture and focusing on the needs of our customers. We focus on executing at a high level consistently, which we believe can be a competitive advantage. To execute at a high level, we have to consistently adhere to living the pledge. We cannot and will not take our eye off of execution. Success will be achieved with an attention to detail and exceptional execution. Before I conclude, I want to reiterate that our initiatives around inventory assortment, hub stores, commercial growth, Mexico, ALLDATA, E-Commerce and Brazil are all very exciting to us. We feel these initiatives will lead to increasing sales for 2014. While our industry sales, according to NPD data made available to us, have been slower, we expect the less robust growth is more from the near-term macro pressures than long-term structural change. It didn't surprise us that our retail sales results remained sluggish this past quarter as several macro headwinds had yet to lap themselves. Based on our read of the trajectory of the macro influences, combined with our existing and exciting new initiatives, we are optimistic about our sales for the balance of the year. Our long-term model is to grow new store square footage at a low single-digit growth rate and we expect to continue growing our Commercial business at an accelerated rate. As we continue to execute on our financial model, we look to routinely grow EBIT dollars in the mid-single-digit range or better in times of strength. And we leverage our very strong and predictable cash flow to repurchase shares, enhancing our earnings per share growth into double digits. We feel the track we are on will allow us to continue winning for the long run. We believe our steady consistent strategy is correct. It is the attention to details and consistent execution that will matter. Our belief of solid consistent strategy, combined with superior execution, is a formula for success. We are investing in the key initiatives that will drive our long-term performance. In the end, delivering strong EPS growth and ROIC each and every quarter is how we measure ourselves. We remain committed to delivering on our strategic and financial objectives. Before we move to the question-and-answer period, I'd like to take this opportunity to recognize and say goodbye to one of our great leaders. In early January, Harry Goldsmith, Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary, will be retiring. Harry has provided sage advice to our company and its leaders for the past 20 years, and his contributions have been invaluable. He will certainly be missed. But he has built a strong team that will continue to prosper after his retirement. As we thank him for his service, we want to wish Harry and his family all the best in their future endeavors. Now we'd like to open up the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question today is from Simeon Gutman with Credit Suisse. Simeon Gutman - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Bill, just curious what you're thinking in terms of competitive response to some of the changes that are happening around you. Does AutoZone need to accelerate its position in the Commercial arena? Or is it sort of pay-as-you-go and slow and steady as far as just trying to build the business and then benefit from potential disruption? William C. Rhodes: Yes. All right. I don't know what's going on with that phone. Great question. Simeon, would you mind going on hold if this is on your line? [Technical Difficulty] William C. Rhodes: Terrific question. And Simeon, I'll come back to you once I answered to see if you have any follow-ups. There are some pretty significant changes that are going on in our industry. Frankly, when we look at those, number one, we have terrific competitors, both on the retail side and the commercial side across-the-board. And our retail and commercial competitors are going to get better over time. It doesn't matter whether there's a major transition -- transformational acquisition or if they're just out there doing what they do everyday. We will certainly monitor what happens on the landscape. There's a lot yet that we don't know how that acquisition is going to be implemented. We'll certainly monitor and stay close to it. But the bottom line is we have what we believe is a very robust strategy. And regardless of what others are going to do, it's more important that we focus on what we're going to do and how we get better. As I mentioned in the prepared comments, we really have taken on kind of a step-change in looking at new initiatives and tests and we're very excited about those. I think we need to focus on what we're doing and let everybody else do whatever they're going to do. Simeon, do you have a follow-up? Simeon Gutman - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Yes. One follow-up but it's not to that, it's a different question. I'm sorry if the phone is coming in choppy. So 2013 turned out pretty solid despite some choppiness on the DIY side. Everything is pointing to that maybe we'll see a little bit of a pickup here in the near term. But if we don't, playing the other side of that, if things stay choppy, could the business still see a mid-teens type of earnings growth or high single-digit EBIT growth if the DIY business stays under pressure next year? William C. Rhodes: Well, I think I'd go back to one of the things that I said towards the end of our comments, is that our approach going in is we're going to grow square footage in the low single-digit range and then grow Commercial on accelerated rate, which we believe is a formula to drive mid-single-digit growth rate in EBIT. And then we're going to add our share repurchase on top of that, which will comfortably get us in the double digits. Whether or not we can grow in the teens or the mid-teens, that's always an uphill battle for us. But I'd say when you step back and look at what we've done over the last several years, we've been able to accomplish that. Following up on that, though, one challenge that we do have this year is the second quarter last year was particularly challenging for us and we very aggressively managed our expenses. As the sales environment has improved a bit, we think it's important that we get up -- get caught up on a little bit of the things that we're behind on as we make sure that we don't slow down the momentum that's building in this. So I think you can look for us to be a little bit less aggressive than we were last year this time on the operating expenses. Simeon Gutman - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : [indiscernible] I guess at the expense of reining in some of the costs, that will stay on plan? William C. Rhodes: I'm sorry, I didn't hear the first part of that. Simeon Gutman - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : New store growth, new store openings. William C. Rhodes: New store growth, we're a little bit behind as we enter the year. That's not atypical for us. We'll be on the 150 stores range in the United States and roughly 40 in Mexico and still progressing in Brazil, although that's a little harder to forecast. Operator : The next question is from Chris Bottiglieri with Wolfe Research. Aram Rubinson - Wolfe Research, LLC: It's Aram. Chris, maybe I should have you ask the question because I've, obviously, got some problems. Can you do me a favor and just talk about the gross margin a little bit? Your competitors have made huge amounts of inroads getting gross margin rate closer to yours. And I know you said earlier you don't manage the business to a gross margin rate, but if we were to adjust the income statements for the warehouse and distribution costs that you both include, I would say the O'Reilly's gross margin is probably higher than yours even though they've got a lot more commercial and a lot less private label. Wondering if you can talk about whether you've got an opportunity to improve that over time or if there's some other reason I should think about as to why that spread might exist? William T. Giles: I think the way we're looking at our gross margin is that we've had some improvement in this past quarter and, frankly, over probably the last 3 quarters on lowering some of our acquisition costs. Clearly, we haven't seen some of the inflation aspects that we have experienced in years past, which helped drive a little bit some of the retail increases, which can be beneficial to gross margin. As we mentioned before, AutoAnything has probably a drag to the tune of 37 to 40 basis points per quarter for the last 3 quarters. So that masked some of the productivity that the merchant organization has done in terms of improving their overall gross margin. And then keep in mind that we're, obviously, growing our Commercial rate -- Commercial business at an accelerated rate, which also, as that we mentioned in the prepared comments, continues to be a little bit of a headwind on our gross margin rate overall. That business gets to be a bigger piece of the pie, but we've dealt with that for several quarters, several years and we've done a good job of being able to demonstrate improvement in gross margin in spite of that. So we look at our gross margins relatively healthy, it continues to grow. I think we're doing a great job from a sourcing perspective. I think we -- our supply chain organization runs a pretty tight ship. We clearly had some headwinds from AutoAnything, but again, we're kind of focused on dollars and not so much the rate. Aram Rubinson - Wolfe Research, LLC: So Bill, I appreciate that comment. I guess I was just trying to make sense more of the level than the pace of change and I just would have thought that kind of level-for-level, that you guys would be, with the private label and the commercial mix difference, I guess I would have thought that you guys would be kind of head and shoulders above but -- so that was kind of one thing. And then the second question I had is around the average ticket moderating. Can you talk to us about kind of the age of the vehicles that your parts are servicing and maybe the size of job if that's been the issue or if it's really more like-for-like price deflation or disinflation? William C. Rhodes: Yes, I don't think it has anything to do with the mix of products that we're selling based on the age of vehicles. It's really, in the last several years, we had fairly significant inflation in commodity-based products, oil-based products, steel-based products, lead-based products, and really at an accelerated rate over what we've seen in the past. And so we had some fairly significant average ticket growth. That has not only waned, it's basically ceased. And in some cases, as Bill just mentioned, it's going backwards. And so it's put a short-term, or mid- to short-term headwind on the average ticket. We don't think it's something that's structural over the long term once we anniversary it in another couple of quarters. We think it will probably go back to a more normalized rate. Operator : The next question is from Michael Lasser with UBS. Michael Lasser - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : I'm curious about how you are communicating some of the changes you're making to your business, to your customers. So with the inventory investments, are you messaging that to the Commercial customers? And if not now, do you plan to do that over time, especially as there should be or potentially could be some business up for grabs in the dislocation following some of the M&A activity? William C. Rhodes: Yes, I think that's a terrific question. Number one, a lot of the changes that we are making are tests, so they're discrete tests in discreet markets. And while we don't want to go out on a macro basis and talk about it, because we don't know if those tests are going to be successful, we don't know what the ultimate outcome will be, the people on the ground in the local market are certainly going out and sharing with their customers what the changes are. Once we finish and I've talked about the inventory availability tests we have going on, it's going to take us about the balance of this fiscal year, I think and we believe, until we have that figured out where we're going. Once we have that solved, then we will have a more robust communication plan and marketing plan, either leveraging our very talented sales force or other mechanisms. But it's too yet -- it's too early yet to do that. Michael Lasser - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Okay. My follow-up question was on the inflation topic. Given that it's just been such an important theme this year, is there a way you can, potentially, quantify what the impact has been over the last few quarters to your comp? And do you -- how do you expect that to unfold as we enter calendar 2014? William C. Rhodes: I mean, it's been between 1% and 2% off of its historical norms. Sometimes, in the last couple of years, it's even higher than that. But over what the long-term trajectory of average ticket growth has been, it's been between 100 and 200 basis points off of that. As far as winter debates, we've been dealing with it now in a big way for the last couple of quarters. Once we anniversary that, hopefully, it will subside some and start increasing back at more normalized rates. Operator : The next question is from Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : My first question relates to your comment on advertising spending. I know you spoke about SG&A sort of more theoretically as you thought about the year. You did talk to a shift in ad expenses out of Q1. Can you talk about, perhaps, when and how you intend to redeploy those dollars? And any rough sizing will also be very helpful. William T. Giles: Yes, I think we probably called down, if I recall, in the press release, it was somewhere around 10 basis points or so. And it's really just a shift, Matt, from Q1 to Q2. So I suspect some of those dollars will be spent more in Q2 and it's really just more of a timing shift than anything else. Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Great. And in terms of your inventory investment, to date, the incremental inventory has been basically completely funded by your payables ratio and I guess you have yet to find a ceiling as to how long that can continue. As you continue to build the inventory and it sounds like it's working for you, would you expect to continue to have neutral working capital implications from that decision? William T. Giles: I think we'll have to see exactly how these tests work out and how much inventory we will continue to add and we will continue to add inventory over the next several quarters. So our -- we would love to have it to be a neutral working capital impact, but we'll have to see how that shakes out. It may have a little bit of pressure on working capital, but I would suspect if it does, it will probably be a year or 2 from now. Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Got it. And then third and finally, you spoke explicitly about your retail or DIY market share and I realize that there might be third-party data sources that made that a bit more accessible to you. The real pickup, to your point, in rate of change seem to be in commercial, where you saw some nice acceleration in the underlying commercial same-store sales. Do you have a sense as to whether that is a market share dynamic for you? Or would that, in your view, relate to some pickup in the market overall? William C. Rhodes: Yes, I'd say a couple of things, Matt. Number one, we've been gaining commercial share very consistently over a long period of time. Over the last 12 months before this quarter, our rate of growth had slowed in Commercial. That reaccelerated in this quarter. However, on the Retail side, where we had grown market share for 3 years, over the last 12 months, we were not growing market share and we were losing some market share. We began to reemerge with growing market share over the last couple of months. That doesn't make a trend yet, but we're encouraged by it. So I would say it was really a pickup in share in both is what we saw. Operator : The next question is from Bret Jordan with BB&T Capital Markets. Bret David Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division : A couple of questions on the inventory build that I think you commented that some of the less productive inventory in the store was being replaced with some of the new inventory. And I guess as we look at maybe expectations on inventory turn, as you're building this, can you offset what in theory, I guess, would be slower-turn inventory because it's the incremental product that it was not the high velocities that you would normally stock. Will you be able to offset some of that slowing inventory turn off the build by taking out some of this unproductive inventory you're finding in the stores? William T. Giles: I would say, in fairness, probably not completely. I think if we can make a tradeoff in order to be able to have more inventory locally in the marketplace to be able to say yes on a more frequent basis, that's ultimately what we're trying to do. We believe that on a long-term basis, that will improve market share. So I wouldn't say that we are going to do exactly what you just said, but I would not necessarily think that it's going to increase our inventory turn. William C. Rhodes: I would add one thing too, Bret. As these new algorithms that we've created, we have a high degree of confidence in them. But we're being more aggressive on the inventory adds than we are on the deletes. If we add inventory too early in the life cycle of the vehicle, it's no big deal. It will be in the life cycle 2 years from now. We want to -- we're doing about 1/2 of the deletes now and we'll come back and do the other 1/2 next year. So that will also be a little bit of a pinch point for us over the next 12 to 18 months. Bret David Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division : Okay. And I guess have you said, what you think, logistically you can get personal or inventory updates. It sounds like we're going to build for a few quarters now. I guess, inventory up 9% year-over-year. Is that sort of a growth rate we might see for the next -- for the balance of the year? Or give us a sort of an idea where we might shake out at the end of the day. William C. Rhodes: I wish I could give you more clarity. The inventory growth that we had this quarter, we said about 40% of it was due to the new rollout of algorithms. We anticipate that will continue -- that portion of it will continue for the next 3 quarters. The big unknown is we have these big tests that were out there trying to understand increasing inventory in hub stores, trying other hubs -- increasing the assortment in hub stores even farther and they will service other hub stores and these daily or -- excuse me, more frequent deliveries out of our distribution centers. We just don't know where that's going to go right now. As we get towards the end of the tests, we will be as clear as we can be with you where that's headed, but it's just too early to make that call right now. Operator : The next question is from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : On that -- follow-up to that inventory per store question, is there a way to track how much of that inventory investment, let's say, attributed to Commercial comps or DIY comps or overall comps this past quarter? William T. Giles: Internally, yes. Externally, we wouldn't disclose that necessarily. So we're going to be able to track, what we believe, the lift in sales is for that incremental inventory by channel. But we're seeing, as we always have when we've added inventory, improvement in both sides of the business. So it's not an effort to improve inventories strictly for one particular side of the business. Both Retail and Commercial, both benefit from the increase in inventory. Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Okay. But you did mention that the Commercial side seems to be responding more to the hard parts. So it sounds like there's a little bit more lift on the Commercial side. William T. Giles: Well, they're concentrated on the hard parts side of the business, so yes. Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Okay. And on the DIY share side, is there a way to -- can you look at that data regionally to see where -- were you losing share in certain regions and is that -- is it coming back and stemming and then coming back in those similar regions? William C. Rhodes: The market share information that we have has changed over the last couple of years. We used to have very detailed information of very broad set of our direct competitors that allowed us to see very granular information at the category level and at the regional level. That went away, I guess almost 2 years ago now. So in that data set, we can only see national information based upon hard parts and nonapplication-specific parts. There is another data set that is a broader group of retailers, includes some mass and other sectors outside of us that's sales floor only. And we can see on the sales floor-only things on a very large regional basis. But because the data is not that big, it's not that helpful for us to dig in on a regional basis. Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Understood. And then on the -- that 10-basis-point advertising shift out of 1Q to 2Q, just so we understand, is there more expenses on top of that shift that you're referring to or the pressure on expenses, I guess, versus what you saw this quarter year-over-year. Is it strictly related to advertising or is there also more payroll and other expenses coming in? William T. Giles: I think the way we articulated is think about the advertising as kind of a standalone and there should be a little bit of a shift from Q1 to Q2. I don't want to anticipate our overall advertising expenditures to be dramatically different this year versus last year in totality, but there may be a shift between the quarters. I think one of the things that Bill was highlighting earlier was that we were aggressive on some of our expense control in Q2 last year that as we look back on it and know some of the things that we're doing now with the initiatives, with a more normalized winter, with a little bit of sales momentum, that we want to be able to keep that in track. And so we're going to manage our expenses mindfully, but at the same time, we're going to want to be able to deliver great customer service and continue to focus on capturing market share. Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Understood. And then the last one, just in terms of AP to inventory, I mean, how high is high? Did you ever think that you would get to 115%? Obviously, the inventory per store additions is actually diluting that down a bit, so the underlying trend seems to be higher there. Is there an upper boundary of where you think that number can go? William T. Giles: Again, no problem. I don't know if there's an upper boundary per se. Although we're mindful of the fact that again, we want to be able to say yes on a more frequent basis. So winning for us is going to be driving commercial sales and driving retail sales and not necessarily getting to a specific AP to inventory ratio per se. I think as we look over time and we determine what the appropriate inventory levels are, it's really going to be a function of whether inventory turns slows a little bit. And if inventory turns slows a little bit, then the AP to inventory ratio will begin to cap out at some point in time and moderate. So we feel great about what we've accomplished. The merchandising organization has done an outstanding job of helping them manage to those kinds of industry-leading numbers and we'll continue to push it. But I don't expect to see a significant amount of upside to that just yet. Operator : The next question is from Seth Basham with Wedbush. Seth Basham - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division : You guys mentioned a moderation in average ticket on the DIY side. But help me understand better what's going on in the Commercial side as you're adding inventory? Are you seeing average ticket increasing? And is that being driven by number of units in the basket or price or something else? William C. Rhodes: Yes. Number one, we don't focus nearly as much on average ticket and customer account in Commercial. We're trying to bundle as much as we can in every single delivery. And so that can have some fluctuations that aren't necessarily demand-based like they are on the Retail side. What I would tell you is that the commodity piece is certainly a much smaller part of the business than the commercial piece. So the loss of that commodity-based inflation would not be seen at the same -- to the same degree in Commercial. Seth Basham - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division : Understood. I guess the reason I asked is because if you're getting more units from that basket, your profitability on each delivery is probably going to move up. I want to understand, as you make these inventory investments and get additional sales, how does profitability coincide with that incremental capital you're spending and what's going to happen to returns on capital over the next 2 quarters? William C. Rhodes: We can barely hear you. Seth Basham - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division : Sorry. Let me repeat that. What I'm trying to understand is as you're making investments in inventory, at the same time, you're trying to grow your commercial sales, you're going to make more profitable sales if you had more units in that basket per transaction. And I want to understand that balance. Are you going to see returns on capital moderate over time or are you going to be able to offset that with improved profitability on your commercial sales? William C. Rhodes: Yes, obviously, any growth that we get into Commercial business is, in and of itself, very additive to return on invested capital. The real question is going to be what comes out of these inventory investments that we make over time. And as I said earlier, some of that's yet to be known. The bigger piece to me on the broadening the inventory assortment is not necessarily that it's additive to the basket. What we're trying to do is be able to answer our Commercial customers' call and say yes every time. And in some cases, it's not about a basket play as it is about getting that next phone call when they have an odd part. And so I don't necessarily think it will be as much about basket as it will be about just moving up the call list for that Commercial customer. Seth Basham - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division : Great. Lastly, a follow-up on SG&A. You guys mentioned incremental expenses in the next quarter. Does -- do any of those expenses have to do with plans for the Affordable Care Act? Did you make any changes to the way your labor mix is between part-time and full-time or do anything else that might impact your health care costs going forward? William T. Giles: That's a good question. No, we're not really doing anything structurally in response to the Affordable Health Care Act. I would say that overall, though, in the short term, we expect to have some increase in costs as a result of the act. I don't think it's going to be material. We're more interested to see how the legislation plays itself out over the next couple of years. I think it will have a bigger impact 2 to 3 years from now than it will for the next 12 months. So we don't expect it to be a big storyline in the fiscal year 2014 for us. Operator : The final question today is from Greg Melich with ISI Group. Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : I want to start with just a housekeeping one, Bill. The weak shift that impacted DIY, which quarter does that come back in? I assume the second or third quarter, just given the seasons? William T. Giles: Yes, it will kind of mute itself out over the year, but kind of pick up a little bit of it in the second quarter. It's just that the bigger impact of that fourth quarter, which is the summer month, swapping that out for a November week is the biggest or the most dramatic switch. But it will kind of mute itself out throughout the year. Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : Okay, great. And then another comment you made about the leverage ratio, the 2.5x net-to-EBITDAR, you mentioned that you managed through a credit rating and not a leverage number. And I just wondered if your discussions with the rating agencies have shifted at all, especially given advance and the sort of leverage they're taking on and the rating they've kept while doing that? William T. Giles: No, no changes. I just wanted to be clear that we want to be at around this BBB stable credit metric. That's what we focus on. Predominantly, each of the credit agencies have their own individual metrics as they determine how they're going to rate us. And so we just used 2.5 as a rounded number for you guys in order to do your models. Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : Okay. And then on the inventory increase, it sounds like your -- I can see why it wouldn't hurt AP-to-inventory ratio today. But if it's slow-turn inventory and you're now buying it, the reason you mentioned 1 to 2 years is that's sort of on the back end. If the stuff hasn't sold in a year or 2, it's because it's slow-returning. Is that how we should think about it when we model it out? William T. Giles: Yes and just keep in mind that we're talking in test mode at the moment. So we'll determine exactly how much we wind up adding and where it is and what the impact is going to be and have more knowledge about it as we begin to roll it out. And as Bill said, we'll probably spend the next several quarters working through the test, determining what works well. But the quick answer is yes, that would be one way to think about it. If it plays out that way, that if it does slow-turn, it would probably happen a year or 2 from now just given the nature of our overall turn. But again, we're all about putting inventory into the local market in order to say yes on more frequent basis. We want to drive sales. Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : Great. And then lastly on Commercial, sort of to tie that together, if I take the program growth and the total dollar growth, I get that they're pretty much the same. And I know new programs have less productivity. But assuming that, that encompass sort of low to mid-single digit in Commercial, if that's the metric to watch, when would you expect this inventory if the test is working to actually start to inflect that upwards? William C. Rhodes: I think it's going to take us a while to, number one, get this inventory into the marketplace. As I've mentioned, it's going to take about a year even to get it out there. Once we get it out there than we can have a more comprehensive campaign -- marketing campaign to talk to our customers about it. So I think we need to be careful not to be looking forward in the next quarter or 2. I think it will build over time, but it may not be as material as being able to highlight it at the macro level. Operator : I would now like to turn the conference over to Bill Rhodes for closing comments. William C. Rhodes: Yes, before we conclude the call, I'd just like to take a moment to reiterate that we have a long and strong heritage of consistent impressive performance. We are currently working on a variety of exciting new initiatives and tests that we believe will enhance our performance over time. Ultimately, our AutoZoners have delivered year in and year out and I'm highly confident they will continue to do so. Thank you for participating in today's call and we'd like to wish everyone a very happy and healthy holiday season and a prosperous new year. Thanks for participating today. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference. Thank you very much for joining. You may disconnect at this time.",

Operator : Mr. Rhodes, you may now begin. Bill Rhodes : Good morning and thank you for joining us today for AutoZone's 2014 second quarter conference call. With me today are Bill Giles, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, IT and ALLDATA; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax. Regarding the second quarter, I hope you've had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not, the press release, along with slides complementing our comments today, are available on our website, www.autozoneinc.com. Please click on Quarterly Earnings Conference Calls to see them. To begin this morning, I want to thank all AutoZoners across the globe for another very good quarter. This morning we reported our 30th consecutive quarter of double-digit earnings per share growth. That accomplishment is testament to our organization's focus and discipline around delivering consistent well customer service. We\u2019ll spend sometime this morning discussing our sales results and provide you some details on regional and product sales trends. We will also provide some detail on the cadence of sales throughout the 12-week quarter. Next, we will update you on our digital integration initiatives and our international store performance. Finally, we will highlight what we've been doing to improve our business model for today and beyond. We are very excited about the initiatives we're working on and believe our recent learning's will help to shape our company's future for years to come. For the quarter, we reported total sales increase of 7.3%, while same-store sales were up 4.3%. This overall sales performance showed noticeable improvement from our Q1 results. I do want to point out that part of the increase in DIY was due to the calendar shift resulting from our 53rd week in fiscal 2013. Our DIY same-store sales would have been approximately 1% lower if we were comparing to the same weeks last year. Commercial continue to outpace the growth of our retail business. This quarter retails showed marked acceleration from recent trends, but colder weather across much of the U.S. drove robust traffic on batteries and increase in wiper blades. However, our West Coast stores experienced less favorable weather for parts failures. Abnormally dry conditions led to fewer for example, wiper blade scales in our stores on the West Coast. We also experienced growth in both traffic and ticket across both our retail and commercial customer segments. Our failure related hard part categories experienced the highest growth in both retail and commercial. Clearly, the weather was a significant factor, but we also believe that work that we have been doing to improve inventory availability had us very well positioned to capitalize on the increased demand. We feel, as we continue to improve our hard parts product availability, this has led to increasing traffic and ticket, especially in commercial where the vast majority of the business is in hard parts. In regard to the cadence of sales trends for the quarter, November, December, and through mid-January our sales ran quite strong above 5% in same-store sales. However, for the last month of our quarter our same-store sales slowed. During those weeks, our results dropped into the low-single-digit range. We experienced a slowdown across both our retail and commercial businesses. The culprit strange as it is for me to say was the weather. It seems I've spent a career talking about how weather; in particular extreme weather drives positive results for us. But by late January, by the time several of the U.S. regions were experiencing their third or fourth heavy cold snap, the parts that were close to failing appear to have already failed earlier in the season. Additionally, the later storms, particularly across the southeast calls us and our commercial customers to close due to the severity of the storms and the poor driving conditions. As we look at the balance of the year, we believe there will be a lingering positive effect on our industry. Two years ago the weather looked quite mild and we highlighted that as a headwind for our business for months. Conversely, after the extensive winter we have had this year we anticipate that demand will remain strong as we head into the spring and summer seasons. While certain failure related categories were particularly strong during the second quarter, other categories specifically maintenance categories that can be deferred or challenged. We expect these deferred projects to be completed in the balance of the year. Regarding the consumer, we continue to believe our consumer remains under pressure. However we feel 2014 has several positive items going forward. One large headwind has now been anniversaried, the payroll tax reinstatement last year. Another is gas prices have begun to abate and we believe this can have a positive effect on our customer's ability to spend on routine maintenance. With approximately 10 billion of gasoline consumed monthly in the U.S., any sizeable move in price could have a material stimulus on the economy. Currently gasoline prices are approximately $3.35 a gallon, about $0.25 a gallon below this time last year. As we are heading into what is forecasted to be a more normal spring and summer weather pattern, we are optimistic on the sales front. We continue to assume the most pronounced effects would be felt in the Midwest and northeast markets, as these have been the most challenging for a couple of years. Regarding market share, the data we have available to us is showing we're gaining share on both the retail and commercial fronts. We are especially focused on improving our chance in the application parts area where our efforts to improve our assortments would have the most impact, and so far we're encouraged. We feel the initiatives we're working on are making a difference. For example we have enhanced our electronic catalogue to better serve our customers by further highlighting related items necessary to do the complete job. We believe these enhancements will improve the customer experience and will compliment the knowledge of our AutoZoners. While we are early in our efforts, the feedback we're receiving from AutoZoners and customers is encouraging. Regarding DIY ticket and traffic trends both increased for the quarter. As I previously mentioned the traffic count was much stronger earlier in the quarter versus the last few weeks. While we experienced traffic growth in commercial for several years, it was exciting to see growth in the retail channel. On the average ticket front, retail continues to be up but at a lower rate than our historical experience. One driver of the lower retail ticket has been the lack of commodity-based inflation. Currently we don't see any indications of that trend changing materially in the short to midterm. Well that is good news for our customers; it has certainly challenged our results. On the commercial front we were pleased to see a higher average ticket to another earlier more of hard part sales. Overall we don't have control over the macro factors that impact our business and that is why we had intensified our efforts on enhancing our offerings. Our effects on the initiatives we have underway or intent should lead to ongoing sales growth. We are pleased with the progress we are making on commercial business. Our sales increased 12.2% from last year's second quarter and we opened 49 new programs to finish with 74% of our domestic stores having a commercial sales program. This brings our year-to-date openings to 174. We expect to open a similar number of programs this year as we did last year. Our all other businesses increased approximately 31% over last year. Starting this quarter we began anniversary acquisition of AutoAnything. The all other segment of our business includes AutoAnything, autozone.com and ALLDATA. Regarding all these businesses, we've introduced the idea of being more digitally integrated. Therefore we've made this one of our four strategic growth priorities, along with Retail, Commercial, and International. While in an early stage we believe this can be an important and significant opportunity for us to deepen customer relationships and ultimately grow sales. At this point the evolution of our online offering we're focusing more on data compilation and building a knowledge portal than on current sales. Today, shoppers used our websites for educating themselves what they need for their vehicles and they continue to buy the vast majority of what they need from our stores, which to us makes perfect sense and is in line with our operating plans. Our objective is to satisfy our customer's needs regardless of how they want to interact with us. Now, I'd like to update you on our initiatives. Last quarter we discussed that we were testing a handful of initiatives that focused on increasing our ability to say yes to our customers parts needs, in both retail and commercial. We establish tests last summer, focused on increasing the depth of coverage available at the store, hub stores and at our distribution centers. Product initiative at the hub stores and distribution centers also included tests around frequency of delivery to the stores that they service. Over the last several months, we have significantly increased the pace of strategic assessments and challenged ourselves to review our tests results very carefully. The amount of time and effort going into this effort has been nothing short of extraordinary. Our entire organization owes the subset of individuals who are leading in this effort tremendous gratitude. On last quarter's call, we highlighted that one of our test initiatives was complete and in the process of being implemented. This initiative was the enhanced modeling for stores SKU placements, where we would significantly add incremental inventory while simultaneously removing unproductive inventory. At the end of the quarter, we were complete with about 75% of this initiative. But it is important to note that much of this additional inventory again arriving at our stores very late in the quarter and some is still in the distribution centers. This has been a massive undertaking and this can cause considerable work at the stores and in the distribution centers, as you can see our per store inventories increased significantly as a result of this initiative. We have a high degree of confidence that these new assortments will drive meaningful profitable sales increases as we tested this new methodology several times before implementation. To-date the sales are generally in line with our expectations. But again, much of the inventory hasn't been positioned for sale or was positioned very late in the quarter. We've also been testing additional inventory in our hub stores. We continue to earn opportunities to add productive inventory to all of our hubs and we expect this to continue, especially if we further penetrate to highly fragmented commercial market. Additionally, we are testing a much deeper product offering in a select few hub stores and these locations are leveraging net inventory across a wide network of additional hubs and satellites. This allows us to significantly broaden the depth of the product offering closer to the customer with many stores having same day access to the broad assortment. In addition, to testing broader SKU assortments in our hubs and our distribution centers, we are also testing more frequent deliveries to both select hub and satellite stores. All of these efforts are deigned to assess the most effective way to service our customers needs and to reduce the amount of unproductive activity we have transferring products from store-to-store. It is still very early, but what we have learned as we expected that more inventory closer to the customer increase the sales. At this stage, we have not determined the optimal solution and we expect to continue to run these tests for an extended period of time. We continue to execute on our strategies to improve the customer shopping experience. We expanded five net additional hub locations during the quarter to take our total remodeled hubs to 115 locations. These remodels entail expanding the size and capacity of these locations ensuring they are in the right physical location and adding additional inventory into the market that benefits both retail and commercial. We also opened three new hub stores finishing with 160. Over time, we do expect to open more hub locations, but we believe our strategy on inventory deployment at the store level allows us to keep the number of openings at a moderate level. Last quarter, I also mentioned the new version of Z-net that was being deployed. Over the last couple of years, we have reset our expectations in regard to technology investments in an effort to leverage technology to enhance the customer experience and leverage operating efficiencies. The enhanced Z-net is the first of those efforts to be implemented. Finally, I mentioned our goal is and remains to be growing market share in 2014, while continuing to deliver solid earnings. We were successful with this objective in the last calendar quarter of 2013, according to the data available to us. However, we compete against great companies in our industry and they too are aggressively modifying their business. While we are improving, we clearly see where we can improve our selling proposition and we are focused on those areas. Our organization understands the importance of balancing investments and returns and we have to invest our time and capital accordingly. With the continued aging of the car population, we are optimistic regarding trends for our industry in both DIY and DIFM. While new car sales have been very strong these past two years, we have seen those traded-in vehicles be resold to new owners, who are repairing and enhancing their \"new vehicle\". With gas prices declining a bit here recently on a year-over-year basis, we believe miles driven can increase in 2014. Historically, lower gas prices and an improving economic outlook have led to more miles being driven. We expect that trend to remerge. We remain bullish on our industry sales growth opportunities on both retail and commercial front over the long-term, as the vehicle population remains at an all time high and consumers continue to look for good values while maintaining their vehicles, we see AutoZone's opportunity to sell to these customers only growing. Now, let me review our operating theme priorities for 2014. Our overall operating theme this year is Creating Customers for Life and the key priorities for the year are : one, Great People Providing Great Service!; two, profitably growing our Commercial business; three, leveraging the Internet; four, leveraging technology to improve the customer experience while optimizing efficiencies; and finally, improving inventory availability. On the retail front this past quarter, under the Great People Providing Great Service! theme, we continue with our intense focus on improving execution. Along with the completion of the rollout of our new Z-net software, we spent a great deal of time training AutoZoners on the system enhancements. We've tried to make the system as intuitive as possible, but along with change, we have to spend time teaching and discussing those changes. We also learned from our store AutoZoners how to improve the way the information is presented on the screen. This mutual respect for operations and technology will lead, in our belief, to a superior selling tool in our stores. We also invested more payroll in our stores this past quarter. Last year we managed expenses tightly as our sales results were below our expectations. This year, as we expected sales to improve with all of our initiatives we wanted to make sure we represented our brand well, so we added additional payroll. We should highlight another strong performance in return on invested capital as we finish Q2 at 32.3%. While slightly below last year's Q2 ROIC, excluding the acquisition of AutoAnything, we would have been slightly higher than last year. We are very pleased with this metric as it is one of the best, if not the best, in all of hard lines retailing. Our primary focus has been and continues to be that we ensure every incremental dollar of capital that we deploy in this business provides an acceptable return well in excess of our cost of capital. It is important to reinforce we will always maintain our diligence regarding capital stewardship as the capital we invest is our investor's capital. Now let me turn the call over to Bill Giles. Bill? Bill Giles : Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everyone. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to talk more specifically about our Retail, Commercial, and International results for the quarter. For the quarter, total auto part sales, which included our domestic Retail and Commercial businesses, our Mexico stores and our four stores in Brazil, increased 6.5% over the 12 weeks. Regarding macro trends, during the quarter, nationally, unleaded gas prices started out at $3.29 a gallon and finished the quarter at $3.38 a gallon. Last year gas prices increased $0.18 per gallon during the quarter, starting at $3.43 and ending at $3.61 a gallon. We continue to believe gas prices have a real impact on our customers' abilities to maintain their vehicles and we continue to monitor prices closely in the future. We also recognized that the impact of miles driven on cars over 10-years-old, the current average is much different than our newer cars in terms of wear and tear. Miles driven data, reported by the Department of Transportation are available only through December. While October was up 2.3%, while November was down 0.2%, December was up 1.1%. The other statistic we highlight is the number of 7-year-old and older vehicles on the road which continues to trend in our industry's favor. Another key macro headwind last year was the favorable tax reinstitution, while we do not expect to benefit this year, we simply are anniversarying a negative event from last year, it is hard to gauge what the benefit this will have on our traffic but it won't be an additional pressure point like it was last year. For the trailing four quarters, total sales per auto part store was $1,754,000. This statistic continues to set the pace for the rest of the industry. For the quarter, total Commercial sales increased 12.2%. Commercial represented 16.3% of our total company sales and grew $35 million over the last year's second quarter. Last year's commercial sales mix percent was 15.6%. We believe there are ample opportunities for us to continue to improve many facets of our operations and offerings and therefore we are optimistic about the future of this business. Year-to-date we opened 174 new programs versus 93 programs up in last fiscal year. We now have our commercial program in 3,595 stores supported by 160 hub stores. Approximately, 1,080 of our programs are 3-years-old or younger. With only 74% of our domestic stores having the commercial program, and our average revenue per program below several of our competitors, we believe there is further opportunity for additional program growth, in addition to improved productivity opportunities in current programs. The tests on inventory that we've conducted provide us with one of the pieces of information on how to close the gap of competitors that are more productive and commercial than us today on a per outlet basis. We understand where share opportunities exist and we remain focused on closing that gap. We believe we're on the right track when it comes to our ability to climb the call list to becoming our customers' first call. In summary, we remain committed to our long-term growth strategy. We have accelerated the growth of our commercial programs having opened over a thousand programs in the past 36 months. 30% of the programs are 3-years-old or younger. And we believe we are well positioned to grow this business and capture market share. Our Mexico stores continued to perform well. We opened four new stores during the second quarter. We currently have 367 stores in Mexico. Our returns and profit growth continue to be in line with our expectations. Regarding Brazil we opened no new stores in the quarter and have four stores open as of the end of the quarter. Our plans remain to open in total about 10 stores, then pause our development as we refine our offerings and prove that our concept works for our customers and it's financially viable. At that point we will talk more on our long-term growth plans. Recapping this past quarter's performance for the company, in total our sales were $1,099,000,000, an increase of 7.3% from last year's second quarter. Domestic same-stores sales were sales for stores opened more than one year were up 4.3% for the quarter. As Bill has mentioned earlier, our last four week sales results were below the run rate of the first eight weeks. We attribute much of this decline to even harsher than expected winter weather in certain parts of the country keeping customers at home, indoors along with an excessive amount of precipitation challenging customers to complete vehicle projects outdoors. Additionally we believe many of the failure parts that were subject to failure during extreme temperatures had already failed earlier in the season. Moving onto gross profit, the gross margin for the quarter was 52.1% of sales, up 25 basis points versus last year's second quarter. The improvement in gross margin was attributable to higher merchandise margins, lower shrink expense, offset primarily by the inclusion of the recent acquisition of AutoAnything. In regards to inflation, we continue to see modest decreases in costs year-over-year. This was different than in past years. At this point our assumption is we'll experience subdued producer pricing for the foreseeable future and therefore we feel costs will be predictable and manageable. We will remain cognizant in the future developments regarding inflation and we'll make the appropriate adjustments should they arise. Looking forward, we continue to believe there remains opportunity for gross margin expansion within both the retail and commercial businesses. However, we do not manage to a target gross margin percentage, as the growth of our commercial business has been steady headwind on our overall gross margin rate for a few years we have not bothered to call out the headwind quarterly as an integrated part of our business model. Additionally, AutoAnything has been a slight drag on our gross margins as this business model operates at a lower gross margin rate. As we anniversaried our acquisition of AutoAnything during Q2, our margin comparisons will be comparable going forward. Our primary focus remains growing absolute gross profit dollars. SG&A for the quarter was 35.2% of sale, higher by 42 basis points from last year's second quarter. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of sales was primarily due to the timing of advertising expenditures in Q2 from Q1. As I had mentioned a few moments ago, our investments were favorable, did leverage our domestic -- did deleverage our domestic store operating expenses as a percentage of sales. Advertising, however, was the larger single component to the increase. While expenses are higher than last year, they were budgeted and were in-line with our expectation. We continue to believe we are well-positioned to manage our cost structure and response to our sales environment. EBIT for the quarter was $337 million, up 6.2% over the last year's second quarter. Our EBIT margin was 16.9%. This represented a decrease of 17 basis points versus the previous year's second quarter. Interest expense for the quarter was $39.5 million, compared with $41.3 million in Q2 a year ago. Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $4.311 billion approximately $310 million more than last year's Q2 balance of $3.998 billion. Our adjusted debt level metric finished the quarter at 2.5x EBITDAR. While in any given quarter we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on management's opinion regarding debt and equity market condition, we remain committed to both our investment grade rating and our capital allocation strategy. Our share repurchases are an important element of that strategy. For the quarter, our tax rate was approximately 35.3%, lower than the last year's second quarter of 36.2%. This quarter benefited from certain discrete tax items. Net income for the quarter was $193 million, was up 9.4% versus the prior year's second quarter. Our diluted share count of $34.3 million was down 7.2% from last year's second quarter. The combination of these factors grows earnings per share for the quarter to $5.63 million, up 17.8% over the prior year's second quarter. Related to the cash flow statement, for the second fiscal quarter, we generated $151 million of operating cash flow. Net fixed assets were up 6.5% versus last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $77 million and reflected the additional expenditures required both from 32 new stores this quarter, capital expenditures on existing stores, hub store remodel; work on development of new stores for upcoming quarters and information technology investment. Additionally, we purchase the rights to certain customer relationships in connection with our ALLDATA business. These investments were approximately $11 million this year with an additional $20 million to be paid over the next two years. For all of fiscal 2013, our CapEx was approximately $415 million. With the new stores open, we finished this quarter with 4,871 stores in 49 states, the District to Columbia and Puerto Rico, 367 stores in Mexico and 4 in Brazil for a total store count of 5,242. Depreciation totaled $58.4 million for the quarter versus last year's second quarter expense of $52.3 million. With our excess cash flow we repurchased $200 million of AutoZone stock in the second quarter. At quarter end, we had $727 million remaining under our share buyback authorization. Our leverage metric was 2.5x this past quarter. Again, I want to stress, we managed the appropriate credit ratings and not any one metric. The metric we report is meant as a guide only as each trading firm has its own criteria. We continue to view our share repurchase program with an attractive capital deployment strategy. Accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 113%. Next, I'd like to update you on our inventory level one a per store basis. We reported an inventory balance of $3.1 billion, up 12% versus the Q2 ending balance last year. Increased inventory reflects new store growth along with additional investments in coverage for select categories. Inventory per store was up 8.3% at $589,000 per store, reflecting our continued investment in hard parts coverage. Finally, as Bill previously mentioned, our continued disciplined capital management approach resulted in return on invested capital for the trailing four quarters of 32.3%. We have and will continue to make investments that we believe will generate returns but significantly exceed our cost of capital. Now, I'll turn it back to Bill Rhodes. Bill Rhodes : Thanks, Bill. We are pleased to report our 30th consecutive quarter of double-digit earnings per share growth. Our company continues to be successful due to our long term focus. That focus on exceptional customer service is part of the AutoZone DNA. We focus on executing at a very high level consistently, which we believe can be a competitive advantage. To execute at a high level, we have to consistently adhere to living the pledge. We cannot and will not take our eye off of the execution. Success will be achieved with a strong attention to detail. But we also have to evolve and change to adapt to our ever evolving industry. The initiatives we are working around inventory assortment, hub stores, commercial growth, Mexico, ALLDATA, e-commerce and Brazil are all very exciting to us. We feel these efforts will lead to increasing sales for 2014 and beyond. Our industry sales, according to the NPD data made available to us, accelerated this past quarter. We continued to experience share gains on both the retail and commercial fronts. While, this is exciting we cannot be complacent. We are just starting to implement our major initiatives and the best we believe is ahead of us. Our long-term models to go new source new store square footage and a low-single-digit growth rate and we expect to continue growing our commercial business at an accelerated rate. As we continue to execute on our financial model, we look to routinely grow EBIT dollars in the mid single digit range or better in times of strength, and we leverage our very strong and predictable cash flow to repurchase shares enhancing our earnings per share within to double digits. We build the track we are on will allow us to continue winning from a long run. We believe our study consistent strategy is right. It is the attention to details and consistent executions that will matter over time. Our belief that solid consistent strategy combined with superior execution is a formula for success. We are investing in the key additions that we will drive our long term performance. In the end, delivering strong EPS growth and ROIC each and every quarter is how we measure our sales. We remain committed to deliberate on our strategic and financial objectives. Now I would like to open up the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question today is from Alan Rifkin with Barclays. Alan Rifkin : Couple of questions, if I may, first one to Bill Rhodes. Bill, you spoke about the lingering positive effect from weather on hard parts. And while it's easy to probably determine what the immediate effect is on battery, you may be provide a little bit more color on how you think that lingering effort is going to be and what proportion of the hard parts are typically accepted longer term from adverse weather? Bill Rhodes : Yes, Alan, and I think the best proxy that we have in recent history was two years ago when we had a very mild winter of 2011-2012. If you recall in April and really on through October of that year, we continue to call the lingering impact in our business and it was really in the maintenance category places like brakes and chassis that didn't get replaced at the same rates that they had in previous years. Now we attribute a lot of that to the lack of snow and ice, lack of snow piles, lack of potholes in the roads. And clearly from an out of the winter that we just had our expectation is that those categories should be robust. Also, those categories specifically that I talked about brakes and chassis and the line, they were challenged Q2. We had great performance in batteries and wipers and antifreeze, but a lot of categories where the customer could defer them they did the defer them, and we expect those deferrals to come back. Alan Rifkin : So Bill, what you say is the positive effect this year from the poor weather equal to the core effect we had on revenues a couple of years ago from the unseasonably warm weather that we had? Bill Rhodes : I see your guess is as good as mine on that one, Alan. I'm just -- I'm bullish about it, but we're going to see how it plays out. Alan Rifkin : Thank you second question may be for Bill Giles. Hey, Bill, with less than 30% of the hub stores under three years old, what is the ramp on the revenue growth that newly opened hub stores look like? Was most under maturity captured post three years? You can maybe provide a little bit more color on that, I'd appreciate it. Bill Giles : Yes, actually unlike a traditional retail new store a lot of it is captured really in the first two to three years. So there is a continued ramp in the maturating post that, but there is a much more accelerated ramp in the first frankly a couple of years and sometimes even shorter than that depending on the market that we get into. And then the other thing with an addition to having a increasingly maturation process of the new commercial programs that's just all the initiatives what we are doing. So we are trying to make every program better every single day and a lot of things that Bill talked about on the inventory availability, we think it will help in that process. Alan Rifkin : One last question if I may to Bill Rhodes. Obviously, with one of your major competitors completing the acquisition at Carquest recently, there were certainly -- it was well documented at Carquest that was on the auction block for quite some time. Are you at liberty to maybe elaborate on what it was about the Carquest that did not interest you in moving forward more aggressively? Bill Rhodes : That's a tough question, Alan. I think I'd rather keep our deliberations to ourselves. I think those could have competitive implications over the long-term and one other industry consolidation. Alan Rifkin : All right. So you never try that. Bill Rhodes : I appreciate the question. I understand it. I just don't think it will be appropriate for us to comment on it. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Dan Wewer with Raymond James. Dan Wewer : Bill Rhodes, a question on the inventories entering the next quarter 8% higher than a year ago. Is this all additional SKUs or were you finding you didn't have enough depth in the existing SKUs to fulfill commercial ordering? So for example may be your systems shows your X stock was two pieces of a certain SKU, but I've got a commercial customer asking for four pieces and therefore you were having to say no. Bill Rhodes : Yes. What you've seen to-date is the vast majority of it has been incremental coverage, not incremental quantities. We are, as I mentioned we are testing a lot of different things and then in some respects some of those tests are increasing or decreasing the quantities of the parts that we have based upon the delivery frequency of that store. But what you've seen to-date, the vast majority of it has been incremental coverage. I did want to reiterate it that a lot of it came in right at the end of the quarter. Dan Wewer : You talked about that your management is doing a lot of analytical work on the payback on the inventory investment. Could you help us understand the implications for our GM ROI? I'm assuming it's probably dilutive but if you could tell us what you are seeing in your tests? Bill Rhodes : Yes, certainly as we go farther down the curve -- farther down the bell curve, it is clearly GM ROI dilutive to where we are today. Let's remember we're 32.3% ROIC. But a lot of decisions, opening a new store a lot of times is dilutive to ROIC. We're very comfortable that it's going to provide us with reasonable returns well in ahead of our cost of capital. Dan Wewer : And then just the last question and I know we have talked about this in the past but when you look at your tests improving your delivery capabilities in commercial, what do you think are the advantages and what are the disadvantages relative to competitors to build large distribution centers and then could achieve a lot of the same benefits? Bill Rhodes : Well obviously the disadvantages of significantly changed or significantly with broader distribution network are so costly, it's quite costly. And so we're looking at several different things and we've made no decisions at this point in time on the other initiatives. We've rolled out our improved algorithms for store replacement. But we've not made any decisions about distribution centers, hub stores or the like. We're in the midst of testing all those things. But we're encouraged -- we're encouraged by all the different things we're testing. But what we now have to move is to figure out is which one is the optimal approach. Which one provides the best return at the lowest cost? And I think that's going to take us a couple, two or three more quarters to figure that out. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Michael Baker with Deutsche Bank. Michael Baker : Thanks. So a couple of questions on the commercial. I just wanted to go back. You said, Bill Giles, that stores that are two or three years old in the commercial business ramp up quite well in terms of the sales and in fact even faster than the retail business. So I guess I don't fully understand why you wouldn't be seeing greater sales on the commercial business if you have so many immature store, so many stores in that 1% to 2% to 3% of three-year-old cohorts and those would be driving higher sales growth? Bill Giles : They do and then but at the same time, we still have, keep in mind 30% of the commercial programs that we have opened today are all less than three-years-old. So they're continuing to ramp and that's driving down a little bit of our productivity when you look at it on an average basis. And the other thing is obviously we're at 74% penetration. And as we continue to ratchet that up, will be some level of cannibalization not significant, but it will be a little bit until we just continue to penetrate the market overall. Michael Baker : So I guess that explains why the sales per store would be lower. But still I would think the growth rate would be higher and so perhaps and here's my second question, is it a function of increased competition in the commercial business on the West Coast O'Reilly is maturing more and more every year with their CSK stores and then in the Northeast, you did the VIP acquisition? So is it possible that you're just seeing more competition in the commercial business? Bill Giles : I wouldn't say more because obviously those are replacements of existing competition. Michael Baker : Better perhaps. Bill Giles : Yes, I would say they're slightly better capitalized. But what we've got a 3% market share or less. We continue to believe there is a lot of Greenfield opportunities and we got to continue to drive our productivity. Also I think the inventory availability and not to hang our hats just on that, we've got a lot of initiatives going on. But I think more inventory in the market place is going to be beneficial for the Commercial programs, both DIY and Commercial, but specifically Commercial as well. Operator : Thank you. (Operator Instructions) The next question is from Greg Melich with ISI Group. Greg Melich : My question is really about the inventory addition and its impact on ticket and what it does to the AP ratio going forward. Specifically did you -- is it too early or did the increased SKUs help ticket in either do it for me or DIY in the quarter? Bill Giles : That's a great question. I think it's a little too early for us to see whether or not both that inventory and as Bill said, still -- some of it's still on the pipeline has an impact on ticket. We would expect it to drive it a little bit overall as we continue to be able to say yes to more profits, more demand but in the future. So might the inventory ratio perspective I think over time that that will likely to put a little bit of pressure on AP to inventory. But I suspect that will be over a couple of year kind of a timeframe, I don't see that in the immediate future necessarily. But it also points to the fact that we've got opportunities and try to reduce some of the unproductive inventory that we have in the chain as we continue to replace this with other additional SKUs and that we're grow inventory grow SKUs and will put a little bit of pressure on inventory churn and put a little bit of pressure on AP to inventory ratio and I suspect that that will be over a couple of years and not something in the immediate future. Greg Melich : And you mentioned 75% of the initiative is done in terms of the enhanced SKU placements. If you look at all the other things that you listed that are still on test, could you help us understand the magnitude if you decide to go through with those, would it be a lift of inventory similar to what we have seen so far per store? Bill Rhodes : Yes, Greg this is Bill Rhodes. Number one, one of the initiatives that we're working on or competing against each other where you have a delivery methodology frequency change out of the distribution centers but at the same time we also have a mega hub notion that's doing the same kind of work. So we don't really -- it's hard to say what's going to happen. When I look at it I don't think there would be nearly significant increase in inventory as a result of these initiatives because you would be talking about deploying inventory in fewer number locations either hubs or distribution centers. This is not talking additional inventories in the stores and if you increase the frequency of delivery you're also going to bring the quantities of inventory in the stores down. That could actually be a benefit to inventory but it would require capital and operating expenses to get that benefit. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from John Lawrence with Stephens &Company. John Lawrence : Bill would you comment a little bit the follow-up on Alan's question a little bit about the frequency change as far as the deliveries. I mean I know some of those hub stores have gone may be once or twice or maybe even three times a day to some of these stores. Could you talk a little bit more about that and how does this, the bay or the garage know that you have this additional inventory. Bill Rhodes : That's a great question on how the garage knows that, the way that they know is our incredibly talented sales force is out anytime you give a sales person or an operator additional inventory they are going to tell everybody and so that's a big part of our sales message right now. As far as the frequency of deliveries in the standard hub stores, we really haven't changed those in the last two or three years. We did increase them pretty significantly in '09, '10 timeframe but now we are testing something and this is again just in test and that's kind of a mega hub notion, where it's a hub serving additional hubs, so I think that one hub that might be servicing six or seven other hubs. And if they are in the same major metropolitan areas it might be serving that additional hub multiple times a day and then for the long faraway hubs it's only servicing them once a day. John Lawrence : And just to follow that in periods when these bays and garages are very busy. Does that give the opportunity to that third and fourth player in the market to really move up on that call list because of the increased demand? Bill Rhodes : I think increased demand but more importantly increased availability. When the shop finds, you have something that somebody else doesn't that gives you real opportunity and move up that list. Particularly you are doing a great job of service. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Aram Rubinson with Wolfe Research. Aram Rubinson : One question and a follow-up. The first one is about volatility. Some of the metrics that we see are kind of steady as ever, EPS growth being in the 15% to 17% range, cash flow you mentioned very predictable and steady. SG&A a little bit more volatile and sales, little bit more than historical, but can you talk to us about the underlying patterns of customer behavior that you're seeing inter-quarter, inter-week, to understand kind of what it is that the customer is kind of preferring and just wondering if you can give us a historical perspective on volatility? Bill Giles : The second quarter for us is always an incredibly volatile of time, it's the most volatile period of time that we have. Number one, you have the holidays in there. Number two, weather patterns can be extremely different one week to the next. Last weekend it was 70 degrees here in Memphis, today the kids, Shelby County's schools are out, because it's ice and snow. So those kind of changes will really change the volatility -- the customer traffic patterns. The other thing that's been different for us, and we talked about is our average ticket, our average ticket for about the last nine months has been, it's still growing, but it's been more muted growth and the big part of that is due to the lack of commodity-based inflation, we had significant commodity-based inflation for a couple of years and that slowed down a little bit. We think that will continue for a reasonable period going forward, we don't see a change. Aram Rubinson : Just a follow-up. On your comment earlier, Bill Rhodes, about inventory and kind of willing to put inventory in so long it's kind of in excess of your cost of capital. How do you philosophically think about inventory when your cost of capital is effectively zero and what are guard rails telling us when it's going to hit that diminishing return? Bill Rhodes : We know everything to a 15% after tax IRR. So regardless of what happens to our cost of capital, we're going to hold every investment through a 15% IRR with the exception of a few real estate decisions that we make in strategic markets where we have to hold them, because we hold them to at least 12%. Aram Rubinson : How does payables factor into that, because that effectively makes the cost of adding inventory free in that regard? Bill Rhodes : Yes, we charge the initiative with payable, with the inventory and don't give it the payables benefit although we let some of the inventory come back at the end of the IRR calculation period. Aram Rubinson : That's real helpful. Thanks. Bill Rhodes : The burden of those costs are real and just because we're able to get the AP coverage on doesn't mean that we don't need to look at that very closely and make sure we are making wise business decisions. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Bret Jordan with BB&T Capital Markets. Bret Jordan : A couple of questions, another question around the inventory. I guess if you look at sort of the puts and takes, the scale of purchasing the incremental inventory versus the possibly lower margin of growing the Commercial business. In the gross margin improvement year-over-year, could you sort of give us the impact of both sides of that? Bill Giles : I would say that the increase in the inventory during the quarter had some additional supply chain cost et cetera, but there wasn't a benefit per se from the additional purchasing of the inventory that would necessarily bolster gross margin, at least at this stage, it wouldn't happen till the inventory is sold necessarily. So that answers it, Bret. Bret Jordan : And then I guess as you talked about market share, could you give us any color regionally were there markets that you gained relatively more share in? Bill Rhodes : Yes. The information that we get today about market share is not at the same level of granularity on a regional basis, we only get regional information on non-application products. So I don't really think it's wise for us to get into those discussions. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Michael Lasser with UBS. Michael Lasser : Now that you've had time to see the results of both the inventory and the labor investments, do you think these initiatives will give to you -- will allow you to fully close the commercial productivity gap with your peers? And is that the goal here? Or do you think that if you do close the productivity gap, it will be return dilutive, you don't necessarily want to get there? Bill Rhodes : Number one, we want to focus on us, not our competition. We believe we have tremendous opportunities for increased business in the Commercial business over time. We don't think it's going to come one week or one quarter or one year, it's going to take us improving our model, continuing to work with our sales force, continuing to deepen our relationship with our customers. I believe that the initiatives that we're working on particularly the inventory availability initiatives will have a big benefit to us going forward. But it's not going to be measured in quarters it's going to be measured in years. As for the inventory that we added, again, I will reiterate that we added right at the end of the quarter, so we didn\u2019t see much of it. As far as the payroll addition and I appreciate you calling that out. We really -- last year the second quarter was really tight and our sales trends weren't very exciting. And so we very aggressively managed our payroll, and in hindsight we felt like we too aggressively managed it. So we didn't -- we weren't that aggressive this time. Now that was a one quarter event. That was not something that we did in Q3 and Q4. It was really a Q2 event that we've now annualized. Michael Lasser : Then as my follow-up question, I think some of your comments around the cadence of the comp during the quarter have raised some questions about sustainability of the recent industry performance. Could you parse may be on a regional perspective, did you see the same type of slowdown on the West or the less weather affected areas? And have you seen that continue into the current quarter or maybe there's been less adverse weather? Bill Rhodes : Yes. We kind of have a standing practice not to talk about the current quarter, but I appreciate you bringing that up. So let me add a little bit more specifics to it. In the last month that we talked about, there were three weeks. The first three weeks of that month where it was snow and ice across much of the Eastern United States including the South. Those three weeks, we had significant pressure on our sales. The final week of the quarter, we had much improved weather and our business was materially better. That also coincided with when the tax refunds started flowing in the marketplace. We had the combinations of improved weather and tax refunds and we saw a material improvement in our business. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Seth Basham with Wedbush. Seth Basham : I think you just helped us understand the calendar shift a bit with that last week being so strong. Bill Rhodes : Right. Seth Basham : But going forward, should we expect any changes with calendar shifts in the balance of the year? Bill Rhodes : We all wait, it cost us 70 bps in the first quarter, it cost us about 1% here. I think it should be -- it's certainly going to be neutral for the balance of the year. There is going to be a slight shift between Q3 and Q4? It's going to depend, just like you picked up on, it wasn't going to be a big event until we had a really strong last week and that infotainment event. I know what the first week of this quarter is going to be, but I don't know what the last week is going to be. So, I think it's anybody's guess. Seth Basham : And just picking apart the SG&A deleverage in the quarter a bit, can you give us the puts and takes year-over-year as it relates to some of the line items around payroll and advertising, et cetera, and were there any incremental investments for your initiatives? Bill Giles : I would say that there wasn't a lot of incremental investments on the initiatives. There were some additional costs. I think payroll deleveraged probably less than 10 basis points or so, but to Bill's point earlier, that was really a function of us kind of keeping more consistent with our payroll model where last year we probably got off of that a little bit and we really made some cuts that in retrospect we didn't want to repeat as we went through Q2. In Q1, we mentioned that there was going to be some timing related to advertising where we pushed some advertising from Q2, or Q1 into Q2, and that was worth probably a little over 20 basis points. So that's kind of the majority of that 42 basis points. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Brian Nagel : I actually have just a couple really quick questions. One, we've already discussed weather a lot, but is there a way to specifically look -- you take the comp you hedge in the fiscal second quarter, how much of that was directly attributable to the weather? Then the second question, I think to some extent you discussed it in your prepared comments, but the buyback, looking at my model here, you obviously continue to buy back stock, but it would seem like a slightly or a modestly slower pace than it had been in prior quarters. Any reasons we should be thinking something into that? Thanks. Bill Rhodes : All right. I'll take the first and I'll give Bill Giles the second one. It's really difficult to quantify the impact of the weather. And again, it has puts and calls, so we can see that our batteries and starters and alternators businesses are up pretty significantly. Conversely brakes and chassis and the like are down. I think it did have a benefit; I would characterize it in the 1% to 2% range. But I also think that we've got this pent-up demand which should help us going forward. We love the extremes. But if you don\u2019t get the extreme weather and those batteries don't fail than it's going to be the next extreme when they do fail. So we got that business and now hopefully we'll get the deferral of the maintenance business as we look forward. Bill Giles : I would just say. I have nothing to really read on the stock repurchases. We'll try to be relatively consistent year-over-year, quarter-over-quarter so I wouldn't read too much into that. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. Scot Ciccarelli : You mentioned the tight payroll couple of times. You were talking about the year-over-year SG&A I'm curious did that lead to changes in employee turnover at all and in addition to that with some of the industry consolidation we've seen is employee turnover a greater concern may be than what's been in the past? Bill Rhodes : No. We haven't seen any material change in employee turnover. We did see a material reduction when the onset of the recession and we've seen it kick up 1% or 2% over certain quarters, but it has nothing material. As far as the industry dynamics, I think number one it's far too early to see what any ramifications of those changes are. But we are always looking for great people that love the AutoZone culture and if they want to come join a great team we'd love to have them. Scot Ciccarelli : And when do you think that might play out, you said it's still too early. Just given your experience in the industry, and obviously with acquisitions themselves like when would we start to see when people are kind of placing their longer-term debt is it after three months, is it six months is it a year, just kind of given your experience wondering what your thought process is. Bill Rhodes : It all depends on what the strategy is and what the level of execution on that strategy is. It can happen very quickly. If there is a massive determination, on what the integration plans are or it can take a year. It's all going to depend on the implementation pace. Operator : Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over the speakers for any closing comments. Bill Rhodes : Before we conclude the call, I'd just like to take a moment to reiterate what separates us from the other players in our industry; our culture is very unique. Being part of the AutoZone family and striving to improve its very unique across the entire retail landscape, it's the passion to continue to build our culture that will carry us to new heights. We are currently working on the variety of exciting new initiatives and tests that we believe will enhance our performance over time. Ultimately, our AutoZoners have delivered, year in and year out, and I'm highly confident that with them leading the charge, our future is incredibly bright. Thank you for participating in today's call. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's conference. Thank you for joining. You may disconnect at this time.",

I hope everyone had a wonderful Memorial Day weekend. With me today are Bill Giles, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, IT and ALLDATA, and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax. Regarding the third quarter, I hope you\u2019ve had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter\u2019s results. If not, the press release along with slides complementing our comments today is available on our website, www.autozoneinc.com. Please click on Quarterly Earnings Conference Calls to see them. To begin this morning, I want to thank all AutoZoners across our organization for delivering another solid quarter operationally and financially. This morning, we reported our 31st consecutive quarter of double-digit earnings per share growth. While past success is no guarantee for future performance, this consistency in earnings is something we strive to attain each and every quarter. This morning, we\u2019ll discuss our sales results and provide you some details on regional and product sales trends. We\u2019ll also provide some detail on the cadence of sales throughout the quarter. Next, we will update you on our various initiatives. We\u2019re very excited about all the initiatives being worked and believe our progress can benefit the company\u2019s sales and earnings trajectory for years to come.  For the quarter, we reported a total sales increase of 6.2% while same store sales were up 4%. In retail, we experienced same store growth in both traffic and ticket, although ticket growth continues to be subdued versus historical growth rates due to the lack of inflation. As expected, during the quarter the deferrable maintenance categories that were challenged during the harsh winter rebounded nicely, while the failure-related categories that were so strong during the winter continued to grow but at slower rates than in the second quarter. These category sales trends also existed in commercial as well but weren\u2019t as pronounced as they were in retail. Overall, domestic commercial sales growth accelerated to 14% this quarter versus 12% last quarter. We continue to be pleased with our progress in commercial and we see tremendous opportunities for additional growth through further penetration of existing customers and acquisition of new customers. For the quarter, we opened 137 new programs to finish with 76% of our domestic stores operating commercial. This brings our year-to-date openings to 311. We expect to open approximately 400 programs this fiscal year. While weather has been a big topic throughout the retail sector recently, we felt weather in general didn\u2019t have a material impact on our results. We felt the bigger story was the rebound in the deferrable maintenance categories; however, our west coast markets were challenged for the quarter and we attribute that to milder, wetter weather conditions in those markets. During the quarter, our sales trends were strongest during the first part of the quarter when winter initially subsided and tax refunds began in earnest. Tax refund season has become a more important driver of our business in recent years as our customers\u2019 discretionary spending has been more challenged. During the latter part of the quarter, our sales fluctuated consistent with the weather patterns. We continually to believe our customers are financially strained. One recent additional pressure point has been the increase in gas prices. During the quarter, gas prices increased $0.29 and are currently $0.07 higher than the same time last year. Based on the dialog we see across retail, the low end consumer seems to be particularly challenged. Our all other businesses sales increased 7% over last year. The deceleration versus the last several quarters is due to the annualization of the Auto Anything acquisition in December. The all other segment of businesses includes Auto Anything. AutoZone.com, and ALLDATA. These businesses performed in line with our expectations. Now I\u2019d like to review our initiatives for the year. Our operating theme this year is creating customers for life, and the key priorities for the year are : great people providing great service; two, profitably growing our commercial business; three, leveraging the internet; four, leveraging technology to improve the customer experience while optimizing efficiencies; and five, improving inventory availability. On the retail front this past quarter under the great people providing great service theme, we continued with our intense focus on improving execution. We continued to enhance our operating systems to make them as intuitive as possible. We also continued to invest more payroll in our stores. Last year, we managed expenses especially tight as our sales results were below our expectations. This year as we expected sales to improve with all of our initiatives, we wanted to make sure we represented our brand well, so we added payroll. One area of specific emphasis the last few years has been on the safety of our AutoZoners. We felt our rate of injuries in our stores and in our vehicles were unacceptable. We owe it to every AutoZoner to provide a safe working environment. While these efforts are nowhere near complete, I\u2019m quite pleased and impressed by our team\u2019s relentless focus on safety, and our performance in this area has shown significant improvement.  After a strategic review in the winter of 2012-2013, last spring we began to design, develop and implement tests focused on improving our local market inventory availability. Our markets are designed to improve inventory coverage in all stores, increase the frequency of replenishment from our distribution centers, offer broader assortments from our hub stores, leverage the broadest assortment in select hub stores, increase stores\u2019 inventory holding capacity, and finally improve our overnight delivery of hard-to-find products. I\u2019d first like to congratulate all the AutoZoners that are working on these initiatives. We have made more progress in the last 12 months than I would have expected. To date, we have learned a tremendous amount. Most of our efforts have had encouraging results, but this has led us to develop additional tests. We are in a position today to have a definitive point of view on the ultimate outcomes. It will likely take several additional quarters. One of the initiatives was to improve the hard parts placement methodology in all stores. We completed our testing last spring and began implementing last summer. As of the end of Q3, the majority of this effort is complete. We have been pleased with our results to date as the new items we have added have performed generally consistent with our expectations. While this effort certainly adds additional product, it also removes unproductive inventory at an accelerated rate compared to our previous methodology. In this initial phase, we decided to be less aggressive with the deletes than the additions. Based on our performance to date, we anticipate deleting the balance of those unproductive items over the course of the next year, concurrent with our category reviews. Regarding increased frequency of delivery from our distribution centers and/or leveraging select hub stores with expanded assortments, we have substantial work and testing to complete but the initial results are encouraging. These initiatives are somewhat competing initiatives and our current focus is to determine the optimal methodology. Additionally, we are beginning to test different delivery frequencies to determine the most effective approach. Also this quarter, we opened a few stores with a quote-unquote new prototype. To the casual observer, not much has changed as the majority of the changes are in the back room and are focused on increasing the holding capacity in the hard parts area. This change significantly increases our holding capacity and we will be migrating to this new plan in the fourth quarter for new stores. The combination of these tests has led to increased inventory and additional costs. Again, we have learned a tremendous amount and we are encouraged by our results, but we still have substantial testing to complete. We will keep you abreast of developments in future calls. Additionally, we expanded our total hub locations by one, finishing at 161, and we continued to expand or relocate hubs. We have now expanded or relocated 120 hubs. We expect to continue to open a modest number of new hubs and our expansion relocation efforts are also continuing. As we mentioned on last quarter\u2019s earnings call, we\u2019ve introduced the idea of being more digitally integrated and we made this one of our four strategic growth priorities along with retail, commercial and international. While in an early stage, we believe this can be an important and significant opportunity for us to deepen customer relationships and grow sales. At this point in the evolution of our online offering, we\u2019re focusing more on data compilation and building a knowledge portal than on current sales. Today, shoppers use our websites for educating themselves on what they need for their vehicles, and they continue to buy the vast majority of what they need from our stores. Our objective is to satisfy our customers\u2019 needs regardless of how they want to interact with us. As we head into the final quarter of our fiscal year, we remain optimistic on our prospects. Although we have some concerns about the health of the consumer due to ongoing financial strains and increasing gas prices, we are pleased with our execution and excited about our ongoing strategies. We are encouraged by increasing traffic counts and the increases we have experienced in the deferrable maintenance categories, which we expect to continue through the summer. Additionally, our acceleration in commercial further builds our confidence in our strategies and tactics to address this vitally important growth vehicle. Over the long term, we remain bullish on our industry\u2019s sales growth opportunities in retail, commercial, international and on the digital front. As our results highlight, we are intensely focused on delivering consistent performance, investing more aggressively in times of strength and managing our expense structure tightly during more challenging periods.  We also reported another strong performance in return on invested capital as we finished Q3 at 32.4%, slightly ahead of last year. We are proud of this metric as it is one of the best, if not the best in all of hard lines retailing. However, our primary focus has been and continues to be that we ensure every incremental dollar of capital that we deploy in this business provides an acceptable return well in excess of our cost of capital. It is important to reinforce that we will always maintain our diligence regarding capital stewardship as the capital we invest is our investors\u2019 capital. Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Bill Giles. Bill? William Giles : Thanks Bill, and good morning everyone. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to talk more specifically about our retail, commercial and international results. For the quarter, total auto parts sales, which includes our domestic retail and commercial businesses, our Mexico stores and our four stores in Brazil, increased 6.1% over the 12 weeks. Regarding the macro trends during the quarter, nationally unleaded gas prices started out at $3.38 a gallon and finished the quarter at $3.67 a gallon. Last year, gas prices decreased $0.07 per gallon during the third quarter, starting at $3.61 and ending at $3.54 a gallon. We continue to believe gas prices have a real impact on our customers\u2019 abilities to maintain their vehicles and we will continue to monitor prices closely in the future.  We also recognize that the impact of miles driven on cars over 10 years old, the current average, is much different than on newer cars in terms of wear and tear. Miles driven data reported by the Department of Transportation are available only through February. January was down 1.3% while February was down 0.8%. The other statistic we highlight is the number of seven-year and older vehicles on the road, which continues to trend in our industry\u2019s favor.  Another key macro headwind last year was the payroll tax reinstitution. While we do not expect to benefit this year, we simply are anniversarying a negative event from last year. It is hard to gauge what benefit this has had or will have on our traffic, but it won\u2019t be an additional pressure point like last year. For the trailing four quarters, total sales per auto parts store was $1,767,000. This statistic continues to set the pace for the rest of the industry.  For the quarter, total domestic commercial sales increased 14%. Domestic commercial sales represented 17.3% of our total company sales and grew $50 million over last year\u2019s Q3. Last year\u2019s commercial sales mix as a percent was 16.2%. We believe there are ample opportunities for us to continue to improve many facets of our operations and offerings, and therefore we are optimistic about the future of this business. Year-to-date through Q3, we have opened 311 new programs versus 195 programs last fiscal year.  We now have our commercial program in 3,732 stores supported by 161 hub stores. With only 76% of our domestic stores having a commercial program and our average revenue per program below several of our competitors, we believe there is further opportunity for additional program growth in addition to improved productivity opportunities in current programs. The tests on inventory that we have conducted provide us with information on how to close the gap with competitors that are more productive in commercial than we are today on a per-outlet basis. With the support of additional inventory available in markets and a more seasoned sales force, we believe we have long runway to grow both traffic and ticket with our commercial customer base. As Q3 showed improvements from Q2, we believe we\u2019re on the right track to continue to show growth. In summary, we remain committed to our long-term growth strategy. We have accelerated the growth of our commercial programs, having opened 1,200 programs in the past 36 months, which is 32% of the programs are three years older or younger. We believe we are well positioned to grow this business and capture market share. Our Mexico stores continue to perform well. We opened seven new stores during the third quarter. We currently have 374 stores in Mexico. Our returns and profit growth continue to be in line with our expectations. Regarding Brazil, we currently are operating four stores and our plans remain to open approximately five more stores over the next year and the pause our development as we refine our offerings and prove that our concept works for our customers and is financially viable. At that point, we will talk more on our long-term growth plans. Recapping this past quarter\u2019s performance for the company, in total our sales were $2,342,000,000, an increase of 6.2% from last year\u2019s third quarter. Domestic same store sales or sales for stores open more than one year were up 4% for the quarter. As Bill mentioned earlier, this quarter\u2019s results were very much in line with last quarter\u2019s. We continue to evaluate our inventory additions and the impacts we\u2019re having on sales results. We feel we\u2019re well positioned for the upcoming quarter to grow sales. Gross margin for the quarter was 52% of sales, up 17 basis points versus last year\u2019s third quarter. The improvement in gross margin was attributable to the higher merchandise margins and lower shrink expense partially offset by the higher supply chain costs associated with current year inventory initiatives. In regards to inflation, we continue to see modest decreases in cost year-over-year, and this is different than in past years. At this point, our assumption is we\u2019ll experience subdued producer pricing for the foreseeable future and therefore we feel costs will be predictable and manageable. We will remain cognizant of future developments regarding inflation and will make the appropriate adjustments, should they arise. Looking forward, we continue to believe there remains opportunity for gross margin expansion within both the retail and commercial businesses; however, we do not manage to a targeted gross margin percentage. As the growth of our commercial business has been a steady headwind on our overall gross margin rate for a few years, we have not bothered to call out the headwind quarterly \u2013 it is an integrated part of our business model. Our primary focus remains growing absolute gross profit dollars. SG&A for the quarter was 31.5% of sales, higher by 39 basis points from last year\u2019s third quarter. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of sales was primarily due to the higher store payroll and the benefit recorded last year for the net gain on disposal of certain assets. We continue to believe we are well positioned to manage our cost structure in response to our sales environment. EBIT for the quarter was $479 million, up 5% over last year\u2019s third quarter. Our EBIT margin was 20.5%. This represented a decrease of 22 basis points versus the previous year\u2019s third quarter. Interest expense for the quarter was $36.2 million compared with $42.1 million in Q3 a year ago. Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $4,378,000,000 or approximately $380 million more than last year\u2019s Q3 balance of $4 billion. Our adjusted debt level metric finished the quarter at 2.5 times EBITDAR. While in any given quarter we may increase or decrease our leverage metrics based on management\u2019s opinion regarding debt and equity market conditions, we remain committed to both our investment-grade rating and our capital allocation strategy, and share repurchases are an important element of that strategy. For the quarter, our tax rate was approximately 35.6%, slightly lower than last year\u2019s third quarter of 35.8%. This quarter benefited from certain discrete tax items. Net income for the quarter of $285 million was up 7.4% versus the prior year\u2019s third quarter. Our diluted share count of 33.7 million was down 7.7% from last year\u2019s third quarter. The combination of these factors drove earnings per share for the quarter to $8.46, up 16.4% over the prior year\u2019s third quarter. Related to the cash flow statement for the third fiscal quarter, we generated $463 million of operating cash flow. Net fixed assets were up 6.3% versus last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $102 million and reflected the additional expenditures required to open 37 new stores and four relocations this quarter, capital expenditures on existing stores, hub store remodels, work on the development of new stores for upcoming quarters, and information technology investments. For all of fiscal 2014, our CAPEX is expected to be approximately $440 million. With the new stores opened, we finished this past quarter with 4,901 stores in 49 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, 374 stores in Mexico, and four in Brazil for a total store count of 5,279.  Depreciation totaled $58.1 million for the quarter versus last year\u2019s third quarter expense of $52.9 million. With our excess cash flow, we repurchased $420 million of AutoZone stock in the third quarter. At quarter-end, we had $307 million remaining under our share buyback authorization. Our leverage metric was 2.5 times this past quarter. Again, we want to stress we manage to appropriate credit ratings and not any one metric. The metric we report is meant as a guide only as each rating firm has its own criteria. We continue to view our share repurchase program as an attractive capital deployment strategy. Accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 114%.  Next, I\u2019d like to update you on our inventory levels in total and on a per-store basis. We reported an inventory balance of $3.1 billion, up 12% versus the Q3 ending balance last year. Increased inventory reflects new store growth along with additional investments and coverage for select categories. As we highlighted earlier, we have been focused on improving our local market inventory availability. There are several aspects of this initiative, including improving the placement methodology of hard parts at the store level which through Q3 is largely completed. This activity contributed to an increase in inventory per store which was up 8.6% at $594,000 per store, reflecting our continued investments in hard parts coverage.  Finally as Bill previously mentioned, our continued disciplined capital management approach resulted in return on invested capital for the trailing four quarters of 32.4%. We have and will continue to make investments that we believe will generate returns that significantly exceed our cost of capital. Now I\u2019ll turn it back to Bill Rhodes. William Rhodes : Thanks Bill. We\u2019re pleased to report our 31st consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth. Our company continues to be successful due to a long-term focus. We focus on delivering exceptional customer service and executing at a high level consistently which we believe is a competitive advantage. To execute at a high level, we have to adhere to living the pledge. Like our operating theme for this fiscal year states, we must focus on creating customers for life. We cannot and will not take our eye off of execution. Success will be achieved with strong attention to detail.  The initiatives we are working on around inventory assortment, hub stores, commercial growth, Mexico, ALLDATA, ecommerce and Brazil are all very exciting to us. We feel these efforts will lead to increasing sales for many years to come. While our industry sales according to MPD data made available to us were higher than last year\u2019s results, we must remain focused on enhancing every facet of our business. While it is exciting to see our industry doing well, we cannot become complacent. We are just starting to implement our initiatives, and while encouraged, we still have a tremendous amount of work in front of us to determine the optimal approach. Our long-term model is to grow new store square footage at a low single-digit growth rate, and we expect to continue growing our commercial business at an accelerated rate. As we continue to execute on our financial model, we look to routinely grow EBIT dollars in the mid-single digit range or better in times of strength, and we leverage our very strong and predictable cash flow to repurchase shares, enhancing our earnings per share into double digits. We believe our steady, consistent strategy is correct. It is the attention to details and consistent execution that will matter. Our belief is a very thoughtful operating strategy combined with superior execution is a formula for success. We are investing in the key initiatives that will drive our long-term performance. In the end, delivering strong EPS growth and ROIC each and every quarter is how we measure ourselves. We remain committed to delivering on our strategic and financial objectives. Now we\u2019d like to open up the call for questions. Operator : [Operator instructions] The first question is from Alan Rifkin with Barclays. Alan Rifkin \u2013 Barclays: Thank you very much. Question for Bill Rhodes \u2013 can you maybe just provide a little bit of color on performance of the hubs that have so far been expanded relative to the ones that remain to be expanded? What do the productivity differences look like between the two? And then I have a follow-up, if I may. William Rhodes : Yes, thanks Alan. They\u2019re fairly significant. Now, what happens in many of the cases is the hubs as they were didn\u2019t have the space necessary to have the entire parts assortment that we wanted to have in those hubs, and so when we relocate them we make sure\u2014or expand them, we make sure that they have the physical space to hold all the inventory that we want. That inventory, we\u2019ve already determined in the other locations is productive inventory, so it\u2019s just a function of getting the space. So they performed fairly significantly better. Alan Rifkin \u2013 Barclays: Any quantification of significantly better? I mean, are the expanded ones doing 20% better than non-expanded, or is it higher or lower than that? William Rhodes : I don\u2019t have the quantification in front of us. What I can share with you is like any other investment that we have, the expansions are generating a 15% after-tax IRR because that\u2019s what we hold them to, so that\u2019s not only the inventory load but also the expense that goes into the remodel or move as well as the additional square footage. Alan Rifkin \u2013 Barclays: Okay, and one follow-up if I may. With respect to trying to increase the frequency of delivery, if you look at your product assortment, what proportion of your products would you say need to be available for delivery same day versus one day versus maybe two days, and where are you relative to that today? William Rhodes : One of the interesting facts is 70% of the SKUs that are in our stores have one piece on the shelf, so what that means is if we sell it during the week, we\u2019re out of it for up to eight days. So what we\u2019re finding in the daily replenishment model is that the biggest benefit comes from the items that are stock one and stock two, and so the frequency of delivery allows us to be in-stock much quicker. Now one of the things we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re testing five day a week delivery. Now we\u2019re going to go out and that\u2019s why we\u2019re saying, we don\u2019t know what we\u2019re going to do, we\u2019re going to go out, we\u2019re going to test other cycles \u2013 two times a week, three times a week to determine what the optimal approach is. Alan Rifkin \u2013 Barclays: Okay, thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Gary Balter from Credit Suisse. Gary Balter \u2013 Credit Suisse : Thank you. Just following up on Alan\u2019s question, is there a way to measure with your customers the fill rate that you\u2019re getting in these expanded hubs? William Rhodes : Are you asking are we able to\u2014 Gary Balter \u2013 Credit Suisse : Well I know you measure it, but could you give us some quantification that way in terms of what percent of the orders are you satisfying from the customers versus what you were before you added the inventory? William Giles : I think one of the ways to think about it, Gary, from a hub perspective is what we look at is the lift that we get out of the satellite stores that are basically pulling merchandise and product from the hubs. In essence, that was product that they might not otherwise have been able to say yes to, so I won\u2019t be able to quantify that for you right now but the fact is that, as Bill said before, we\u2019ve got our return metrics that we are looking at to determine what kind of lift each satellite store gets as we expand the hub and add more inventory into the hub, and that\u2019s kind of how we measure it going forward, so that ultimately is showing up in your comp store sales performance as well. Gary Balter \u2013 Credit Suisse : Thanks, and then just to follow up and I\u2019ll get off \u2013 Bill, you talked about the seven-plus, like your type of vehicles has been growing and continuing growing, but there\u2019s some concern about the five- to seven-year-olds as the 2009\u2019s now start hitting the equation. What are your thoughts on that? William Giles : Yes, there\u2019s a little bit of a dip in that five- to seven-year-olds, but the more important point is that the number of registered vehicles hasn\u2019t really changed significantly, so we still have the same number of vehicles out on the road and so you do have a little bit of a dip, if you will, if you look at the timeline. But for us, the advantage is that we do continue to see vehicles age and that\u2019s helpful for us, and so we\u2019re finding that our cycles or our lifecycle of product is actually getting expanded out a little bit further. Gary Balter \u2013 Credit Suisse : Great, thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Matthew Fassler \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Thanks a lot. Good morning. Thanks a lot for the color that you offered us on the composition or the mix of business as you made your way through the May quarter. As you think about the August quarter and you think about the weather that you\u2019ve experienced year-to-date, particularly the after effects of the tough winter, and you think about failure and for maintenance product, how do you envision the mix evolving \u2013 I know it\u2019s somewhat forward weather dependent \u2013 and if you could talk about the gross margin implications of that outlook. William Rhodes : Okay. The best analog that I think we have for what a harsh winter will or will not do for your business performance is two years ago, Matt, when we had a very mild winter. If you remember, we called out for some time that that mild winter really hurt us, and it particularly hurt us in the deferrable maintenance categories. Well, now we\u2019re coming off of a very harsh winter. When we came into this quarter, we said we anticipated that the failure items would slow down a bit, which they did, and we anticipated that we would see an increase in the deferrable maintenance categories \u2013 think about brake systems, chassis and the like. That\u2019s what we saw. Our expectation is that those trends will continue for some time and certainly through the summer months. As to the ramifications on our gross margin, it\u2019s not material one way or the other. We typically \u2013 and I don\u2019t think we have ever called out \u2013 that we\u2019ve had a shift in product mix that has been a key driver of our gross margins. Matthew Fassler \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Great, and then a second question that I want to ask, a brief one \u2013 so obviously you disclosed commercial total revenues and it\u2019s sort of to us to think about what the comparable store trajectory might be like, and to do that we need to think about the productivity of the new unit. Can you talk about as you\u2019ve moved deeper into the base with the commercial rollout, how the sales per new commercial program has been evolving over the past couple or three years relative to recent trend? William Rhodes : Yes, I would say it\u2019s remarkable that the new stores \u2013 and we track them out period out to 13 periods, how are they doing on both sales and EBIT \u2013 and it\u2019s remarkable the consistency of those new store openings, although they are getting slightly better year-over-year-over-year, which is counterintuitive. You would think that they would be performing worse because hopefully we\u2019ve opened the best programs earlier on in the life cycle, but I think as we get better in commercial and as we learn how to open programs better, they are getting marginally better even as we go to the less desirable programs, although they are very desirable. Matthew Fassler \u2013 Goldman Sachs : That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Greg Melich with ISI Group. Greg Melich \u2013 ISI Group : Hi, thanks. I have two questions, one on sales and a follow-up on inventory. You talk about sales through the quarter starting strong with tax refunds and weather and failure, and then getting more volatile towards the end. Could you help us with the magnitude of that? Was the early part of the quarter 2x what the end of the quarter was? William Giles : Yes, I would say probably. I wouldn\u2019t say exactly 2x, but I think it certainly softened up a little bit towards the tail end of the quarter, and that\u2019s always an odd time of the year anyways. We\u2019re kind of past the tax season, before the summer season really gets started, so it\u2019s not unexpected for us to have a bit of sales volatility during that last period of the third quarter, and we experienced it this year. I think part of it was that we just started out very strong. William Rhodes : I would also add, if you recall this quarter\u2019s call last year, we talked about a strong April and the fact that we maybe we were getting out of the challenges that we had experienced., so April was a particularly tougher comparison versus last year. Greg Melich \u2013 ISI Group : Got it, and would it be fair to say that traffic was positive through the whole quarter, even though it maybe got a little more volatile towards the end? William Giles : Yes, I think that\u2019s fair to say. Greg Melich \u2013 ISI Group : Okay, great. And then my follow up was, Bill, you mentioned your comments on inventory, that now were largely complete in terms of the additional items going in for commercial, and that we would now sort of flush out the slower turning SKUs in the ensuing near during normal negotiations. What does that do to gross margin and working capital as you go through that? William Giles : Yes, and just to clarify, in some of these product placements we\u2019re largely done. We still have some more things to do from a hub perspective, et cetera, in terms of adding inventory, et cetera, so I still think we have some opportunities to improve our coverage overall. I think from a gross margin perspective, we wouldn\u2019t anticipate that the inventory additions would have a significant impact on our gross margin rate by themselves necessarily. I mean, obviously we continue to believe there\u2019s opportunity for us to improve gross margin rates, and I think from a working capital perspective we obviously reported AP to inventory of 114% this quarter versus 111% last year, and as we\u2019ve said before, we don\u2019t anticipate our AP to inventory percentage increasing significantly going forward. We do believe that there will be a little bit of pressure on AP to inventory or working capital as we move in the next six, 12, 18 months or so, but we believe that we can kind of maintain close to these levels. Greg Melich \u2013 ISI Group : That\u2019s great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Dan Wewer with Raymond James. Dan Wewer \u2013 Raymond James : Thanks. A question for Bill Rhodes regarding inventory productivity. You noted that inventory per store is up a little over 8.5%, yet if you look at gross profit dollars per store they were up slightly more than 4%. So I guess my question, when you look at the, let\u2019s say the (indiscernible) ROI on these new SKUs, are you seeing diminishing returns from before you began the program? William Rhodes : Clearly. The inventory that we\u2019re adding today is significantly less productive than the inventory that\u2019s in our base assortment \u2013 no question about it. But when we run our models, we are very confident that even though it\u2019s less productive, that it can be a productive investment for us and we\u2019re pretty pleased with how they\u2019re performing so far. Dan Wewer \u2013 Raymond James : Then as a follow up, I believe this is the first instance since the fourth quarter of 2009 that operating margin rate declined year-over-year. Interestingly, you achieved very good sales growth in 4Q \u201909 as well, but it does raise questions that with your operating margins well above the industry average \u2013 obviously the highest in the industry \u2013 do you think we\u2019re beginning to see a peak in operating margin rate? William Giles : In the spirit of full and fair disclosure, last quarter we had a declination in operating margin as well, so that\u2019s\u2014 Dan Wewer \u2013 Raymond James : Okay, oh yes. William Giles : But you\u2019re right, though \u2013 \u201909 was the previous spot, Dan. At the end of the day, we\u2019re focused on growing operating profit dollars at high returns, so that\u2019s ultimately what we\u2019re focused on. We want to grow sales, gain market share, and we want to deploy our capital, which includes inventory and expenses, in a manner which continues to generate high returns, so that is ultimately our objective. So we\u2019re not 100% focused on just increasing our EBIT margin necessarily quarter-in and quarter-out, although we\u2019ve done a very good job of that consistently over the years. So is this the peak? I don\u2019t know the answer to that question. We\u2019re not focused on the EBIT margin, per se. We\u2019re focused on operating profit dollars and generating high returns. William Rhodes : If I may, I would add one thing \u2013 in 2005 when we created our reinvestment plan, our operating margins were at an all-time high of 17.5%. They went down to about 17% in 2006 and everybody was saying, okay, this is the beginning of the migration back to the mean in the industry. Clearly over time, we found ways to be more productive and increased our operating margin almost 250 BPs above that point in time, so I have a high degree of confidence that this team will continue to find ways to make this business more productive, but we\u2019re not going to get focused particularly on a quarter-to-quarter basis if we have some deterioration in the operating margin, as long as we\u2019ve got good returns. Dan Wewer \u2013 Raymond James : Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Kate McShane with Citi Research. Kate McShane \u2013 Citigroup: Thanks, good morning. I think when you started talking about testing changes that you\u2019re making in commercial business about two quarters ago, you thought it would take about a year to assess and complete the tests. Is this still the timeline, and once you do decide to take a direction, how long will it take to implement? And then just in addition to that, how does private label come into play with the testing of your commercial strategies and the increases in inventory? William Rhodes : Okay. On the first one as far as the timeline, I think we\u2019ve been fairly vague about the timeline because we don\u2019t know what we don\u2019t know, and I say that to say we had an initial test on daily deliveries. Now, we\u2019re saying wait a minute \u2013 we need to go test different frequency of delivery, so that\u2019s going to push out our timeline a little bit. But each initiative is not necessarily dependent upon the other, so we\u2019ve already finished what we call the optimal hurdle, which is store SKU placements. We\u2019ve now gone into a new prototype \u2013 we\u2019ve made a decision on that and we\u2019re moving forward, so every one of them is not necessarily going to be on the same timeline. But the bigger, broader ones, which by the way whatever decisions we make could have significant implications, we want to be careful and we want to make sure that we\u2019ve got the right amount of information, and that we have a long enough testing period so it\u2019s reliable. As far as how private label plays into this, number one, we don\u2019t consider it private label. We think Duralast is the best and strongest brand in the automotive aftermarket, and I hope you\u2019re enjoying our new marketing featuring Chuck Liddell. But I don\u2019t see that any of this testing to date has proven to change any of our strategies. I\u2019ll remind you that we have some very strong brands that are national brands in our stores, both on the sales floor and in hard parts, and where we find that there\u2019s a good value proposition that the customer thinks is important, we will carry a brand, be it a Duralast brand or someone else\u2019s brand. Kate McShane \u2013 Citigroup: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Chris Horvers from JPMC. Chris Horvers \u2013 JP Morgan : Thanks, good morning. So two follow-up questions \u2013 first on the gross margin, can you talk about the outlook there? And you had some pressure in the supply chain from the inventory additions that you put into the stores. Does that continue, and is it related to that deleting process that you mentioned earlier in the script? William Giles : Not so much the deleting process as it is just the overall increase in inventory movement, if you will, and so I would expect us to continue to have a little bit of pressure on supply chain costs for the next few quarters. From a margin perspective, we continue to believe\u2014we haven\u2019t had a lot of inflation in the last probably year and a half, and sometimes inflation can be your friend from a gross margin perspective, so we\u2019ve done better\u2014you know, our merchandising organization has done some really good things in order to try to improve cost from sourcing and optimizing how we\u2019re getting product into the country, so I think that there continues to be some opportunity for us to continue to grow our gross margin rate. Obviously the Duralast product continues to do well, and as we continue to increase its penetration that will also help improve gross margin rate overall. So although we have some pressures here and there, I think we feel pretty positive about our gross margin rate going forward. Chris Horvers \u2013 JP Morgan : And on the deleting side, does that create some sort of markdown risk at the store level that you need to clean out the SKUs that you don\u2019t want? William Giles : Typically not. Many of the deletes, we\u2019re able to push through the system and sometimes we\u2019re able to push it back to the vendors as well, so historically deletes has not resulted in necessarily margin pressure. Chris Horvers \u2013 JP Morgan : And then the follow-up on the commercial sales per store, it was according to our calculation down a couple percentage points year-to-year, so just following up on that productivity question, was there anything else that would have driven it down on a year-to-year basis besides the comments provided previously? William Giles : Not too much, other than just the number of stores that we\u2019re opening on a quarterly basis. I think we probably accelerated our commercial program growth rate on a quarterly basis higher this year than we did last year. Chris Horvers \u2013 JP Morgan : Okay, thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Bret Jordan of BB&T Capital Markets. Bret Jordan \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets : Hey, good morning. A quick question, a follow-up I guess on two questions around brand and Duralast versus national brand. Do you have more national brand inventory in stock this quarter versus a year ago? Is there any change in the weighting? William Rhodes : I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s material. There\u2019s pushes and pulls in various categories, but I wouldn\u2019t say there\u2019s any material change. Bret Jordan \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets : Okay, and then a follow-up \u2013 you commented on the new prototype store allowing more hard parts in the box. Could you describe that a little bit more, maybe how much incremental product can get into the store and what type of investment is involved in reformatting? William Rhodes : Well number one, we haven\u2019t made any decisions to go quote-unquote reformat. These are for the new stores that we\u2019re going to be opening, some of them in the fourth quarter. Certainly after the fourth quarter, they\u2019ll all be opening with this new prototype. It has a little bit incremental capital and expense to open the new store, but not material, but it will carry more than 20% additional hard parts than the current prototype that we have today.  Now over time, we\u2019re going to see how it performs. We have some stores that do very high volumes, so some of these elements we might want to go back and put them in there, but we haven\u2019t made any of those decisions at this point in time. Bret Jordan \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets : Okay, and then one last question. On your internet sales volumes, did Auto Anything or the online initiative grow at a faster rate than the category? I guess all other was up 7%. Did the online sales exceed that? William Giles : I\u2019d say a little bit, yes. Bret Jordan \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Brian Nagel \u2013 Oppenheimer: Hi, good morning. I wanted to follow up on the inventory issue as well. I think a couple questions ago, someone asked about the productivity of the new inventory you\u2019ve put into stores, but maybe I\u2019ll ask the question \u2013 if you look at the incremental inventory you\u2019ll be continuing to put in the stores for a longer period of time now, is there a way to think about what type of sales benefit should be derived from that? Maybe said another way, what type of sales are not occurring because the inventory is not there? William Giles : Yes, I think in essence, Brian, that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to figure out at some level, so obviously we can quantify internally the productivity that we\u2019re getting out of our adds to date, but the real question will be is when we\u2019ll be more expansive on our rollout of inventory and execute some of these tests that we\u2019re talking about as to what that will ultimately mean in sales. So I couldn\u2019t give you a number today as to exactly what that would be, but obviously we\u2019ll continue to monitor it internally. Brian Nagel \u2013 Oppenheimer: Got it. Then just as a follow up to that, you continue to\u2014the AP leverage is quite remarkable. Will that change or will AP leverage kind of stay where it is, even as you put more inventory in? William Giles : I think as we put more inventory in, the question is going to be the productivity of the inventory as a group overall, and so as inventory turns slow a little bit, if they do, then that will put a little bit of pressure on your AP to inventory ratio slightly. Obviously our merchandising organization continues to work with our vendors in order to optimize turns so that we\u2019ll continue to work hard at maintaining our AP to inventory ratio where it\u2019s been historically. But I think looking forward, we don\u2019t necessarily expect it to increase at the levels it has historically. Brian Nagel \u2013 Oppenheimer: Got it, thanks. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Aram Rubinson with Wolfe Research. Aram Rubinson \u2013 Wolfe Research : Hi, thanks. Good morning. Had a question around labor \u2013 I think you mentioned in the release you were adding labor to some stores. Can you help us think if that\u2019s more DIY oriented, more commercial oriented, and then I had a follow-up for you. Thanks. William Rhodes : Yes. Number one, I would say it\u2019s both, and we\u2019ve really moved to managing our labor more on a holistic basis rather than just DIY or commercial over the last year or so as part of our one team strategy to make sure that we\u2019re serving all of our customers exceptionally, regardless of how they interact with us. When you think about the labor increase this year, and it happened in the second quarter and it happened in the third quarter, the biggest reason for the labor increase is we really managed labor very tight last year, and in some respects we are annualizing that very aggressive management of labor because we had very tough sales trends. One thing I\u2019m proud of this organization, we\u2019ve performed very well regardless of industry headwinds or tailwinds, and last year we had to be very aggressive. So we\u2019re just annualizing that \u2013 there\u2019s no change in strategy really. Aram Rubinson \u2013 Wolfe Research : So there\u2019s no change in where you\u2019re, let\u2019s say, sourcing your parts pros from? Is there a mix of internal versus external, and if that should change? And then the follow-up I had was also around just the general harsh winter that we had, as you were coming into this quarter, I\u2019m just wondering whether or not you thought the harsh winter weather would have given you kind of even more benefit than you ended up getting, or how it compared to the expectations you might have had coming in. William Rhodes : Yes, I would say number one, we\u2019re not sourcing our people from any different sources than we have on a historical basis. Secondly, I would say that our sales performed a little bit better in the third quarter than our expectations, particularly when the winter subsided and the tax refunds were flowing. We had some tremendous weeks in that period of time, so I would say it rebounded quicker. And then, we\u2019ve been encouraged by the deferrable maintenance categories and how they\u2019ve continued to perform throughout the quarter. Aram Rubinson \u2013 Wolfe Research : In thinking about how to compare against the year from now, if this was more favorable than you might have thought, and then I\u2019ll hop off. William Rhodes : I\u2019ll say the second quarter is going to be a daunting sales quarter. I mean, we just had a tremendous weather pattern, and our failure categories were off the charts in the second quarter. Now on the other side, our deferrable maintenance categories were down, so it will be what it will be. We\u2019re up to the challenge, regardless of what we\u2019re lapping next year. Aram Rubinson \u2013 Wolfe Research : All right, thank you. Best of luck. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Michael Lasser with UBS. Michael Lasser \u2013 UBS: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my questions. I\u2019m curious about what performance metric you\u2019re seeking to maximize with all the different initiatives you having going \u2013 the availability, inventory, payroll. Is it return, it is margin, it is sales? What are you seeking to maximize, and how do you think you\u2019ll get there? William Rhodes : Well as we\u2019ve said for a long time, our two performance metrics are EBIT dollar growth and return on invested capital. That\u2019s been our incentive compensation program for 12 or 13 years now. It continues to be. So if you think about what we\u2019ve decided are the most important metrics, those are it. Michael Lasser \u2013 UBS: Okay, and then my second question\u2014sorry, go ahead? William Rhodes : Go ahead. Michael Lasser \u2013 UBS: My second question was on some of the comments you made around productivity of your commercial programs. The new ones continue to do better, so I guess inherently that means some of the more mature ones are degrading a little bit. Is there any\u2014a, is that true, and b, are there any common characteristics about what\u2019s driving the degradation in performance in some of the older commercial programs? Thank you. William Rhodes : I would not infer that the older commercial programs are degrading; in fact, they\u2019re continuing to grow. What\u2019s happening is we\u2019ve opened, what, 1,400 new locations over the last four years, so our maturity of the commercial programs is fairly significantly different than it was four years ago. So I would not read anything into the average weekly sales being relatively constant \u2013 they\u2019re all moving in the right direction. We just have a higher percentage of new programs. Operator : Mr. Lasser, does that conclude your questions? We\u2019ll move on to the next question. The next question is from John Lawrence with Stephens. John Lawrence \u2013 Stephens: Good morning guys. Bill, would you comment a little bit\u2014not to beat a dead horse with this inventory issue, but can we just talk a little bit about when you talk about those maturity of programs, I guess the other factor is now that you\u2019re at 76% hub sort of commercial program penetration, is what we\u2019re talking about is finding that optimization point to whether you can go to 90% commercial programs, or I guess the other way to look at it is how variable are these programs across the country when you open them in terms of breadth of inventory, say, compared to three or four years ago with import parts, et cetera? William Rhodes : Yes, it\u2019s a great question, John. Number one, I wouldn\u2019t say across the country that there\u2019s great variation. I would say it depends on the market and the demographics, so they perform differently in dense urban environments than they do in suburban environments versus the way they do in rural environments. They do different in heavy Hispanic or African-American or Caucasian environments. But what we\u2019re finding as we go deeper and deeper is every\u2014more and more stores have the potential than we thought, so we\u2019re continuing to grow at a pretty rapid rate. We\u2019re not closing a lot of programs \u2013 in fact, very, very few, and I think as we continue to improve our commercial business, then we find that we can operate in places we didn\u2019t think we could before.  So I don\u2019t think we know\u2014well, I will tell you, we do not know what the ultimate answer is. I think we suspect it\u2019s higher than we ever thought it was before, and the better we get, hopefully those expectations will continue to go up. John Lawrence \u2013 Stephens: And the last question there is when you\u2019re in a new market, is that incremental part that we\u2019re talking about here that maybe stocked out today with this incremental inventory, can you move up on a call list when you have that incremental part? Does that help? William Rhodes : Absolutely. You know, when you first engage with a customer, you don\u2019t start at number one, at least not on very many occasions. A lot of times, you\u2019ll start as fourth or fifth call. Well, if nobody else in town has it, now you\u2019ve got an opportunity to impress that customer, so they call you with something they didn\u2019t think you would have and you have it, and then you give them prompt, great service, and guess what? Now you\u2019ve got a chance to start moving up that list. John Lawrence \u2013 Stephens: And all those tests are just trying to optimize the capital required to get that there? William Rhodes : That\u2019s correct. John Lawrence \u2013 Stephens: Thanks a lot. William Rhodes : And the expense structure as well. It\u2019s a pretty heavy math problem, honestly. John Lawrence \u2013 Stephens: Great, thanks. Operator : Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Rhodes for closing comments. William Rhodes : Okay. Before we conclude the call, I\u2019d just like to take a moment to reiterate what separates us from other players in our industry. It\u2019s of course our culture, which is very special. Being part of the AutoZone family is very unique across the retail landscape. We are currently working on a variety of exciting new initiatives that we discuss and test and that we believe will enhance our performance over time. Ultimately, our AutoZoners have delivered year-in and year-out, and I\u2019m highly confident with them leading the charge, our future is incredibly bright. Thanks for participating in today\u2019s call. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you for joining. You may disconnect at this time.",

Bill Rhodes : Good morning and thank you for joining us today for AutoZone\u2019s 2014 Fourth Quarter conference call. With me today are Bill Giles, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, IT and ALLDATA, and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax. Regarding the fourth quarter, I hope you\u2019ve had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter\u2019s results. If not, the press release along with slides complementing our comments today are available on our website, www.autozoneinc.com. Please click on Quarterly Earnings Conference Calls to see them. To begin this morning, I want to thank all AutoZoners' across the globe for another solid quarter and year. 2014 was a very busy and productive year for us. We\u2019ve been growing our business on a variety of fronts. Our U.S. retail business expanded again in 2014 with the opening of another 148 new stores. Our commercial business continues to gain traction growing sales 12.8% on a 52-week basis with 424 net new programs opened. We now had a commercial program in 77% of our domestic stores, having opened 792 new programs in just the past two years alone, and we continued to expand our presence in Mexico. This quarter, we celebrated the opening of our 400th store in Mexico. We opened one additional store in Brazil and now have five stores in operation. We currently have approximately 8% of our total stores outside of U.S. and we believe we have growth opportunities in the United States and beyond for many years to come. We also expanded our online offerings in both our traditional autozone.com and autozonepro.com website as well as AutoAnything in fiscal 2014. ALLDATA introduced several new products and also continued its expansion in Europe this past year. Along with these strategic investments, we spent a lot of time on our core domestic retail business. Our DIY business remains the largest portion of our sales and continues to generate tremendous returns. We continue to see significant opportunities for new store growth and improved productivity in our existing stores. This continues to be our number one priority. As our commercial business continues to grow and it is intertwined with our retail business, we continued to identify opportunities to optimize our inventory placement and distribution strategy in order to respond to the ever increasing challenge of parts proliferation in our industry. We began testing a new methodology last year to improve our hard parts placement techniques in all stores. During this past fiscal year, we completed our testing and implemented this new approach. We\u2019ve been able to add additional products while removing unproductive inventory at an accelerated rate compared to our previous methodology. This has resulted in an increase to our store level inventory. This increased movement of inventory has also resulted in higher distribution cost. We\u2019ve been pleased with our results today, but continue to rely on the new process. As we\u2019ve mentioned during our last quarterly call, we\u2019ve been testing different delivery frequencies, primarily from our distribution centers. We\u2019ve been encouraged by the preliminary results although we still have more work to do in order to determine the optimal go-forward strategy. Our tests have shown us that increased delivery frequency increases sales and improves inventory productivity by reducing safety stock. We now have implemented additional test to validate our initial findings and provide us with sufficient data to develop the optimal approach. While we are more aggressive with our inventory additions this past year we feel future investments will be more targeted and refined. We believe our growth and inventory for our store will continue but in a more modest pace than last year. As we carefully analyze all of our test, we expect to have more to discuss in each of the next several quarters. As we continue to manage this organization to provide exceptional service for our customers, to provide our AutoZoners with a great place to work with opportunities for advancements. We must ensure we do it on a profitable basis to provide strong returns for our shareholders. This process requires us to have a higher degree of confidence in our plans before executing on a broad basis. We\u2019ll be holding our national sales meeting in Memphis next week. All week and again during my address to the team as the conclusion of the events, we are introducing the idea of \u201cWhy every customer every where\u201d. We have always been focused on service, but this annual operating things adds intensity and renewed focus. We spent significant systems; we\u2019ve made significant systems enhancements and investments this year in order to capture data by our customers shopping patterns across all of our platforms. We understand we have to be able to toggle between the store, the shop, the phone and online in order to meet our customer\u2019s needs. We also emphasize our ongoing inventory availability test and what they will mean for availability in 2015. I\u2019d like to take a moment to discuss our pending acquisition of Interamerican Motor Corporation doing business in the market place as IMC. They are the second largest distributor of OE quality import replacement parts in the United States. They specialize in parts coverage for European and Asian vehicles. While considerably smaller than the number one participant in the industry, IMC with 17 branches today offers an impressive growth opportunity for us. Not just because of the parts coverage, but also because of the strong management team. They are an exceptional team. We do not believe there is a significant overlap with our current commercial customer base and IMC. This new customer base is one of the reasons we are excited about this acquisition. This is a segment of the service repair population that demand OE quality. While we are comfortable with our ability to grow our current business with our existing model, IMC will be a nice compliment our commercial strategy. We expect to open a handful of IMC locations in the new fiscal year while also making the IMC parts catalog available to our domestic store base as soon as possible. We also believe we can help IMC improve its store level economics. I do want to stress we will be diligent with our growth strategies here and make sure our financial hurdles are reached as we grow. We look forward to welcoming the entire IMC team to the AutoZone family soon.  Now let\u2019s turn to our fourth quarter results. Our sales decreased 1.5% but on a comparable 16-week basis they were up 4.5%. Our domestic same store sales were up 2.1%. This quarter sales results can be summed up in one word, \u201cinconsistent\u201d. While May was quite strong and June was decent, July was not as strong. August improved but results were still quite inconsistent from one week to the next. We attribute much of this volatility to both unique weather and the belief that the low end consumer continues to struggle. We are happy to have run both positive retail and commercial comp sales for the quarter, but expected a stronger sales performance in Q4 than we delivered. Regionally the Northeast and Midwest performed better than the overall chain; however these two markets experienced similar volatility to the rest of the country in July and August. While our failure-related merchandised categories continued to perform well, our maintenance related categories were below our expectations. We attribute much of this category\u2019s underperformance to an unseasonably mild weather in July and August. Secondly, in regards to traffic versus ticket in the DIY business, traffic was negative while ticket was up. The decline in traffic was primarily attributable to the slow down of our maintenance product sales. After growing lower than our historical moments over the last year, average ticket growth accelerated in Q4. Third, we opened 113 new commercial programs in the quarter versus 173 programs last year. For the year, we opened 424 net programs for the full year reaching 77% of our domestic store base. To put our growth in the commercial business in perspective, at the end of 2011 we reported $1.08 billion in total sales compared to $1.61 billion in 2014, up 50% in three years. Lastly, I always like to recognize how effective our team delivers consistent earnings in good sales environments and not so good and that practice has allowed us to deliver an impressive 32 consecutive quarters of double digit EPS growth. That consistently allows us to be both shareholder friendly with solid earnings growth and bond holder friendly through a targeted investment grade rating and strong cash flow. We continued to manage this business for both short term and long term optimum performance. As part of our strategy of increasing inventory levels in local markets closer to our customers, this past quarter we opened five additional hub locations. Overtime, we do expect to open more hub locations, but we believe our strategy on inventory deployment at the store level allows us to keep the number of openings at a moderate level. Regarding Mexico, we opened 28 stores this quarter and reached a milestone of surpassing the 400 store mark. Our sales in the other businesses for the quarter were down slightly year-over-year on a 16 versus 17 week basis; however, as a reminder ALLDATA and e-commerce which included AutoZone.com and AutoAnything make us this segment of sales. Regarding online sales opportunities, there continue to be great opportunities for growth on both the business to business and two individual consumers or B to C. While these businesses are small for us at just 3.6% of our total sales mix on the quarter, we expect these businesses to grow at a faster rate than our brick and mortar business for the foreseeable future. With the continued ageing of the car population, we continue to be optimistic regarding the trends of the industry in both the DIY and DIFM. While new car sales have been very strong these past two years, we have seen those traded in vehicles to be resold to new owners who are repairing or enhancing their new vehicles. With gas prices on average flat year-over-year for the fourth quarter, we see miles driven relatively flat as well. As prices at the pump have recently been declining, we expect this to benefit our customers especially those most financially strapped. The low end consumer benefits the most from lower gas prices relative to income, this trend is encouraging. I know of [familiar] pumps many investors had asked us about our expectations for 2015 relative to the more difficult comparisons our industry will have in the upcoming winter months. For us, our second and third quarter results are more difficult comparisons. However, we are optimistic we can grow on all our upcoming quarters, while certain markets outperformed during the winter, this past year others under performed. We believe we should improve in those regions. As our history has shown we managed this business focusing on both the long term and the short term, and we felt our sales would be challenged in the short term if we felt ourselves to be shown in the short term due to difficult comparisons we wouldn\u2019t make material changes to our plan or operations. We will continue to balance short term and long term performance and will be keenly focused on delivering consistent strong performance and extending our streaks of 32 consecutive quarters of double digit EPS growth. Now let me review our highlights regarding execution of our operating themes 2014 creating customers for life. The key priorities for the year were : one, great people providing great service; two, profitably growing our commercial business; three, leveraging the internet; four, leveraging technology to improve the customer experience while optimizing efficiencies; and five, improving inventory availability. On the retail front this past quarter under the great people providing great service theme, we continued with our intense focus on improving execution. This past year we rolled out improvements to our electronic parts catalog. While this has rolled out to our chain earlier in the calendar year, we learned some things as the year went off. We made some modifications along the way. These changes were around how we displayed product on the screen and presented all the items necessary to do the job right. These upgrades and our other ongoing ones to the systems we believe have created the best selling tool in our industry. And our store AutoZoners agree we look forward to updating you on the results in upcoming conference calls. Behind the scenes, we have reset our expectations on technology investments and challenged ourselves to make sure our offerings are relevant across all shopping platforms. We realize as customers have become much more tech and mobile savvy we have to have a sales proposition that touches all the way as they desire to interact with us. Our current and future technology investments will lead to sales growth across all our businesses. In regards to commercial, we opened 113 programs during the quarter. For the year, we opened 424 versus 368 last year. Our expectation is we will continue to open new programs and grow our percentage of stores with commercial programs although our pace of growth will likely moderate. As we continue to improve our product assortment and availability and as we make other refinements to our offerings, we expect that the estimated sales potential from the market will grow. Our results continued to provide us confidence to be aggressive in adding additional resources and new programs to this important growth initiative, which also highlight another strong performance in return on invested capital as we were able to finish 2014 at 31.9%. We are very pleased with this metric as it is one of the best if not the best in all of hard lines retail. However, our primary focus has been and continues to be that we ensure every incremental dollar of capital that we deployed in this business provides an acceptable return well in excess of cost to capital. It is important to reinforce that we will always maintain our diligence regarding capital stewardship as the capital we invest is our investors\u2019 capital. Before I pass the discussion over to Bill Giles to talk about our financial results, I\u2019d like to thank and state how proud we are of our entire organizations efforts to manage this business appropriately and prudently. We have an amazing team and our initiatives for 2015 are exciting. With our ongoing supply chain initiatives as well as an incorporation and expansion of our acquisition of IMC, we are ready to continue to provide wide customer service to all our customers and we are ready to continue to prudently manage our cost structures to providing our shareholders with a consistent feat we have exhibited in the past. Now here\u2019s Bill. Bill Giles :  Thanks Bill. Good morning everyone. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to talk more specifically about our retail, commercial and international results for the quarter. For the quarter, total auto parts sales, which includes our domestic retail and commercial businesses, our Mexico stores and our five stores in Brazil, increased 4.5% on 16 week per 16 week basis. Including last years extra week, our sales decreased 1.5%. Now regarding the macro trends during the quarter, nationally unleaded gas prices started out at $3.67 a gallon then ended the quarter at $3.46 a gallon a $0.21 decrease. Last year, gas prices decreased $0.07 per gallon during the fourth quarter, starting at $3.54 and ending at $3.61 a gallon. We continue to believe gas prices have a real impact on our customers\u2019 abilities to maintain their vehicles and as cost reductions help all Americans, we hope to benefit from some increase and disposable income. We also recognize that the impact of miles driven on cars over 10 years old, the current average, is much different than on newer cars in terms of wear and tear. Miles driven increased in both May and June; July and August data is not available yet. The other statistic we highlight is the number of seven-year and older vehicles on the road, which continues to trend in our industry\u2019s favor. For the trailing four quarters, total sales per auto parts store was $1,724,000. This statistic continues to set the pace for the rest of the industry. For the quarter, total commercial sales increased 5.3%. On a comparable basis, commercial sales increased 11.5%. For the fourth quarter commercial represented 18% of our total sales and grew $27 million over last years Q4. Last year\u2019s commercial sales mix percent was 16%. This past quarter we opened a 113 new programs versus 173 programs opened in our fourth quarter of last fiscal year. We now have our commercial program in 3,845 stores supported by 166 hub stores. Approximately 1,200 of our programs are three years old or younger. Let me take a moment and discuss our commercial program performance. While our average sales per program is below some peers in our industry at $8500 it has grown more than 30% since 2009. It\u2019s important to highlight that we accelerated our new program growth over the past few years as approximately 30% of our programs are younger than three years old. These openings have impacted our average sales metric and cannibalized some of our older programs. However our focus is on growing market share and improving our service levels by having more programs closer to our customers. Looking specifically at our matured programs, those at least five years old, they averaged $10,000 in weekly sales this past year and also experienced steady growth each of the last five years. This year\u2019s growth versus last year slowed in these programs but were nicely positive. We still have significant opportunity to open additional programs over the next several years at the same time we will remain focused on improving the productivity of all our existing programs. But obviously -- we feel very good about the success we\u2019ve had and profitably growing the commercial business. With our inventory additions and the support of the IMC acquisitions, we are well positioned to grow our base business. Over the last several years, a significant amount of our focus has been on opening new programs and that will continue to be the case albeit at a slightly moderated case. However, we are hiking our emphasis on increasing sales and our more mature store base in fiscal 2015. We have a very talented sales force and we are enhancing training and introducing additional technology to optimize the productivity of the sales force. We have increased our efforts around analyzing customer purchasing trends and inside trends. In summary, we remain committed to our long term growth strategy. We believe, we are well positioned to grow this business and capture increased market share. For the [trailing] at this point our assumption is -- I\u2019m sorry. Let me just move onto for Mexico for a second. Our Mexico stores continue to perform well. We opened 28 new stores during the fourth quarter and 40 for the full year. We currently have 402 stores in Mexico. Exceeding 400 stores, that\u2019s a terrific milestone and we congratulate all AutoZoners involved with Mexico on this achievement. We look forward to years of growth here. Our returns and profit growth continue to be in line with our expectations. Now regarding Brazil, we opened one store in the quarter and have five stores opened at the end of the year. Our plans remain to open a few more stores and then we find our offering improved our concept works for our customers and is financially viable. While sales growth has been very encouraging, we are operating currently at a loss. Business, that\u2019s expected to having such a small store base and carrying distribution center and overhead they can handle far more stores. Once we refine our offerings and operations and evaluate the performance we will talk more on our long term growth plans. Recapping this past quarters performance for the company in total, our sales were 3 billion plus $50 million and increased to 4.5% on a comparable 16-week basis from last years fourth quarter. Domestic same store sales or sales for stores open more than one year were up 2.1% for the quarter. Gross margin for the quarter was 52.3% of sales, up 48 basis points. The improvement in gross margin was attributable to lower acquisition cost and lower shrink expense partially offset by higher supply chain costs associated with current year inventory initiatives. In regards to inflation, it has been basically non-existent year-over-year. This is different than in past years. At this point, our assumption is we\u2019ll experience subdued producer pricing, pet events of the calendar year and therefore we feel costs will be predictable and manageable. We will remain cognizant of future developments regarding inflation and we\u2019ll make the appropriate adjustments, should they arise. Looking forward, we continue to believe there remains opportunity for gross margin expansion within both the retail and commercial businesses; however, we do not manage to a targeted gross margin percentage. As the growth of our commercial business has been on a steady headwind on our overall gross margin rate for a few years, we have not specifically called out the headwind quarterly \u2013 it is part of our business model and we understand we have to manage that headwind as the business grows. Additionally, IMC will be a [side] track on gross margins as this business model operates at a lower gross margin rate. Our primary focus remains growing absolute gross profit dollars in our total Auto parts segment. SG&A for the quarter was 31.6% of sales, higher by 37 basis points from last year\u2019s fourth quarter. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of sales was primarily due to a combination of de-leverage from the 17th week of sales last year, higher incentive compensation and planned information system investments. IMC will also have a slight impact on SG&A dollars in the upcoming quarters while these expenses will cause slight de-leverage and we expect they will have lasting benefits to the overall organization. We continue to believe we are well positioned to manage our cost structure in response to our sales environment. EBIT for the quarter was $630 million, down 0.9% over last year\u2019s fourth quarter. Our EBIT margin improved to 20.7%. Excluding the extra week, our EBIT margin was up 22 basis points and our EBIT dollars grew by 5.7%. Interest expense for the quarter was $49.4 million compared with $57.4million on a comparable basis in Q4 a year ago. Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $4,344,000,000 or approximately $160 million more than last year\u2019s balance of $4,187 billion. Our adjusted debt level metric finished the quarter at 2.5 times EBITDAR. While in any given quarter we may increase or decrease our leverage metrics based on management\u2019s opinion regarding debt and equity market conditions, and we remain committed to both our investment-grade rating and our capital allocation strategy, and share repurchases are an important element of that strategy. For the quarter, our tax rate was approximately 35.7%, up from last year\u2019s fourth quarter. We expect our annual rate to be close to the 36.7% on an ongoing basis as the deviation result was primarily driven by the resolution of discrete tax items that arise. Net income for the quarter was $374 million excluding the extra week net income was up 7.4%. Our diluted share count of 33.1 million was down 7% from last year\u2019s fourth quarter. The combination of these factors drove earnings per share for the quarter to $11.28, up 15.6% over the prior year\u2019s fourth quarter on a comparable basis. Related to the cash flow statement for the fourth fiscal quarter, we generated $370 million of operating cash flow. Net fixed assets were up 8% versus last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $176 million and reflected the additional expenditures required to open 113 new stores this quarter. Capital expenditures on existing stores, hub store remodels, work on the development of new stores for upcoming quarters, and information technology investments. For all of fiscal 2014, our CapEx was approximately $440 million. With the new stores opened, we finished this past quarter with 4,984 stores in 49 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, 402 stores in Mexico, and five in Brazil for a total store count of 5,391. Depreciation totaled $79 million for the quarter versus last year\u2019s fourth quarter expense of $71 million inline with recent growth quarters. With our excess cash flow, we repurchased $188 million of AutoZone stock in the fourth quarter. This is lower than last year\u2019s buyback as the extra week last year and the EBITDA it generated provided additional leverage capacity. At year-end, we had $869 million remaining under our share buyback authorization and our leverage metric was 2.5 times. Again, I want to stress, we manage to appropriate credit ratings and not any one metric. The metric we report is meant as a guide only as each rating firm has its own criteria. We continue to view our share repurchase program as an attractive capital deployment strategy. Accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 115%. Next, I\u2019d like to update you on our inventory levels in total and on a per-store basis. We reported an inventory balance of $3.1 billion, up 10% versus Q4 ending balance last year. Increased inventory reflects new store growth along with additional investments and coverage. Inventory per store was up 5.8% to $582,000 per store, reflecting our continued investments in hard parts coverage. This first store amount was down from Q3 to $594,000 per store. Finally as Bill previously mentioned, our continued disciplined capital management approach resulted in return on invested capital for the trailing four quarters of 31.9%. We have and will continue to make investments that we believe will generate returns that significantly exceed our cost of capital. Now I\u2019ll turn it back to Bill Rhodes. Bill Rhodes : Thank you, Bill. We are pleased to report our 32nd consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth and for the year to report an EPS growth rate of 16.3% on a comparable 52-week basis. Our company has continued to be successful over the long run. That success is attributable to our approach of leveraging our unique and powerful culture and focusing on the needs of our customers. To execute at a high level, we have to consistently adhere to living the pledge. We cannot and will not take our eye off the execution. While we study the external environment and react where appropriate, we must stay committed to executing day-in and day-out on our game plans. Success will be achieved with an intention to detail and exceptional execution. Before I conclude, I want to take this opportunity to reflect on fiscal 2014. We were able to build on past accomplishments and delivered some impressive results in recognition of the dedication, passion and commitment of our AutoZoners. I want to highlight that in 2014 we grew sales in all of our businesses. With this growth, we were able to achieve and comfortably surpass the $9 billion annual sales milestone for the first time on a 52-week basis. As previously mentioned, we opened our 400 stores in Mexico. We reached a definitive agreement to acquire IMC. We believe IMC is the right business at the right time for us. The management team at IMC is exceptional and we can\u2019t wait to grow the business for many years to come. Our inventory availability testing and hub store remodels have been nothing short of incredible. We\u2019ve learned a tremendous amount and believe our findings will lead us to more productive models. We are talking more than ever about innovation as the industry leader, it is imperative that we stay ahead; making sure every aspect of our offering has improved from inventory assortments to our commercial offerings to leveraging the power of information technology enhancements. We can leave no stone unturned. We invested more in information systems infrastructure this past year than in recent memory, an investment that will pay dividends for years to come. At the end of the day, our customers have choices and we must innovate to ensure they turn to us for their vehicle needs. Again, we are excited about our initiatives around inventory assortment, hub stores, commercial growth, Mexico, ALLDATA, ecommerce, Brazil and now IMC. Our long-term model is to grow new store square footage at a low single-digit growth rate and we expect to continue growing our commercial business at an accelerated rate. Therefore, we look to routinely grow EBIT dollars in the mid single-digit range or better in terms of strengths. And we leverage our very strong and predictable cash flows to repurchase shares, enhancing our earnings per share into double digits. We feel the track we are on will allow us to continue wining for the long run. We believe our steady, consistent strategy is correct. It is the attention to details and consistent execution that will matter. Our belief is solid, consistent strategy combined with superior execution is a formula for success. Our charge remains to optimize our key -- our performance regardless of market condition and continue to ensure we are investing in the key initiatives that will drive our long-term performance. In the end, delivering strong EPS growth in ROIC each and ever quarter is how measure ourselves. We are pleased with our results this past year, but we much remain committed to delivering on our strategic and financial objectives. I can\u2019t wait to sit down and talk with our leadership team at our upcoming national sales meeting. This team is comprised of the best leaders in our industry. We are launching our \u2013 while every customer, everywhere [same] and I know our leaders combined with our talented team of more than 70,000 AutoZoners will do just that. Now we\u2019d like to open up the call for questions. Operator : (Operator Instructions) The first question is from Alan Rifkin with Barclays. Alan Rifkin - Barclays Capital : Thank you very much and congratulations on another nice year. Bill Rhodes : Thank you. Alan Rifkin - Barclays Capital : First question for Bill Rhodes, I mean, as you look longer term we suspect to IMC. How should we think of that company long-term as a proportion of your revenues and how will you integrate this at all in a little bit more detail with both your store base, as well as Auto Anything? Thank you. Bill Rhodes : Yes. Thank you, Alan. It\u2019s a great question. First of all, I want to update everybody that as on last Friday we received HSR clearance. And so, we are working towards closing the deal and hopefully can do it in the next week or so. So, at this point in time our integration efforts as you would expect as we\u2019re going to the regulatory approval process has been minimal. But we\u2019ll start working that diligently as we go forward. With respect to our growth plans, they currently have 17 branches and there are considerable opportunities for growth. You can look at the other key player in the industry and they have over 100 branches. So we look to rollout additional branches. Three of their branches are new this year and are off to a great start. So we\u2019re encouraged about the long term with them. Additionally, we think that they can be leverage particularly with our other stores AutoZone stores on both the retail and the commercial side. They have a product offering that we don\u2019t have today. So, we are very excited about them joining the family and hopefully that\u2019s going to happen in the next week or so. Alan Rifkin - Barclays Capital : Okay. Thank you. And one follow up if may for either of the Bills. Is there any structural reason why your less mature commercial stores which are doing 8500 a week cannot get to the level where some of your more mature units are doing which is over 10,000 a week? Bill Rhodes : Yeah. Let me clarify that. The 8500 was on average all of our stores, Alan. So, we got the more mature stores are averaging 10,000. The newer stores are even below the 8500 level. But we\u2019ve been very pleased that we continue to grow at a very rapid pace opening almost 800 new programs in the last two years that those new programs are continuing to perform at or above where they start, where the older program started. So, we believe we have a long-term opportunity for them to be very productive. We also believe the stores that are doing over 10,000 are nowhere near where they need to be. We had continued growth opportunities with them. Alan Rifkin - Barclays Capital : Okay. But just to clarify, Bill, so even though some of the units which you\u2019ve added most recently, you still that collectively over the longer term that can achieve revenue levels and profitability levels of some of your more mature ones? Bill Rhodes : Yes. Bill Giles : Yes. That\u2019s absolutely fair. Alan Rifkin - Barclays Capital : Thank you very much. Bill Rhodes : And hopefully beyond that, Alan. Alan Rifkin - Barclays Capital : Yeah. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from John Lawrence with Stephens. John Lawrence - Stephens: Good morning, guys. Bill Rhodes : Good morning. Bill Giles : Hi, John. John Lawrence - Stephens: Yeah. Bill, would you comment to follow on Alan\u2019s question just a little further. That gap of some of those clients or stores that where you don\u2019t have that merchandise or that line card available. Can you just give us a sense of some of those stores and what you have available for those that you don\u2019t have today and how big of any opportunity \u2013 how large of an opportunity is that? Bill Rhodes : The IMC product offering is vastly different than ours. It is a branded offering that is OE quality, OE manufactures that we don\u2019t necessarily have in our product offering today. There are certain customers think about the high-end BMW or Mercedes shops that want to use those products and use them pretty much exclusively. We don\u2019t do business with many of those shops today. However, we do have a lot of shops that are doing that kind of work and then in certain cases want those kinds of products. This will now allow us in our commercial program to sell those cases to our existing \u2013 those products to our existing customers as well. John Lawrence - Stephens: Great. Thanks. And just a follow-up for Bill Giles. On the G&A as far as technology investments and incentive comp should those stay about the same level going forward? Bill Giles : Let\u2019s say that obviously from a management team perspective, we hope the incentive comp continues to go up. But I would say that from an IT perspective, we will continue to expect to have some investments in IT over the next fiscal year or so. As Bill highlighted earlier, the several things that we\u2019ve done from a store system structure perspective in order to enhance the information that we\u2019ll provide in our AutoZoners which is ultimately providing to our customers. So we think there\u2019s some real opportunity for that, as well as tying all of our customer information together, so we have a better visibility on the activities of our customers. John Lawrence - Stephens: Thanks. Good luck and congrats. Bill Rhodes : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Dan Wewer with Raymond James. Dan Wewer - Raymond James : Thanks. Bill, we\u2019ve had five consecutive quarters that inventory per square foot is grown between call it 4.5% to 8.5%. I would have thought by now that these initiatives would have had enough time to get some traction and generate better sales productivity. It sounds like you\u2019re continuing to refine the test particularly regarding distribution frequency. Just curious as to why you think that the payoff hasn\u2019t materialized by now and what kind of timeframe would you advice investors to take with a payback? Bill Giles : Yeah. It\u2019s a good question, Dan and I think that\u2019s you\u2019re looking at the right way. I mean, we recognize the importance of hard parts coverage. And every time we add inventory we recognize that it benefits both the commercial side of business as well as the DIY side of the business. You know, and keep in mind to, we\u2019re fortunate to be operating in an industry where there\u2019s very low [ops] to lessen inventory and there\u2019s very low financing cost at the moment. So, we think that this is a very good risk reward strategy that we\u2019re taking and it\u2019s an important one for us to continue to gain market share with our customers. And then other leg of the stool is really the delivery of frequency. So, we\u2019ve added more inventory particularly at the store level. And then, we\u2019re also testing our optimization of the frequency of delivery and the method of delivery to both our satellite stores as well as ultimately to our customers. And so, there\u2019s more work to be done on there. I think that the test would show that we\u2019ve gotten some good returns on the investments that we\u2019ve made. They\u2019ve been broad-based in some cases, but frankly not although across the chain. Many of the tests that we\u2019re doing are very isolated. And in those cases we\u2019re very encouraged with the results that we have. There\u2019s more learning to be done. There\u2019s more work to be done. But we think that adding inventory like I said before is a very good from a risk reward perspective. We don\u2019t see a lot of exposure, but again, it\u2019s not fast and its not technology based. So we think it\u2019s a good way to continue to capture market share. And then, we got to continue to work with the delivery frequency to optimize our overall supply chain. Dan Wewer - Raymond James : Just to clarify is there is bottleneck so we\u2019ve added this -- we\u2019ve added inventory either at a distribution center or at a hub, but there\u2019s a bottleneck that\u2019s preventing it from getting to the store and effectively sold to your commercial customer? Bill Giles : I think one thing to think about and we\u2019ve always talked about this is that 70% of the SKUs that we carry one on hand, and so there\u2019s an incredible randomness on the lot of sales of service inventory. So your ability to predict and to stay in stock is what\u2019s really become challenging. So I wouldn\u2019t consider it a bottleneck per say. I think we got distribution center, we\u2019ve got hub stores and we\u2019ve got our individual stores. And it\u2019s really where we have the inventory versus safety and then the frequency of delivery and those of the things that we\u2019re working on right now. Dan Wewer - Raymond James : And just a follow-up question. You noted that the year-over-year comparisons become a lot more difficult in your second quarter of fiscal year \u201915, but at the same time we do have some weaker markets that could recover. I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re talking about the West Coast given the drought conditions out there or can you expect it will continue next year. What makes you confident that those lagging markets would recovery this coming year? Bill Rhodes : Well, obviously we can\u2019t predict the future. But we did have a lot of strength in the second quarter particularly in the Northeast and the Midwest. I would also say, it wasn\u2019t just the geography issue. In the second quarter of last year we performed particularly well on the failure-related categories, but even at the time we spoke to the fact that the maintenance-related categories, think about all the under car things that could be differed had saw significant decreases. So, yeah, we have a strong quarter. We had strength in certain categories, in certain geographies at the same time. The West was weaker in certain categories or weaker. Dan Wewer - Raymond James : Okay. Thank you. Bill Rhodes : All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Seth Basham - Wedbush Securities : Good morning. Bill Giles : Good morning. Seth Basham - Wedbush Securities : The first question I had is just regarding some of your distribution plans. It seem to me you\u2019re talking little bit more about testing more overnight, more frequent deliveries from the DCs to stores rather than focusing on utilization of the hub. Is that correct? And can you give us some more information on your thinking there? Bill Rhodes : Yes. That is correct. We have several different tests that are going on. Let me go back and remind you. We talked about something we called optimal hurdle which was refining the store SKU placement across the entire store network. We finish that testing last summer and it rolled that out. We\u2019ve been very pleased with the results of that today. A couple of the other key tests are would \u2013 an increase in delivery frequency from our distribution centers to our stores, the productive use and we\u2019ve been testing that for about eight or nine months now and so far we\u2019re pretty pleased with the results. Now we\u2019re taking it the next level and saying, okay, let\u2019s vary the delivery frequency instead of five days a week what happens at two days a week, what happens at three days a week, so that we can find the optimal approach. We\u2019re also testing something which is an expanded SKU coverage even beyond our hub stores in a select number of we call mega hub stores and those mega hubs are also servicing the other hubs stores in the area further extending our same day local market availability. So, we\u2019re still very much in test phase. We hope to be bringing some of these tests to conclusion over the next several months and then once we make those decisions, we will be communicating with you. Seth Basham - Wedbush Securities : Great. That\u2019s helpful. And just thinking about some of the mature programs, you talked about the growth in these commercial programs, still improving but at a slower rate. What do you think is driving that slowdown especially given the fact that you\u2019re having lot of inventory and what not? Is the cannibalization going on or is it more market dynamics, how do we think about that? Bill Rhodes : Yeah. I think a big part of it is the cannibalization. As we\u2019ve open these new programs, remember several years ago we have 51% of our stores that were on the commercial program. We\u2019re now at 77%. When we open a program in an existing market, we take the customers that are closer to the new program. We move into that program. So, there\u2019s a fairly significantly amount of cannibalization that\u2019s in there and that\u2019s impacting those growth rate. But overall, we want to make it clear to you all. We\u2019re making progress and have been over the last five years and are pleased with it, never going as fast as you want to. Seth Basham - Wedbush Securities : Great. Thanks guys. Good luck. Bill Rhodes : All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Simeon Gutman - Morgan Stanley : Thanks. First on, what you mentioned on the prepared remarks that August was better but inconsistent. Can you touch on September as appropriate? And then looking at August, its maybe just the past few months whether it weather mix of business or some secular trends? Can you help sort of push that out and if there are markets that haven\u2019t had any weather noise, can you tell us where the underlying run rate is? Bill Rhodes : Yeah. As far as August is concern, let me just this, every period for us in the quarter had a positive same-store sales growth. August was certainly better than July which was our weakness point. In September, we have a policy of really not talking about what\u2019s going on in the current quarter because we release our earnings so early in the quarter. We\u2019re just barely three weeks in and so we don\u2019t think it\u2019s prudent for us to share what\u2019s going on in September so far. As far as what was driving the trajectory, you could very easily see it in the weather and the weather-related categories. So, things like A/C chemicals, A/C and heating, cooling systems, all of those categories were weak for the entire quarter and particularly weak in July and in certain select weeks in August. So, to us it was very much. When the weather cooperated our sales were strong. When it didn\u2019t they didn\u2019t. Simeon Gutman - Morgan Stanley : Okay. And then second about next year, we\u2019re mentioning those stuff compares. Can you talk about the comp that\u2019s required to lever the expense line. I think the business right now is doing great on the gross margin. So that\u2019s helping the gross profit dollars. So the composition had all change as the SG&A flex a little bit, I mean, what\u2019s the right level for next year? Bill Giles : Yeah. It\u2019s a good question. And you know, its one that I think varies a little bit, I mean, the reality of it is if you look over time, we\u2019re going to adjust our expense structure based on the sales environment that we\u2019re operating in. So, we\u2019re ultimately focused on growing EBIT dollars, and so, we\u2019ll have some opportunities in gross margin. We may make some investment in SG&A, but we\u2019ll manage those over the long-term based on the sales environment that we operate on. So it\u2019s hard to give you a static number per say, because at times we leverage on very low comps and times we deleverage on higher comps. And so, we\u2019ll just continue to look at the strategies that we have in place and the investments that we think we\u2019ll help us out on a long-term basis and will adjust based on the sales environment we plan. Simeon Gutman - Morgan Stanley : Okay. The lower acquisition costs that were cited this quarter is that normal course of business or did something else change that triggered your ability to lower the COGs? Bill Giles : I would say that that\u2019s probably more normal course of business. I think better work with the merchandizing organization and lower some of the acquisition cost either through sourcing. There\u2019s probably some deflation in certain categories and that\u2019s probably what\u2019s drove it mostly. Simeon Gutman - Morgan Stanley : Okay. Thanks and good luck. Bill Rhodes : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Michael Lasser with UBS. Michael Lasser - UBS: Good morning, guys. Thanks a lot for taking my question. I was hoping you could benchmark where you think you\u2019re parts availability and your delivery frequency capabilities are relative to your peers? We know that you\u2019ve made good strives in the last several quarters, but I think the challenges we don\u2019t know really order of magnitude where you are today versus where you were and what you\u2019re trying to get to? Bill Rhodes : Yeah. On the delivery frequency, we\u2019ve had a long strategy of -- we deliver the vast majority of our stores once a week. We have competitors that are out there that deliver their stores on a daily basis. We are in the process of testing delivery frequency. And I want to emphasize the word \u201ctest\u201d. We\u2019re talking about a few hundreds stores that are on this delivery frequency test. So what\u2019s going on in those stores is not shown up in our overall numbers in any material way. We\u2019re going to go up and see what increase delivery frequency means as I mentioned earlier we\u2019ve been please with what we\u2019ve seen so far. And no surprise, as we get inventory closer and as Bill mentioned 70% of our SKUs have one piece on the shelf normally its in our current \u2013 we sell that piece. We\u2019re out of it for up to eight days. This allows us to put it back on the shelf within 24 hours. So we\u2019re encouraged, but we haven\u2019t made any final decisions yet. Michael Lasser - UBS: Okay. And in those stores where you have increased frequency, what has been the profitability impact, presumably it\u2019s not more expensive to do that? Bill Rhodes : Yes. It is more expensive and we\u2019ve got four or five different test in different markets throughout now and they have mixed results. The longest running test is showing that it\u2019s EBIT positive and then it\u2019s generating a 15% IRR or better. So, that\u2019s the threshold that we\u2019re going hold any investment too. What we\u2019re trying to be careful of is these will be some decisions that have long-term ramifications. And so we are wanting to make sure that we prudently test them and we validate our test results. And then determine as what\u2019s the right number. Whether it should be twice a week or five times a week, we don\u2019t know that answer yet. Michael Lasser - UBS: Okay. And just to tie all those things together. If you were to get to daily replenishment or multi-week, multi time per week replenishment would you have necessarily sacrifice your profitability rate in order to do that? Bill Giles : I wouldn\u2019t say, well I cannot sacrifice our EBIT growth rate per se. But at the end of the day this is about driving EBIT dollars and driving unacceptable IRR which is up 15% for us. So that\u2019s kind of the way we think about it. That\u2019s the way we focus on. It\u2019s going to generate more profit dollars. Are we going to get an adequate return on the investment that we make? And that\u2019s kind of how we look at it. So we\u2019re not getting hung up on absolute margin rate per se. Michael Lasser - UBS: Okay. Thank you very much. Bill Rhodes : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Aram Rubinson with Wolfe Research. Aram Rubinson - Wolfe Research : Hi, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I understand that some of the commercial businesses is kind of cannibalizing from your mature stores, but you\u2019re still at 18% of your mix is commercial, I\u2019m not sure where they have a particular goal of where they would like to be but it seems from just reading and studying the industry it seems like that wants to go a lot higher. So my question is, is there\u2019s a reason that you can think of why we\u2019re cannibalizing from ourselves rather than taking business from others is seems to be growing there kind of constant at commercial program? And do you get a sense that we\u2019re all kind of just piling into the same strategy at the same time and maybe that\u2019s making it more difficult competitively? Bill Rhodes : Yes. I would say the cannibalization is just a natural effect. If we open a store that is closer to a customer than the existing store that servicing, its just makes all the sense in the world for us to move that customer over to the new store so we can service him better, delivery times will be shorter and so on and so forth. So I think it\u2019s not that that\u2019s the only way we can do, that\u2019s just the natural course of business. Yes, we only have 18% of our sales \u2013 I think that\u2019s up from 16 last year. It\u2019s no where near where we want it to be. We believe that we have a long term opportunities continue to commercial in aggressive way. We have not set any specific number, because we don\u2019t want to maximize or put a threshold on where we\u2019re going. We want to be as big in both businesses as we can be. As far as the piece of that growing in this business. I think it just takes time. We\u2019ve been in this business the shortest amount of time. We\u2019ve really had a successful growth rate over the last six or seven years and we are very confident track that we\u2019re on and with the strategies that we have. Aram Rubinson - Wolfe Research : Thanks. And on the DIY side, can you tell us a little bit about your market share whether you feel like you\u2019re growing that market share or is that kind of stagnating or slipping. And then also where does ecommerce fit it into that market share equation on the DIY side, is that beginning to make any material inroads? Thank you. Bill Giles : I think on the ecommerce side, when we look at the industry broad-based, we think that there is some opportunity for online sales, although it is in the significant penetration like it is in other industries. We recognize that a lot of people are coming for information relative it\u2019s to be a content of the product or repair information etcetera. So we think that\u2019s an integrated approach overall and that\u2019s how we\u2019re approaching it. From a market share perspective I think we\u2019re holding our own. And so our growth seems to be close what the overall industry is growing at, at the same time we\u2019re growing square footage growth rate at about 3%. So overall I think we\u2019re holding our own from a market share perspective. Aram Rubinson - Wolfe Research : Thanks, guys. Bill Rhodes : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs : Thank you so much and good morning. My first question relates to the IMC acquisition. If you could shed a little bit of light on the economics of the business revenue per store compared for (inaudible) store and the roll of online in that business and then also just give us a sense to the pace and the impact of the perspective rollout of their catalog to AutoZone stores? Bill Giles : I\u2019m seeing overall revenue is around $10 million per location, is about what they average overall. And so as far as what the overall impact would be on us on an ongoing basis as Bill mentioned before and so trying to get through the close and get our implementation ran, integrated and started we\u2019ll be able to give you a little bit more color. I think in terms of getting even to the catalog obviously we would expect that to transpire in fiscal \u201815. So expect that to happen some time in the fiscal year I will give you better idea of that in the next conference call. But overall its good productivity, it\u2019s a great compliment from an inventory perspective and certainly from a customer perspective and it\u2019s a great management team. So we think that was a combination of things, so I hope the integration go even quicker. Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs : And Bill if you think about the role of ecommerce and your model compared to what you see for the core AutoZone stores as you discussed to the last question. Is it similar or greater, would you say vis-\u00e0-vis your core business today? Bill Giles : I would say it\u2019s probably a little bit greater. I think that there\u2019s an opportunity from an online ordering perspective with the commercial customers out. I think there\u2019s probably a broader base from an ecommerce perspective for their product as well. So I think that that product probably has even more opportunities online. Matthew Fassler \u2013 Goldman Sachs : And then my second question relates to the pace of the buyback. In recent years, your buyback in the final quarter of the fiscal year has been the largest of the year, I guess some part till the length of the quarter and there might be other reasons associated with seasonality and as such this year that was not the case. How should we think about the way you managed the buyback in the quarter this year and will it tell us if there\u2019s anything about the pace of buyback going forward? Bill Rhodes : Yes, that\u2019s a good question. We purchased about $1.1 billion I think we just borrowed $1.3 billion last year as we mentioned the extra week, as the quarter of last year certainly helped a little bit last year so that\u2019s some of the differential. If you think about it, we brought back about $1 billion over the past six years and so we think that that\u2019s a cash flow number that we can maintain going forward if not better. And we\u2019re also consciously trying to spread it out over the year as well and not make it as chunky as it has been. So those were some of the factors that go into that, but I wouldn\u2019t think about the fourth quarter as being light in terms of being a trend, I would look at it as 1.1 versus 1.3 and the 1.3 reduced a little bit with the extra week last year. Matthew Fassler \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Got it. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes the question and answer session. I\u2019d like to turn it back to Mr. Rhodes for closing comments. William C. Rhodes:  Great, thank you. Before we conclude the call, I\u2019d just like to take a moment to reiterate that our business model continues to be solid. We are excited about our growth prospects for the year. We will not take anything for granted as we understand our customers have alternatives. We have a solid plan to succeed this fiscal year but I want to stress that this is a marathon and not a sprint. As we continue to focus on the basics and focus on optimizing long term share holder value, we are confident AutoZone will continue to be very successful. We thank you for participating in today\u2019s call. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you for joining. You may disconnect at this time.",

Bill Rhodes : Good morning and thank you for joining us today for AutoZone\u2019s 2015 First Quarter Conference Call. With me today are Bill Giles, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, IT and ALLDATA, and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax. Regarding the first quarter, I hope you\u2019ve had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter\u2019s results. If not, the press release along with slides complementing our comments today is available on our website, www.autozoneinc.com. Please click on Quarterly Earnings Conference Calls to see them. To begin this morning, I want to thank all AutoZoners across the globe for another solid quarter and a very good start to the new fiscal year. We remained focused this past quarter on several key initiatives and on growing our business on a variety of fronts.  I thought I'd begin this morning recapping the various aspects of our business as it has become more complex in recent years. We have diversified our portfolio with the emphasis on building additional legs of growth. First, we have our retail domestic business which generates approximately 70% of our revenue. This business performed quite well on Q1 and we continue to see opportunities for future growth in store count and same-store sales. Secondly, we have our commercial domestic business which has been growing sales by double digits for five years and continues to be a tremendous growth opportunity. We also have international retail and commercial businesses in Mexico and Brazil. We've been doing business in Mexico since late 1998 and our model has proven to work quite well. In Brazil, we are still in test phase but our sales had continued to grow nicely. We also have an growing internet business supported by both AutoZone.com and AutoAnything and we have our all data business which is the leading diagnostic and repair business in the United States. We have expanded that business to both Canada and Europe in recent years. And finally we recently acquired IMC which focuses on the import parts business and provides us with a new growth opportunity in new avenues to invite AutoZone customers who often expanded product assortment. This past quarter, our U.S. retail business expanded with the opening of 22 new stores. We also opened 61 net new commercial programs our commercial business continue to gain traction growing sales 13% for the quarter. We now have commercial programs in 78% of our domestic stores having opened 816 new programs in just the past two years and we have opened four new stores in Mexico during the quarter. In Brazil, we continue to operate five stores and expect to open a couple of new ones over the next few months.  We currently have approximately 8% of our total stores outside of the United States. We believe we have growth opportunity in the U.S. and outside the U.S for many years to come. In the first quarter, our sales accelerated on a same store basis compared to last quarter. We reported a same stores sales increase of 4.5% up from 2.1% in Q4 of last year. We were pleased to see we gained traction in sales categories where we\u2019ve added merchandize and our commercial business benefited from both the inventory additions and a diligent focus on growing sales in our older programs with particular emphasis on mature customers. We were pleased with our sales performance throughout the quarter but our DIY business was particularly strong in the last two weeks when much of the country experienced the first significant cold weather spell. Our results were also generally consistent across all regions of the countries while the weather experience at the end of the quarter accelerated our growth even further, our sales throughout the quarter were noticeably improved from Q4 in virtually every week. Our beliefs is at the reduce gas prices are giving our customers additional disposable income and helping drive our sales.  Additionally and more importantly, we believe the work we\u2019ve been doing over the last year of inventory availability is also contributing to improve sales performance. Over the last year, we have implemented our new algorithms for inventory assortments and those products have been in our stores now for over 6 months. These are generally slower moving products but as our customers experience the improved debt of our inventory these products are continuing to gaining traction. Overall we were quite pleased with our sales performance in Q1.  Our inventory per store increased over our Q4 2014 levels the primary driver of this increase was the inventory added through the acquisition of IMC. The IMC stores carry on average eight to ten times the inventory per location are basic AutoZone stores do. While we are more aggressive with our inventory additions this past year, we feel future investments will be more targeted and refined. Additionally, when we implemented our new assortment methodology last year we made a decision to only execute half of the deletes of underproductive merchandize in order to mitigate the potential risk of such a significant change. We are in the process of executing the additional deletions over the next few quarters. Overall, we believe our growth in inventory per store will continue but at a low modest pace than last year. We will continue to assess and analyze our changes and we will continue to refine our methodologies overtime. But the majority of this initiative will be completed once the additional deletions are removed. Secondly, as we mentioned during the last several quarterly calls, we have been testing different delivery frequencies from our distribution centers. Our ongoing tests have shown us that increased delivery frequency increases sales and improves inventory productivity while reducing safety stock. The important takeaway here is we continue to expand these tests and have added more stores to these test. As we\u2019ve been testing for about a year, our results to date have been encouraging and we plan to further expand the test in Q3. Once we have confirmed our bindings we will develop a long term plan and explain our strategy and its ramifications to you. We would expect to do this in the next couple of quarters. Ultimately, assuming our findings are confirmed we would expect to increase the delivery frequency to most of our stores and we would expect to add two to three additional distribution centers to do this cost effectively and on a timely basis.  Additionally, we\u2019ve been testing what we call mega hubs, mega hubs have substantially increased product assortment and they leverage those increased product assortments across other hub network providing stores across large geography access to this expanded assortment.  We have been testing two mega hubs for about a year. Both of them have been performing well and we will be opening three additional mega hubs over the course of this fiscal year. This too is still in test phase but we are pleased with the performance to date. All of our inventory availability initiatives are designed to significantly increase our ability to meet our customer\u2019s needs. In this business, the inventory availability is a must and we believe once this work is completed we will materially improve our ability to fulfill our customers request. As our commercial business has grown, our need for expanded assortments has grown even more. Again, we are continuing to test and we are expanding our test to validate our findings to date. We will keep you abreast with these developments. This has been important and difficult work and I would like to thank everyone in the organization who has been involved with this initiative for their excellent work today.  Last quarter, we held our national sales meeting here in Memphis. This year's operating plan theme, wow, every customer, everywhere was very well received. The customers are simply focused on everything we do or like we say at AutoZone, AutoZoners always put customers first.  We've always been focused on service but this annual operating theme adds intensity and renewed focus. We've made significant systems investments and enhancements this past year in order to capture more data about our customer shopping patterns across all of our platforms.  We understand we have to be able to toggle between the store, the shop the phone and online experience in order to meet our customer\u2019s needs. At the national sales meeting, my favorite event every year is our recognition luncheon hosting our award winning store managers, or as we call them our President's Club, it's an opportunity for our officers to meet and answer questions from our best and brightest store AutoZoners. This year was certainly no exception. These store award winners deserve our gratitude for their efforts each and every day. Now I will take a moment to discuss our recently completed acquisition of Interamerican Motor Corporation doing business in the marketplace as IMC. They are the second largest distributor of OE quality import replacement parts in the United States. They specialize in parts coverage for European and Asian vehicles. While considerably smaller than the number one participant in the industry, IMC with 17 branches today offers a terrific growth opportunity for us.  Not just because of the parts coverage, but also because of a very strong management team. They are an exceptional team. We closed on the acquisition in September and we have been fast at work on getting our integration plan in place. While it's very premature, I will mention our plans include opening more IMC branches in incorporating their parts catalog into our AutoZone's Z-Net parts catalog. We will continue go-to-market as IMC and expect to open a handful of new IMC branches over the next 12 months. We also expect to have their catalog available in our stores by early spring 2015. I do want to point out; there was very little customer overlap with our commercial customer base.  Now let me stress the IMC brand is very important to us and we will grow that brand and its presence in the future in the many more markets than what it is in today. IMC has been in a growth mode recently and has built an infrastructure to support a substantially larger footprint. Therefore it currently doesn't enjoy the operating margins that we experienced, so it will lower our overall EBIT margins by approximately 40 basis points on an annual basis. We are very excited to have IMC as part of our organization and very optimistic about our future together. Now let's turn to our first quarter results. Our sales increased 8% and our domestic same-store sales were up 4.5%. As mentioned previously, our sales improved significantly from Q4 and each month both retail and commercial experienced positive same-store sales growth. That consistency was across all regions of the country. We believe we benefitted from both macro tailwinds, our work on inventory availability and solid execution. While our value related and maintenance merchandise categories performed well. We were especially happy to see the growth in our maintenance category. Regarding traffic versus tickets in DIY business, traffic was negative while ticket was positive. While only slightly negative traffic improved in the quarter well along and was nicely positive at the end. Our average ticket improved significantly and has returned to more normalized levels after about a year of subdued growth. The hard parts of this since we've added to our stores have held ticket growth.  Over the last two decades, our traffic count has been challenged. The primary driver of this challenge is the improvements in the product quality which has led to fewer failures or longer maintenance intervals but those improvements have come from technological advancements and those enhancements have significantly increased the price of the products we sale. We have been managing through these phenomena as mentioned for over two decades and expect to continue to do so quite well.  We are having 61 new commercial programs in the quarter versus 125 programs in the comparable period last year. We have a commercial program in 78% of our domestic store base. Our commercial sales excluding items were up 13% this quarter. Lastly, I always like to recognize how effective our team delivers consistent earning in good sales environment and not so good. And that practice has allowed us to deliver an impressive 33 consecutive quarters of double-digit EPS growth. That consistency allows us to be both shareholder friendly with solid earnings growth and bondholder friendly through a targeted investment grade rating and strong cash flow. We continue to manage this business for both short term and long term optimum performance. As part of our strategy to increasing inventory levels in local markets closer to our customers this past quarter we opened five additional hub locations. Overtime, we do expect to open more hub locations and we believe our strategy on inventory deployment at the store level allows us to keep the number of openings at a moderate level. Regarding Mexico we opened four stores this quarter. Sales in our other businesses for the quarter were up 6.4% over the last year\u2019s first quarter. As a reminder our all data in e-commerce which includes autozone.com and autoanything make the segment of sales. Regarding online sales opportunities there continued to be great opportunities for growth on both business-to-business and to individual customers who are beginning to see. While these businesses are small for us we expect them to grow at a faster rate in our brick and mortar business for the foreseeable future. With the continued ageing of the car population, we continue to be optimistic regarding trends for our industry in both the DIY and DIFM. While new car sales have been very strong these past two years, we have seen those traded in vehicles to be resold to new owners who are repairing or enhancing their new vehicles. With gas prices on average down materially year-over-year for the first quarter, we are beginning to see miles driven increase. Decline in prices at the pump have benefited our customers especially those most financially strapped. The lower end consumer benefits the most from lower gas prices relative to income; this trend is encouraging but only one of several factors that impact sales. I know many of this has asked about our sales expectations for the second and third quarters. The comparisons are considerably more difficult. Our certain markets and categories outperformed during last winter, others underperformed. We believe we should improve in those regions in our maintenance categories shift the weather patterns be considerably different.  As our history has shown we managed this business focusing on both the short and long term performance. As we entered the second quarter we are keenly focused on delivering consistent strong performance and extending our streak of 33 consecutive quarters of double-digit EPS growth.  Our operating theme for 2015 is wow, every customer everywhere and our key -- for the year are, one, great people providing great service; two, profitably growing our commercial business; three, leveraging the Internet; four, leveraging technology to improve the customer experience while optimizing efficiencies and five, improving inventory availability. On the retail front last quarter under the great people providing great service theme, we continued with our intense focus on improving execution. Along with the improvements to our catalog assortment we\u2019re incorporating more training tools to help our store AutoZoners provide trustworthy advice.  Training will continue to be a larger effort for us at the store level. Behind the scenes, we have reset our expectations on technology investment and challenge ourselves to make sure our offerings are relevant across all shopping platforms. We realize that customers have become much more tech and mobile savvy we have to have a sales proposition that touches all the way as they desire to interact with us. Our current and future technology investments will lead to sales growth across all of our businesses. In regards to commercial, we opened 61 programs during the quarter. Our expectation is we will continue to open new programs and grow our percentage of stores with commercial programs although our pace of growth will likely moderate. We expect to open approximately 300 programs this year versus 424 last year. As we continue to improve our product assortment and availability and as we make other refinements to our offerings, we expect that the sales potential will continue to increase. Our results continued to provide us confidence to be aggressive in adding additional resources and new programs to this important growth initiative, which also highlight another strong performance in return on invested capital as we were able to finish Q1 at 31.7%.  We are very pleased with this metric as it is one of the best if not the best in all of hard lines retail. However, our primary focus has been and continues to be that we ensure every incremental dollar of capital that we deployed in this business provides an acceptable return well in excess of cost to capital. It is important to reinforce that we will always maintain our diligence regarding capital stewardship as the capital we invest is our investors\u2019 capital. Before I pass the discussion over to Bill Giles to talk about our financial results, I\u2019d like to recognize our entire organization for their efforts to manage the business appropriately and prudently. We have an amazing team and our initiatives for 2015 are exciting. With our ongoing supply chain initiatives as well as the inclusion in upcoming expansion IMC, we are ready to continue to provide wide customer service to all our customers and we are ready to continue to prudently manage our cost structure providing our shareholders with a consistency we have exhibited. Now here is Bill. Bill Rhodes :  Thanks Bill. Good morning everyone to start this morning let me take a few moments to discuss our retail, commercial and international results for the quarter. During the quarter total auto parts sales which include our domestic retail, IMC and commercial businesses, our Mexico stores and our five stores in Brazil, increased 8%. Regarding the macro trends during the quarter, nationally unleaded gas prices started out at $3.46 a gallon and ended the quarter at $2.82 a gallon, a $0.64 decrease. Last year, gas prices decreased $0.31 per gallon during the first quarter, starting at $3.60 and ending at $3.29 a gallon. We continue to believe gas prices have a real impact on our customers\u2019 abilities to maintain their vehicles and as cost reductions help all Americans, we hope to benefit from an increase in disposable income. We also recognize that the impact of miles driven on cars over 10 years old, the current average, is much different than on newer cars in terms of wear and tear. Miles driven increased 2.3% in September I don\u2019t have October, November data yet. The other statistic we highlight is the number of seven-year and older vehicles on the road, which continues to trend in our industry\u2019s favored. For the trailing four quarters, total sales per auto parts locations was $1,746,000. This statistic continues to set the pace for the rest of the industry. For the quarter, commercial sales increased 13% commercial represented 17% of our total sales and grew $45 million over last the year of Q1. Last year\u2019s commercial sales mix percent was also 17%. This past quarter, we opened a 61 new programs versus 125 programs opened in our first quarter of last fiscal year. We now have our commercial program in 3,906 stores supported by 171 hub stores. Approximately 1,200 of our programs are three years old or younger. Let me take a moment and discuss our commercial program performance. As I mentioned our commercial sales were up 13% this past quarter, a nice acceleration versus last quarter while our average sales per program is below some peers in our industry at $8500. We feel we are on the right track and methodically close that gap. It\u2019s important to highlight that we accelerated our new program growth over the past few years as approximately 30% of our programs are younger than three years old. These openings have impacted our average sales metric and cannibalized some of our older programs. However, our focus is on growing market share and improving our service levels by having more programs closer to our customers. This year we are increasingly focused on measuring and growing sales in our older programs and the specific emphasis on our long-term customer growth.  Looking specifically at our matured programs, those at least five years old, they grew in a high single digit range this past quarter. Additionally, we still have significant opportunity to open additional programs over the next several years. We feel good about the successes we have had and probably growing the commercial business. In summary, we remain committed to our long-term growth strategy. We believe the improvements we have made in upcoming additional improvements from our inventory availability initiatives enhance our prospects and we believe the addition of IMC will provide us with additional avenues to service our commercial customers very effectively. We believe we are well positioned to grow this business and capture increased market share.  Our Mexico stores continue to perform well. We opened 4 new stores during the first quarter and we currently have 406 stores in Mexico. We expect to open a similar of stores in Mexico this fiscal year that we open last year. Our returns and profit growth continue to be in line with our expectations. Now regarding Brazil, we are currently operating five stores we didn\u2019t open any stores this quarter our plans remains open a few more stores and then refine our offerings improves our accounts of more for our customers and is financially viable. Our sales growth has been very encouraging and on plan. We continue to operate a considerable loss this is due to expected to having such a small store base and carrying distribution capabilities and overhead that can handle far more stores. Once we refinance our offerings in operations and value at the performance we will provide you with an update on our long-term growth plans. Recapping this past quarters performance for the company in total our sales were $2,260 million and increase of 8% domestic same stores sales or sales were stores are for more than year were up 4.5% for the quarter. Gross margin for the quarter was 52.1% of sales up 20 basis points. The improvement in gross margin was attributable to higher merchandize margins and lower strength expense. Partially offset by the impact on margin from the IMC acquisition. And regards to inflation is been basically non-existing for couple of years now of certain categories have had some price increases in general. We have slightly more decreases at this point our assumption is we experience of produce for pricing heading into the new calendar year and therefore we feel cautiously predictable and manageable. We will remain confident in the future development regarding inflation and we\u2019ll make the appropriate judgment should they arrive.  Looking forward, we continue to believe the remains opportunity for gross margin expansion within both retail and commercial businesses, however, we do not manage through a target growth margin percentage, as the growth of our commercial business has been a steady headwind and our overall gross margins rate for few years was not bother to call out the headwind quarterly and it is part of our operating model.  Additionally, until the anniversary of the acquisition, IMC will present a headwind on a gross margin of approximately 30 basis points over the next three quarters as this business model operates to lower gross margin rates. Our primary focus remains growing absolute gross profit dollars in our total auto part segment. SG&A for the quarter was 33.8% of sales higher by 45 basis points from last year's first quarter. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of sales was primarily due to higher legal cost and self-insured medical cost. Now IMC will also have approximately 10 basis points of deleverage on SG&A in the upcoming quarters. We continue to believe we are well positioned to manage our cost structure in response to our sales environment. EBIT for the quarter was $409 million, up 6.5% over last year's first quarter. Our EBIT margin was down 25 basis points at 18.1%. Interest expense for the quarter was $37.1 million compared with $42.4 million in Q1 a year ago. Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $4.422 billion or approximately $250 million more than last year's balance of $4.174 billion. Our adjusted debt-level metric finished the quarter at 2.5 times EBITDAR. While in any given quarter, we may increase or decrease or leverage metrics based on management's opinion debt regarding debt and equity market conditions, we remain committed to both our investment grade ratings and our capital allocation strategy and share repurchases are an important element of our strategy. For the quarter, our tax rate was approximately 35.9%, down slightly from last year's first quarter. We expect our annual rate to be closer to 36.7% on an ongoing basis as the deviation in results this quarter was primarily driven by the resolution of discrete tax items that arose. Net income for the quarter was $238 million, up 9.3%. Our diluted share count of 32.8 million was down 5.5% from last year's first quarter. The combination of these factors drove earnings per share for the quarter to $7.27, up 15.6% over the prior year's first quarter. Relating to the cash flow statements in the first fiscal quarter, we generated $375 million of operating cash flow. Net fixed assets were up 8% versus last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $92 million and reflected the additional expenditures required to open 27 new stores this quarter, capital expenditures on existing stores, hub store remodels, work on development on new stores for upcoming quarters and information technology investments.  With the new stores opened, we finished this past quarter with 5,006 stores in 49 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. 406 stores in Mexico, 17 IMC locations and 5 stores in Brazil for a total count of 5,434. Depreciation totaled $61 million for the quarter versus last year's first quarter expense of $56 million; this is in line with recent quarter growth rates. With our excess cash flow, we repurchased $300 million of AutoZone stock in the first quarter. At the end of the quarter, we had $517 million remaining under our share buyback optimization and our leverage metric was 2.5 times. Again, I want to stress we manage through appropriate credit ratings and not any one metric. The metric we report is meant to guide only of each rating firm has its own criteria. We continue to do view our share repurchase program as an attractive capital deployment strategy. Accounts payable as a percentage of growth inventory finished the quarter at a 112.5% and includes of IMC reduced AP ratio of approximately 150 basis points.  Next I would like to update you on our inventory levels in total and on a per store basis; we reported an inventory balance of $3.3 billion of 11% versus the Q1 ending balance last year. Increased inventory reflects the recent IMC acquisition, new store growth and additional investments and coverage. Inventory per store was up 6.7% at $604,000 per store, reflecting our continued investments and hard parts coverage and the IMC acquisition. The increase in inventory per store this quarter from last quarter was predominantly IMC driven which added just over $10,000 per store to this metric. Excluding IMC, inventory was up 9% over the last year Q1.  Finally, as Bill previously mentioned, our continued disciplined capital management approach resulted in return on invested capital for the trailing four quarters of 31.7%. We have and will continue to make investments that we believe will generate returns and significantly exceed our cost of capital.  Now I will turn it back to Bill Rhodes. Bill Rhodes :  Thank you, Bill. We are pleased this morning to report our 33rd consecutive quarter of double digit EPS growth growing this quarter at a rate of 15.6%. Our company has continued to be successful over the long run. That success is attributable to our approach to leveraging our unique and powerful culture and focusing on the needs of our customers. At the end of the day our customers have choices and we must innovate to ensure they turn to us for the rate of corporate needs. As we continue to invest in our businesses and monitor the results from our ongoing inventory initiatives, we are optimistic about our future. We feel like we continue to be on the right track. Again we\u2019re excited about our initiatives around inventory assortment, hub stores, commercial growth Mexico, all data, e-commerce Brazil and now IMC. Our long term model is to grow new stores square footage at a low single digit growth rate and we expect to continue growing our commercial business at an accelerated rate. Therefore we look to grow EBIT dollars in the mid-single digit range or better in terms of strength. And we leverage our very strong and predictable cash flow to repurchase shares enhancing our earnings per share growth in the double digits. We feel the track we are on will allow us to continue winning for the long run. We believe our steady consistent strategy is correct. It is the intention to details and consistent execution that will matter. Our belief is solid consistent strategy combined with superior execution is a formula for success. Our charge remains to optimize our performance regardless of market conditions and continue to ensure we are investing in the key initiatives that will drive our long-term performance.  In the end, delivering strong EPS growth in ROIC each and every quarter is how we measure ourselves. We are pleased with our results this past year, but we must remain committed to delivering on our strategic and financial objectives. Now we\u2019d like to open up the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Alan Rifkin with Barclays. Alan Rifkin :  Thank you very much and congratulations on a very nice quarter. First question is for Bill Rhodes. So with all of the new initiatives that you\u2019re presently undertaking whether it\u2019s increasing delivery frequency, investment in the mega hubs or the IMC acquisition, it seems like there is much greater willingness on part to possibly take on more risk and grow the business at a greater rate. Can you maybe just provide a little bit color on why that seems to be at this pointing time and if there anyone of those programs where you have greater confidence than the others. Thank you. Bill Rhodes :  That\u2019s a terrific question. I think I would say the -- has moved modestly I don\u2019t want to send the message that we\u2019ve changed our investment profile significantly. But working with our terrific Board of Directors we\u2019ve made a decision to take on a little bit more risk and diversify our portfolio a little bit and you mentioned -- all the winning thing is also another great example of that which has allowed us much better insights into the online retail market and provided us with another great team and a good solid business. I think you asked also, which one do we think is the biggest as most potential, I would tell you that inventory availability has the most potential, because it impacts roughly $8 billion of our revenue today. IMC and all the winning thing are clearly smaller businesses and good solid businesses in growth aspects but the inventory availability initiatives can also significantly impact the overall business. Also let out that we\u2019ve been growing in Brazil as well and as we mentioned it\u2019s cost us significant amount of money and operating loss is down there as we try to get stand up and go on but at the same time that happen when we were in Mexico initially now we seat here with over 400 stores in a very solid business model in Mexico. Alan Rifkin : Okay. So Bill as to continue to target inventory availability and you has different delivery frequencies, what are you learning and obviously it increases revenues at think that\u2019s probably clear but what are the cost associated with testing those different delivery frequencies and ultimately you believe that this can be accretive to EBIT margin as well as accretive to comps and revenues? Bill Rhodes : This is terrific question. I\u2019ll give you some color on it, but the reason we\u2019re not saying it today here is what we\u2019re going to do is because we don\u2019t know all of those answers yet. So on delivery frequency for instance we tested two times a week, we\u2019ve tested three times a week, we\u2019ve tested five times a week. We don\u2019t know what the right answer is yet. The cost profile of going twice a week is very different and going five times a week. Similarly with mega hubs we\u2019re finding how far can we go out on a same day basis versus an overnight basis and the cost profile is very different. I\u2019ll tell you that I would not expect this initiative would be EBIT margin accretive, in fact I would expect it to be dilutive I can\u2019t tell you today how much it will dilutive I wouldn\u2019t expect massively dilutive, but it\u2019s hard when you hold yourself to a 19% roughly annual EBIT margin to say you\u2019re going to do new initiatives that are going to meet that. We do not want to hold ourselves for that standard. Alan Rifkin : Just one last one if I may and I'll pass it on. Is it possible that some stores might be better served with two times a week as opposed to three or five? Can there be some variability in the delivery frequency? I'm having a lot of difficulty with that word this morning. Bill Rhodes :  Yes it is a difficult word [indiscernible] prepared comment. Bill Giles :  I think that\u2019s a question that we\u2019re asking ourselves right now if so we have a distribution center in Dallas, Texas and we have a $70,000 store in Dallas going there five times a week seems pretty easy. But we have to far go North Dakota does it makes sense to go five times week? Those are question that we just haven\u2019t answered at this point. Alan Rifkin : Okay. Thank you let me pass it on to somebody else. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Robert Higginbotham with SunTrust. Robert Higginbotham :  Good morning everyone. You mentioned the potential for two to three more DCs or that you expect it to put into two to three more DCs to increase your inventory availability. That seemed to cover a broad range of potential frequencies for deliveries. What kind of range would that two to three cover? Would that go up to daily, would that be two to three times a week, how should we think about that? Bill Rhodes :  Well the most were attempting today\u2019s five times I wouldn\u2019t call it daily. But we would be able to briefs the networks that we think we need to reach on a two to five time a week basis from, if we added that those three distribution centers. Robert Higginbotham :  Okay fair enough. And then have you talked about what kind of lift do you see on sales at the stores you tested to the five time? Bill Rhodes :  No we haven\u2019t because we\u2019re testing around the 150 stores and we\u2019re testing with different profiles. And frankly the results were mix were all positive but the range of results were different, different markets are performing different ways. So we need to get a better handle on it that\u2019s why we\u2019re going to expand the test to further validate our results. These are big decisions that we will make and we\u2019re taking our time to make sure we make the right decisions. Robert Higginbotham : Okay and one last one on IMC. Beyond the next 12 months where you said you'd add a handful how do you think about the potential number of warehouses, obviously advances put out some pretty aggressive numbers out there for world Pac with IMC being at least a similar concept. Any reason you couldn't over time maybe reach something close to those levels of locations and then as part of that, could you talk about how capital intensive the new IMC warehouse is, any numbers we can share on unit economics would be helpful, thanks. Bill Rhodes :  Sure on the number of locations we think we will have over a 100 at some point of time not see like anybody else would have more than we do. So that will be our plan overtime but we\u2019re going to open a handful this year, this is a new business for us, new endeavor for us and we\u2019re going to work with the IMC team to figure out how can invest leverage each other and open a few make sure that we get the performance that we want and then we will accelerate from them. Bill Giles :  And then from the capital perspective on the stores or the locations are typically non-retail and more warehouse locations so there are typically certainly less than retail locations with cost. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Dan Wewer with Raymond James. Dan Wewer :  Thanks. So Bill, in expanding the daily delivery or the delivery capabilities of two to five times a week that would still be I guess less frequent than your three largest competitors in the commercial channel. What do you think that you would be leaving on the table by not going to maybe a multiple daily delivery rate? Bill Rhodes :  Well just to clarify we will be doing multiple times a day from our hub stores and our mega hubs in those markets. And so I don\u2019t think we would be if we win a five times a week I don\u2019t think we would be at any competitive disadvantages at that point in time. Dan Wewer :  So the two to five times per week is from the large distribution center and then you'd top off additionally from the hubs and mega hubs? Bill Rhodes :  Three times a day typically within a week more approximately to the store. Dan Wewer :  So when you look at roughly the 30% gap in revenue per program, do you think this is the game changer that will get you to that 11-$12,000 a week level? Bill Rhodes :  I don\u2019t know the answer to that yet Dan. But what I do know is this will be a material change in our ability to fulfill our customers need. We are seeing significant improvements in sales performance my personal expectations is that we\u2019ll grow overtime as our commercial customers in particular experience us being all to fill their needs at higher level. And I think it can make a big difference Whether or not that's a silver bullet I don\u2019t think there is a silver bullet I think we\u2019ve got to stick to our net and continue to improved business every day and get letter. Dan Wewer :  Separate question on the legal expenses that appears to be about $0.09 a share after-tax. Is this a one off issue tied to the lawsuit that was in the papers a few weeks ago or do you think this is going to be an ongoing higher expense rate tied to just the legal environment that you're in? Bill Rhodes :  That\u2019s not a former we want to talk about anything in particular. But obviously during the quarter we believe we had a onetime non-recurring cost and just you pointed is roughly about 22 basis points SG&A for just this quarter. Dan Wewer :  The final question for Bill Rhodes. When you think about the benefits of the drop in gasoline prices compared to the headwinds from the favorable weather last year which went in that tug of war? Bill Rhodes :  I am sorry, can you say it loud [indiscernible]. Dan Wewer : Which is the most relevant, the benefit from the drop in gas O loan prices or the headwind from the more difficult sales comparison from the ideal weather last year. Bill Rhodes : Clearly we had terrific performance last year in the second quarter. We saw in specific categories the weather related categories performed exceedingly well. However, some of the other categories did not perform well. We talked about that last year in the second quarter. So it's going to be, the weather is going what it's going to be. There is not material changes that we need to make our business. So we are going to just go up and slug it up the best we can. Gas prices really dropped precipitously just recently and we are beginning to see some of the benefits. I expect the benefits to be bigger overtime if they remain at these levels or even go over but as far as comparing the two I think you have just as good insight on that as I do. Operator :  Thank you. The next question is from Aram Rubinson with Wolfe Research. Aram Rubinson : Hi good morning. Thanks for taking the question. A couple of really good questions already asked. Just want to tie it towards the cash flow if we can. I think back in 2012, you reduced your share counts by 9% and then the following year by 8% and following year by 7% and this year we're kind of 5.5 so what I'm wondering is where does that go and implicit is where does CapEx need to go to accommodate these that you've got on the docket? Bill Giles :  Yes, I think that's a good question. I think if you look at it over the last several years, we obviously had some benefits on working capital and you look at AP to inventory. And as we've kind of headlined over the last several quarters, that we feel great about where we are from AP to inventory ratio well over a 100% and we think there is some moderate opportunities for us to continue to improve AP to inventory but we do not anticipate having the kind of increases in AP to inventory going forward that we experienced over the last several years, some of that attributed to helping us from a share repurchase perspective. I think relative to capital investments in terms of distributions et cetera, as Bill mentioned, we may add two to three distribution centers of the next several years and we still have work to do to determine whether when we will do it, how many we will do it et cetera. But also keep in mind that we would have added one or two distribution centers overtime anyway just to support our footprint across the United States, I mean you can clearly get out of map and see that we really don't have a lot of distribution capabilities necessarily in the North West relatively to the amount of stores we've opened over the last five years.  So some of that is inherent in our model overall. So we will give you a little bit more color on the inventory initiative over the next couple of quarters as we finish up the test and have the better plan. I think from a share repurchase perspective, we think we are in a pretty good position right now and we will continue to seek opportunities to improve working capital but I think that's kind of gap existing over the last several years. Aram Rubinson : Well without giving us a number can you tell us where you might have flex room inside of CapEx if you did decide to step it up on the DC side what things might be able to come out to accommodate it? Thank you. Bill Giles :  I am sure there are some things in there nothing significant to be excited at the moment. I mean one thing for sure that we want to make sure we're doing is looking down the road, so we're going to continue to make sure that we are making information system investments in order to support our growth long-term both domestically and internationally. We are very diligent about according our pledge making sure that our stores look right and are going to continue to invest in our maintenance and training of our AutoZoners. So there will be opportunities for us to eat the CapEx a little but we will definitely have some costs relative to distribution centers. Operator :  Thank you. The next question is from Michael Lasser with UBS. Unidentified Analyst : Hi this is Max on your Michael Lasser. Congrats on the quarter and thanks a lot for taking my question. How far do you think your current inventory initiatives can take you in closing the commercial sales per program gap with your peers? Bill Rhodes : I think it's too early for us to tell. As I mentioned our performance so far, with everything is performing well but there's a pretty wide band of how they are performing. I also think it's going to take time just because we are proving availability it's going to take time to further deepen those relationships with our commercial customers. I think we are doing a lot of great things in our commercial business as I mentioned in the prepared remarks. We've grown commercial double digits for five straight quarters and I think that's pretty impressive and also we will continue to do this. Unidentified Analyst :  Thanks a lot. Also, just kind of as a follow-up, can you maybe dimension some of the cannibalization you're seeing from your younger programs at all? Bill Rhodes : We can internally. We don't necessarily discuss it externally. I think the key is to focus on for this quarter is that we've obviously improved the productivity of our commercial programs on an average weekly sale basis which is along the way as we measure some 8,500 versus 8,300 last year. We're seeing a high single digit growth out of our material programs, so we feel pretty good about the programs as they mature and we recognize the 30% of our overall programs three years old and younger. And so there will continue to be some cannibalization on those more from just transferring mature customers around, but overall we feel pretty good about the growth rates that we\u2019ve achieved on commercial and we feel pretty good about the trend rates that we\u2019ve seen on commercial. Operator :  Thank you. The next question is from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Seth Basham :  You guys had same-store sales accelerate 240 basis points from Q4 to Q1. Could you try to break down the drivers of that acceleration between inventory availability whether industry growth, etc? Bill Rhodes :  One of the things we thought weather was probably worth around a point or so. I think from a GAAP perspective or lower fuel cost as Bill mentioned before, lot of that happen late in the quarter so I suspect that benefited some. So those items and I think the progression you saw from comp store sales in really a result of lot of the initiatives that we put in place and we think back on inventory optimization the algorithms that we changed that inventory into the stores et cetera now that take itself for just about a little over a year now. We feel pretty good about that and as mentioned before on many of these initiatives it\u2019s going to take time for the customers to recognize the changes that we\u2019ve made. So that inventory optimization is a great example of one where it took several months and now we believe that we\u2019re starting to see some benefits they can drive results. Seth Basham : Got it and as you look forward obviously you don't provide guidance but from the outside in should we be thinking about consistent two year stack comps for the next couple quarters? Bill Rhodes :  Yes, that we don\u2019t really look at it that way. We\u2019re kind of looking at how we\u2019re doing right now this past quarter and what we have in front of us and as Bill mentioned before clearly next quarter has a high comp because we have some severe weather and that impacted a lot of failure related categories in lot of the northeast market, at the same time there are lot of maintenance categories that underperformed and there were market outside of the northeast that underperform. So we\u2019ll have to wait and see how it all shakes out but we think that there is opportunities from a category in region perspective and if gas prices stay down that can only be helpful. Seth Basham : Okay and then lastly on deflation, would you expect to see more deflation running through your business with oil prices down, impact on oil and chemicals specifically as well as products with steel input? Bill Rhodes :  Intellectually a little bit, we would expect to see some deflation that we haven\u2019t seen it yet. So there is some little bit of deflation at oil, there are other categories that have experienced some inflation still on the whole. We\u2019ve seen relatively the nine inflation or deflation in total we have to wait and see how it shake out, right now we don\u2019t really see a big change. Operator :  Thank you. The next question is from Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Matthew Fassler :  Thanks a lot, good morning. I want to start out by focusing if we could on SG&A. Even when we isolate out the two discrete items that you called out healthcare and legal, the growth rate in SG&A looks to have picked up a bit and I guess just slightly from where you were earlier in the year. How should we think about your expense comparison going forward and how much discretionary investments would you say is in bedded in the underlying SG&A number here in the November quarter? Bill Rhodes :  I think it\u2019s a good question Matt I think that obviously we have the legal insurance to put IMC cost and there we didn\u2019t call out, expose things our which probably get flat SG&A rate year-over-year but you had a 4.5 comp. So you\u2019d expect to have had some leverage on SG&A above that I would think it\u2019s a way to think through that is we probably at a little bit from a discretionary perspective and that\u2019s a much discretionary as these inventory initiatives although we haven\u2019t quantify them. There are a little bit headwind from an operating cost perspective and we would expect those to continue over the next couple of quarters as we continue access those out. So there are some dollars there I\u2019m not going to quantify exactly what the percentages are but I think we can run flattish for the quarter if willing back out some of those items and then probably had a little bit of investments on our initiatives. Matthew Fassler : Just to follow that through a little bit you've had a track record over the past couple years of tightening your belts a bit when the business has been tough as was the case in your fiscal 13 and then investing a bit more in the business has been better so because you did that last year, your expense compare looks easy if you will just given you had the sizeable increase, so should we consider then perhaps to compare might be easy but the investments should persist into the middle of this year given the Supply Chain dynamics or Supply Chain investments remain very much under way? Bill Rhodes :  Exactly right. Matthew Fassler : And then a follow-up, just trying to work with some of the numbers you gave us to understand the intrinsic profit ability of IMC today and where it could be headed so presuming that it's about a 1.5% \"business pro forma, you talked about a 30 basis point drag on gross margin and I believe you talked about the 10 basis point drag going forward in SG&A. Should that spell out something like a mid-single digit operating margin for that business as we speak? Bill Rhodes :  I would say not as we speak I think we think of them in growth note and so they\u2019ve got some immature businesses. We\u2019re going to continue to invest in those businesses et cetera. And so we will need to improve the profitability of IMC and then more importantly we also need to overtime help our own commercial customers through IMC product. Matthew Fassler : And I know it's a small business but given that it's sort of tough to get at a precise number would you say that business is in the black today just to get clear on that. Bill Rhodes :  Now to be clear on that Matt just not to talk around it, it is in the slide 1. Matthew Fassler : Got it and the profit potential of that model overtime, as you think about intrinsic gross margins and term potential et cetera. Bill Rhodes :  Yes obviously that\u2019s probably close to what you\u2019re thinking before versus probably a mid-single digit kind of a number. But the bigger opportunity would be the broader base. Matthew Fassler : Understood. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Greg Melich : Hi thanks. A couple follow-ups I think. One was on the sequential improvement in the comp trend. How much of that was I heard traffic was still a little bit negative but how much of that sequential improvement was traffic versus ticket? Bill Rhodes :  I think it was both and I\u2019ve talk about it earlier. The ticket for on the less from year it\u2019s been really quick it\u2019s being continuing to grow it\u2019s been some due. And let trend changed back to the time normalize trends this quarter. But traffic also improved as we\u2019re looking and talking about the acceleration from Q4 I\u2019d also remind as us all that, nobody was really happy with Q4 and remember this July was really poor and August was poor as well. So I wouldn\u2019t necessarily the base line if you will. Greg Melich : Okay great and then just to understand a little bit more I think I heard in your comments that you had lower product acquisition costs. What's driving that and if you think about it going forward I think you mentioned inflation just isn't back at all. Do you think there's actually deflation likely to come into next year? Bill Rhodes :  Yes I think our merchandizing organization pretend this to do a great job both and identifying new vendors for existing product where we can reduce our cost in direct import opportunities overseas, doing things directly or finding new vendors overseas as well. So I think the merchandizing organization is done a great job from flowing our acquisition costs. Haven\u2019t seen in total lot of deflation necessarily but we haven\u2019t seen inflation either obviously. Going forward right now our expectations is that there won\u2019t be much deflation or inflation but clearly in some categories we expect we\u2019ll be all to the deflation. I think overall be relatively flat. Greg Melich : And were most where you are now in terms of direct import as a percentage? Bill Rhodes :  It\u2019s out of significant percentage certainly well below 20%. Greg Melich : Okay and Duralast, do you have a number for that? Bill Rhodes :  Our 10 granted products was value throughout the last year last 12 products see max are represent to serve a 50% of all of our sales. Operator : Thank you. That\u2019s all time we have for questions. I\u2019d like to turn call over to Bill Rhodes for final comments. Bill Rhodes :  Before we conclude the call, I\u2019d just like to take a moment to reiterate that we have a long and strong heritage of consistent impressive performance. While we are excited about our growth prospects for the year. We will not take anything for granted as we understand our customers have choices. We have a solid plan to succeed this fiscal year but I want to stress that this is a marathon and not a sprint. As we continue to focus on the basics and focus on optimizing long term shareholder value, we are confident AutoZone will continue to be very successful. We thank you for participating in today\u2019s call. And we like to wish everyone a very happy and healthy holiday season and a prosperous New Year. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you for joining. You may disconnect at this time.",

Operator : Mr. Rhodes, you may begin. William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning and thank you for joining us today for AutoZone's 2015 Second Quarter Conference Call. With me today are Bill Giles, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, IT and ALLDATA; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax. Regarding the second quarter, I hope you've had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not, the press release, along with slides complementing our comments today, is available on our website, www.autozoneinc.com. Please click on Quarterly Earnings Conference Calls to see them. To begin this morning, I want to thank all AutoZoners across the globe for delivering another solid quarter. We remain focused on several key initiatives and on growing our business on a variety of fronts. We've diversified our portfolio somewhat in recent years, with an emphasis on building additional legs of growth for the future. Our Retail domestic business, which generates approximately 70% of our revenues, performed well in Q2. And we continue to see opportunities for future growth in store count and same-store sales. Secondly, our Commercial domestic business, which has been growing sales by double digits for five years, accelerated its growth in Q2 and continues to be a tremendous growth opportunity. Regarding our international operations, we've been doing business in Mexico since late 1998 and our model has proven to work quite well. In Brazil, we are still in test phase, but our sales have continued to grow nicely. As with other international companies, the strengthening dollar has negatively impacted our U.S. dollar earnings from these operations recently. Our Internet businesses, AutoZone.com and AutoAnything, continue to grow nicely and generally consistent with our expectations. ALLDATA, which is the leading diagnostic and repair business in the United States, continues to perform well although our growth in that business has slowed as the market has become more competitive in recent years and as our market share has reached all-time highs. And finally, IMC, an imports parts specialist that we acquired in the fall, has begun the integration process where we are working to expand their footprint of branches and where we are working to leverage their inventory assortment across the AutoZone domestic store base. This past quarter, our U.S. Retail business expanded with the opening of 36 net new stores. We also opened 29 net new Commercial programs. Our Commercial business continued to grain traction, growing sales 14.5% for the quarter. We have the Commercial programs in 78% of our domestic stores, having opened approximately 800 new programs in just the past two years. Additionally, we opened five stores in Mexico during the quarter. In Brazil, we continue to operate five stores and expect to open a couple of new ones over the next few months. We currently have 8% of our total stores outside of the United States. Finally, we opened our first IMC branch since we acquired the company. And we are in the final stages of relocating their East Coast distribution center. We believe we have growth opportunities on a variety of fronts in the United States and outside the U.S. for many years to come. As mentioned on our last conference call, during our first fiscal quarter, our sales continued to gain momentum throughout the quarter. And in the last two weeks, due to the first significant cold weather, our sales grew significantly. Due to last year's very strong Q2 sales, up 4.3% on a same-store basis, the comparisons for this past quarter were challenging. We were quite pleased with our performance throughout the second quarter, especially in light of the difficult comparisons. And we ended the quarter with domestic same-store sales of 3.6%. This represents more than 200 basis points improvement on a two-year rolling same-store basis from last quarter. We were pleased to see we gained traction in sales categories where we've added merchandise, and our Commercial business benefited from both the inventory additions and the diligent focus on growing sales in our older programs, with particular emphasis on mature customers. Our results were strongest in the West, South and South Central states and were weakest in the Northeastern and Midwestern markets. These weaker markets performed quite well last year with the extremely cold winter. And we knew the comparison this year would be difficult. While our cold weather-related categories didn't perform as well as last year, they continued to perform well under the circumstances. And as anticipated, our maintenance-related categories performed quite well in the quarter. Our belief is the Improvement and Maintenance category sales was driven by more conducive weather patterns, improved merchandise assortments due to the products we have added over the last year, and lower gas prices, which we believe is relieving some pressure, particularly on our most economically challenged customers. In recent years, we have experienced a significant growth in our sales concurrent with the U.S. tax refund season. We believe our most economically challenged customers use their refunds to make repairs and enhancements to their vehicles that they have deferred for some time. Each year, the exact timing of tax refunds moves a bit and those moves occur at the very end of our second quarter or at the beginning of our third quarter. If you recall, in fiscal 2013, we cited the delays in tax refunds that caused a material reduction in our sales the last two weeks of the quarter, where we saw 8% decline in same-store sales for those two weeks. This year, refunds began earlier and helped our business, particularly in the second-to-last week of the quarter. This one week added about 100 basis points to our same-store sales for the quarter. Overall, we were quite pleased with our sales performance in Q2. Our inventory per location increased over our Q1 2015 levels. The primary driver of this increase was timing. We typically experience an increase in inventory as we prepare for the spring selling season. We anticipate that inventory levels will decline somewhat as this merchandise sells over the balance of the next two quarters. Additionally, the IMC acquisition has increased our inventory per store across the chain by $11,000 per store. IMC branches carry approximately 10 times the inventory per location that an average AutoZone store carries, but their volumes on a per-location basis are materially higher as well. As we mentioned during the last several quarterly calls, we've been testing different delivery frequencies from our distribution centers. Our ongoing tests show us that increased delivery frequency increases sales and improves inventory productivity by reducing safety stops. We've been running tests in just over 150 stores for approximately a year. And based on the success of our initial results, during the second quarter, we made the decision to expand the test to more than 300 additional stores. These stores were added to the test in the last couple of weeks of the second quarter and the first week of the third quarter. We now have the test in approximately 10% of our domestic chains, which we believe gives us a substantial base of stores to assess performance. The results to date show a nice low single-digit lift in sales, but we aren't prepared yet to determine our long-term strategy. We still have a significant amount to learn, including the optimal number of deliveries each store should receive weekly. It could be three, four, five times or more. Ultimately, assuming our current findings continue, we would expect to increase the delivery frequency to most of our stores. And we would expect to add two to three additional distribution centers to do this cost effectively and timely. If we ultimately elect to increase the delivery frequency to our stores, we will increase our capital expenditures primarily for the new distribution centers but we will also add annual operating expenses. Our modeling to date, based on our current results shows that while it is somewhat dilutive to gross and operating margins over the long term, it is sufficiently additive to operating profit dollars and provides us with returns above our internal hurdle rate. We've been pleased with our learnings to date. And we are excited to expand our test to hopefully improve on our results and confirm our expectations. Additionally, we have been testing what we call mega-hubs. Mega-hubs have substantially increased product assortments and they leverage those increased product assortments across other hub networks, providing stores across a large geography access to this expanded assortment. We have been testing two mega-hubs for about a year. Based on the encouraging results we've seen to date, we're expanding the mega-hub program by an additional three locations, which should open over the balance of our fiscal year. Once these three locations are opened, 35% of our domestic store base will have access to these expanded inventory assortments. If these three additional mega-hubs meet or exceed our expectations, we will develop a long-term strategy to roll out mega-hubs to provide service to the majority of our domestic stores. All of our inventory availability initiatives are designed to significantly increase our ability to meet our customers' needs. As our Commercial business has grown and our DIY customers' needs increase, our need for expanded parts assortments continues. This has been important and difficult work, and I'd like to thank everyone in the organization that has been involved with this initiative for their excellent work. Now I'll take a moment to discuss our recently completed acquisition of Interamerican Motor Corporation. IMC is the second largest distributor of OE quality import replacement parts in the United States. They specialize in parts coverage for European and Asian cars. While considerably smaller than the number one participant in the industry, IMC, now with 18 branches, offers an impressive growth opportunity for us, not just because of the parts coverage, but also because of the very strong management team. While it's premature, I will mention our plans include opening more IMC branches and incorporating their parts catalog into the AutoZone Z-Net parts catalog. We will continue to go to market as IMC and we expect to open a handful of new IMC locations over the next 12 months. This past January, we made the IMC catalog available to a small number of AutoZone stores near an IMC location. Thus far, while really early, we are pleased. We have seen a lift in those stores' Commercial sales that encourages us that our assumptions on the sales lift to AutoZone from cross-selling were correct. In fact, we're slightly ahead of our original sales assumptions, again, in a statistically insignificant number of AutoZone stores, but so far, so good. Let me stress. The IMC brand is very important to us. And we will grow the brand and its presence in the future in many more markets than it is in today. IMC has been in a growth mode recently and it's built an infrastructure to support a substantially larger footprint. It currently doesn't enjoy the operating margins that we experienced, so it will lower our overall EBIT margins by approximately 40 basis points on an annual basis. We are very excited to have the great IMC team as part of our organization and very optimistic about our future together. The IMC team has embraced the acquisition by AutoZone. And we all are very excited about the future of our two companies together as this acquisition makes both of us stronger. Now let's turn to our second quarter results. Our sales increased 7.7% and our domestic same-store sales were up 3.6%. Both Retail and Commercial experienced positive same-store sales growth. Our same-stores fluctuated from week to week due to the wild swings in weather patterns that occur this time of year. The overall trajectory of our business was quite consistent throughout most of the quarter. That consistency was across all regions of the country. We believe we benefited from macro tailwinds, our work on inventory availability and on solid execution. While our failure-related and maintenance merchandise categories performed well, we were especially happy to see the growth in our maintenance categories. Regarding traffic versus ticket in our DIY business, traffic was slightly negative, while ticket was positive. Interestingly, the Northeast and Midwest experienced declines in customer count around 5%, while the rest of the country was positive, together blending to be down slightly. The comparison to last year's extreme cold in the Northern markets was a big contributor to this year being a difficult comparison. Our average ticket grew generally consistent with the first quarter when it returned to more normalized levels after about a year of subdued growth. The hard parts additions we've added to our stores have helped drive ticket growth. While improvement in product quality has pressured traffic over the last couple of decades, the technology advancements have significantly increased the price of the products we sell. We've been managing through this phenomenon as mentioned for over two decades and expect to continue to do so. We opened 29 new Commercial programs in the quarter versus 49 programs in the comparable period last year. We now have a Commercial program in 78% of our domestic store base. Our Commercial sales, excluding IMC, were up 14.5% this quarter. Our productivity per program showed a nice uptick this past quarter. We have intensified our focus on mature program growth and specifically mature customer growth, and it was encouraging to see the improvements that began in Q1 further accelerate in Q2. Regarding Mexico, we opened five stores this quarter. Sales in our other businesses for the quarter were up 9.2% over last year's second quarter. As a reminder, ALLDATA and e-commerce, which includes AutoZone.com and AutoAnything make up this segment of sales. Regarding online sales, there continue to be great opportunities for growth on both a business-to-business basis and to the individual consumers or B2C. While these businesses are small for us at just 4% of our total sales mix on the quarter, we expect these businesses to grow at a faster rate than our brick-and-mortar business for the foreseeable future. With the continued aging of the car population and with gas prices on average down materially year-over-year for the second quarter, we are beginning to see miles driven increase. Declining prices at the pump has benefited our customers, especially those most financially strapped. The lower end consumer benefits the most from lower gas prices relative to income. This trend is encouraging, but we understand this is just one of the many factors that impact our business. Our operating theme for 2015 is Wow! Every Customer Everywhere. And our key priorities for the year are : one, great people providing great service; two, profitably growing our Commercial business; three, leveraging the Internet; four, leveraging technology to improve the customer experience while optimizing efficiencies; and five, improving inventory availability. On the Retail front last quarter, under the Great People Providing Great Service theme, we continued with our intense focus on improving execution. Along with improvements to our product assortment, we're incorporating more training tools to help our store AutoZoners provide trustworthy advice. Training will continue to be a large effort for us at the store level. Behind the scenes, we have increased our technology investment and challenged ourselves to make sure our offerings are relevant across all shopping platforms. We realize as customers have become much more tech and mobile savvy, we have to have a sales proposition that touches all the ways they desire to interact with us. It is imperative we continue to invest in both current and future technologies in order to drive sales growth across all businesses. Additionally, during the quarter, we completed our second ever company-wide engagement survey. We completed our first survey in the fall of 2012 and had terrific results. This year, our results were even better, which is a great testament to our culture and to the terrific leaders we have on our team. It is so encouraging that our AutoZoners not only know they work for a great organization, but they are highly engaged in that work and feel proud to work for this great company we call AutoZone. Our AutoZoners are the most valuable asset we have. In regards to Commercial, we opened 29 programs during the quarter and 90 year-to-date. We expect to open approximately 300 programs this year versus 424 last year. As we continue to improve our product assortment and availability and as we make other refinements to our offerings, we expect that the sales potential will continue to increase. Our results continue to provide us with confidence to be aggressive in adding additional resources and new programs to this important growth initiative. We should also highlight another strong performance in return on invested capital, as we were able to finish Q2 at 31.2%. We are very pleased with this metric as it is one of the best, if not the best, in all of hard lines retailing. However, our primary focus has been and continues to be that we ensure every incremental dollar of capital that we deploy in this business provides an acceptable return, well in excess of our cost of capital. It is important to reinforce that we will always maintain our diligence regarding capital stewardship as the capital we invest is our investors' capital. Before I pass the discussion over to Bill Giles to talk about our financial results, I'd like to recognize our entire organization for their incredible effort to deliver another strong quarter of solid financial results, while providing Wow! customer service to all of our customers. Now, here's Bill. William T. Giles - CFO & Executive VP-Information Technology and ALLDATA : Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everyone. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to talk more specifically about our Retail, Commercial and International results. For the quarter, total auto parts sales, which includes our domestic Retail and Commercial businesses, IMC, our Mexico stores and our five stores in Brazil, increased 7.6%. Regarding macro trends during the quarter, nationally unleaded gas prices started out at $2.82 a gallon and ended the quarter at $2.27 a gallon, a $0.55 increase. Last year, gas prices increased $0.15 per gallon during the second quarter, starting out at $3.29 and ending at $3.44 a gallon. We continue to believe gas prices have a real impact on our customers' abilities to maintain their vehicles, and as cost reductions help all Americans, we hope to benefit from some increase in disposable income. We also recognize that the impact of miles driven on cars over 10 years old, the current average, is much different than on newer cars in terms of wear and tear. Miles driven increased 1% in November. Data for December and January isn't currently available. The other statistically highlight is the number of seven-year and older vehicles on the road, which continues to trend in our industry's favor. For the trailing four quarters, total sales per AutoZone store were $1.753 million. This statistic continues to set the pace for the rest of the industry. For the quarter, total Commercial sales increased 14.5%. Commercial represented 17% of our total sales compared to 16% last year and grew $47 million over last year's second quarter. We opened 29 new programs during the quarter versus 49 programs opened in our second quarter of last fiscal year. We now have our Commercial program in 3,935 stores, supported by 171 hub stores. Approximately 1,100 of our programs are three years old or younger. As Bill had mentioned earlier, both our total Commercial sales and sales per program accelerated from the previous quarter's results. While our average sales per program is below some peers in our industry, we feel we are on the right track to methodically close that gap. It's important to highlight that we accelerated our new program growth over the last few years as approximately 30% of our programs are younger than three years old, these openings have impacted our average sales metric and cannibalized some of our older programs. However, our focus is on growing market share and improving our service levels by having more programs closer to our customers. Looking specifically at our mature programs, those at least five years old, they grew in the mid-single-digit range this past quarter. Additionally, we still have significant opportunities to open additional programs over the next several years. We feel good about the success we've had in profitably growing the Commercial business. In summary, we remain committed to our long-term growth strategy. We believe the improvements we have made and upcoming additional improvements from our inventory availability initiatives enhance our prospects, and we believe the addition of IMC will provide us with more avenues to service our Commercial customers very effectively. We believe we are well positioned to grow this business and capture increased market share. Our Mexico stores continued to perform well. We opened five new stores during the second quarter. We currently have 411 stores in Mexico. As the U.S. dollar strengthened this past quarter, we did have an FX conversion headwind. However, we still delivered a solid U.S. dollar equipment EBIT results and felt good about being able to handle the currency weakening in regard to the overall impact for the company's results. We expect to open a similar number of stores in Mexico this fiscal year that we opened last year. Our returns and profit growth continue to be in line with our expectations. Regarding Brazil, we are currently operating five stores. We expect to open a few more stores over the next several months and then refine our offerings and prove that our concept works for our customers and is financially viable. Once we refine our offerings and operations and evaluate the performance, we will provide you with an update on our long-term growth plans. Recapping this past quarter's performance for the company, in total, our sales were $2.144 billion, an increase of 7.7%. Domestic same-store sales or sales for stores opened more than one year were up 3.6% for the quarter. Gross margin for the quarter was 52.2% of sales, up 15 basis points. The improvement in gross margin was attributable to higher merchandise margins, partially offset by the impact from Interamerican Motor Corporation, which was acquired during September 2014. Looking forward, we continue to believe there remains opportunity for merchandise gross margin expansion within both the Retail and Commercial businesses. The pressure we will experience in the IMC business, along with the rollout of further stores on more frequent deliveries from our distribution centers, will continue to cause headwinds to our overall gross margin rate. However, our primary focus remains growing absolute gross profit dollars in our total auto parts segment. SG&A for the quarter was 35.4% of sales, 25 basis points higher than last year's second quarter. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of sales was due to higher incentive compensation impact from the IMC acquisition and self-insured employee medical costs. Partially offsetting these items was a favorable credit card litigation settlement of $5.4 million recognized during the quarter. While we have invested in several key initiatives that are customer service-related, like training and systems upgrades, we believe we are well positioned to manage our cost structure in response to our sales environment. EBIT for the quarter was $361 million, up 7.1% over last year's second quarter. Our EBIT margin was down 10 basis points at 16.9%. Interest expense for the quarter was $34.5 million compared with $39.5 million in Q2 a year ago. Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $4.4 billion or approximately $125 million more than last year's balance of $4.3 billion. Our adjusted debt level metric finished the quarter at 2.5 times EBITDAR. While on any given quarter, we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on management's opinion regarding debt and equity market conditions, we remain committed to both our investment grade rating and our capital allocation strategy and share repurchases are an important element of that strategy. For the quarter, our tax rate was approximately 35.2%, in line with last year's second quarter. We expect our annual rate to be closer to 36.5% on an ongoing basis as the deviation in results this quarter, like last year, was primarily driven by the government tax credits reinstituted in December of 2014. Net income for the quarter was $212 million, up 9.8%. Our diluted share count of 32.5 million shares was down 5% from last year's second quarter. The combination of these factors drove earnings per share for the quarter to $6.51, up 15.6% over the prior year's second quarter. Relating to the cash flow statement for the second fiscal quarter, our operating cash flow was $101 million. Net fixed assets were up 7.7% versus last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $93.8 million and reflected the additional expenditures required to open 44 new stores this quarter, capital expenditures on existing stores, hub store remodels, work on development of new stores for upcoming quarters and Information Technology investments. With the new stores open, we finished this past quarter with 5,042 stores in 49 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, 411 stores in Mexico, 18 IMC branches and five stores in Brazil for a total location count of 5,476. Depreciation totaled $59.9 million for the quarter versus last year's second quarter expense of $58 million. This is in line with recent quarter growth rates. With our excess cash flow, we repurchased $26 million of AutoZone stock in the second quarter. At the end of the quarter, we had $544 million remaining under our share buyback authorization and our leverage metric was 2.5 times. Again, I want to stress we manage to appropriate credit ratings and not any one metric. The metric we report is meant as a guide only, as each rating agency firm has its own criteria. We continue to view our share repurchase program as an attractive capital deployment strategy. Accounts payable, as a percent of gross inventory, finished the quarter at 107.5%. The inclusion of IMC reduced the AP ratio by 170 basis points. Next I'd like to update you on our inventory levels in total and on a per-store basis. We reported an inventory balance of $3.5 billion, up 12% versus the Q2 ending balance last year. Increased inventory reflects the recent IMC acquisition, new store growth and additional investments in coverage. Inventory per store was up 7.1% at $631,000 per store, reflecting our continued investments in hard parts coverage and the IMC acquisition. The increase in inventory per store this quarter due to the IMC acquisition was $11,000 per store. Finally, as Bill previously mentioned, our continued disciplined capital management approach resulted in return on invested capital for the trailing four quarters of 31.2%. We have and will continue to make investments that we believe will generate returns that significantly exceed our cost of capital. Now I'll turn it back to Bill Rhodes. William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Bill. We are pleased this morning to report our 34th consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth, growing this quarter at a rate of 15.6%. Our company has continued to be successful over the long run. That success is attributable to our approach to leveraging our unique and powerful culture and focusing on the needs of our customers. At the end of the day, our customers have choices, and we must innovate to ensure they turn to us for their vehicle solution needs. As we continue to invest in our businesses and monitor the results from our ongoing inventory initiatives, we are optimistic about our future. We feel like we continue to be on the right track. Again, we are excited about our initiatives around inventory assortment, supply chain solutions, hub stores, commercial growth, Mexico, ALLDATA, e-commerce, Brazil and now IMC. Our long-term model is to grow new store square footage at a low-single-digit growth rate, and we expect to continue growing our Commercial business at an accelerated rate. Therefore, we routinely look to grow our EBIT dollars in the mid-single-digit range or better in times of strength. And we leverage our very strong and predictable cash flow to repurchase shares, enhancing our earnings per share growth in the double digits. We feel the track we are on will allow us to continue winning for the long run. We believe our steady, consistent strategy is correct. It is the attention to details and consistent execution that will matter. Our belief is solid consistent strategy combined with superior execution is a formula for success. Our charge remains to optimize our performance regardless of market conditions and to continue to ensure we are investing in the key initiatives that will drive our long-term performance. In the end, delivering strong EPS growth and ROIC each and every quarter is how we measure ourselves. We are pleased with our results this past quarter, but we must remain committed to delivering on our strategic and financial objectives. Now we'd like to open up the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. The first question today is from Alan Rifkin with Barclays. Alan M. Rifkin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you very much, and congratulations on another nice quarter, guys. William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Alan M. Rifkin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: First question for Bill Rhodes, concerns the delivery frequency program and increasing that. Could you maybe just provide a little bit more color, Bill, as to when you think, if the program goes according to your plan, when peak spending to support the effort will occur? And maybe provide a little bit of color on the comp lifts that you're seeing to the stores that are supported already by the increase in frequency? Thank you. William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : That's a terrific question, Alan, and one that I don't want go in too in depth at this point in time. And one of the reasons why is we've been testing this in, I think, 168 stores in five different markets, and they're five very different geographies with different competitive sets and the like. And our results generally have been good, but some parts of them are still hard to read, and that's why we decided to expand it by another over 300 stores. And I think as we get the read on those stores, over the third quarter and fourth quarter, we will have a much better understanding to confirm that we're on the right track, hopefully to confirm that they're actually performing better than the ones we've done to date. It's just a little bit early. Our expectation is once we make a decision, we're going to come back to you all and we'll communicate it clearly and show you what we believe the financial implications are on the operating margins and gross margins and capital expenditures. Alan M. Rifkin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Is it reasonable to expect, Bill, that the frequency actually may vary depending on region where some stores may get deliveries three times a week and others will get deliveries as many as five times? Or are you going to do a unilateral approach across the board? William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I think at this point in time, everything is still on the table. We are testing three times, we're testing five times, we tested two times, and clearly, in some places, you're going to be very close to the store. So the cost of going five times is not as significant as if you're 500 miles away. So I think we still have to determine those things, and that's why we expanded it to another 300 plus stores in the last month. Alan M. Rifkin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And one follow-up if I may, I believe you said that ALLDATA was slowing. Can you maybe just provide a little bit more color as to what you are seeing there and what initiatives over the next 12 months are you going to take to reaccelerate that business? William T. Giles - CFO & Executive VP-Information Technology and ALLDATA : Yeah, I mean, ALLDATA continues to be the market leader in diagnostic repair software. And so what we have seen is a little bit more competition in the marketplace and a little bit more pricing pressure on the product. We continue to command a very large market share in that segment. And our strategy over the next 12 months to 24 months is to continue to add enhancements to the product to service our customers better and add additional value. Some of that will be through repair information, confirmed repair information, we put a community website up today as part of the repair product, and that's been received very well. So there's a lot of enhancements that we're making to our suite of products that we think over time will continue to create a larger stickiness with our customers and add more value. Alan M. Rifkin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thank you very much, and good luck in the spring selling season. William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : All right. Thanks. William T. Giles - CFO & Executive VP-Information Technology and ALLDATA : Thank you, Alan. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from John Lawrence with Stephens. John R. Lawrence - Stephens, Inc.: Good morning, guys. William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. John R. Lawrence - Stephens, Inc.: Bill, would you comment \u2013 your comment on the dilution of the EBIT margin at IMC, would you take a step further and if all these other initiatives on the rollout as far as multiple deliveries per week could over time offset some of that, would that not be correct if you looked out to the completion of that project? William T. Giles - CFO & Executive VP-Information Technology and ALLDATA : Actually let me \u2013 I'll jump in, John. I would say probably not. I would think of them differently. IMC operates at a lower margin business than the overall AutoZone business does. We think we can improve IMC's operating margin. We think we can continue to grow that business, but it will continue to operate at a lower margin than our overall company and therefore will create a little bit of dilution on our operating margin. Now obviously when we anniversary that acquisition that occurred in September of 2014, then it won't be a year-over-year headwind per se. Relative to delivery frequency, the play there is really to add some additional cost into our operating cost structure in an effort to increase sales, gain further market share and grow operating profit at a faster rate, and so, both of those will create a little bit of headwind from a pure operating margin rate standpoint. But the objective obviously in both cases is to continue to provide better service and value to our customers, be closer to our customers with inventory and be able to capture market share and grow operating profit. John R. Lawrence - Stephens, Inc.: Great. Thanks. Congratulations. William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next call is from Aram Rubinson with Wolfe Research. Chris J. Bottiglieri - Wolfe Research LLC : Hi, this is actually Chris Bottiglieri on for Aaron Rubinson. William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. William T. Giles - CFO & Executive VP-Information Technology and ALLDATA : Hey, how are you? Chris J. Bottiglieri - Wolfe Research LLC : I'm good. Thanks. Very nice quarter. Had just a quick question on the Commercial program growth, so you took the growth down this year, but obviously the sales were up nicely. Maybe you could just kind of walk us through your thought process there and your desire to slow that down, are your current inventory tests and field tests and delivery tests part of this? Is it to maybe realize that you grew too fast over the last couple of years or is it just kind of preserving capital to use it elsewhere in your business? Thank you. William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes, great question. I'll start with \u2013 it was our plan this year as we came into the year to slow down a little bit. Remember, what seven years ago, we had 51% of the stores on the program. We now have 78% of the stores on the program. We don't have a vision that 100% of the stores will have the Commercial program, but we do believe it will be significantly higher than it is today, we just don't know the exact number. The reason we slowed it down was one, we're later in the lifecycle of the program openings. But more importantly, we really want to focus the organization more on growing mature programs and specifically growing our business with mature customers. As we've opened so many these programs in the last four, five years, taken a lot of time and attention away from the existing programs, it's also cannibalized the existing programs. But this year, we really wanted to recalibrate our focus and focus intensely on growing mature programs and mature customers. And so far through the first six months, that's having some nice benefits. Chris J. Bottiglieri - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. That's great. I'll pass it on to the next person. Thanks for your time. William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Dan Wewer with Raymond James. Dan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thanks. Bill, you'd noted that you were seeing the initial payback with your mature customers. Does that reflect the fact that they're seeing the benefit of the better in-stock positions? And then second, what is the strategy for your top-down sales guys to become more aggressive and letting new accounts know about your greater commercial capabilities? William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : A couple quick questions. Thanks, Dan. On the sales force side, we really started building a sales force about seven, eight years ago now. And I will tell you I am just \u2013 every time I ride with one of our salespeople, every time I talk to our senior sales leaders, I'm just remarkably impressed by the progress that we've made. And unlike a lot of organizations where you put the salespeople out there to eat what you can kill, our sales processes are very well defined and our team determines exactly where we want our salespeople to be, the exact type of accounts and by the way, the exact accounts that they want them to call on that week. So part of what we've done is we've redirected some of their focus and efforts to the existing stores or the existing customers that we have. And that's beginning to pay off, which we are still calling on new customers, but we really want to be focused on the ones that we have today. And I'm sorry I forgot your first question. Dan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Well, it's just \u2013 I think you answered that, that the initial payback with the mature customers, that reflects the fact that you're able to say yes more often to their orders. William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Really so far, we've only seen one of the initiatives that we embarked on, and that was the change in our algorithms that we made last year to put newer inventory function to the customer. As we work on both this mega-hub approach and this delivery frequency approach, that can have a material difference in our ability to say yes. And it is more important with the \u2013 it's important on both the Commercial and DIY side. With the Commercial customer calling me multiple times a day versus a DIY customer calling you a few times a year, it's very important on the Commercial side. Dan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: And just one other question. After you complete opening three additional distribution centers, your total network is still about half the number of DC locations that your competitors have. Do you see this as just an intermediate investment and that someday AutoZone may operate 20 plus distribution centers? William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I would say at this point in time, absolutely not. We see this as the permanent solution. That doesn't mean that we won't get smarter over time and decide we need to drop another DC in here. But we have no vision of a 25 distribution center model. Now that being said, three years ago, we didn't have a vision of going delivery frequency. And as our business has changed and as the competitive landscape has changed, we've had to modify our model. But today, we think that is the right long-term approach. Dan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thank you. William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Joshua M. Siber - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good morning. This is Josh on for Simeon. Just a question on gasoline prices. Are you seeing a noticeable pickup from lower prices? And then on the weather front, do you expect a pickup later on as a result of the colder weather right now? William T. Giles - CFO & Executive VP-Information Technology and ALLDATA : Yeah, it's always difficult to really measure with any precision on that. Clearly, the lower gas prices we believe have been helpful. And they certainty have probably contributed at some level to our comp, I don't think significantly, but they certainly have been helpful. So we try to weigh in all the things between gas and tax refunds, et cetera. From a maintenance perspective, we think that as we \u2013 obviously this has been a longer winter and it's dragging on, but clearly spring will be here hopefully in the next couple of weeks, and then we'll get back to our core maintenance categories and things like that. And we expect those businesses to perform well. So we'll have to get a little bit further down the road to look in the rearview mirror to see exactly what the impacts are of gas and whether. But we expect it to be favorable in the spring. Simeon Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey. It's Simeon. If I can just ask one follow-up. Can you \u2013 I don't know if anyone asked this, so I apologize if it's redundant. The loyalty card, can you talk about how helpful it's been to sales? Have you've been tracking it in terms of sign-ups, in terms of wallet share, in terms of driving traffic? William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes, Simeon. As you know, I guess we launched the first part of the loyalty program nine or 10 years ago, and then we took it to the digital program probably seven years ago. This past year, we used to have different programs in different parts of the country. This past year, we went to one consolidated nationwide program, and the program has worked very well since the beginning. It continues to work well and it's growing, although it's growing at a lower rate just because it's more mature. Now there have been two of our competitors that have launched loyalty programs in the last year or so, but both are different than ours. So far, we continue to be very help happy with our loyalty program and we continue to grow. We haven't seen material changes in our loyalty acceptance rate versus where we were before. Simeon Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Nice quarter. Thanks. William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Good morning. William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Morning. Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Can we take a step back and just think a little bit more about the long-term financial model? You continue to expect mid-single EBIT growth or better, but it seems like you're investing a little bit more capital in DCs and whatnot, and some of these acquisitions. So longer term, should we expect ROIC to continue to decline? Or is it going to be stable? How do you think about that? William T. Giles - CFO & Executive VP-Information Technology and ALLDATA : The way we really think about it is that, and as Bill, I think, highlighted in his remarks, we're very proud of the ROIC number that we have. And we recognize that it's probably one of the highest in hardline retail. At the same time, we're very focused on investing in the initiatives that we believe will generate very strong returns and more importantly will capture market share and grow earnings. So I think as we look at the model on a longer-term basis that we'll focus on those kinds of initiatives and they may or may not have some pressure on ROIC and bring it down a little bit. But again, we're focused on growing operating profit dollars, capturing market share and investing in activities that generate very strong returns. William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, can I add to that too? If we held ourselves to a standard where we wouldn't make investments unless they were at 32% return on invested capital, we wouldn't do a lot of things that would be very important to our business and would frankly put ourselves at a competitive disadvantage. That's why we've held to this long-term internal hurdle rate and it's worked very well. Remember when we implemented the internal hurdle rate, our ROIC was around 20%, so we've been able to grow it over time by being very disciplined, but at the same time, we can't hold single initiatives to a 30%-plus return. Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: That makes perfect sense. If you look at the portfolio of initiatives you have right now, how do you think about them in a rank order in terms of the ROIC potential, whether it be IMC, whether it be delivery frequency, mega hubs, inventory additions, et cetera? William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I would say the first and foremost biggest short-term to medium-term opportunity is just growing the Commercial business. It's a very low capital required to grow that business, so anything that we can do, enhance our sales force, continue to improve our execution, that is by far and away the single biggest way to drive ROIC. I think most of the other initiatives, based upon our modeling today, would be slightly dilutive to return on invested capital, but they have very good returns and they're going to accelerate the growth of operating profit dollars, which is one of our objectives. Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Got it. Thanks a lot, guys, and good luck. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan. Mark A. Becks - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. It's actually Mark Becks on for Chris. I just wanted to sharpen the pencil on the trend. You mentioned your core business was up 200 basis points on a two-year rolling basis. Outside of the 50 basis point contribution from tax refunds, is it safe to say the remainder is what you view as sustainable? I guess I'm just trying to get a sense of how you view the underlying growth rate of the industry versus potential share gains in the moving pieces with gas and whether. William T. Giles - CFO & Executive VP-Information Technology and ALLDATA : Yeah, I think that well, first of all, I think to some extent, gas is probably a more longer-term one. I mean obviously, we're going to get some increases in gas prices. But on a relative basis, they will be well below last year. And I suspect that they will continue to be so for at least the immediate future. Relative to tax refunds, you're right. As we called out, we think that maybe that was 100 basis points of impact on Q2. We'll have a better feel for that as we move our way through Q3. And then excluding that, I think that the way we look at it is that that really is the underlying core trends of the business. Mark A. Becks - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. If I look at DIY, historically it's been kind of a 1%, 2% growth business, and obviously that's with the benefit inflation which you're not seeing right now. Is there anything structurally changing with the industry, or are maybe your thoughts on just the outlook for the Retail business in general? William T. Giles - CFO & Executive VP-Information Technology and ALLDATA : I don't think that we see anything necessarily structurally changing in the business. If you look at the competitive landscape from a pricing, promotional activity, even from a capital investment perspective, it continues to be pretty consistent and rational industry overall, and you are right. We have not been the beneficiary of inflation over the last, almost at this point I'd say 18 plus months, maybe pushing 24 months, and it doesn't appear as though there's a lot of inflation in the horizon either. There's a couple of categories here and there that have some inflation, but for the most part, we've been generating these sales out of a no inflation kind of environment. So it really is the strength of the customer, the strength of our offering that was really driving that. Mark A. Becks - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. And then a follow-up to Alan's question on the expanded daily delivery frequency, your 10% of your stores now, if you were to flip the switch and roll it out to a greater number, is there anything in terms of a particular stretch that you'd be able to do to add to a greater number of stores? Or how would you think about the timing of that growth? William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I think it's still yet to be determined. We just went over and implemented 300 stores. Obviously, that's the biggest thing that we've done at this point in time. We did it over about three weeks, and so far, it's gone pretty well, but there have to be a tremendous amount of efforts in the distribution centers to ramp up for that increase of activity both inside the warehouse and in the transportation team. So we'll learn from this newest rollout and will plan for future wins, but more importantly now we got about 500 stores on the program and we are hopeful that we can quickly confirm our expectations today. Mark A. Becks - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And one quick follow-up to that. Given the potential for increased CapEx, should you continue to roll this out, do you think that would meaningfully alter your philosophy on share buybacks going forward? William T. Giles - CFO & Executive VP-Information Technology and ALLDATA : It won't alter our philosophy at all. I mean we believe that it is a great way to add value back to our shareholders and return capital back to the shareholders through the share repurchase program. We've been very disciplined about it. We operate at a very defined credit metric and will continue to do so. Mark A. Becks - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Best of luck. William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks. William T. Giles - CFO & Executive VP-Information Technology and ALLDATA : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Greg S. Melich - Evercore ISI : Hi, thanks. I had two questions. First was, how many stores now have the extended IMC inventory? So I think it was the 300 with the added inventory, but how many of those, or is it a different group that had the IMC? William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : A different group. It's under 10. Greg S. Melich - Evercore ISI : It's just a handful. William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, we've been doing this for six weeks or seven weeks so far, Greg. And we did a lot of work around the systems piece, but even now at this point in time, we're muscling it. We're just trying to get a sense for it. So far we've been really encouraged. Greg S. Melich - Evercore ISI : Very early days. Okay. So then switching to CapEx and cash flow a little bit, if my math is right, you'll be opening or doing 100 Commercial programs each of the next two quarters? William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, roughly. William T. Giles - CFO & Executive VP-Information Technology and ALLDATA : That's about right, yeah. Greg S. Melich - Evercore ISI : And then with given everything that you've talked about, what's sort of CapEx run rate? Should we look at the last six months as sort of a normal thing now to get all the initiatives done that you've talked about? William T. Giles - CFO & Executive VP-Information Technology and ALLDATA : I would say it's probably about that. We're certainly going to be right around about a $500 million number or so, I think, on an annualized basis. So it'll be a little bit of a step-up, but not significantly. Greg S. Melich - Evercore ISI : And on the AP to inventory ratio, it seems like that came down. Was there any sort of timing issues there? Or again, just given everything you're doing on inventory that could be \u2013 we might see that effect kind of stick around for a little bit? William T. Giles - CFO & Executive VP-Information Technology and ALLDATA : I think the latter. I think that hopefully we were somewhat consistent two or three quarters ago when we began to add more inventory, and we tried to call out that that will put a little bit of pressure on AP to inventory when you fast-forward three quarters or four quarters, and here we are. So it was certainly down this quarter. We don't anticipate it going down further, necessarily, for the next two quarters, but expect it to hang around that kind of number. Greg S. Melich - Evercore ISI : Great. Good job. Good luck, guys. William T. Giles - CFO & Executive VP-Information Technology and ALLDATA : Thanks. William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Chandni Luthra - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi, guys. Nice quarter, this is Chandni Luthra on behalf of Matt Fassler. I just have two quick ones. Could you give us the contribution of IMC to your SG&A? William T. Giles - CFO & Executive VP-Information Technology and ALLDATA : I think we said that it was probably around 15 basis points. I would say all three of those categories that we identified accounted for about 45 basis points... Chandni Luthra - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Got it. And then just to get some clarity on the recent cold weather, particularly Northeast region. Did it help? And what we're trying to basically gauge is, would the Northeast results have been any worse without the cold snap? William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Are you talking about the most recent cold snap? They weren't... Chandni Luthra - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yes. I mean basically the last month or so. William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. So about half of that was in our results. But remember, the cold snaps \u2013 as you get later in the winter, the cold snaps are more of a headwind than they are a benefit. Early in the season, it spurs activity of people trying to get their vehicles ready for the winter. What happens late in the winter, most of the parts that were going to fail have already failed, and frankly customers have winter fatigue and they're not doing things getting ready for the winter. So they're generally not beneficial later in the year or later in the season as they are (56:59). Chandni Luthra - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Okay. Thank you. William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes the question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Rhodes for any closing comments. William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Right. Before we conclude the call, I'd like to take a moment to reiterate that we have a long and strong heritage of consistent impressive performance. While we are excited about our growth prospects for the year, we will not take anything for granted as we understand our customers have choices. We have a solid plan to succeed this fiscal year, but I want to stress this is a marathon and not a sprint. As we continue to focus on the basics and focus on optimizing long-term shareholder value, we are confident AutoZone will continue to be very successful. Thank you for participating in today's call. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's conference. Thank you for joining. You may disconnect at this time.",

Operator : I would now like to turn the meeting over to Mr. Bill Rhodes. Sir, you may begin. William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning and thank you for joining us today for AutoZone's 2015 third quarter conference call. With me today are Bill Giles, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer IT and ALLDATA and Brian Campbell, Vice President-Treasurer (sic) [Vice President-Treasury], Investor Relations and Tax. Regarding the third quarter, I hope you've had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not, the press release, along with slides complementing our comments today, is available on our website www.autozoneinc.com. Please click on quarterly earnings conference calls to see them. To begin this morning, I want to thank all AutoZoners for delivering another solid quarter. Our primary focus this quarter was to continue and expand our different delivery models, open two additional mega hub stores and closely monitor the performance of these ongoing tests. We've made good progress on these tests and now have just over 900 stores receiving increased deliveries intra-week or 18% of our domestic store base and we now have four mega hubs in operation. In recent years, we've diversified our portfolio somewhat with an emphasis on building additional legs of growth for the future. Our retail domestic business, which generates approximately 70% of our revenues, performed well in Q3 and while our growth slowed modestly from last quarter, we continue to see opportunities for future growth in both store count and same store sales. Secondly, our commercial domestic business, which has been growing sales by double-digits since 2010, continued its growth in Q3 and continues to represent a significant opportunity for us. Regarding our international operations, we've been doing business in Mexico since late 1998 and our model has proven to work quite well. In Brazil, we opened two additional locations and our sales continued to grow nicely. As with other international companies, the strengthening dollar has negatively impacted our U.S. dollar earnings from these operations recently. Even with this volatility, we're comfortable continuing to open stores at our current pace. Our Internet businesses AutoZone.com and AutoAnything continue to grow well, generally consistent with our expectations. ALLDATA, which is the leading diagnostic and repair information business in the United States, continues to perform well. However, that business is more mature and coupled with increased competition has experienced more nominal growth. And finally, IMC, an imports parts specialist that we acquired last fall, continued with its integration process where we're working to expand their footprint of branches and where we're working to leverage their inventory assortment across the AutoZone domestic store base. This past quarter, our U.S. retail business expanded with the opening of 27 net new stores. We also opened 72 net new commercial programs. We've a commercial program in 79% of our domestic stores having opened approximately 750 new programs in just the past two years. Additionally, we opened seven stores in Mexico during the quarter. In Brazil, we opened two additional stores and operated seven stores at the end of the quarter. We expect to open a couple of additional stores over the next few months. We currently have 8% of our total stores outside of the United States. We believe we have growth opportunities on a variety of fronts in the U.S. and outside the U.S. for many years to come. The cadence of sales this quarter showed much weaker performance at the beginning of the quarter, offset by stronger performance during the last two reporting periods. These results were not unexpected to us. If you recall, during our conference call last quarter, we discussed how income tax refunds were issued earlier this year, following in the last two weeks of the second quarter. We believe approximately 100 basis points of same store sales were pulled forward, which benefited our 3.6% reported comp last quarter. After the tax refund cadence normalized, our sales results improved as expected. Regarding merchandise categories, our failure categories continued to do well, outpacing both maintenance and discretionary categories. This was opposite of last quarter and a little unique considering we were hoping the lower gas prices at the pump, coupled with the spring season, would lead to accelerating growth. Our belief is that the late winter storms in the first few weeks of the quarter coupled with accelerated tax refunds led to a later start to the spring maintenance season. Regarding regional performance, the west and the east did a little better than the central part of the country. Much of this can be attributed to the precipitation we experienced in these areas. We felt we finished the quarter in good shape to start our summer selling season with our stores looking great and our inventory assortment better than it's ever been. I should say one last thing regarding the income tax refund discussion I mentioned earlier. From a report issued by the Treasury Department, the amount of refund dollars were just about identical with last year's totals. However, it was the pronounced shift to initiating refunds two weeks earlier this year that was new. We believe this was the large reason for the start of our quarter being a little weaker and we believe our last quarter sales represented more normalized levels. Overall, we were pleased with our sales performance in Q3 and we're optimistic about the sales environment heading into our fourth quarter. Inventory levels increased over last year's Q3, approximately 6% on a per-location basis. This was in line with our expectations, as we have implemented several tactics over the past year to improve our hard parts coverage and to place inventory closer to our customers. We anticipate that inventory levels will remain relatively flat in Q4. Additionally, the IMC acquisition has increased our inventory per store across the chain by about $13,000. IMC branches carry approximately 10 times the inventory per location that an average AutoZone store carries, but their sales volumes on a per-location basis are materially higher as well. As we discussed on the last several quarterly calls, we have several initiatives to improve our inventory coverage and our ability to say yes to our customers both retail and commercial more frequently. We're continuing to expand our initiative around replenishing stores on a more frequent basis from our distribution centers. Traditionally, the vast majority of our stores were replenished once per week. At the end of the quarter, we had more than 500 stores that were being replenished between three times and five times a week, the majority of which began in Q3. Based on our results to-date and to provide us with additional data to determine our long-term strategy, we added more than 350 additional stores to this program in just the last few weeks. This brings our total store count of stores receiving additional deliveries per week to well over 900 stores. We are seeing a lift in sales. However, we have yet to definitively determine the ultimate benefit, nor we determine the optimal frequency. So consistent with past test and given the magnitude of change, we will methodically test and carefully measure our results. In order to replenish our stores on a more frequent basis, it will require increased operating expenses and capital expenditures, primarily for two to three additional distribution centers. Our modeling to-date based on current results indicates that while it is dilutive to gross and operating margins, it is sufficiently additive to operating profit dollars over the long-term. We've been pleased with our learnings to-date and are encouraged to continue to expand more stores under the program to better evaluate our results. Additionally, I want to update you on our mega hub stores. As a reminder, our stores are supported by approximately 173 hub stores with an expanded assortment. While our traditional hub store carries between 35,000 SKUs and 50,000 SKUs, our mega hubs typically more than double the hub stores' SKU assortment. With these substantially expanded product assortments, our mega hubs leverage those increased product assortments across other hub networks, providing stores across a very large geography access to this broad assortment. Along with the two older locations, we opened two additional mega hubs this past quarter. We're planning on opening one additional mega hub location in the fourth quarter. Based on our results to-date, we've begun to identify the next set of mega hub locations and are in various stages of developing these stores. Assuming our findings are confirmed by the more recent mega hub openings, we will develop a long-term strategy to roll out these mega hubs to provide service to the majority of our domestic stores. All of our inventory availability initiatives are designed to significantly increase our ability to meet our customers' needs. As our commercial business has grown and as our aspirations for this business are quite high and our DIY customers' needs increase, our need for expanded assortments of quality products at the right price continues. This has been important and difficult work and I want to stress we are still learning. While we are encouraged by these initiatives, before moving more aggressively, we need to have solid evidence of the long-term ramifications to our business and we need to ensure these initiatives are the appropriate course of action. At this point, we are encouraged with our findings, but there are examples of inconsistent performance between markets and initiatives and we need more time and more test results to determine our ultimate strategy. Lastly, around our inventory initiatives, we're in the early stages of expanding our direct import capabilities. Although we currently have an active program, we believe that it can be significantly expanded by developing more internal capabilities. We've completed significant research and have now developed a new global sourcing strategy and that strategy which includes opening our first offshore sourcing office is in the implementation phase. Now, I'll take a moment to discuss our recently completed acquisition of Interamerican Motor Corporation doing business in the marketplace as IMC. IMC is the second largest distributor of OE quality import replacement parts in the United States. They specialize in parts coverage for European and Asian cars. While considerably smaller than the number one participant in the industry, IMC now with 18 branches offers an impressive growth opportunity for us, not just because of the parts coverage, but also because of the strong management team. While it's still early in the process, I will mention our plans include opening more IMC branches and incorporating their parts catalog into our AutoZone Z-net parts catalog. We will continue to go to market as IMC and we expect to open several new IMC locations over the next 12 months. We acquired IMC in September and the rate of integration and expansion has been encouraging to-date. Thus far, we've made the IMC catalog available to over 500 AutoZone locations. While many of these 500 locations recently added the ordering capabilities from IMC, we've seen a sales lift in these stores' commercial sales programs that encourages us that our assumptions on the sales lift to AutoZone from cross-selling were correct, if not even conservative. Additionally, IMC added one new branch and several others are in the development pipeline. Finally, we relocated the IMC East Coast distribution center, which allows greater access to more sizeable markets. Let me stress, the IMC brand is very important to us. We will grow the brand and its presence in the future in many more markets than it is in today. IMC has been in a growth mode recently and has built an infrastructure to support a substantially larger footprint. It currently doesn't enjoy the operating margins that we experienced. So it lowers our overall EBIT margins by approximately 40 basis points on an annual basis. We're very excited to have the great IMC team as part of our organization and we're very optimistic about our future together. We continue to see synergies moving forward. Now, let's turn to our third quarter overall results. Our sales increased 6.5% and our domestic same store sales were up 2.3%. Both retail and commercial experienced positive same store sales growth. While our same store sales were negative the first few weeks of the quarter, due in our belief mainly to a shift in the income tax refunds, the remaining weeks improved. That consistency was across all regions of the country. We believe we continue to benefit from macro tailwinds, our work on inventory availability initiatives and solid execution. Regarding traffic versus ticket in the DIY business, traffic was negative, while ticket was positive. In line with weekly sales performance, our traffic accelerated at the end of the quarter versus the beginning. Our average ticket grew generally consistent with the first and second quarters when it returned to more normalized levels after about a year of subdued growth. The hard parts additions we've added to our stores have helped ticket growth. While improvements in product quality have pressured traffic over the last couple of decades, the technology advancements have significantly increased the price of the products we sell. We've been managing through this phenomenon as mentioned for over two decades, and expect to continue to do so. We opened 72 new commercial programs in the quarter versus 137 programs in the comparable period last year. We now have the commercial program in 79% of our domestic store base. Our commercial sales excluding IMC were up 11.4% this quarter. While our productivity per program was nicely positive, it did not increase as much as last quarter. Much like our retail business, our commercial business did slow in the first few weeks of the quarter, but finished more in line with our expectations. We've intensified our focus on mature program growth, and specifically, mature customer growth, and it was encouraging to see the improvements that began in Q1 and Q2 continue into Q3, although those improvements were muted in the first few weeks of the quarter as well. Finally, our older programs, those greater than five years old, continued to grow in the mid single-digit range. Regarding Mexico, we opened seven stores this quarter and we added two stores in Brazil. Sales in our other businesses for the quarter were up 6.5% over last year's third quarter. As a reminder, ALLDATA and e-commerce, which include AutoZone.com and AutoAnything, make up this segment of sales. Regarding online sales, there continued to be great opportunities for growth on both a business-to-business basis and to individual customers or B-to-C. While these businesses are small for us at just 4% of our total sales mix on the quarter, we're seeing these businesses grow at a faster rate than our brick-and-mortar businesses. With the continued aging of the car population and with gas prices on average down materially year-over-year for the third quarter, miles driven increased 3.9% year-to-date through February. Declining prices at the pump have benefited our customers, especially those most financially stressed (17:57). The lower end customer benefits the most from lower gas prices relative to income. This trend is encouraging, but we understand this is just one of many factors that impact our business. While gas prices have increased more recently, prices are still around $1 a gallon below last year. Our operating theme for 2015 is Wow! Every Customer Everywhere, and our key priorities for the year are great people providing great service, profitably growing our commercial business, leveraging the Internet, leveraging technology to improve the customer experience while optimizing efficiencies, and finally, improving inventory availability. On the retail front last quarter, under the great people providing great service theme, we continued with our intense focus on improving execution. Along with improvements to our product assortment, we're incorporating more product content and information to help our store AutoZoners provide trustworthy advice. Delivering product quality, features and benefits content through training and in Z-net continues to be a major effort for us at the store level. Behind the scenes, we continue to increase our technology investments and challenge ourselves to make sure our offerings are relevant across all shopping platforms. We realize as customers have become much more tech and mobile savvy, we have to have a sales proposition that supports all the ways they desire to connect with us. It is imperative we continue to invest in both current and future technologies in order to drive sales growth across all of our businesses. Over time, we will update you on the rollout of these technologies and how they help us interact with our customers and their vehicles more effectively. As our competition continues to innovate, we understand our ability to both maintain and gain market share will require us to have great-looking stores, higher in-stock levels, and most importantly, more knowledgeable AutoZoners to help customers than even what is available today. While we are gaining share, we need to be even better. The biggest link to all of this is our people. As you have to have the right merchandise at the right price in great looking convenience stores, real differentiation comes from our AutoZoners meeting and exceeding our customers' wants, needs and desires. Our AutoZoners are the most valuable asset we have in differentiating us in the eyes of our customers. In regards to commercial, we opened 72 programs during the quarter and 162 programs year-to-date. As we expect to open approximately 300 programs this year versus 424 programs last year, we will have a busy fourth quarter. We're on track thus far. As we continue to improve our product assortments and availability and as we make other refinements to our offerings, we expect that our sales growth potential will continue to increase. Our results continue to provide us with confidence to be aggressive in adding additional resources and new programs to this important growth initiative. We should also highlight another strong performance and return on invested capital. As we were able to finish Q3 at 31.1%, we're very pleased with this metric, as it is one of the best, if not the best, in all of hardlines retailing. However, our primary focus has been and continues to be that we ensure every incremental dollar of capital that we deploy in this business provides an acceptable return well in excess of our cost of capital. It is important to reinforce that we will always maintain our diligence regarding capital stewardship, as the capital we invest is our investors' capital. Before I pass the discussion over to Bill Giles to talk about our financial results, I'd like to recognize and thank every AutoZoner for this past quarter's effort to provide Wow! customer service to all of our customers. Now, here's Bill. William T. Giles - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President\u2013Finance, Information Technology and ALLDATA : Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everyone. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to talk more specifically about our retail, commercial and international results. For the quarter, total auto parts sales, which includes our domestic retail and commercial businesses, IMC, our Mexico stores and our seven stores in Brazil, increased 6.5%. And regarding macro trends during the quarter, nationally, unleaded gas prices started out at $2.27 a gallon and ended the quarter at $2.69 a gallon, a $0.42 increase. And last year, gas prices increased $0.29 per gallon during the quarter, starting at $3.38 and ending at $3.67 a gallon. We continue to believe gas prices have a real impact on our customers' ability to maintain their vehicles, and as cost reductions help all Americans, we hope to benefit from some increase in disposable income. We also recognized that the impact of miles driven on cars over 10 years old, the current average is much different than on newer cars in terms of wear and tear. Miles driven increased 4.9% in January and 2.8% in February. We don't have March or April data yet. The other statistic we highlight is the number of seven-year and older vehicles on the road, which continues to trend in our industry's favor. For the trailing four quarters, total sales per AutoZone store were $1,761,000. This statistic continued to set the pace for the rest of the industry. For the quarter, total commercial sales increased 11.4%. Commercial represented 18% of our total sales compared to 17% last year and grew $46 million over last year's Q3, an almost identical dollar growth to last quarter's $47 million improvement. We opened 72 new programs during the quarter versus 137 programs opened in our third quarter of last fiscal year; we now have our commercial program in 4,007 stores supported by 173 hub stores. Approximately 1,100 of our programs are three years old or younger. As Bill had mentioned earlier, both our total commercial sales and sales per program accelerated from the previous quarter's results. While productivity per program is lower than several of our peers, we have a much younger program base. Being able to increase sales approximately $50 million for the quarter year-over-year is allowing us to close that sales gap. Our focus is on growing market share and improving our service levels by having more programs closer to our customers, and we are consistently making progress. Looking specifically at mature programs, those at least five years old, they grew in the mid single-digit range this past quarter, slightly slower than last quarter. However, the first few weeks of the quarter for commercial were muting our productivity growth. Additionally, we still have significant opportunities to open additional programs over the next several years. In summary, we remain committed to our long-term growth strategy. We believe the improvements we have made and upcoming additional improvements from our inventory availability initiatives enhanced our prospects, and we believe the addition of IMC will provide us with more avenues to service our commercial customers very effectively. We believe we are well-positioned to grow this business and capture increased market share. Our Mexico stores continue to perform well. We opened seven new stores during the third quarter. We currently have 418 stores in Mexico. As the U.S. dollar strengthened this past quarter, we did have an FX conversion headwind. However, we still delivered a solid U.S. dollar equivalent EBIT result and felt good about being able to handle the currency weakening in regard to the overall impact of the company's results. We expect to open a similar number of stores in Mexico this fiscal year that we opened last year, about 40 stores. Our returns and profit growth continue to be in line with our expectations. Regarding Brazil, we opened two new stores and now have seven total locations. We are committed to our prudent pace of development, customers are embracing our offering, and sales results continue to climb. While still not profitable, we're beginning to close the gap. While it is easy to envision several hundred stores in Brazil over time, currently, our strategy is to open a few more stores over the next several months and then refine our offerings and prove that our concept works for our customers and is financially viable. Once we refine our offerings and operations and evaluate the performance, we will provide you with an update on our long-term growth plans. Recapping this past quarter's performance for the company, in total, our sales were $2.493 billion, an increase of 6.5%. Domestic same store sales or sales for stores opened more than one year were up 2.3% for the quarter. Gross margin for the quarter was 52.3% of sales, up 29 basis points. The improvement in gross margin was attributable to higher merchandise margins, partially offset by the impact from Interamerican Motor Corporation, which was acquired during September of 2014. Looking forward, we continue to believe there remains opportunity for merchandise gross margin expansion within both the retail and commercial businesses. The pressure we will experience from the IMC business along with the rollout of further stores and more frequent deliveries from our distribution centers will continue to cause headwinds to overall gross margin rate. Our primary focus remains growing absolute gross profit dollars in our total auto parts segment. SG&A for the quarter was 31.64% of sales, 12 basis points higher than last year's third quarter. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of sales was primarily due to the impact from the IMC acquisition. While we have invested in several key initiatives that are customer service related, like training and systems upgrades, we believe we are well-positioned to manage our cost structure in response to our sales environment. EBIT for the quarter was $514 million, up 7.3% over last year's third quarter. Our EBIT margin was up 16 basis points at 20.6%. Interest expense for the quarter was $31.8 million compared with $36.2 million in Q3 a year ago. Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $4.533 billion or approximately $160 million more than last year's balance of $4.378 billion. Our adjusted debt level metric finished the quarter at 2.5 times EBITDAR. While in any given quarter we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on management's opinion regarding debt and equity market conditions, we remain committed to both our investment-grade rating and our capital allocation strategy; and share repurchases are an important element of that strategy. For the quarter, our tax rate was approximately 35.9% above last year's third quarter. We expect our annual rate to be closer to 36.5% on an ongoing basis. Net income for the quarter was $309 million, up 8.4%. Our diluted share count of 32.3 million was down 4.2% from last year's third quarter. The combination of these factors drove earnings per share for the quarter to $9.57, up 13.1% over the prior year's third quarter. Relating to the cash flow statement, for the third fiscal quarter, our operating cash flow was $523 million. Net fixed assets were up 7.3% versus last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $107 million and reflected the additional expenditures required to open 37 new stores this quarter, capital expenditures on existing stores, hub store remodels, work on development of new stores for upcoming quarters and information technology investments. With the new stores opened, we finished this past quarter with 5,069 stores in 49 states, District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, 418 stores in Mexico, 18 IMC branches and seven stores in Brazil for a total location count of 5,512. Depreciation totaled $62.3 million for the quarter versus last year's third quarter expense of $58 million. This is in line with recent quarter growth rates. With our excess cash flow, we repurchased $515 million of AutoZone stock in the third quarter. At the end of the quarter, we have $778 million remaining under our share buyback authorization and our leverage metric was 2.5 times. Again, I want to stress, we managed appropriate credit ratings and not any one metric; the metric we report is meant as a guide only as each rating firm has its own criteria. We continue to view our share repurchase program as an attractive capital deployment strategy. Accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 110.9%. The inclusion of IMC reduced the AP ratio by about 174 basis points. Next, I'd like to update you on our inventory levels in total and on a per store basis. We reported an inventory balance of $3.5 billion, up 10.7% versus Q3 ending balance last year. Increased inventory reflects the recent IMC acquisition, new store growth and additional investments and coverage. Inventory per store was up 6% at $629,000 per location, reflecting our continued investments in hard parts coverage and the IMC acquisition. The increase in inventory per store this quarter due to the IMC acquisition was $12,700 per store. Finally, as Bill previously mentioned, our continued disciplined capital management approach resulted in return on invested capital for the trailing four quarters of 31.1%. We have and will continue to make investments that we believe will generate returns that significantly exceed our cost of capital. Now, I'll turn it back to Bill Rhodes. William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Bill. We are pleased this morning to report our 35th consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth, growing this quarter at a rate of 13.1%. Our company has continued to be successful over the long run. That success is attributable to our approach to leveraging our unique and powerful culture and focusing on the needs of our customers. At the end of the day, our customers have choices, and we must innovate to ensure they turn to us for their vehicle needs. We will continue to invest in our businesses and monitor the results from our ongoing inventory initiatives. As we have tested multiple delivery frequency models, financial results have been inconclusive as to which format makes the most sense. There are incremental costs to more frequent deliveries, and we have to make sure we develop the appropriate long-term solutions, because many of these additional costs will virtually become fixed costs. We are moving forward with our mega hub store concept. As you can see, we've got lots of exciting things going on. Along with our inventory assortment, our initiatives around commercial growth, Mexico, ALLDATA, e-commerce, Brazil and now IMC are all just getting started. Our long-term model is to grow new store square footage at a low single-digit growth rate, and we expect to continue growing our commercial business at an accelerated rate. Therefore, we look to routinely grow EBIT dollars in the mid single-digit range or better in times of strength. And we leverage our very strong and predictable cash flow to repurchase shares, enhancing our earnings per share growth into double-digits. We feel the track we're on will allow us to continue winning for the long-term. We believe our steady, consistent strategy is correct. It's the attention to details and consistent execution that will matter. Our belief this solid consistent strategy combined with superior execution is a formula for success. Our charge remains to optimize our performance regardless of market conditions and continue to ensure we're investing in the key initiatives that will drive our long-term performance. In the end, delivering strong EPS growth and ROIC each and every quarter is how we measure ourselves. We're pleased with our results this past quarter, but we must remain committed to delivering on our strategic and financial objectives. Now, we'd like to open up the call for questions. Operator : Our first question is from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Your line is open. Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Good morning. William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: My first question is around your mega hub strategy. It seems like you've developed more confidence in rolling out that strategy. Can you give us some more color on what kind of lift you're seeing from mega hubs? William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, first of all, Seth, thank you for the question. I want to be careful about giving out too much specific information, because we have two stores that have been on the program for a considerable amount of time. We just rolled the other two locations in the last eight weeks or so. I will tell you that those two locations are performing at or above our expectations so far, so they are helping us build our confidence level. But I don't want to get into specific sales performance indicators, because there is some variability between them and there's two of them that are just so new. But what I will tell you is we do have a higher degree of confidence in that, that's why we're going forward with looking for additional sites. And we are \u2013 it is certainly meeting or exceeding our financial expectations, which means it's meeting our internal rate of return or better. Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Got you. Good to hear. And then secondly, as it relates to IMC, you talked about the sales there meeting or exceeding expectations thus far. What kind of assumptions do have there for your cross-selling lift? And do you expect to maintain that type of cross-selling lift as you expand that to more stores that are further from the IMC branches? William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, it's going to be interesting over time and we're very early in this as well. We started with eight stores on the program and we've now up to over 500 stores, but many of those stores are very early in the process. I think what we're learning so far is the stores that are very close to IMC locations are going to outperform those that are farther away; and there's certainly a big amount of our stores, call it, half of them that can be touched by an IMC location today, but there's a bunch of them that would have to be serviced overnight. So it's really early. While we did have assumptions in our overall model and so far we're meeting or exceeding those assumptions, but we've got a long way to go. Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Got you. Thanks and good luck. William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : All right. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Dan Wewer with Raymond James. Your line is open. Dan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning, Bill. You talked about the variability and the results from the new initiatives. Does that reflect different levels of execution? Or is that just the inherent variability that AutoZone sees in a lot of its different businesses? William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : That's a terrific question, Dan. I would say it's not about execution. I've got to tell you, what our team has done to roll out over 900 stores on multiple deliveries per week and really just over two quarters is pretty remarkable. I guess there's 700 stores of them (38:00) just over the last couple of quarters is really remarkable. And while we're still learning how to do it better, they've almost flawlessly executed that, so hats off to all the team that's worked on that. One of the problems we have with this initiative is that we have elected to do many of the tests very close to the specific distribution centers. It's easier, it's cheaper, lot of other reasons, but because of that, we have very small geographies that \u2013 where these tests are focused on, and some of those geographies are going through different things in the marketplace that have nothing to do with delivery frequency. So we're seeing very different results in certain markets, and so that's why we keep expanding the test to try to broaden that slot so that we can make sure that we understand what the benefits of that are. Dan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And then just as a follow-up question, when you think about the benefits from the better parts coverage, do you think you're getting a bigger benefit from the multiple shipments per week from the distribution centers? I think those are focusing on the faster turning SKUs or do you think you're going to get a bigger lift from the slower turning SKUs that you're adding to the other mega hubs? William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, I would say we definitely get a bigger lift from the frequency of delivery test, which is focused on the SKUs that are in those local stores that are sorted there and making sure we have the right replenishment levels. However, the costs of that initiative are materially higher than they are on the mega hubs. Dan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. So a bigger sales lift but also higher expenses? William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : It's much higher expenses. Dan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. Great. Thank you. William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : All right. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from John Lawrence with Stephens, Inc. Your line is open. John R. Lawrence - Stephens, Inc.: Thank you and good morning, Bill. William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. John R. Lawrence - Stephens, Inc.: Would you comment a little bit about the global sourcing strategy. I know it's very early, but give us a sense of sort of that \u2013 the context of that process of using that type of strategy globally? William T. Giles - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President\u2013Finance, Information Technology and ALLDATA : Yeah, thanks, John. We obviously today import a fair amount of product directly ourselves today and we use third parties in order to help us do that. And we will continue to do so. But what we really want to do is to be able to put ourselves in a position to increase that fairly significant over the next several years. Though as Bill highlighted in his comments, our expectation as I said, we will put AutoZone resources overseas in a dedicated office that will allow us to be closer to the vendors and the manufacturers so that we can source with a broader net and improve our quality control, et cetera. So there's a lot of opportunities there on a long-term basis. John R. Lawrence - Stephens, Inc.: All right. Thanks. Good luck. Operator : Our next question is from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Simeon A. Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good morning. So a follow-up question on the mega hub and then how it relates to or how it fits into the puzzle of multiple delivery. Are you expanding them, meaning testing them so that the DC may not necessarily be the primary vehicle that's used for multiple delivery? And does the number of mega hubs mean that you won't have to use the DC as much? William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, let me go into a little bit more depth to make sure that we're articulating it appropriately. So think about a standard AutoZone store that carries 20,000 SKUs, 22,000 SKUs. When those SKUs are replenished, that replenishment today comes from the distribution center, and tomorrow, if our test proves successful, will still come from the distribution center, but will come three times or five times a week. When the SKU is not in that 22,000 SKU assortment, today, the AutoZoners in that store can go for that expanded assortment to a hub store, which will take the 22,000 SKUs up to 35,000 SKUs to 50,000 SKUs. Tomorrow, if the mega hub continues to work, if that hub store doesn't have it, they can reach out for another 30,000 SKUs, 40,000 SKUs to the mega hub store. So the increased frequency of delivery is all about replenishment, and the mega hub is all about increased access to additional parts coverage. Does that make sense? Simeon A. Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah, no, that's helpful. So my follow-up is you have \u2013 you said as of today, I think over 900 stores that are benefiting from some type of daily delivery. What's the timeframe, your best guess, is how long some of your tests will keep running? And then once you arrive at some formula, whether it's you decide certain stores will be two days, three days, five days or even once a week, will you turn this on all at once? Or what would hold you back from once you figure out the formula from turning on the rest of the chain all at once? William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : It's a fantastic question, which means I wish I could answer it and I can't. I would have thought we would have made this decision by now and would have articulated it to you. But some of our results have been inconclusive. And there's a lot of moving pieces here. And as we said in our prepared comments, this is a big decision, and we at AutoZone are pretty methodical in how we make decisions. This isn't about next year or year after, this is about the long-term and so we want to make sure we get it right. So we're going to take enough time to get it right. And then as far as rollouts, we've been pretty aggressive the last two quarters by rolling 350 stores, 400 stores onto this program. I don't know that we could go a lot faster than that. We might be able to as we get deeper into it, but it's not something that we would be able to roll out all at once, nor is it something we need to roll out all at once. I think you look at the way we've done things in the past, whether that was the commercial new model that we rolled out or the hub store initiatives that we rolled out, we like to get in a cadence, do it where it's digestible and where we can execute it at a very high level, so I suspect that's how we would roll it out. Simeon A. Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks. William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Bret Jordan with BB&T. Your line is open. Bret D. Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets : Hey. Good morning. William T. Giles - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President\u2013Finance, Information Technology and ALLDATA : Good morning. Bret D. Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets : A question on the global sourcing and I guess as you look at it, is this going to increase your penetration with the Duralast mix? And I guess what does it do to supply chain? Does it add inventory because you own inventory further into the supply chain? And I guess is the strategy to pick up better pricing? Or is it to have better management of products quality? William T. Giles - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President\u2013Finance, Information Technology and ALLDATA : I think probably better opportunity to source from a broader selection of manufacturers and vendors. It will have the opportunity to reduce pricing, because we'll be able to go direct in many circumstances. It likely will add a little bit of inventory just from the standpoint that you'll own it for a longer period of time in the process, but we believe obviously there's the savings that we will achieve from the acquisition costs will far outweigh those carrying costs. And then from a quality perspective, it probably has some opportunity to improve the quality although we feel really good about the quality of our product today that we import. So there's a little bit of opportunity there, but probably not as much. The real focus is going to be on the acquisition cost, getting closer to the vendors and the manufacturers and improving the profitability of the company. Bret D. Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets : Will Duralast as a percentage of the inventory increase in this process? Or is it largely stable just better sourcing? William T. Giles - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President\u2013Finance, Information Technology and ALLDATA : I would say that if Duralast increases as a percent of our total, it wouldn't be as a result of this initiative necessarily. It's more about sourcing. Bret D. Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets : Okay. And then one quick question on the e-commerce; you said it was growing faster than brick-and-mortar. Is that traffic-driven increases or is that ticket-driven increases? Are you seeing any price pressures out there from people like RockAuto or is the market pretty stable? William T. Giles - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President\u2013Finance, Information Technology and ALLDATA : The market is somewhat stable from an online, although it does continues to be somewhat promotional in nature. From our vantage point, it's really mostly traffic. And so, our traffic has continued to grow at double-digit kind of rates. So we've experienced good traffic and it's a great source of information for our end customers. Bret D. Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets : Okay. Thank you. I appreciate it. William T. Giles - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President\u2013Finance, Information Technology and ALLDATA : Okay. Operator : Our next question is from Aram Rubinson with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Aram H. Rubinson - Wolfe Research LLC : Hey, there, guys. Good morning. Two questions. The first one just about the capital structure, shares outstanding fell by 4.2% on a year-over-year basis, the lowest that I've seen at least in our model. Can you talk to us a little bit about the CapEx element that might be pressuring that? CapEx is higher as a percent of sales, but talk a little bit about where you think that might max out? And also whether or not it's making you think about things differently on the rent-to-own calculation when you're building out some new stores? Thanks. William T. Giles - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President\u2013Finance, Information Technology and ALLDATA : Yeah, just to kind of \u2013 if you don't mind me going backwards, it doesn't necessarily change our mind relative from a rent perspective. We're obviously going to continue to prefer to own where we have those opportunities, because we want to be in control of the asset and we think it's cheaper long-term. I would say from the 4% element, it is a little bit lower, but you've seen it come down a little bit over time. Some of that is stock price driven, and so the cash flow generation that we have has been relatively consistent and the stock price has gone up along with the P/E so it's had a little bit of a natural dilution effect, if you will, from that perspective. And from a CapEx perspective, it continues to be a little bit of an increase in CapEx. We had mentioned in previous calls it's likely that we would do an additional distribution center or two over the next couple of years, so that will have some additional usage of CapEx certainly not in the numbers today. And then AP to inventory ratio, which has been a big benefit for us over the past several years, has begun to moderate a little bit more. And so, as we have said before that our expectation is that our AP to inventory ratio will probably stay close to its current rate or a little better, but it won't have the significant increases that it experienced two years or three years ago. Does that help? Aram H. Rubinson - Wolfe Research LLC : Yeah, thanks. And just to follow-up the second question on the commercial, really, you've given us some statistics in terms of commercial penetration and growth. Can you give us some more subjective elements in terms of whether that you've got customer service scores or retention out rates or anything internally that you can help us to get a sense that you're qualitatively gaining traction there would be great. William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes. One of the things we talked about probably more extensively on the last call was at the beginning of this fiscal year, we made a shift. We've been opening a tremendous amount of stores over the last three years or four years on the commercial program. And with that, our sales with our mature programs and specifically, our mature customers, were not performing as well as we would have liked. So beginning kind of September 1, we really re-anchored our focus on those mature stores and mature customers, and we've turned the tide not I would say, marginally at this point in time, but probably more encouragingly than we would have thought. We still have a ways to go, but I think that is one of the key metrics that's on the forefront of what we were looking at. More subjectively, I'd just say you think back seven years, eight years ago, when we went to this new commercial strategy, our receptivity in the marketplace is just vastly different from people that we try to hire to customers that we go in and make sales calls. Think back eight years ago, we didn't have a sales force out telling our story. Now, we have a very robust and talented and well-trained sales force out there telling our story, and it's making a meaningful difference in the marketplace on their receptivity to us. Aram H. Rubinson - Wolfe Research LLC : And is it fair to say that the lift in sales that you're getting from the hubs and the mega hubs, is that all attributable to the commercial side of the house? William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : No, not at all. Not at all. It's probably slightly skewed to commercial, but it's also very robust on the retail side. Aram H. Rubinson - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Thanks so much. Have a good day. William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : All right. You too. Thanks. Operator : Our next question is from Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Matthew Jeremy Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks a lot. Good morning. William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Matt. Matthew Jeremy Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.: I want to ask another question on global sourcing and then a quick follow-up. Can you help us get a sense of the relative profitability of branded goods versus private label goods as they're currently sourced versus where you think having your own sourcing infrastructure overseas will take you? William T. Giles - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President\u2013Finance, Information Technology and ALLDATA : That's a good question, and my expectation is that the further we penetrate into the global sourcing, the narrower those numbers will get. But I suspect it's a few hundred basis points when you take everything into consideration. But you do have some additional cost, as we mentioned earlier, relative to owning the inventory for a longer period of time, and frankly, owning it end-to-end. So there are some offsets, but I would say that's probably a round number to use. Matthew Jeremy Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And if you think you're starting essentially at zero, how much penetration do you think you could ultimately achieve with your own sourcing infrastructure? And to some degree, would simply having an infrastructure in place be a good bargaining or negotiating tool for you to work with your costs with your current vendors? William T. Giles - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President\u2013Finance, Information Technology and ALLDATA : Yeah, I think the way to think about it is that we've started this journey a long time ago, and we do a fair amount of direct importing today. And so, it's not that we're starting from ground zero necessarily. The merchandising team has been working on this for a long time, and quite frankly, today, have done a great job of having a fair amount of direct importing. However, we think we can probably more than double what we're doing today and probably a little better than that over the next three years to five years. So we're kind of in the third or fourth innings, and working our way through. Matthew Jeremy Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.: My follow-up is on gas prices. And Bill Rhodes, you talked to the way the impact of gas played out kind of at a very high level versus expectations. I know it's hard to attribute sales to individual sources, but if you think about A, the discretionary products that would sell when people have more money in their pockets and B, the kind of products that ultimately get sold more of (53:25) due to miles driven going up, whether it's in chemicals perhaps or I guess wear and tear would take a while. Since gas prices have come down, if you could, not just restrict it to this past quarter, but the past seven months, eight months, can you talk about that journey and how is that all you think you've seen that impact the business? William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I think we've actually called it out on the last two specific discussions that we thought it was a net benefit. It's not 5% benefit, but in the 1% kind of range. This quarter, we didn't spend as much time on it, although I think it's beneficial with a slight increase. It's probably not as beneficial as it was the last quarter. The real story this quarter was all about our first period and first four weeks of the quarter, which were really, really tough, we expected them to be tough because of the 100 basis points that we mentioned last quarter we pulled forward. But then those late winter storms, particularly in the Deep South, just really muted our growth. Actually, we were down pretty significantly, so we were \u2013 that was the story of the quarter so the one we wanted to focus on in our remarks. Matthew Jeremy Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.: So the weather is kind of an additional factor above and beyond the tax issues, that perhaps was not anticipated? William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, and I would just say in those first few weeks, Matt, weather is always seasonal in the spring time. But we were \u2013 it was the third quarter here. We're sitting with six inches of snow in Memphis, Tennessee. That's not normal. Matthew Jeremy Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Understood. Thank you so much. William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : All right. Thank you. William T. Giles - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President\u2013Finance, Information Technology and ALLDATA : Thank you, Matt. Operator : Our next question is from Michael Lasser with UBS Investment. Your line is open. Michael Louis Lasser - UBS Investment Bank : Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Bill, I was hoping you could size (55:08) the potential opportunity from both the mega hubs store rollout as well as increasing the frequency of replenishment. So of that 22,000 SKUs that will see a benefit from the mega hub, are you missing out like 10% of the time? Or is it more like 20%? And then how would you size the increasing frequency of replenishment as well? William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I think it's difficult for us right now to continue to size it. Look, we're doing close to $1.8 million per store on an annual basis. These are not going to make that $2.5 million. We could maybe pick up $1,000, $1,500 per store per week over time if these initiatives work, but that's let's also remember the competitive landscape is not a stagnant place either. People \u2013 this whole industry is chasing parts coverage, parts availability and the ability to say yes, because our customers need it. As parts proliferation continues, it's become a greater and greater challenge and frankly, it's on the forefront of one of the ways we compete against each other. But I don't know that we can sit here and say here's what the numbers going to be because the landscape is going to change over time. Michael Louis Lasser - UBS Investment Bank : Does the sales increase all come from being able to say yes more often? Or is there some element where the parts pros, the folks in the stores feel a little bit more comfortable with what's available and then they can go out and sell the capabilities to the commercial relationships more aggressively? William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, you're talking about really a halo effect there, and clearly, the confidence of our sales team on the commercial side of our counter folks on the DIY side, that's certainly an element. But I would say the bigger element of it is, if a customer, specifically a commercial customer, is calling you six times or seven times a day, if they see a noticeable increase in the amount of times that you say yes, you're going to pick up more share with him. Conversely, if you're saying no more than your competitors said, then you're going to be challenged. So I think there certainly are halo effects. That's hard to see in the data and hard to estimate over what time that's going to happen, but we certainly think if there's an issue or a benefit there. Michael Louis Lasser - UBS Investment Bank : Okay. And then last question on this line is what's the downside? Can a store become overwhelmed with too much inventory? Or does the complexity become a little greater when there's more availability? Thank you very much. William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I think the downside is what's the cost to get that last sale. There is a lot of diminishing returns on putting inventory into locations. Why don't we put 50,000 SKUs into the local store? Well, because we can't afford to. That's why we have a hub store that will aggregate the demand of 30 stores or 40 stores. Same kind of issue with delivery frequency, there is a lot of diminishing returns, how much can you afford to get that last sale? Michael Louis Lasser - UBS Investment Bank : Okay. Thank you so much. William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : All right. Thank you. William C. Rhodes - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : All right. Before we conclude the call, I hope you had a nice Memorial Day weekend, and I look forward to updating you on our activities from the summer. While we're excited about our growth prospects for the year, we do not take things for granted, as we understand our customers have choices. Our competition is not standing still and we must continue to challenge ourselves to improve. We have a solid plan to succeed this fiscal year, but I want to stress this is a marathon, not a sprint. As we continue to focus on the basics and focus on optimizing long-term shareholder value, we're confident AutoZone will continue to be very successful. Thank you for participating in today's call, and have a great week. Operator : Thanks for participating in today's conference. All lines may disconnect at this time.",

Rhodes: Good morning and thank you for joining us today for AutoZone's 2015 fourth quarter conference call. With me today are Bill Giles, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer IT and ALLDATA and Brian Campbell, Vice President-Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax. Regarding the fourth quarter, I hope you've had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not, the press release, along with slides complementing our comments today, is available on our Web site www.autozoneinc.com. Please click on quarterly earnings conference calls to see them. To begin this morning, I want to thank all AutoZoners across the globe for another solid quarter and year. 2015 was a very busy and productive year for us. We continue to grow our business on a variety of front. Our U.S retail business expanded again in 2015 with the opening of another 157 net new stores. Our commercial business continues to gain traction growing sales 12.9% for the year with 296 net new programs open. We now have the commercial program in 81% of our domestic stores, having opened 720 new programs in just the past two years. And we continue to expand our presence in Mexico, where this quarter we celebrated the opening of our 441st store. While opening no additional stores in Brazil this quarter, we opened two for the year and now have seven stores in operation. Lastly, we opened three new IMC branches for the year. We\u2019ve a lot of runway to open future IMC location. We currently have approximately 90% of our total Company sales coming from our domestic AutoZone stores. We believe we have great growth opportunities inside and outside of the U.S for many years to come. In 2015, we expanded our online offerings in both our traditional autozone.com and autozonepro.com Web sites, as well as autoanything. ALLDATA also continued its expansion in the year. Along with these strategic investments, we spent a lot of time on initiatives to drive our core domestic retail business. DIY remains our number one priority. Our DIY business continues to grow, remains the largest portion of our sales, and continues to generate tremendous returns. We also see significant opportunities for new store growth and improved productivity in our existing stores. As our commercial business continues to grow and is intertwined with our retail business, we\u2019ve continued to identify opportunities to optimize our inventory placement and distribution strategy in order to respond to the ever increasing challenge of parts proliferation in the industry. Over the past two years, we implemented new methodologies to improve our hard parts placement techniques in all stores. We\u2019ve been testing more frequent deliveries to our stores and expanded parts availability in the mega hub stores. Additionally, we\u2019ve developed a new store prototype that significantly expands the hard parts holding capacity in our stores. All new stores are now opening with this new prototype and we remodeled 93 of our most constrained stores. These efforts have resulted in an increase in our store inventory levels. They\u2019ve also added incremental costs, but sales have justified our investments and offered convincing proof that we\u2019ve been on the right track. Along with improving our local parts availability and assortment, we continue to manage this organization to provide exceptional service for our customers, provide AutoZoners with a great place to work with opportunities for advancement, and ensure we do it on a profitable basis to provide strong returns for our shareholders. We will be holding our national sales meeting in Memphis next week. All week and again during my address to the team at the conclusion of the event, we\u2019re rededicating ourselves to live the pledge. Our pledge starts with always putting customers first and therefore we\u2019re always looking for ways to improve our model. As our product assortment continues to improve, we feel it is essentially to reinstill a passion to say yes, we\u2019ve got it to our customers needs. To this day, it surprises me how often we\u2019ve to say sorry, we don\u2019t have that available. Even with our new part additions too many customers leave our stores without their needs being met. In this spirit to help the customer we continue to make significant systems enhancements and to capture data about our customer shopping patterns across all of our platforms. We understand we have to be able to share information and process seamlessly between our customers, between our stores, commercial shops, phone, and online experiences in order to meet all of our customers need. Before getting into specifics on the fourth quarter, I\u2019d like to take a moment to go into detail on our inventory availability test. We\u2019ve concluded our test and determined the framework of our new supply chain strategy. Over the last couple of years, we\u2019ve been testing two specific new concepts, increase frequency of delivery to our stores, and significantly expanded parts assortments in select stores we call mega hubs. As both of these concepts are a material departure from our long standing successful strategy and both of them increase our fixed cost structure, we\u2019ve been patient. We wanted to ensure that the results we initially achieve were accurate and sustainable. The first test multiple deliveries per week focuses on improving our in-stock position in stores for regularly stocked SKUs. The plan was to replenish our stores from their respective distribution center more frequently. On the last quarter\u2019s call, we said a little over 900 of our 5,100 domestic stores were receiving either three or five times a week deliveries. This was up from the usual once a week delivery schedules we\u2019ve historically run. With approximately 21,000 SKUs in an average AutoZone store, we tested with increasing the replenishment frequency of these SKUs meant. Although our inventory turns at a relatively low rate around 1.5 times per year, the vast majority of our SKUs have an on hand quantity of one. Therefore, given the randomness of demand, there is potential for out of stock positions. There are clearly increased costs associated with delivering more frequently; however, the sales lift achieved from our tests have supported increasing the delivery frequency in the majority of the chain to either three times per week or five times per week, depending on certain parameters. It is important to note that our current plan do not contemplate providing this level of service to all stores. It just isn\u2019t currently economically viable everywhere.\u2019 Over the next 12 months, we expect to roll this increased frequency model to approximately at an additional 1,000 stores. We will begin this roll out in the first quarter. Roughly speaking, we\u2019re modeling a gross margin headwind from this initiative of approximately 25 basis points each quarter until we complete the roll out. It will take us a few years to roll out this new strategy. But once it is complete, we\u2019d expect roughly two thirds of our stores to have increased frequency of deliveries. As we implement this further, we will continue to monitor our performance and will further refine the stores on this program. The second test that we\u2019re rolling out is a mega hub store concept. We will open and/or expand another handful of mega hubs in 2016, increasing from our current count of five mega hubs. We are very excited about what the mega hubs can represent for us. We will open these locations over the back six months of our fiscal year. As a reminder, these super sized AutoZone stores carry between 80,000 to 100,000 unique SKUs, approximately twice what a hub store carries today. They provide coverage to both surrounding stores and other hub stores, multiple times a day or over -- on an overnight basis. Our sales results thus far in our open mega hubs are exceeding our expectations. We\u2019ve been pleasantly surprised to see the sales generated by the new unique SKU additions, lifting both our retail and commercial businesses. While there are incremental costs to these rollouts such as payroll and fuel to manage the extra deliveries to surrounding stores, we feel their cost deleverage is relatively modest. Our current assumption on this rollout is that we want to experience meaningful deleverage from this initiative in fiscal 2016. Currently five mega hubs support approximately 750 surrounding stores, and once built out we would expect to have a network of mega hubs in the neighborhood of 25 to 40 total locations. Like the weekly deliveries from our distribution centers, we expect to complete our mega hub expansion over the next few years. In order to support more frequent deliveries to new stores as well as the mega hubs, we expect to open two or three domestic distribution centers over the two or three years. For your modeling purposes each new distribution center is expected to cost between $40 million to $45 million. At present we\u2019re in the early stages of planning their openings and don\u2019t expect any distribution center to come online in early -- until early fiscal 2017. Fiscal 2016 will incur some capital and operating expenses related to development, but a larger portion of the capital we spend will be in fiscal 2017 and \u201918. We are very excited to have reached a conclusion on these strategic changes. We had a tremendous amount of AutoZoners who worked this extremely hard and with great discipline. Due to their incredible efforts and patience, we believe we\u2019ve identified the optimum approach for managing our supply chain. In recent years AutoZone has completed small acquisitions with AutoAnything and IMC. We currently expect our cash from investing in the business this upcoming year to look similar to this past year. Our capital investments are expected to offset the capital used in the acquisitions. To summarize our plans, we expect to rollout more frequent distribution center deliveries and more mega hub locations over the next few years. We also expect to open two or three new domestic distribution centers over this time. While our total use of capital will not be materially different than next year from this past, we do expect to incur an approximate 20 to 30 basis point gross margin headwind from these investments alone. This past fiscal year we faced headwinds to our gross margin and we were able to overcome them and post improvements in each of our quarters. We believe in fiscal 2016, we\u2019ve opportunities for improvement, but we remain cautious as we know we will experience more significant supply chain headwind. Now let\u2019s turn to our fourth quarter results. Our sales increased 7.9%. Our domestic same-store sales were up 4.5%. This quarter sales result were stronger towards the back half of our fiscal quarter than the beginning. While May was the weakest month of comp store performance, the comparison to the previous year\u2019s May was a contributor. May was quite strong the year before. The remaining months were very consistent. We attribute this to consistent weather across much of the country and steadily lower fuel prices. Regionally the Northeast and the Midwest performed slightly below our overall chain. However, these two markets were slightly better the year before. In regards to our three primary merchandised category splits, failure related, maintenance and discretionary, failure performed best followed closely in growth over the last year by maintenance and then discretionary. We attribute failure strength to more miles being driven across the country and failure occurring with the vehicle usage in addition to favorable weather. Both traffic and ticket were positive for our DIY and commercial businesses. We opened 134 new commercial programs in the quarter versus 113 last year. For the year we opened 296 net programs for the full-year reaching 81% of our domestic store base. While our sales grew 13% on the year, our programs opened grew by 8%. We are proud of our commercial results this year and as our programs continue to mature, we believe our future is bright. As part of our strategy on increasing inventory levels in local markets closer to our customers, this past quarter we opened three additional hub locations and now operate 176. As mentioned above regarding opening more mega hub location, we do expect to open more standard hub locations as well. Over time, we expect to operate as many as 200 to 225 stores as hubs. But that growth is expected over many years to come. Regarding Mexico, we opened 23 stores this quarter and now have 441 total locations. While Mexico\u2019s U.S dollar sales were below historic growth rates, we executed well, especially in light of the foreign currency headwinds experienced with the peso. Sales in our other businesses for the quarter were up 2% over last year. As a reminder, our ALLDATA and e-commerce businesses, which include autozone.com and autoanything, make up this segment of sales. Regarding online sales opportunities, there continued to be great opportunities for growth on both a business-to-business basis and to individual customers or B-to-C. These businesses are relatively small for us representing just 3.4% of our total sales mix on the quarter. Overall, we feel like we\u2019re well positioned in 2016 to improve on 2015s results. With the continued aging of the car population, as we continue to be optimistic regarding transfer our industry in both DIY and DIFM. As new vehicle sales are reaching all-time highs and gas prices on average are down year-over-year, miles driven continue to increase. The lowering customer benefits the most from lower gas prices relative to income. This trend is encouraging. I know with our new fiscal year upon us, many investors have asked about our expectations for 2016. For us, our second and third quarter results are more difficult comparison. However, we\u2019re optimistic we can grow in all of our upcoming quarters. While certain markets outperformed during the winter this past year, others underperformed. We believe we should improve in these regions. As our history has shown, we manage this business focusing on both short-term and long-term performance. And if we felt our sales would be challenged in the short-term due to difficult comparisons, we wouldn\u2019t make material changes to our plans or operations. We will continue to balance short-term and long-term performance, and will be keenly focused on delivering consistent strong performance and extending our streak of 36 consecutive quarters of double-digit EPS growth. However, with our delivery frequency initiatives along with expanding mega hubs, we will likely have some headwinds on our operating margin. Now let me review our highlights regarding execution of our operating theme for 2015. Wow! Every customer everywhere. The key priorities for the year were great people providing great service, profitably growing our commercial business, leveraging the internet, leveraging technology to improve the customer experience while optimizing efficiencies and improving availability. On the retail front this past quarter, under the great people providing great service theme, we continued with our intense focus on improving execution. We\u2019ve continually been upgrading our product content in both our electronic catalogue and online offerings. We\u2019ve also been focused on improving our mobile app to be relevant across our fastest growing online category. We\u2019ve been aggressive on our technology investments and believe these initiatives will help differentiate us on a go-forward basis. We believe or we realize as customers have become much more tech and mobile savvy, we have to have a sales proposition that touches all the ways they desire to interact with us. Our current and future technology investments will lead to sales growth across all our businesses. In regards to commercial, we opened 134 programs during the quarter. For the year, we opened 296 versus 424 last year. Our expectation is we will continue to open new programs and grow our percentage of stores with the commercial program, although our pace of growth will likely moderate. As we continue to improve our product assortments and availability and as we make other refinements to our offerings, we expect that the estimated sales potential from the market will grow. Our results continue to provide us confidence to be aggressive and adding additional resources and new programs to this important growth initiative. We should also highlight another strong performance in return on invested capital, as we were able to finish 2015 at 31.2%. We are very pleased with this metric and is -- its one of the best in all of hardline\u2019s retail. However, our primary focus has been and continues to be that we ensured every incremental dollar of capital that we deployed in this business provides an acceptable return, well in excess of our cost of capital. It is important to reinforce that we will always maintain our diligence regarding capital stewardship as the capital we invest is our investor\u2019s capital. Before I pass the discussion over to Bill Giles to talk about our financial results, I'd like to thank and reinforce how proud we\u2019re of our entire organizations efforts to manage the business appropriately and prudently. We have an amazing team and our initiatives for 2016 are very exciting. With our ongoing supply chain initiatives as well as new store openings, we\u2019re ready to continue to provide Wow! Customer service to all of our customers and we\u2019re ready to continue to prudently manage our cost structure providing our shareholders with the consistency we\u2019ve exhibited in the past. Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Bill Giles. William T. Giles: Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everyone. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to talk more specifically about our retail, commercial and international results for the quarter. For the quarter total auto parts sales, which includes our domestic retail and commercial businesses, our Mexico and Brazil stores and our 20 IMC branches, increased 8.1%. Now switching to macro trends during the quarter, nationally unleaded gas prices started out at $2.69 a gallon and ended the quarter at $2.51 a gallon, an $0.18 decrease. Last year, gas prices decreased $0.21 per gallon during the fourth quarter, starting at $3.67 and ending at $3.46 a gallon. We continue to believe gas prices have a real impact on our customers' ability to maintain their vehicles, and cost reductions help all Americans, we hope to continue to benefit from this increase in disposable income. We also recognized that the impact of miles driven on cars over 10 years old, the current average is much different than on newer cars in terms of wear and tear. Miles driven increased 2.6% in May and 3.9% in June. We don't have July or August data yet. The other statistic we highlight is the number of seven-year and older vehicles on the road, which continues to trend in our industry\u2019s favor. For the trailing four quarters, total sales per AutoZone store were $1,761,000. This statistic continued to set the pace for the rest of the industry. Now for the quarter, total commercial sales increased 13.1%. In the fourth quarter commercial represented 18% of our total sales and grew $70 million over last year's Q4. This past quarter we opened a 134 new programs versus 113 programs opened in our fourth quarter of last fiscal year. We now have our commercial program in 4,141 stores supported by 176 hub stores. Approximately 1,100 of our programs are three years old or younger. Let me take a moment discuss our commercial program performance while our average weekly sales per program for the full-year were below some peers in our industry had $8,800, our productivity continues to improve. It\u2019s important to highlight that we accelerated our new program growth over the past few years, as approximately 26% of our programs are younger than three years old. These openings have impacted our average sales metric and cannibalized some of our older programs. However, our focus is on growing market share and improving our service levels, by having more programs closer to our customers. Looking specifically at our mature programs, those at least five years old, they average $10,000 per week this past year and grew 6.2% over last year. While we will continue to open additional programs over the next several years, we will remain focused on improving the productivity of all our existing programs. We also feel very good about this success we\u2019ve had in profitably growing the commercial business, and we like our trajectory here. With our inventory additions in the support of the IMC acquisition, we\u2019re well positioned to grow our base business over the last several years to significant amount of our focus has been on opening new programs and that will continue to be the case albeit at a slightly moderated pace. We have a very talented sales force and we\u2019re enhancing training and introducing additional technology to optimize the productivity of the sales force. We\u2019ve increased our efforts around analyzing customer purchasing trends and in-stock trends. In summary, we remain committed to our long-term growth strategy. We believe we\u2019re well positioned to grow this business and capture increased market share and we believe we can scale this business in a profitable manner and we continue to be excited about our opportunities in this business for many years to come. Now moving on to Mexico, our Mexico stores continue to perform well. We opened 23 new stores during the fourth quarter and 39 for the full-year. We currently have 441 stores in Mexico. This upcoming year, we expect to open a similar 40 new stores and we\u2019re on target to open a new distribution center. This will mark our second DC in the country and support Central Mexico store growth. While sales in base currency were above plan this past year, the devaluation in the peso was much greater than we assumed at the start of the year. The peso devalued 28% over the course of the year. This created a headwind that caused our reported U.S. dollar EBIT to be lower than last year. The EBIT dollar impact on the quarter assuming constant currency with last year\u2019s foreign exchange rate was meaningful approximately double-digit millions of dollar. While we cannot control movements in functional currency versus planned assumptions, we feel the Mexico leadership did an exceptional job managing the peso denominated business. And while we hope more favorable currency compares are in our future in fiscal 2016, we know our Mexico AutoZoners will continue to provide outstanding customer service. If the peso stays at these elevated levels, it will continue to pressure our U.S dollar earnings for the next several quarters. Now regarding Brazil, we opened no stores in the quarter and have seven stores opened at the end of the year. Our plans remain to open a few stores this upcoming fiscal 2016, while sales growth has been very encouraging, we\u2019ve been challenged by a weak Brazilian real relative to U.S dollars as well. While the peso devalued 28%, the real devalued 60% on the year. We remain in test phase on Brazil, but have been more encouraged of late due to our improved operating performance. And recapping this past quarter\u2019s performance for the Company in total, our sales were $3.290 billion, an increase of 7.9% over last year\u2019s fourth quarter. Domestic same-store sales or sales for stores opened more than one year were up 4.5% for the quarter. Gross margin for the quarter was 52.5% of sales, up 20 basis points. The improvement in gross margin was attributable to higher merchandise margins, partially offset by the impact from higher supply chain costs associated with current year inventory initiatives, and Interamerican Motor Corporation, which was acquired in September 2014. In regards to inflation, it has been down slightly year-over-year. Currently we feel cost will be predictable and manageable. We will remain cognizant in the future developments regarding inflation and will make the appropriate adjustments should they arise. Looking forward, we continue to believe there remains opportunity for gross margin expansion within both the retail and commercial businesses, but our commercial business is growing at an accelerated rate and it has lower margins which is adding pressure to our overall gross margins. It is important to note we do not manage to targeted gross margin percentage. We will understand the headwind from expanding our distribution center deliveries will cause. We work diligently to offset these headwinds with the focus on lower acquisition cost. Our primary focus remains growing absolute gross profit dollars in our total auto parts segment. SG&A for the quarter was 32.2% of sales, higher by 52 basis points from last year's fourth quarter. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of sales was primarily due to legal costs, higher legal costs and the impact of the IMC acquisition. The legal costs growth this quarter was attributable to discrete matters that we would not expect to continue. The acquisition of IMC anniversary this month in September, so we expect the majority of the deleverage to dissipate going forward. We continue to believe we\u2019re well positioned to manage our cost structure in response to our sales environment. EBIT for the quarter was $669 million, up 6.2% over the last year's fourth quarter. Our EBIT margin was 20.3%. Interest expense for the quarter was $47.1 million compared with $49.4 million in Q4 a year-ago. Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $4.620 billion or approximately $300 million more than last year's balance of $4.323 billion. Our adjusted debt level metric finished the quarter at 2.5 times EBITDAR. While in any given quarter we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on management's opinion regarding debt and equity market conditions, we remain committed to both our investment-grade rating and our capital allocation strategy; and share repurchases are an important element of that strategy. For the quarter, our tax rate was in line with last year\u2019s Q4. We expect our annual rate to be closer to 36.5% on an ongoing basis as the deviation results in primarily driven by the resolution of discrete tax items that arise. Net income for the quarter was $401 million, and up 7.4% over last year. Our diluted share count of 31.5 million was down 5% from last year's fourth quarter. The combination of these factors drove earnings per share for the quarter to $12.75, up 13% over the prior year's fourth quarter. Now relating to the cash flow statement, for the fourth fiscal quarter, we generated $526 million of operating cash flow. Net fixed assets were up 6% versus last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $188 million and reflected the additional expenditures required to open 97 new locations this quarter, capital expenditures on existing stores, hub and mega hub store remodels or openings, work on development of new stores for upcoming quarters and information technology investments. For all fiscal 2015, our CapEx was approximately $480 million. With the new stores opened, we finished this past quarter with 5,141 stores in 49 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, 441 stores in Mexico, and seven in Brazil for a total AutoZone store count of 5,589. We also had 20 IMC branches opened at fiscal year and taking our total locations to 5,690. Depreciation totaled $87 million for the quarter versus last year's fourth quarter expense of $79 million, in line with recent quarter growth rates. With our excess cash flow, we repurchased $430 million of AutoZone stock in the fourth quarter. At year-end, we have $348 million remaining under our share buyback authorization and our leverage metric was 2.5 times at year-end. Again, I want to stress, we managed appropriate credit ratings and not any one metric; the metric we report is meant as a guide only as each rating firm has its own criteria. We continue to view our share repurchase program as an attractive capital deployment strategy. Accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 113. Next, I'd like to update you on our inventory levels in total and on a per store basis. The Company\u2019s inventory increased 9% over the same period last year, driven by increased product placement, new stores during the fiscal year and the acquisition of IMC, inventory per location was $610 versus $582,000 last year, and $629,000 last quarter. The IMC acquisition increased inventory per location by $15,000 this quarter. Net inventory defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable on a per location basis was a negative $79,000 versus negative $87,000 last year and negative $68,000 in just the last quarter. As a reminder, the addition of IMC has added $15,000 in inventory per location and reduced AP to inventory by approximately 2 percentage points. As we will now be anniversarying the acquisitions, we expect dramatically reduced pressure on these overall metrics going forward. Finally, as Bill previously mentioned, our continued disciplined capital management approach resulted in return on invested capital for the trailing four quarters of 31.2%. We have and will continue to make investments that we believe will generate returns that significantly exceed our cost of capital. Now, I'll turn it back to Bill Rhodes. William C. Rhodes: Thanks, Bill. We\u2019re pleased to report our 36th consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth, and for the year the reported EPS growth rate of 14.1%. We also surpassed an historic milestone in 2015 exceeding $10 billion in sales for the first time in our company\u2019s rich history. Our company has continued to be successful over the long run. That success is attributable to our approach of leveraging our unique and powerful culture and focusing on the needs of our customers. To execute at a high level, we have to consistently adhere to living the pledge. We cannot and will not take our eye of off execution. While we study the external environment and react where appropriate, we must stay committed to executing day-in and day-out on our game plan. Success will be achieved with an attention to detail and exceptional execution. Before I conclude, I want to take this opportunity to reflect on fiscal 2015. We were able to build on past accomplishments and deliver some impressive results. In recognition of the dedication, passion and commitment of our AutoZoners, I want to highlight that, we grew sales to a record $10.2 billion this past year, and we grew same store sales at 3.8%. We grew our store base in Mexico and managed our expenses exceptionally well in spite of the foreign currency headwind with the peso. We began our IMC integration, opened three new branches and now have 20 locations. With the minority of our AutoZone stores today able to sell IMC products, we feel we\u2019re well positioned to expand this business in the future. Our inventory availability testing in mega hub store remodels helped us to reach our conclusion and allowed us to announce our planned implementation schedule. I could not be more proud of the tremendous work everyone on this project contributed. And lastly, we will talk more about saying, yes. We got it to our customers. We are fixated on making sure we meet our customer\u2019s needs in 2016. Our offerings are the best they have ever been, and we are determined to communicate this to our customer base. At the end of the day our customers have choices and we must exceed their expectation. Again we\u2019re excited about our initiatives around inventory assortment and availability, hub stores, commercial growth, Mexico, ALLDATA ecommerce, Brazil and IMC. Our long-term model is to grow new store square footage at a low-single digit growth rate and we expect to continue growing our commercial business at an accelerated rate. Therefore we look to routinely grow EBIT dollars in the mid-single digit range or better in terms of strength, and we leverage our very strong and predictable cash flow to repurchase shares, enhancing our earnings per share growth into double digits. We feel the track we\u2019re on will allow us to continue winning for the long run. We believe our steady, consistent strategy is correct. It is the attention to details and consistent execution that will matter. Our belief is solid consistent strategy combined with superior execution is a formula for success. Our charge remains to optimize our performance regardless of market conditions and continue to ensure we are investing in the key initiatives that will drive our long-term performance. In the end, delivering strong EPS growth and ROIC each and every quarter is how we measure ourselves. We're pleased with our results this past year, so we must remain committed to delivering on our strategic and financial objectives. I can't wait to sit down and talk to our leadership team at our upcoming national sales meeting. This team is comprised of the best leaders in our industry. We are launching our Live the Pledge theme and I know our leaders combined with our talented teams of roughly 80,000 AutoZoners will do just that. Now we\u2019d like to open up the call for questions. Operator : Thank you, sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Mr. Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Sir, your line is open. Seth Basham : Thanks a lot, and good morning. William T. Giles: Good morning. Seth Basham : My first question is regarding the new distribution strategy. Obviously you guys have worked really hard to test it; you now have a plan to roll it out, just trying a bit to understand the return dynamics and the financial implications here. So previously you had stated that you expect about $1000 or $1500 per week lift per store when all of a sudden it does -- when all of a sudden done from this initiative. I want to confirm that\u2019s still on target? William T. Giles: Yes, I will start with -- that $1000 to $1500 per store is the target when both -- when they get both initiatives. Now, I\u2019ve said in our prepared comments that about a third of the stores will not receive nor frequent delivery, and so some piece of that will not flow through to them. But on stores that get both the mega hub and the increased frequency of delivery it will be in a range of $1000 to $1500. It\u2019s a little tough Bill at this point to narrow that range. There\u2019s just a lot of variability depending on a lot, many different factors. Seth Basham : Got it. So as you roll us out to 1000 stores next year about 20% of your base, it would appear that on a run rate basis that should be driving, boost of comps between 75 and 100 basis points, at the same time you\u2019ll be experiencing some gross margin pressure about 25 basis points, but that looks like a pretty good trade off in my book. It looks like you\u2019ll be growing gross profit dollars from this initiative around $50 million next year on a run rate basis versus about $25 million to gross profit or expenses I\u2019d say with the rollout, that\u2019s a pretty good return. Is that the right way to think about it? William T. Giles: Well you did a lot of really good math there very quickly, much quicker than I can do it. I think generically speaking you\u2019re in the ballpark, and we\u2019re not going to go forward with even this business. We think they\u2019re going to provide us with a growth and operating profit dollars that exceeds our return metrics, and we think that both of these initiatives will do that. Now we didn\u2019t think that it would do it in the lowest volume stores with July, we\u2019re not going to roll it for those stores at this point in time. Seth Basham : Got it. Understood and good luck. William T. Giles: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Ms. Kate McShane with Citi Research. Ma\u2019am your line is open. Kate McShane : I just wondered more [indiscernible] on the quarter, and then I had a question about the successful test. For the comp during the quarter, can you talk a little bit about how you did compared to your plans, and if there was a strategy or plan where it did come from? William C. Rhodes: I think generally speaking that performance versus our plan was pretty much on track, particularly in the retail business. Frankly we had a pretty aggressive plan in the fourth quarter that we were a little bit daunted about coming into the quarter. May was very soft and we were behind, but June, July and August outperformed and generally ended on plan. Kate McShane : Okay, thank you. And my second question is just on some of your commentary around your GT build outs and opportunities for new store growth. How should we think about that from a location standpoint? Where are you aiming to build out your stores and with regards to the GT, where could they be located and are you considering where they\u2019re located in relation to how your competitors supply chain are now? William C. Rhodes: Sure. As far as today we have distribution centers that can service our current strategy for anywhere in the United States. We\u2019re not prepared yet to talk about specifically where these next two to three distribution centers are, we still have some work to do, but we can service every store today. The reason we need to expand it is one, as we continue to grow our store count we need more capacity in our supply chain. And then secondly, as we move to increase frequency of deliveries, we need to have some distribution centers that are closer in certain parts of the country and what we\u2019ll be solving with these extra two to three distribution centers. Kate McShane : Okay. Thank you. William C. Rhodes: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Sir, your line is open. Simeon Gutman : Thanks, good morning. Following up on Seth\u2019s question, regarding I guess, some of the margin trajectory going forward. Bill, you said some of these investments will weigh on margins. You quantified that the 25 bps from the multiple delivery and I think you said very modest de-leverage from on the SG&A line from DC. In all it doesn\u2019t seem like a big amount, this quarter I think you had that run rate and X some of those currency headwinds and legal, you would have seen margins if not up at least flattish. So, my question is, is there a specific outlook on the margin side. It feels like margin could still go up even with that 25 basis point headwind. Do you agree or you\u2019re just trying to just take a cautious outlook ahead of the rollout? William T. Giles: Yes, I think the way I would answer that is, that we wanted to carve out at least what the impact was if the initiative varied specifically, so we said that, that was 20 to 30 basis points, the majority of that is in gross margin as you highlighted a little bit of that would be in SG&A to support the mega hub operational activities, and frankly you\u2019re right we had about a 24 basis point impact in supply chain for this past quarter which is probably a pretty good way to look at it for the next several quarters as we continue to rollout stores. Now separate and distinct from that our merchandising organization has done a terrific job in lowering acquisition cost during surprised optimization, and they\u2019ve done a very good job in offsetting those costs. So, I think there are other opportunities for us to continue to improve gross margin rates. But we can clearly identify and quantify the investments and we wanted to highlight those for you. But I think as we look at out over the year we feel its pretty good about overall margin rates, but clearly we\u2019ll have some headwinds. Simeon Gutman : Okay. My follow-up, on the tests, on the multiple delivery tests or the stores that you\u2019ve been operating for a year, can you just give a little more color about the traction you\u2019re seeing. Bill Rhodes mentioned saying yes, more frequent, are you growing the basket with the existing customer, are you moving up on the call list, are you getting new customers that wouldn\u2019t -- that didn\u2019t previously do business. Can you just add a little more color on so we can appreciate the curve of improvement after the rollout is ongoing? William T. Giles: Yes, I would say that number one, we\u2019re seeing the benefit in both our retail and commercial businesses. We\u2019ve been very pleased with the performance to date. Now this is -- you have to remember this is slower moving inventory. So when they call us and we have it, you can get the sales pretty much immediately because we haven\u2019t seen anything ramp and what has happened over time. I do hope and expect over time that our commercial customers, the more frequently we say yes, the more we\u2019ll up their call list. That\u2019s all on increased frequency of delivery. Regarding mega hubs, that is a substantial different offering we\u2019ve ever had in the market place. And I think by us being able to surprise and delight our commercials -- both retail and commercials that, that\u2019s beginning to build traction over time. Simeon Gutman : Okay. Thanks. William T. Giles: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. Dan Wewer with Raymond James. Sir, your line is open. Dan Wewer : Yes. Thanks. Good morning, Bill. William C. Rhodes: Good morning. Dan Wewer : So, when you think about the eventual distribution that work of 11 DC than 40 mega hubs, AutoZone\u2019s capital investment in distribution will still be less than half of competitors which is O\u2019Reilly and NAPA. When you think about the end game a few years out, how will the parts coverage compared to those competitors, when will it be significantly better than what AutoZone has had in the past, but if you are to benchmark it, I guess those competitors that made that, the much larger investment, what will be the difference? William C. Rhodes: I think we\u2019ll be at the top of the heap in the industry with getting access to inventory. Certainly where we have frequency of delivery at three to five times a week, we\u2019ll be able to pose out those in-stocks. When you think about -- you\u2019re trying to solve two different problems. One is an in-stock problem where you have very low demand and when it spikes, if you don\u2019t have an increased frequency of delivery you\u2019re out of business for eight days. We believe this 10 to 11 distribution center model will allow us to do that at the optimum level. That does not mean that we won't forgo a few sales here and there, but we want to make sure that we get a return on the investments that we\u2019re making that is sufficient for our expectations. And secondly with the mega hub you\u2019re trying to solve expanded parts only. And by putting these 25 to 40 mega hubs in the markets we\u2019re going to significantly increase the local market availability of product to 80,000 to 100,000 SKUs. That helps both our retail customer and our commercial customer on a same day basis in those markets. And then on an overnight basis it will go to other hubs stores which I think is best in class solution. Dan Wewer : So if you think about the potential for an extra $1,500 of revenues per week per program where both of the initiatives are in place. Your commercial run rate is still up about $200,000 less per program, let\u2019s say compared to O\u2019Reilly. Is the difference the fact that its going to take a multiple number of years for your customers to recognize that your capabilities are greater or we\u2019re not factoring, perhaps there\u2019s going to be a need to a large or a number of sales people at AutoZone, but I would think that the upside could actually be more than the $15000 that you\u2019re suggesting? William T. Giles: Well first of all we said $1,000 to $1,500 Dan, but I appreciate your optimism and I hope you\u2019re right too. I hope the upside is more than that. Our testing hasn\u2019t proven that out yet, but as I mentioned a few minutes ago, over time the more you say yes to your commercial customers especially on hard to find parts, the more confidence they\u2019re going to get with you and there could potentially be a halo effect over the long time. This is a significant improvement for us, but it\u2019s not a silver bullet. We still have to continue to refine the way we go to market, make sure we got the right product offerings, make sure that we have the best sales force -- sales force which I think we do and on and on. It\u2019s going to take us some time but we\u2019re closing those gaps even as we speak. Dan Wewer : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Mr. Michael Lasser with UBS. Sir, your line is open. Michael Lasser : Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Bill, as you look out at your industry over the next few months, it looks -- it seems like the low gas prices are here to stay. The weather could be unique given some of the predictions that are out there. So what do you think is going to have a greater influence on demand for the industry gas prices or the weather over the next few months? William T. Giles: I would say that from a consistency perspective I think the gas prices have clearly done a couple of things for us, one of which is it has increased supposable income particularly for our customer and it also seems to have attributed to increased in miles driven and we\u2019re seeing some miles driven numbers that are historically very high relative to anything we\u2019ve seen in the past. And so I think those two things which increase wear and tear on automobiles those are the -- and the age of the vehicles. Those three factors I think are probably going to help support demand for the industry for over the long-term. But weather you maybe right, it\u2019s very hard to predict for us. Obviously we had some favorability this fourth quarter particularly towards the end, but that\u2019s really difficult for us to predict and forecast and we\u2019ll just have to see it as it comes. But on the other ones, I think that those really are favorable underlying trends with the help of the industry. Michael Lasser : Okay. And then following up on the inventory strategy that you\u2019re pursuing, I think the market has come to expect a lot of flexibility in your cost structure where as sales gyrate from quarter-to-quarter, you\u2019re still able to produce the type of earning that you have. Did the new inventory strategy reduce that flexibility such as, if the sales don\u2019t come through the margin performance could be more at risk? William T. Giles: I guess theoretically that\u2019s probably true because we\u2019re adding some increased fixed cost structure to the organization, but at the same time as you pointed out we have been very good at determining how to manage our overall cost structure given the environment that we\u2019re dealing with. Having said that we\u2019re committed to this initiative and we\u2019re very encouraged by and we\u2019re going to see it throughout. Michael Lasser : Okay. Last quick one, a few years ago you were decreasing your share count year-over-year by high single digit pace as moderated into a more like a mid single digit pace. Is that a reasonable rate to expect moving forward? William T. Giles: I think so. I mean, it\u2019s obviously PE, its dependent on the PE. So, as our PE has gone, obviously our share repurchases as a percent is declined as you said to mid-high single digits to just this past quarter 5%. So it\u2019s going to continue to be a very important part of our capital allocation strategy and its going to be a very key element of us driving EPS growth. We\u2019ve got a nice balance of organic EBIT growth and share repurchase to drive EPS and I expect that to continue in the future. Michael Lasser : Cool. Thank you so much. William T. Giles: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Mr. Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Sir, you line is open. Matthew Fassler : Thanks a lot. Good morning and I appreciate all the additional information on the call today. My first question relates to this quarter, I\u2019m just trying to understand some of the improvement. It looks like commercial saw more acceleration and Bill you gave us that 6.2% increase from mature programs. Can you tell us how that 6.2% compare to what you\u2019ve done over the prior quarter or two and to what degree do you think the improvement you generated I think commercial is it all a function of some of that, the early testing and rollouts that you\u2019ve been implementing on the inventory and help side? William T. Giles: I\u2019d say the 6.2% is probably a bit of an acceleration and as we highlighted that\u2019s on our mature program. So we\u2019ve seen a little bit of acceleration on that and with some of the other questions we were going through on commercial, some of that relates to some of the things that we\u2019ve done around inventory availability and inventory initiatives. But keep in mind, we\u2019ve got several initiatives in our commercial programs and we\u2019ve got a lot of things that we\u2019re working on in order to continue to drive that average weekly sale or average dollars per program everyday. So it\u2019s not just inventory availability initiatives, although that\u2019s been helpful. Matthew Fassler : Great. Second question, as we model out the gross margin or the aggregate margin impact of the supply chain investments. You spoke about approximately 25 basis points year-on-year, is that 25 basis points each year incremental to the prior year until the rollout is essentially done? William T. Giles: Theoretically yes, although my guess is that, as we get past a year or 18 month that we\u2019ll be able to dissipate some of that impact with improved sales performance and other tactics to improve margin rates. Matthew Fassler : Got it. And then finally, as you think about the incremental inventory, I know the dollars are not huge, to the extent that, that Bill Rhodes alluded to, as slow turning inventory to what degree do you think vendors are going to be able to carry that for you as a payable relative to the basis? William T. Giles: Yes, I think that\u2019s a good question. I think right now we\u2019re at 1.5 times turn, and so if we can kind of keep it around that number I think the vendors should be able to support our AP inventory ratio where it is. Matthew Fassler : Okay. Thanks so much guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Sir, your line is open. Greg Melich : Thanks. I had sure some housekeeping and a strategic question, but first on the housekeeping. If I got it right, the CapEx is probably going to go up to around $600 million if you factor in the M&A, but then it should build even a little more into 2017 given that\u2019s when the DCs will actually open. Did we get that right -- did I get that right on the cash flow side? William T. Giles: Yes, Greg I think you\u2019re pretty close on that on the $600 million, there maybe a little of an increase over that. We\u2019ll have a little bit of DC dollars in \u201916 but more on \u201917? Greg Melich : Okay, great. And then, I just want to make sure on strategic side, and in your prepared comments I heard you guys mention the new hard parts replacement techniques. Can I assume that\u2019s all part of the mega hubs and the expand availability. But what is, is that all that is, or is there something else going on there. It sounded like it might be a new software system or algorithms you run to figure out where to put those parts or am I reading too much into that? William C. Rhodes: Yes, Greg maybe -- I\u2019m sorry we weren\u2019t clear enough. That\u2019s the work we did a year, year and a half ago, where we updated the algorithms to place, forward place the inventory with a slant towards newer merchandise, newer life cycle of vehicle and merchandise, so that work has been done for about a year now and it\u2019s worked very well. Now we\u2019re using those same methodologies to assort our mega hubs and as we continue to roll those out we\u2019ll leverage that methodology there. Greg Melich : Got it. And then as part of that, that 21,000 SKUs per store, it sounds like as this plays itself out with more daily replenishment. Your plan is not to change that, that would have been shifted a couple of years ago with these algorithms. This is now just making sure you\u2019re in stock faster. William C. Rhodes: That is exactly correct. We\u2019ll modify our SKU count by category every time we do a category update. But the step function change in what we were going to stock in the store has been done. Now we\u2019re going to make a step function change in 70% of the stores on how frequently they receive their replenishment orders. Greg Melich : And lastly if I could follow-up on that, how does this change -- you\u2019ve always had a very strong private label program and you\u2019ve built these brands, Duralast in particular. How does the shift affect that if we think out three, four, five years? William C. Rhodes: Yes, great question. It will have zero bearing on our merchandise strategy and branding strategy. Duralast has been a terrific strategy for us and it will continue to be so. Greg Melich : Great. Thanks a lot. William C. Rhodes: All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. Chris Horvers with J.P. Morgan. Sir, your line is open. Christopher Horvers : Thanks. Good morning, guys. William C. Rhodes: Good morning. Christopher Horvers : So I wanted to, from an understanding perspective, what are the buckets of higher fixed costs associated with the new inventory initiatives, and perhaps any quantification of how much your cost structure will become more fixed over time, maybe as a percentage of total -- from a percentage of total cost perspective? William T. Giles: Probably I\u2019ve got two things going on, one of which is it will open three distribution centers over the next several years, so that will increase the cost structure. We believe that obviously replacing those distribution centers will reduce the transportation cost, so hopefully that will offset it. And then there\u2019ll be some increased transportation equipment if you will of tractors and trailers in order to increase delivery frequency, so those are the costs. They\u2019re not overly significant, but you\u2019re adding some capital into the equation. Christopher Horvers : And then from an ability to be flexible in terms of the rollout with the mega hubs and the increased frequency of delivery, that\u2019s something that can -- you can perhaps accelerate more quickly if you saw more success and then on the other side if the environment weakened, isn\u2019t there ability to dial those back? William T. Giles: On the margin absolutely, but obviously there\u2019s a lot of work involved in increasing the delivery, like I said there\u2019s transportation required, people required and then the same on the mega hubs we\u2019ve got to find the real estate and expand the locations or create a new location. So, there\u2019s some lead time in being able to do this and being able to do it in an efficient profitable manner. Christopher Horvers : And then last question, in case I missed it. Did you mention how many stores currently have both mega hub and increased frequency and how do you think about the percentage of stores that will have those long-term? Thanks. William C. Rhodes: Yes, we specifically said we\u2019ve got about 900 stores on the increased frequency of deliveries and from our five mega hubs we have about 750 stores that are being serviced by those. I don\u2019t even know off the top of my head how many of them have both. Over the long run, about 70% are going to have increased frequency of delivery. And the majority of the stores are going to have mega hubs. But ones that are in remote locations or small volume stores won't have either one of those. Christopher Horvers : Thanks very much. William C. Rhodes: All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And now, I\u2019d like to hand the call back over to Mr. Bill Rhodes. Sir. William C. Rhodes: Okay. Before we conclude the call, I\u2019d just like to take a moment to reiterate that our business model continues to be very solid. We\u2019re excited about our growth prospects for the year. We will not take anything for granted as we understand our customers have alternatives. We have a solid plan to succeed this fiscal year, but I want to stress that this is a marathon and not a sprint. As we continue to focus on the basics and focus on optimizing long-term shareholder value, we\u2019re confident AutoZone will continue to be very successful. We thank you for participating in today's call. Operator : That concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Bill Rhodes : Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for AutoZone's 2016 first quarter conference call. With me today are Bill Giles, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, IT, and ALLDATA; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax. Regarding the first quarter, I hope you had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not the press release, along with slides complementing our comments today, are available on our Web site www.autozoneinc.com. Please click on quarterly earnings conference calls to see them. To begin this morning, I want to thank all AutoZoners across the globe for another solid quarter. The first quarter has been very busy for us. We continue to organically grow our business, while expanding our initiatives designed to drive sales. We expanded our U.S. retail footprint with the opening of another 22 net new stores. Our commercial business continues to gain traction, growing sales 10%, with 55 net new programs open for the quarter. We had the commercial program at 81% of our domestic stores, and we continue to expand our presence in Mexico, opening one store in the quarter. Also, in Brazil, we opened an additional store, and now have eight stores in operation. Lastly, we opened two new IMC branches. While we currently have approximately 90% of our total company sales coming from our domestic AutoZone stores, we believe we have great growth opportunities with both electronic commerce and store openings outside the U.S. for many years to come.  Along with our key strategic investments, we continue to spend a lot of time on initiatives to drive our core domestic retail business. The DIY operations remain our number one priority, and the business did quite well in the first quarter. We generated positive traffic and ticket on a same-store basis. And performance was generally consistent across the country. While the macro economy is favorable for DIY performance right now, we continue to gain share, and would attribute those share gains to our investments in store labor and our inventory availability initiatives. We are committed to providing WOW! Customer Service at every store with every customer. Regarding commercial, we've continued with our inventory placement and distribution strategies to respond to the ever increasing challenge of parts proliferation in the industry. Over the past two years, we implemented new methodologies to improve our hard parts placement techniques in all stores. We continued the rollout of more frequent deliveries to an additional 80 net new stores in the quarter. As we discussed in our last quarterly conference call, this rollout focuses on increasing from once-a-week deliveries from our distribution centers to either three or five times. Our results continue to confirm that this new strategy is appropriate. With the varying weekly sales volumes of our stores, replenishment needs vary as well. And with the remainder of the fiscal year, we expect to roll this increased frequency model to approximately 1,000 additional stores, ending the fiscal year with approximately 2,000 stores with this enhanced service level. The implementation of this initiative will create a gross margin headwind of approximately 30 basis points each quarter until we complete the rollout. While this effort will take a few years to complete we would ultimately expect about two-thirds of our stores to have increased frequency of deliveries. This quarter, we only implemented this initiative in 80 net new stores. This past quarter, our focus was on rolling out multiple deliveries to our hub stores. We focused our efforts on this group of stores because they service so many other stores. Additionally, we continue to be very pleased with our sales results from the mega hub stores. We ended the quarter with five mega hubs in operation, with no new openings this quarter, although we expect to add a handful of additional mega hubs over the balance of the fiscal year. As a reminder, these super-sized AutoZone stores carry 80,000 to 100,000 unique SKUs of inventory, approximately twice what a normal hub store carries. They provide coverage to most surrounding stores, and other hub stores multiple times a day or on an overnight basis. Our sales results thus far in our open mega hubs are exceeding our expectations. We have been pleasantly surprised to see the sales generated by the new unique SKU additions to their markets, lifting both our retail and commercial businesses. While there is incremental cost to these rollouts, and payroll and fuel to execute the extra deliveries, we feel that our cost de-leverage is relatively modest. Our current assumption on this rollout is that we won't experience meaningful de-leverage from this initiative in fiscal 2016. Currently five mega hubs support approximately 2,000 stores on a same-day or overnight basis. And once built out, we'd expect to have a network of mega hubs in the neighborhood of 25 to 40 locations. Consistent with the increased frequency of delivery from our distribution centers, we expect to complete our mega hub expansion over the next few years. We also continue to rollout our new store prototype that significantly expands the hard part holding capacity in our stores. All new stores are opening now with this new prototype. And we remodeled 29 additional constrained stores, and now have 126 completed locations. Each of these efforts that are focused on improving our availability of inventory has resulted in an increase to our store level inventories. They've also added incremental costs. Sales have justified our investments though, and offered convincing proof that we remain on the right track. Along with improving our global parts availability and assortment, we continue to manage this organization to provide exceptional service for our customers, provide our AutoZoners with a great place to work, with opportunities for advancement, and ensure we do it on a profitable basis, to provide strong returns for our shareholders. As I mentioned a few minutes ago, we continue to invest in store labor in order to say, yes, we've got it more frequently. Yes, we've got it, is a new operating mantra for us in 2016. We have made material and meaningful enhancements in the last few years to our availability of inventory. And now it is time to ensure our customers experience and see that substantial change. With traffic up across our stores, we understand and appreciate the need to be appropriately staffed to handle our customers' needs. When a customer has a request for a part, product, or simply advice, our objective is to say to them, yes, we've got it. While early in the implementation phase, our team has enthusiastically embraced this notion. And with the current positive macro environment, we want to make sure our AutoZoners have the tools, and specifically the staff necessary to provide our customers with WOW! Customer Service experience they deserve. We also continue to make significant investments -- systems investments and enhancements to capture data about our customers' shopping patterns across all of our platforms. We believe it is essential to be able to share information and processes seamlessly between our stores, commercial shops, phone, and online experiences in order to meet all of our customers' needs. While we are in the early stages of this work, we believe having a holistic and seamless enterprise-wide perspective of our customers will benefit us greatly over the next several years. In order to support more frequent deliveries to new stores as well as the mega hubs, we expect to open two or three distribution centers over the next two or three years. For remodeling purposes, each new distribution center is expected to cost from $40 million to $45 million. At present, we are in the early stages of planning their openings, and we don't expect any domestic distribution center to come online until early fiscal 2017. Fiscal 2016 will incur some capital and operating expenses related to development, but the larger portion of capital spend will be in fiscal 2017, and '18. To summarize our plans, we expect to rollout more frequent distribution center deliveries, and more mega hub locations over the next few years. We also expect to open two or three new domestic distribution centers over this time. While our total company CapEx will not be materially different this year from the past, we do expect to incur an approximate 20 to 30 basis point gross margin headwind from these investments alone. In fiscal year of 2015, we faced headwinds to our gross margin, and we were able to overcome them, and post improvement in each of our quarters. We believe in fiscal 2016, we continue to have opportunities for improvement. But we also have new headwinds. Now turning to the first quarter's results, our sales increased 5.6%, on top of the 8% growth in Q1 of last year. Our domestic same-store sales were up 3.5%. This quarter's sales results were very consistent throughout the quarter, excluding the last two weeks. The last two weeks of Q1 last year were particularly strong due to the extreme cold across much of the country. Remember the polar vortex. Every year, when the first significant cold spell arrives, we experience significant growth in hard part sales. And customers are reminded of the importance of doing the maintenance work necessary to prepare their vehicles for the winter driving season. Last year, that first cold weather event was pulled forward into Q1, when it usually occurs early in Q2. While weather is always an important factor for sales, over time the impact evens out. Regionally, the Northwest, Northeast, and Midwest performed slightly below the overall chain. However, these two markets were better the year before. In regard to our three primary merchandise category splits, discretionary products' sales performed the best. Maintenance followed, and then failure-related merchandise. We attribute the recent strength in discretionary category to be due to lower gas prices freeing up money for our customers. While important, discretionary remains our lowest mix of sales, approximately 80% of total domestic store sales, so the impact of accelerated growth in these categories is not the most significant driver of our overall sales. We are still a failure parts driven retailer, representing approximately 50% of total sales. And the lack of early winter this year muted our sales in failure-related categories. As I said earlier, both traffic and ticket were positive for our DIY and commercial businesses. For the quarter, we opened 55 net new programs in commercial, and have the commercial program in 81% of our domestic store base. While our sales grew 10% on the quarter, our programs opened grew by 7%. While the commercial business -- the commercial sales growth rate was a bit slower than last quarter's pace, we continue to be pleased with the progress we are making. We believe our future in this business remains bright. As part of our strategy of increasing inventory levels in local markets closer to our customers, this past quarter we opened two additional hub locations. And now operate 178 traditional hubs. In addition to our opening more mega hub locations, we also expect to open additional standard hub locations. Over time, we expect to operate as many as 200 to 225 stores as hubs. Regarding IMC, we opened two new branches this quarter, and are excited by our opportunities. This year, IMC will be busy. We'll open a few more locations this year, and expand access to their original equipment inventory to more AutoZone stores. The IMC parts catalogue is accessible to around 600 AutoZone locations today. So we see great sales growth opportunities in the future for both our retail and commercial customers. Regarding Mexico, we opened one store this quarter, and now have 442 total locations. While foreign currency headwinds persist, Mexico's peso sales have done well. Assuming the peso stabilizes, we expect the pressure on U.S. dollar earnings from our Mexico business to abate starting next summer, in the June-July timeframe, as we begin to lap the exchange rate increases. For the quarter, the foreign currency headwinds lowered our EBIT growth rate by more than a percentage point. Sales in our other businesses for the quarter were up 4% over last year. As a reminder, ALLDATA and e-commerce businesses -- as a reminder, our ALLDATA and e-commerce businesses, which includes AutoZone.com and AutoAnything, make up this segment of sales. Regarding online sales opportunities, there continue to be great opportunities for growth on both a business-to-business basis, and to individual customers or B2C. With the continued aging of the car population, we continue to be optimistic regarding trends for our industry in both DIY and DIFM. As new vehicle sales are reaching all-time highs, and gas prices on the average are down materially, miles driven continue to increase. The lower income customer benefits the most from lower gas prices relative to income. This trend is encouraging. While we understand recent weather has been warmer and we were up against quite cold winter last year, we are still optimistic we can grow sales for upcoming quarters. While we focus on both short-term and long-term performance, we remain committed to delivering consistent strong earnings performance and extending our streak of 37 consecutive quarters of double-digit EPS growth is an important milestone for us. While our delivery frequency initiative and expansion of our mega hubs will add some headwinds on our operating margin for the remainder of the fiscal year, our focus remains growing operating profit dollars and acceptable return levels. Now, let me review our highlights regarding execution of our operating theme for 2016, LIVE the Pledge. The key priorities for the year are great people providing great service, profitably growing our commercial business, leveraging the internet, improving inventory availability. And yes, we've got it. On the retail front this past quarter, we are under the great people providing great service priority we increased staffing levels in our stores. We've also been focused on improving our mobile app on autozone.com to increase our relevancy across our fastest growing online category. We've been aggressive on our technology investments and believe these initiatives will help differentiate us on a long-term basis. We realize that customers have become much more tech and mobile savvy, we have to have a sales proposition that touches all the ways they desire to interact with us. Our current and future technology investments will lead to sales growth across all our businesses. On the Yes, We Got It front, we have added training, metrics, and most importantly share of voice to educate our store level AutoZoners to help all of our customers with any part, product, or advice needs they have. We are very excited about what this imitative can mean. We should also have another strong performance in the total invested capital as we were able to finish the quarter at 31.2%. We are very pleased with this metric as it is one of the best if not the best in all of hard lines retail. However, our primary focus has been and continues to be that we ensure every incremental dollar of capital that we deploy in this business provides an acceptable return well in excess of our cost to capital. It is important to reinforce that we will always maintain our diligence regarding capital stewardship as the capital we invest is our investor's capital. Before I pass the discussion over to Bill Giles to talk about our financial results, I'd like to thank our entire organization for their commitment to managing the business appropriately and prudently. Now, I will turn it over to Bill. Bill Giles : Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everyone. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to talk more specifically about our retail, commercial, and international results for the quarter. For the quarter total auto parts sales, which includes our domestic retail and commercial businesses, our Mexico and Brazil stores and our 20 IMC branches, increased 5.6%. Now switching to macro trends during the quarter, nationally unleaded gas prices started out at $2.51 a gallon and ended the quarter at $2.09 a gallon, a $0.42decrease. Last year, gas prices decreased $0.64 per gallon during the first quarter, starting at $3.46 and ending at $2.82 a gallon. We continue to believe gas prices have a real impact on our customers' ability to maintain their vehicles, and cost reductions help all Americans, we hope to continue to benefit from this increase in disposable income. We also recognize that the impact of miles driven on cars over 11 years old, the current average is much different than on newer cars in terms of wear and tear. Miles driven increased 2.3% in August and 4.3% in September. Now, we don't have October and November data yet. The other statistic we highlight is the number of seven-year and older vehicles on the road, which continues to trend in our industry's favor. For the trailing four quarters, total sales per AutoZone store were $1,761,000. This statistic continues to set the pace for the rest of the industry. For the quarter, total commercial sales increased 10%. In the fourth quarter, commercial represented 18% of our total sales and grew $39 million over last year's Q1. While the sales trajectory of the business slowed a bit in Q1, we are continuing our efforts to grow this business. This past quarter, we opened 55 new programs versus 61 programs opened in first quarter of last fiscal year. We now have our commercial program in 4,196 stores supported by 178 hub stores. Approximately 1,106 of our programs are three years old or younger, or 26% of the base. Let me take a moment and discuss our commercial program performance. While our average weekly sales program for the last 12 months are below some peers in our industry, at $8,800, our productivity continues to improve. Our focus remains on growing both sales and profits at an accelerated rate compared to our retail business. Looking specifically at mature programs both of these five years old, they averaged $10,000 per week this past year and grew mid single digit over last year. While we will continue to open additional programs over the next several years, we will remain focused on improving the productivity of all our existing programs. We also feel very good about the success we've had and profitably growing the commercial business. With our inventory additions and the support of the IMC acquisition, we're well positioned to grow our base business. Over the last several years, a significant amount of our focus has been on opening new programs and that will continue to be the case albeit at a slightly moderated pace. We have a very talented sales force. And we're enhancing training and introducing additional technology to optimize the productivity of the sales force. We've increased our efforts around analyzing customer purchasing trends and in-stock trends. In summary, we remain committed to our long-term growth strategy. We believe we're well positioned to grow this business and capture increased market share. We believe we can scale this business in a profitable manner and are excited about our opportunities in this business for many years to come. Our Mexico stores continue to perform well. We opened one new store during the first quarter. We currently have 442 stores in Mexico. For the year, we expect to open approximately 40 new stores and we're on target to open a new distribution center. This will mark our second DC in the country and support Central Mexico store growth. While sales in base currency were above plan this past quarter, the devaluation in the peso remains a material headwind to U.S. dollars reported for operating profit. The peso finished Q1 21% below last year's quarter end rate. This weakness created a significant headwind on our reported U.S. dollars and EBIT. As Bill previously mentioned, for the quarter foreign exchange headwinds lowered our EBIT growth rate by more than a percentage point. While we cannot control movement in functional currency versus planned assumptions, the Mexico leadership continues to do an excellent job managing the peso denominated business. If the peso stays at these elevated levels, it will continue to pressure our U.S. dollar earnings for the next few quarters. Now regarding Brazil, we opened one store in the quarter resulting in eight stores opened at the end of the quarter. While sales growth has been very encouraging, we've been challenged by a weak Brazilian real relative to U.S dollars as well. While the peso devalued 21%, real devalued 48% this year versus last. With extraordinary volatility, it was managed as best as possible. We remain in test phase in Brazil but have been more encouraged by our operating performance. Recapping this past quarter's performance for the Company in total, our sales were $2.386 billion, an increase of 5.6% over last year's first quarter. Domestic same-store sales or sales for stores opened more than one year, were up 3.5% for the quarter. Gross margin for the quarter was 52.5% of sales, up 45 basis points. The improvement in gross margin was attributable to higher merchandise margins, partially offset by higher supply chain costs associated with current year inventory initiatives. In regards to inflation, it remains subdued basically at flat level to last year across merchandize categories with pockets of deflation. Currently, we feel cost will be predictable and manageable. We will remain cognizant of future developments regarding inflation and will make the appropriate adjustments should they arise. Looking forward, we continue to believe there remains opportunity for gross margin expansion within both the retail and commercial businesses, but our commercial business is growing at an accelerated rate and it has lower margins, which is adding pressure to our overall gross margins. It is important to note we do not manage to targeted gross margin percentage. We also understand the headwind expanding our distribution center deliveries will cause. We work diligently to offset these headwinds with the focus on lower acquisition cost. Our primary focus remains growing absolute gross profit dollars in our total auto parts segment. SG&A for the quarter was 34.2% of sales, higher by 17 basis points from last year's fourth quarter. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of sales was primarily due to higher domestic payroll and the impact of the IMC, which was partially offset by the favorable comparison to last year's higher legal cost. We continue to believe we are well positioned to manage our cost structure in response to our sales environment. EBIT for the quarter was $438 million, up 7.2% over the last year's first quarter. Our EBIT margin was 18.4%. Interest expense for the quarter was $35 million compared with $37.1 million in Q1 a year ago. Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $4.754 billion or approximately $350 million more than last year's balance of $4.402 million. Our adjusted debt level metric finished the quarter at 2.5 times EBITDAR. While in any given quarter, we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on management's opinion regarding debt and equity market conditions, we remain committed to both our investment-grade rating and our capital allocation strategy; and share repurchases are an important element of that strategy. For the quarter, our tax rate was slightly higher than last year's Q1 tax rate. We expect our annual rate to be closer to 36.5% on an ongoing basis as the deviation result is primarily driven by the resolution of discrete tax items that arise. Net income for the quarter was $258 million, and up 8.3% over last year. Our diluted share count of 31.1 million was down 5% from last year's first quarter. The combination of these factors drove earnings per share for the quarter to $8.29, up 14% over the prior year's first quarter. Relating to the cash flow statement, for the first fiscal quarter, we generated $324 million of operating cash flow. Net fixed assets were up 5% versus last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $87 million and reflected the additional expenditures required to open 27 new locations this quarter, capital expenditures on existing stores, hub and mega hub store remodels or openings, work on development of new stores for upcoming quarters and information technology investments. With the new stores opened, we finished this past quarter with 5,163 stores in 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, 441 stores in Mexico, and eight in Brazil for a total AutoZone store count of 5,613. We also had 20 IMC branches opened at fiscal quarter end taking our total locations to 5,635. Depreciation totaled $66 million for the quarter versus last year's first quarter expense of $61 million, in line with recent quarter growth rates. With our excess cash flow, we repurchased $400 million of AutoZone stock in the first quarter. At quarter end, we had $698 million remaining under our share buyback authorization and our leverage metric was 2.5 times at year end. Again, I want to stress, we managed appropriate credit ratings and not any one metric. The metric we report is meant as a guide only as each rating firm has its own criteria. We continue to view our share repurchase program as an attractive capital deployment strategy. Accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 110.6%. Next, I'd like to update you on our inventory levels in total and on a per location basis. The company's inventory increased 7.2% over the same period last year, driven by increased product placement and new stores during the fiscal year. Inventory per location was $624 versus $604,000 last year, and $610,000 last quarter. Finally, as Bill previously mentioned, our continued disciplined capital management approach resulted in return on invested capital for the trailing four quarters of 31.2%. We have and will continue to make investments that we believe will generate returns that significantly exceed our cost of capital. Now, I'll turn it back to Bill Rhodes. Bill Rhodes : Thank you, Bill. We're very pleased to report our 37th consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth, growing this quarter to rate of 14% over last year. To execute at a high level, we have to consistently adhere to living the pledge. We cannot and will not take our eye off of execution. While we study the external environment and react where appropriate, we must take a minute to executing day in and day out on our game plan. Success will be achieved with a strong attention to detail and exceptional execution. We are confident in our initiatives, and we are pleased with the progress we are making in rolling out our new supply chain model by delivering inventory to our stores on a more frequent basis. In addition, the performance of our mega hubs has been strong, and we look forward to opening more. We believe these initiatives will benefit both our retail and commercial businesses. Our long-term model is to grow new store square footage at a low single-digit growth rate. And we expect to continue growing our commercial business at an accelerated rate. Therefore, we look to routinely grow EBIT dollars in the mid single-digit range or better in times of strength. And we leveraged our very strong and predictable cash flow to repurchase shares, enhancing our earnings per share growth in the double digits. We feel the track we are on will allow us to continue winning in the long run. We believe our steady, consistent strategy is correct. It is the attention to details and consistent execution that will matter. Our belief is, the solid, consistent strategy, combined with superior execution drives success. Our charge remains to optimize our performance regardless of market conditions, and continue to ensure we are investing in the key initiatives that will drive our long-term performance. In the end, delivering strong EPS growth and ROIC each and every quarter is how we measure ourselves. We are pleased with our results this past quarter, but we must not be content. There's a lot of work in front of us over the next three quarters, but the future looks bright. Before moving to the Q&A section, I'd like to address some of our recent organizational changes. In late September, Larry Roesel informed us that he was retiring this fall. Larry led our commercial business for eight-and-a-half years. And we experienced tremendous growth during his tenure. We thank Larry for his incredible contributions to our success, and wish he and his wife, Beverly, all the best in retirement. Additionally, Mike Womack recently informed us that he and his family will be moving back to their home in Ohio. Mike has led our human resources organization for three-and-a-half years. Under his leadership, our HR processes have continued to improve. We wish Mike and his family all the best as they return home. In light of these changes, we have elevated three long-term AutoZoners to Executive Vice President, and we have promoted five AutoZoners to Senior Vice President. I am very excited about these individuals, their promotions, and the impact they will have on our business. These are very talented leaders, and they have tremendous AutoZone tenure. On the average, these eight AutoZone leaders have over 25 years of AutoZone tenure. This is a great testament to our unique and powerful culture. And it highlights that our diligent work around succession planning is paying dividends. Now we'd like to open up the call for questions. Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Simeon Gutman : Thanks, good morning, and a nice quarter, guys. Bill Rhodes : Thank you. Simeon Gutman : On multiple delivery and DC rollouts, I guess do DCs eventually come into this -- I missed some of the prepared remarks, but I guess an expectation of maybe some time late this fiscal year or next. If you think about the cadence of investments, the 20 to 30 basis points or so from supply chain, how does the DC investments play into that, is that to pump it up or is it -- or I believe you get some other benefit to take it down? Bill Rhodes : Yes, couple of great questions. First of all, we will open our distribution center in Mexico, our second DC in Mexico hopefully by this fiscal year or first of the next fiscal year. The two DCs that we're working on domestically currently will not open until 2017, hopefully one in the first or second quarter, and then the second one in the third or fourth quarter. As you know, those things take time. As those distribution centers open, clearly they will have some capital investments, but on the operating expense front I don't think that they will be a material contributor to drive our operating expenses up or down. As we do more frequent deliveries they're going to have some benefits because the stem miles of the transportation routes will be shorter, but obviously they will have incremental operating expenses of having a new facility, and a new management team, and all those things. I think those will net out generally. Simeon Gutman : Okay, and then one quick follow-up, granted it's early days with the multiple delivery, but I imagine in-store and some of the inventory, the complexion is changing a little, more depth and maybe less safety stock. Is that the case? How are stores acclimating to it? Is there any protocol in store to minimize disruption, and obviously that should be translating into sales? Bill Rhodes : Yes, and I would say that was one of the things that we looked at when we first started our test on this program. The store operators like it. They like it a lot. Number one, when the truck comes in it's in bite sized pieces, so it's much more easy to work into the daily activities, versus being the big event of the week, where they have to have all hands on deck. So they like it. Yes, it pulls down safety stock which is one of the challenges we have when we talked about our store of the future trying to eliminate some of the physical constraints that we have on our stores. One thing this does is pull down the safety stock and it allows us to put more parts on the shelf. So from an operating standpoint, I think it's all-systems-go, and they really like it. Simeon Gutman : Okay, thanks. Bill Rhodes : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, speakers. Our next question is from Mr. Dan Wewer with Raymond James. Sir, your line is now open. You may proceed. Dan Wewer : Thanks. Good morning, Bill. You had noted that the -- obviously the commercial revenue growth of 10% is quite good. But you did note that it decelerated from previous quarters. When you look at the results for the stores that are commercial programs that are still being delivered to once a week, compared to those that are on a three to five-week schedule, was there a deviation in their sales performance? Bill Rhodes : Yes, Dan, there's clearly a deviation. But I would say first of all, that the benefits that we see from both of the inventory availability initiatives are both on the retail side and the commercial side. I wouldn't say that those stores reacted any differently in comparison than they did in Q4, if that makes sense. Dan Wewer : So when you looked at the bit of moderation in revenue growth in commercial from 4Q, it was pretty much the same whether the stores are being shipped to once a week or three or five times per week? Bill Rhodes : Yes, I think that's right. And as a reminder, when we do the delivery frequency in the mega hubs, we see about a $1000 to $1500 per store if you get both elements of that. That differential seems to be confirmed in everything we've done so far. And we did see a moderation in our sales growth kind of across the board. Dan Wewer : And then just one other follow-up question on the incremental commercial growth; how is that splitting out between doing more business with existing customers or are your sales people now engaging new customers, and making them aware of your greater capabilities. It would be good if you could talk about how that split is developing. Bill Giles : Yes, I think it's a combination of both. I mean, clearly as we've mentioned, we've grown our mature programs in the mid single-digit rate. So we're getting more productivity out of our existing base programs as they continue to mature. But clearly, with our opportunities to say, yes, we've got it on a more frequent basis, and be able to deliver products more timely, both through more frequent deliveries, as well as the mega hub network, and being able to communicate that to our customers with our sales force is an important thing. We've been able to do that, and I think we'll continue to gain traction over time. Dan Wewer : And Bill, if I could just sneak in a real quick -- a quick question, can you remind us how much -- how important are your commercial customers at Firestone, and the service part of Pep Boys to AutoZone? Bill Rhodes : But you know we don't talk about specifics on our commercial customers, but obviously Firestone is one of our great customers. We appreciate their business, but I don't want to get into specifics on them. And obviously we don't do much, if any, business with Pep Boys. Dan Wewer : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you, speakers. Our next question is from Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Sir, you may proceed. Mark Becks : Hi, it's actually Mark Becks on for Chris. Historically, the DIY category has been sort of a flat to 1% comp industry and you guys are obviously doing much better than that. What if anything has changed on the DIY side outside of the fuel price declines? And what do you think the rate of the growth in the industry is currently? Bill Rhodes : Yes, I think clearly we are seeing some industry strength currently. I think a part of that has to do with what's going on with gas prices. And while gas prices initially went down, you didn't see the initial correlation with miles driven increasing. But in more recent months, starting really strong in this summer, and continuing through September, the latest date that we have available, it\u2019s showing nice strength. Over long periods of time we've seen that has a nice correlation with our DIY industry growth. I'd also say that our performance I don't think is solely based on industry. We talked about it in the prepared remarks. We're also gaining market share, and I think a lot of these initiatives that we have in place particularly around inventory availability are beginning to pay dividends, and remember, we're just very early in the early innings. Mark Becks : And two quick follow-ups to that, who do you think you're taking share from, whether it be on the independent or the national retailers, and then also just with the lower gas prices, have you seen any particular lift that you might be able to quantify, or have you done any historical correlation, so for instance, 1% increase in miles driven would add 25 basis points to comps? Bill Rhodes : Yes. I don't think the analysis that we have is that finite. What I would tell you is we would think that we're getting a benefit of 1% to 2% at this point in time in our DIY business. As per who we're gaining market share from, I don't really want to get into that. I'm more focused on are we gaining market share and what we're going to do to gain more of it. Mark Becks : Okay, great. And then just last question, you spoke to still being optimistic about growing sales, and then talked about a dip in trends in the last two quarters. Can you speak to any variability by region that you saw over the last couple of weeks? I think it was 50 here in the Northeast this past weekend and it's supposed to be 60 again this weekend. Thank you. Bill Rhodes : Yes. Thank you, great question. Number one, we wanted to call out what happened in the last two weeks of the quarter, because it was materially different. It wasn't materially different this year from the other weeks in the quarter. What was materially different was last year. We have that very first significant cold snap, and last year was really significant. And it happened in the last two weeks of the quarter. Our sales spiked during those last two weeks. As we all know, it's been a warm fall. The beginning of winter is warm so far. What happens going forward, we don't know, they're calling for it to be a warmer winter; we will see what happens. And I don't think necessarily when you think about average temperatures, is that really the driver, what we need are a few really abrupt cold snaps, because the parts that are on the verge of failing will fail when those cold snaps happen and we will get our failure-related business back in those categories. Operator : Thank you, speakers. Our next question is from Mr. Michael Montani with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. You may proceed. Michael Montani : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask Bill if you could just help contextualize a little bit the benefits that you all would have seen in the spring and summer at the last two years from what were sort of I'd say unusually favorable winter conditions, just to help us contextualize that as we head into the coming spring and summer period? Bill Rhodes : Yes. Clearly we said many times over that a harsh winter does benefit us in the spring and summer. We've never been able to go in and say specifically how much it drives us, but clearly -- and it really happens with the under car parts. So what happens with a tough and particularly a wet snowy winter is the roads get a lot of damage, and that puts a lot of pressure on chassis systems, on brake systems and the like, and so we do tend to benefit from those as the spring thaw happens and into the early parts of the summer. Michael Montani : Okay, great. And just to understand a little bit more if I could on the cost side, it's a little bit surprised to see the 15 whip hit from IMC just because I thought it would been cycled more or less, so can you discuss a little bit the ins and outs there and how to look at that moving forward as well as you know, the labor cost, which popped up a little bit. Is that due to increases in terms of pay per hour, what's driving that? Is it hourly rates to drive service, I think you alluded to? Bill Giles : Yes. I would say that on the IMC front, we haven't fully anniversary it. We'll just anniversary through September -- after September, but we've also opened five new locations. So we went from 17 to 22 locations. So those five locations are adding some incremental expenses as they begin to get themselves ramped up. So my expectation is that we would see a little bit of headwind from IMC for the next quarter or so as we begin to mature some of the new openings that we've had. From a payroll perspective, it's really probably better service levels overall. I think that we've increased our payroll hours a little bit across the board. We're not seeing a significant amount of wage inflation yet. We've seen a little bit. We anticipate probably a little bit more going forward, but overall I would say we have improved our service level in line with our Yes, We've Got It initiative. Michael Montani : Thank you. Bill Rhodes : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, speakers. Our next question is from Mr. Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. You may proceed. Chandni Luthra : Hi, this is Chandni Luthra on behalf of Matt Fassler. Congratulations on a good quarter guys. My first question is that some of your competitors called out and benefit from the M&A disruption in the space, could you perhaps throw some color as to what you are seeing in terms of those trends and any impact that you are getting? Bill Rhodes : Anytime somebody goes through a major acquisition integration, it's a challenge. We're not going to get focused on what they are doing. We are going to focus on what we are doing [technical difficulty] in our prepared remarks. We've got a great strategy. What's going to matter is whether or not we are able to execute this strategy. I think we are doing that right now. We are going to make sure we continue to do it. What happens with others is going to happen. There is nothing we can do about it. So we are just going to [technical difficulty]. Chandni Luthra : Got it. Okay. And then, my next question is about ALLDATA, there were some press releases in the last quarter about some new partnerships and agreements that you got for this ALLDATA business of yours, could you perhaps talk about these and the potential of this business going forward in general? Thank you. Bill Giles : Yes. We have got a few partnerships for the few important vendors and also with customers as well. And that's pretty much ongoing. We will continue to grow the ALLDATA business. We feel good about ALLDATA business. We think that it is a leader in the industry. And we have signed and agreement with AMCO. You may have seen we are trying to just recently to provide them service to all their locations. So it's a great product, well respected in the industry and has good prospects going forward. Chandni Luthra : Great, thanks guys. Operator : Thank you, speakers. Our next question is from Michael Lasser with UBS Securities. Your line is now open. You may proceed. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is actually Mark [indiscernible] today for Michael. Thanks for taking the question. It looks like the gross margin basis point impact from more frequent delivery initiative, picked up slightly this quarter. Can you just talk maybe a little bit about what was slightly more costly than expected and what's bringing you guys up to high end of your expected range looking forward? Bill Giles : Yes, and that's a very good question and that's spot on. So we are 37 basis points de-leveraged due to supply chain and we've articulated a 25 to 30. So it was a little bit higher. I think part of that is really just as we continue rollout new programs with activity I mean if you look at the quarter in a little bit more finite detail, we probably rolled out about 300 programs on to the program this quarter. Although took off a couple of hundred programs that's got us to that net 80. So there was a lot of activity that occurred during the quarter. And as we began to ramp this up, our handling cost, our internal cost to deliver more frequently will rise a little bit. And also keep in mind that this quarter and particularly next quarter as well are slightly lower volume quarters. So we really won't have the opportunity to leverage quite as much as we might. They are in the summer months so to speak. So I think that overall, we feel pretty good about the estimates that we have given on an annualized basis although on any given quarter, it may fluctuate a little bit. Unidentified Analyst : Great. That's really helpful. I guess as a follow-up, can you talk about the performance in the stores that have seen that greater delivery frequencies implemented? And has it been I guess consistently high across the board, or are you guys seeing some variability? Bill Rhodes : Yes, it's a great question. And we do see variability. And that's the reason why we're going to go forward with the strategy that says roughly two thirds of our stores are going to see three to five time per week deliveries and the third I'm going to continue to see one time a week delivery. The big variable that drives it as you would expect is store volume. We are talking about replenishment levels, and the more product that you sell, the more frequently you need to replenish it. And so, we do see significant variability but it's along the volume scale. Unidentified Analyst : All right, great. Thanks guys. Bill Rhodes : All right, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Your line is now open. You may proceed. Bret Jordan : Hi, good morning guys. Bill Rhodes : Good morning. Bill Giles : Good morning. Bret Jordan : A quick question on the store level SG&A investment, I guess if we were looking \u2013 are we thinking about adding employees or maybe changing the mix of employees and getting sort of higher end part pros as you grow that commercial business? Bill Rhodes : I wouldn't say it would be changing the mix necessarily. I think that if a commercial business continues to grow, we will continue invest in commercial sales pros as we call them in the organization. I think really the comparison this year versus last is that we increased our service levels relative to where we were last year. I think last year we probably cutback a little bit more than we wanted to. I think actually we probably might have even called out that last year. We thought our service levels were not at the level that we wanted them to be. And so, this year we didn't want to repeat that mistake. And so, we stuck with out model during the quarter and I think we delivered better service levels. Bret Jordan : Okay. And then, a follow-up on the hard part-centric store prototypes, and as you reset some of the legacy stores, do you see doing more of those or you are sort of where you are at where you need to be from a distribution and hard parts availability standpoint? Bill Rhodes : I think as far as resetting some of the stores that we talked about. We've got a new store prototype. So, all the new stores opened will be under that prototype. We have gone back I can't remember if 126 stores that we've already remodeled on that new store prototype. And we will continue to do that. But frankly, I suspect we'll get into the hundreds of stores I don't see that being a thousand necessarily because we are going to have physical constrains as we go through the process. But where we can find the opportunities to add more hard parts into space constrained stores, we are going to continue that. Bret Jordan : Is the performance of that hard part the new prototype store meaningfully different than the legacy mix? Bill Rhodes : It's different enough for us to justify the investment. We can debate what meaningful is. But those stores are performing better and those hard parts are moving. Bill Giles : If I can add on to that, number one the new prototype is not materially more expensive than the old prototype, so as we open the stores, there's no meaningful cost differential. The real benefit comes in the really, really space constrained stores that we have. Remember, we still have about 3800 sq ft stores, a 5000 sq ft stores. When those stores are performing at high volumes and we are able to go in and remodel them to the element of this new prototype that's where we can really see a difference. Bret Jordan : Great. Thank you. Bill Rhodes : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, speakers. Our next question is from Mr. Curtis Nagle with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. You may proceed. Curtis Nagle : Hi, thanks very much and just on for Denise today, so two quick questions, one, it looks like the comp total sales variance narrowed a bit from these trends and I am just curious if that's from the peso or something else, and then two, any commentary on new store growth for this year if you could comment on that? Bill Rhodes : Sure, great questions. First of all, on the peso, our same-store sales are domestic only. So the peso variances aren't impacting our same-stores at all. If you look at last quarter, our same-store sales did 4.5%. They did 3.5% in Q1 of 2016. You can almost point directly to the last two weeks' performance as to why that's different. And as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we went up against the polar vortex last year, and in those two weeks, we had phenomenal weeks. This year we had good weeks but they were up against phenomenal weeks and that's basically the differential in our same-store sales for the quarter. Curtis Nagle : And then just any commentary on new store growth if you could? Bill Rhodes : Yes. We planned to open -- we opened 158 stores last year. I believe it was 157. We plan to open about 150 stores this year on a domestic basis. We're looking to grow Mexico around 40 stores and Brazil we are kind of taking one at a time. Curtis Nagle : Okay, thanks very much. Bill Rhodes : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, speakers. Our next question is from Mr. Tony Cristello with BB&T Capital Markets. Your line is now open, sir. You may proceed. Tony Cristello : Thank you. Good morning. Bill Rhodes : Good morning. Tony Cristello : The first question I had was related to the IMC the import business, I think you said you are in 22 locations and those were able to service about 600 stores. Can you talk about how that business has evolved? How important that is relative to future growth? And where you would like to see that business in terms of touch points relative to your existing store base? Bill Rhodes : Yes, great question. All right, so a couple of things. Number one, when we acquired IMC just over a year ago, they had 17 branches. We have now opened five new branches. We stand at 22 open locations. Those IMC branches are servicing 600 AutoZone stores, but that's not a function of how many branches we have. That's function on some short-term system limitations that we have at AutoZone to be able to serve up that catalog in our AutoZone stores. We are working. We did some short-term solutions that have allowed us get into those 600 stores, so we could test it. Now, we are having to go back and do the more robust work to industrialize those system improvement. That will be coming later in the year which will allow those system improvements. That will be coming later in the year which will allow us to expand how IMC services the AutoZone stores. I want to also be careful to not overstate the implications of IMC servicing AutoZone stores. Yes, we will leverage IMC, but that's not going to be the big driver of our commercial business. The reason, the main primary reason we bought IMC is because it's a good business and we will continue to expand that business as we have done with past stores that we have opened to date. Tony Cristello : Is that a business that can double or triple? I mean I am just trying to understand. It's a great business and the import side of the business is going to continue to grow given the car park and how they are evolving? Bill Rhodes : Yes. If you take a look at the industry leader on the import side of the business, they have got a well over a hundred locations. I don't see why we can't do the same over time. Tony Cristello : Okay. And if I could have just one follow-up on sort of another business that can contribute the ALLDATA side and I know you've talked about wins and such, but how much of that business do you get sort of a lead into where you should be structuring your commercial side? In parts you need to be caring because I guess that's a system that's stays with your installed base and probably developing relationships before you may have some of those well established relationship at the store level? Bill Rhodes : There is some of that. There is an ability for us to be able to extract some information. I think that we still have a lot of work to do relative to acquiring more information out of all that in order to improve some of the synergies across our commercial business as well. So, I would categorize it is helpful on identifying certain trends, but we still have a long way to go in doing that. Tony Cristello : Okay. Thank you for your time. Bill Rhodes : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, speakers. Our last question is from Mr. Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Your line is now open. You may proceed, sir. Seth Basham : Thanks a lot and good morning. Bill Rhodes : Good morning. Seth Basham : My question is around layouts. It sounds like you are having some good success in rolling out mega hubs and getting lifts from stores they are servicing. Can you provide any more detail on what kind of cycle lift you are seeing specifically out of the story from mega hubs? Bill Rhodes : We haven't gotten into those specifics distinctions between inventory, delivery frequency in mega hubs while we continue to say that we have both of the programs where we are going to add between 1000 and $1500. Now that also varies because some of the mega hubs are the stores that are serviced by that mega hub are serviced by them three times a day directly while other stores are serviced by other hub stores that get delivery three times a day and then other hub stores get overnight delivery. So there is a quite a bit of variability in it, but we continue to be pretty comfortable saying if you get frequency delivery in mega hubs, it means about 1000 and $1500 per store. Tony Cristello : Got you. And in terms of your growth pace of mega hubs, you've talked around 25 to 30 for the next few years, what's the limiting factor in slowing that roll out if you are having pretty good success with the ones that you have out there? Bill Rhodes : Yes. It's just as simple as number one, we wanted to go test this program until we got five up and running. We made the decision in the late summer early September to move forward with this strategy, now it's a function of the real estate development pipeline. And remember I mean it even for a regular AutoZone store, it can take us two years to get a store open. So it has nothing to do with anything other than our real estate pipeline and how long it's going to take us to do that. Trust me, we are pushing very hard on that front. Seth Basham : Right. That's good to hear. And lastly, not to spend too much more time in the weather, but I just wanted to understand, since the weather was unfavorable at the end of the quarter, how is your business progressing through the fiscal second quarter? Bill Rhodes : Yes, everybody always wants us to talk about that and we stay away from that unlike a lot of organization that will have their conference call four to six weeks after the end of the quarter. It has only been two weeks and two days. So I think it's not a good prudent strategy for us to talk about what's happened in the first couple of weeks. And, we've consistent about that for a long time. So, I don't want to break that. Now we will say this, weather normalizes over time. And I also want to reiterate that really cold winter is great, but what we really look for is just few good hard cold snaps. And that's when we really see big spikes in our business in certain failure- related categories. Seth Basham : Got it. [Technical difficulty] and good luck. Bill Rhodes : Okay, thank you very much. Operator : Thank you, speakers. At this time, I would like to hand the call back to you Mr. Bill Rhodes. Bill Rhodes : Thank you. Before we conclude the call, I'd like to take a moment to reiterate that our business model continues to be solid. We're excited about our growth prospects for the year. We'll not take anything for granted as we understand our customers have alternatives. We have a solid plan to succeed this fiscal year, but I want to stress that this is a marathon and not a sprint. As we continue to focus on the basics and focus on optimizing long-term shareholder value, we're confident AutoZone will continue to be very successful. We thank you for participating in today's call, and we'd like to wish everyone a very happy and healthy safe holiday season and a prosperous new year. Thank you very much. Operator : And that concludes today's conference. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",

Bill Rhodes : Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for AutoZone's 2016 second quarter conference call. With me today are Bill Giles, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, IT, and ALLDATA; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax. Regarding the second quarter, I hope you\u2019ve had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not, the press release along with slides complementing our comments today, are available on our website www.autozoneinc.com. Please click on quarterly earnings conference calls to see them. To begin this morning, I want to thank all AutoZoners across the globe for another solid quarter. In the second quarter, we continued to execute our strategies to organically grow our business. We expanded our US retail footprint with the opening of another 30 new stores. Our commercial business continued to grow with sales increasing 8% and we opened 32 net new programs for the quarter. We now have the commercial program in 81% of our domestic stores and we continued to expand our presence in Mexico, opening nine stores this quarter. We did not open any new stores in Brazil this quarter and currently have 8 stores in operation. Lastly, we opened two new IMC branches bringing our total branch count to 24. While we currently have approximately 90% of our total company sales coming from our domestic AutoZone stores, we believe we have great growth prospects in domestic locations, commercial, international and our other businesses. If I could sum up the quarter in a short statement, I would call out our major highlights, I\u2019d say we continued on our game plan of executing our inventory availability and delivery frequency initiatives while adding more labor hours in our stores in an effort to constantly improve our customers\u2019 experiences.  While winter temperatures were milder this year than last, we did not see a material change in business trends from one month to the next overall. Yes, certain cold-weather categories, those that have larger sales during these months were below last year's numbers while others balanced out our performance. And yes, as you would expect, our performance in the Midwest and Northeast were below other markets but they were in line with our expectations considering the weather patterns. Probably the biggest unknown for us this quarter was when would income tax refunds begin to be remitted to consumers by the IRS. By quarter end, total refunds were generally comparable to remittances last year but they were issued very very late in our quarter. We feel our retail business is benefiting from a continued focus on customer service, improving parts availability, and lower overall fuel prices. Lower gas prices, we feel, are contributing to Americans driving more.  Regarding commercial, we saw colder weather markets growing sales at a slower pace than other markets. We believe the milder temperatures led the less failure related repairs being done in those particular markets. However we believe the mild temperatures will not have a material lasting effect on our sales performance heading into the summer. We feel a hot summer is the next thing we will be watching for in regards to sales performance.  Getting back to DIY, our number one business priority, the business did quite well in the second quarter. We generated positive traffic and ticket on a same-store basis and performance was generally consistent across the country. While the macro-economy is favorable for DIY performance right now, we also continue to gain share and would attribute those share gains to our investments in store labor and our inventory availability initiatives. We are committed to providing WOW! Customer Service at every store with every customer.  Regarding commercial, we\u2019ve continued with our inventory placement and distribution strategies to respond to the ever increasing challenge of parts proliferation in our industry. Over the past two years, we implemented new methodologies to improve our hard parts placement techniques in all stores. We continued the rollout of more frequent deliveries to an additional approximately 300 net new stores in the quarter. We now have a total of 1300 locations out of our 5000 plus locations on multiple weekly deliveries. As we've been discussing, this rollout focuses on increasing from once-a-week deliveries from our distribution centers to either three or five times a week. Our results continue to confirm that this new strategy is appropriate.  With the varying weekly sales volumes of our stores, replenishment needs vary as well. Over the remaining two quarters of the fiscal year, we expect to roll this increased frequency model to approximately 700 additional stores ending the fiscal year with approximately 2000 stores with this enhanced service model. The implementation of this initiative will create a gross margin headwind of approximately 20 to 30 basis points until we complete the rollout. While this effort will take a few years to complete, we would ultimately expect about two-thirds of our stores to have increased frequency of deliveries.  This past quarter\u2019s deleverage from deliveries was less than the previous quarter. I appreciate our team\u2019s efforts to manage these rollouts on a cost effective basis. This is a material change in how we do business and our teams are executing it well and managing the costs effectively. Our sales lift from this effort continues to show the investments make economic sense.  Additionally, we continue to be very pleased with our sales results from the mega hub stores. We ended the quarter with 5 mega hubs with no new openings this quarter, although we expect to open \u2013 to add an approximately five additional mega hubs over the last two quarters of the fiscal year. As a reminder, these super-sized AutoZone stores carry 80,000 to 100,000 unique SKUs of inventory, approximately twice what a normal hub store carries. They provide coverage to both surrounding stores and other hub stores multiple times a day or on an overnight basis. Our sales results thus far in our opened mega hubs continue to exceed our expectations and we are experiencing sales improvements from both our retail and commercial businesses. While there is incremental cost of these rollouts, including payroll and fuel to execute the extra deliveries, we feel their cost deleverage is relatively modest. Our current assumption on this rollout is that we won't experience meaningful deleverage from this initiative in fiscal 2016.  Currently five mega hubs support approximately 700 stores on a same day basis and roughly 2000 stores in total, and once built out we would expect to have a network of mega hubs in the neighborhood of 25 to 40 total locations. Consistent with the increased frequency of delivery from our distribution centers, we expect to complete our mega hub expansion over the next few years. Along with improving our local parts availability and assortment, we continue to manage this organization to provide exceptional service for our customers, provide our AutoZoners with a great place to work with opportunities for advancement and ensure we do it on a profitable basis to provide strong returns for our shareholders.  As I mentioned a few years ago -- a few minutes ago we continue to invest in store labor in order to say Yes, We Got It more frequently. Yes, We Got It is a new operating mantra for us in 2016. We\u2019ve made meaningful enhancements in the last few years to our availability of inventory and now it is time to ensure our customers experience and see that substantial change.  As traffic has increased in our stores, we understand and appreciate the need to be appropriately staffed to handle our customers\u2019 needs. When customers have request for a part, product or simply advice, our objective is to say to them, Yes, We Got It. While still early in the implementation training phase, our team has enthusiastically embraced this notion, and with the current positive macro environment, we want to make sure AutoZoners have the tools and specifically the staff necessary to provide our customers with WOW! Customer Service experience they deserve.  We also want to touch on the efforts that are ongoing with regard to capturing data about our customers\u2019 shopping patterns across all of our platforms. We believe it is essential to be able to share information and process seamlessly between our stores, commercial shops, phone and online experiences in order to meet all of our customers\u2019 needs. While still in the early stages of this work, we believe having a holistic and seamless enterprise-wide perspective on our customers will benefit us greatly over the next several years. This will be a significant endeavor for us over the next couple of years. We\u2019ve spent a lot of time mapping through the capture of this data in order to leverage it to better serve our customers. We think this will be a real differentiator for us over the next several years. More to come later on this initiative.  Lastly, in order to support more frequent deliveries to new stores as well as mega hubs, we continue to expect to open two or three distribution centers over the next two or three years. At present we\u2019re in the early stages of planning their openings and don't expect any distribution center to come online until fiscal 2017. Fiscal 2016 will incur some capital on operating expenses related to development but a larger portion of capital spend will be in fiscal 2017 and \u201918.  To summarize our plans, we expect to roll out more frequent distribution center deliveries and more mega hub locations over the next few years. We also expect to open two or three new domestic distribution centers over this time. While our total company CapEx will not be materially different this year from past, we do expect to incur approximately 20 to 30 basis points of gross margin headwinds from these investments alone. Now turning to the second quarter's results. Our sales increased 5.3% on top of 7.7% growth in Q2 of last year. Our domestic same-store sales were up 3.6%. Our growth in both sales and earnings were very consistent with our results from Q1. This quarter sales results were also very consistent throughout the quarter, excluding the last couple of weeks. During the quarter, tax refunds in total were generally comparable to prior year. However from a timing perspective, they flowed [ph] very late in the quarter.  In regard to our three primary merchandise category splits in our US stores, failure-related product sales performed the best. Discretionary had the next highest growth rate followed by maintenance. While all three showed nice growth, we attribute the variance in sales trends between these businesses to the timing of winter events, for example, the polar vortex effects this year versus last. As I said earlier, both traffic and ticket were positive for our DIY and commercial businesses. For the quarter we opened 32 net new programs and have the commercial program in 81% of our domestic store base. While our total domestic sales grew 6% on the quarter, our domestic commercial sales growth was up 8%. The commercial sales growth rate while still impressive has slowed, some of the reductions in growth is due to opening fewer new programs in recent years and having a lower percentage of the programs on the maturation curve. Despite this expected change, our sales slowed a bit more than we expected and we are working diligently to gain back that momentum. In recent weeks, we\u2019ve executed incremental training and have enhanced the focus of our management teams, including store managers on reaccelerating our commercial growth. We believe our future in this business remains quite bright.  As part of our strategy of increasing inventory levels in local markets closer to our customers, this past quarter we opened one additional hub location and now operate 179. In addition to opening over time more mega hub locations, we also expect to open additional standard hub locations. Over time we expect to operate as many as 200 to 225 stores as hub stores. Regarding IMC, we opened two new branches this quarter and continue to be excited by our opportunities. IMC parts catalogue is currently accessible to over 700 AutoZone locations today and we believe there are great sales growth opportunities in the future with both our retail and commercial customers.  Regarding Mexico, we opened another nine stores this quarter and now have 451 total locations in Mexico. While foreign currency headwinds persist, Mexico's peso sales have done quite well. Assuming the peso stabilizes, we expect the pressure on our US dollar earnings from our Mexico business to begin to abate starting this summer in the June to July timeframe as we begin to lap the most significant exchange rate increases. For the quarter, the foreign currency headwinds lowered our EBIT growth rate by more than two percentage points. At the end of the quarter the peso was down 29% versus last year and 16% from the end of Q1. Sales in our other businesses for the quarter were up 3% over last year. As a reminder, ALLDATA and e-commerce businesses, which include AutoZone.com and AutoAnything, make up this segment of sales. Each of these businesses operate in increasingly competitive environment and our sales have slowed a bit. Again, while we understand weather this winter was warmer, we're optimistic for sales this upcoming quarter. The biggest tailwind at the moment in our opinion is the increased miles driven across the country. This leads to more failure and maintenance related demand and benefits both our DIY and DIFM businesses.  While we focus on both the short-term and long-term performance, we remain committed to delivering consistent strong earnings performance and extending our streak of 38 consecutive quarters of double-digit EPS growth, which is an important milestone for us.  While our delivery frequency initiative and expansion of our mega hubs will add some headwinds on our operating margin for the remainder of fiscal 2016, our focus remains on growing operating profit dollars at acceptable return levels. Now let me review our highlights regarding execution of our operating theme for 2016 : LIVE the Pledge. The key priorities for the year were great people providing great service, profitably growing our commercial business, leveraging the Internet, improving inventory availability, and yes, we\u2019ve got it.  On the retail front this past quarter, under the great people providing great service priority, we increased staffing levels in our stores. We've also been aggressive on our technology investments and believe these initiatives will help differentiate us on a long-term basis. We realize as customers have become much more tech and mobile savvy, we have to have a sales proposition that touches all the ways they desire to interact with us. Our current and future technology investments will lead to sales growth across all of our businesses.  On the Yes, We\u2019ve Got It front, we've added training, metrics, and most importantly share of voice to educate our store level AutoZoners to help all of our customers with any part, product or advice needs they have. We're excited about this initiative.  We should also highlight another strong performance in return on invested capital as we were able to finish the quarter at 31%. We are proud of this metric as it is one of the best, if not the best, in all of hard lines retailing. However our primary focus has been and continues to be that we ensure every incremental dollar of capital that we deploy in this business provides an acceptable return well in excess of our cost of capital. It is important to reinforce that we will always maintain our diligence regarding capital stewardship as the capital we invest is our investors\u2019 capital.  Before I pass the discussion over to Bill Giles to talk about our financial results, I\u2019d like to thank again our entire organization for executing on our many operating initiatives while providing our customers with great service and managing our expenses appropriately and prudently.  Now I will turn the call over to Bill Giles. Bill Giles : Thanks, Bill and good morning everyone. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to talk more specifically about our retail, commercial and international results for the quarter. For the quarter, total auto parts sales, which includes our domestic retail and commercial businesses, our Mexico and Brazil stores and our 24 IMC branches, increased 5.4%.  Switching over to macro trends, during the quarter nationally unleaded gas prices started out at $2.09 a gallon and ended the quarter at $1.72 a gallon, a $0.37 decrease. Last year gas prices decreased $0.55 per gallon during the second quarter starting at $2.82 and ending at $2.27 a gallon. We continue to believe gas prices have a real impact on our customers\u2019 ability to maintain their vehicles and as cost reductions help all Americans, we hope to continue to benefit from this increase in disposable income. We also recognize that the impact of miles driven on cars over 11 years old, the current average is much different than on newer cars in terms of wear and tear. Miles driven increased in both October, November and December and we don\u2019t have January data yet. For all of 2015 miles driven finished up 3.5%, an incredible strong number on a historical basis. It represents the largest percentage growth in over a decade.  The other statistic we highlight is the number of seven year and older vehicles on the road which continues to trend in our industry\u2019s favour. For the trailing four quarters, total sales per average AutoZone store was $1,780,000. For the quarter total commercial sales increased 8%. In the second quarter, commercial represented 18% of our total sales and grew $30 million over last year's Q2.  While the sales trajectory of the business slowed a bit in Q2, some of this is due to slower growth from our lower mix of new programs, we've intensified the focus of our entire team, including our store managers on reaccelerating our growth in commercial and we have recently executed some incremental commercial training programs. This past quarter we opened 32 net new programs versus 29 programs opened in our second quarter of last fiscal year. We now have our commercial program in 4228 stores supported by 179 hub stores. Approximately 1100 of our programs are three years old or younger, 26% of the base.  With our inventory additions and the support of the IMC acquisition, we are well-positioned to grow our base business. Over the last several years, significant amount of our focus has been on opening new programs and that will continue to be the case albeit at a slightly moderated pace. This year we plan on opening around 250 commercial programs, approximately 150 more programs over the next two quarters. We have a very talented sales force and we're enhancing training and introducing additional technology to optimize the productivity of the sales force. We've increased our efforts around analyzing customer purchasing trends and in-stock trends.  In summary, we remain committed to our long-term growth strategy. We believe we are well-positioned to grow this business and capture increased market share. We believe we can scale this business in a profitable manner and we continue to be excited about our opportunities in this business for many years to come. Our Mexico stores continue to perform well. We opened nine news stores during the second quarter. We currently have 451 stores in Mexico. For the year we expect to open approximately 40 new stores and we are on target to open a new distribution center this calendar year. This will mark our second distribution center in the country and it will support further Central Mexico store growth. As Bill previously mentioned, for the quarter the foreign exchange headwinds lowered our company EBIT growth by over two percentage points. While we cannot control movements in functional currency versus planned assumptions, Mexico leadership continues to do an excellent job managing the peso denominated business. If the peso stays at these elevated levels, it will continue to pressure our US dollar earnings for the next few quarters.  Regarding Brazil, we opened no stores in the quarter remaining with 8 stores open. While sales growth has been very encouraging, we have been challenged by a weak Brazilian real relative to US dollars as well. While the peso devalued 29% year-over-year, the real devalued 41% this year versus last. This extraordinary volatility has managed as best as possible, remain in test phase in Brazil but have been encouraged by our improving operating performance.  Recapping this past quarter\u2019s performance for the company, in total our sales were $2.257 billion, an increase of 5.3% over last year\u2019s second quarter. Domestic same-store sales, or sales for stores opened more than one year, were up 3.6% for the quarter.  Gross margin for the quarter was 52.7% of sales, up 50 basis points. The improvement in gross margin was attributable to higher merchandise margins, partially offset by higher supply chain costs associated with current year inventory initiatives.  In regards to inflation, it remains subdued. In fact, in total slightly down last year. Currently we feel costs will be predictable and manageable. We will remain cognizant of future developments regarding inflation and will make the appropriate adjustments should they arise. SG&A for the quarter was 35.8% of sales, higher by 40 basis points from last year\u2019s second quarter. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of sales was primarily due to a favorable credit card litigation settlement recognized last year's quarter and higher domestic store payroll. We continue to believe we are well-positioned to manage our cost structure in response to our sales environment.  EBIT for the quarter was $383 million, up 6% over last year\u2019s second quarter. Our EBIT margin was 17%. Interest expense for the quarter was $33 million compared with $35 million in Q2 a year ago. Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $4.845 billion or approximately $415 million more than last year balance of $4.430 billion.  Our adjusted debt level metric finished the quarter at 2.5 times EBITDAR. While in any given quarter, we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on management's opinion regarding debt and equity market conditions, we remain committed to both our investment-grade rating and our capital allocation strategy; and share repurchases are an important element of that strategy. For the quarter our tax rate was slightly lower than the last year\u2019s Q2 tax rate. This rate was lower than planned. Any deviations to our plan are driven primarily by the resolution of discrete tax items that arise. Net income for the quarter was $229 million and up 8% over last year. Our diluted share count of 30.8 million was down 5.4% from last year\u2019s second quarter. The combination of these factors drove earnings per share for the quarter to $7.43, up 14.2% over the prior year\u2019s second quarter. Relating to the cash flow statement, for the second fiscal quarter, we generated $207 million of operating cash flow. Net fixed assets were up 5% versus last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled approximately $100 million and reflected the additional expenditures required to open 43 new locations this quarter, capital expenditures on existing stores, hub and mega hub store remodels or openings, work on development of new stores for upcoming quarters and information technology investments.  With the new stores opened we finished this past quarter with 5193 stores in 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, 451 stores in Mexico and 8 in Brazil, for a total AutoZone store count of 5652. We also had 24 IMC branches opened at fiscal quarter end, taking our total locations to 5,676. Depreciation totaled $69 million for the quarter versus last year\u2019s second quarter expense of $60 million in line with recent quarter growth rates.  With our excess cash flow we repurchased $150 million of AutoZone stock in the second quarter. At quarter end we had $548 million remaining under our share buyback authorization and our leverage metric was 2.5 times at quarter end.  Again, I want to stress, we manage to appropriate credit ratings and not any one metric. The metric we report is meant as a guide only as each rating firm has its own criteria. We continue to view our share repurchase program as an attractive capital deployment strategy. Accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 109%.  Next, I'd like to update you on our inventory levels in total and on a per location basis. The company's inventory increased 3.9% over the same period last year driven primarily by new stores over the last 12 months. Inventory per location was $633,000 versus $631,000 last year and $624,000 last quarter. Finally, as Bill previously mentioned, our continued disciplined capital management approach resulted in return on invested capital for the trailing four quarters of 31%. We have and will continue to make investments that we believe will generate returns that significantly exceed our cost of capital. Now, I'll turn it back to Bill Rhodes. Bill Rhodes : Thank you, Bill. We're very pleased to report our 38th consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth, growing this quarter at a rate of 14.2% over last year. To execute at a high level, we have to consistently adhere to living the pledge. We cannot and will not take our eye off of execution. Success will be achieved with a strong attention to detail and exceptional execution. We are confident in our initiatives, and we are pleased with the progress we are making in rolling out our new supply chain model by delivering inventory to our stores on a more frequent basis. In addition, the performance of our mega hubs has been strong, and ahead of our expectations and we look forward to opening more later this year. We believe these initiatives will benefit both our retail and commercial businesses. Our long-term model is to grow new store square footage at a low single-digit growth rate. And we expect to continue growing our commercial business at an accelerated rate. Therefore, we look to routinely grow EBIT dollars in the mid single-digit range or better in times of strength. And we leveraged our very strong and predictable cash flow to repurchase shares, enhancing our earnings per share growth in the double digits. We feel the track we are on will allow us to continue winning for the long run. We believe our steady, consistent strategy is correct. It is the attention to details and consistent execution that will matter. Our belief is, the solid, consistent strategy, combined with superior execution drives success. Our charge remains to optimize our performance regardless of market conditions, and continue to ensure we are investing in the key initiatives that will drive our long-term performance. In the end, delivering strong EPS growth and ROIC each and every quarter is how we measure ourselves. We are pleased with our results this past quarter, but we must not be content. We have a lot of work in front of us over the next two quarters, but the future continues to look bright. Now we'd like to open up the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question is from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Simeon Gutman : Thanks, good morning. I have a quick question for Bill Rhodes on the commercial sales growth. You mentioned it was a little weaker even absent some noise, and you didn\u2019t mention whether in the same breath, but you mentioned training and labor. So can you share with us what you think the void is on why \u2013 what\u2019s not happening on the training or labor side that\u2019s causing a little like, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s slippage or noise in the commercial sales results? Bill Rhodes : I would start with one of the things we made specific mention of was that we have fewer stores going through the maturation cycle, and also the stores that are in that maturation cycle were opened later in our development process, which means they had lower potential than the ones that were opened sooner. So we\u2019re seeing some of our slowdown and it\u2019s completely attributable to lower new program growth. But that said, we were still below our expectations for the quarter. Some of that we would attributable to some weather patterns particularly in the Midwest and Northeast but not all of it. Frankly we\u2019re not exactly sure all the reasons that we had a little bit of a slowdown, but we are very focused on taking our one team concept and getting our district managers and our store managers along with our sales team really reengaged in a big way and in a materially significant -- more significant way than in the past. And I think that will pay us dividends for the long term. Simeon Gutman : And then a follow up, somewhat related to that, if you look at the markets with increased -- stores that are benefiting from increased frequency, are you making the customers in those stores aware of that or are they just seeing it through improved parts availability? Bill Rhodes : Yes, we're not marketing to them, number one, it\u2019s being done on a store by store basis. Clearly, the local markets will have it or not, but we\u2019re not marketing it to them, we\u2019re just showing it to them and they are yes percentage when they ask for parts. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Matthew Fassler : My question focuses on inventory. Your inventory grew, I believe, at a slower rate than cost of goods for the first time in quite a while. And this is, as you\u2019re ramping up availability. If you could talk about the moderation in year-on-year growth, whether you expect it to continue and impact, if any, would have had on sales as you went through the quarter? Bill Rhodes : I think when you look over time we've actually increased our inventory quite a bit. And so now it\u2019s at a 630,000 per store location level, we feel pretty good about that. As Bill mentioned in the prepared remarks, we spend a lot of time on analyzing placements and so the merchandising organization has done a great job over the last, I would call it, 12 to 15 months, of better determining workplace inventory. I think the more frequent delivery will be able to optimize inventory location as well and obviously we will increase -- we've increased some inventories, we\u2019ve added some of these mega hubs. So I would expect our inventory levels on a per location basis to be approximately where they are now. They might have some increases as we roll out a few more mega hubs but not significant increases. Matthew Fassler : So basically growing more or less in line with sales if the trajectory continues as it is? Bill Rhodes : Exactly right. Matthew Fassler : And then my very quick follow-up, you quantified the impact of FX on EBIT and it\u2019s not an insignificant number relative to your algorithm. How much -- I'm not sure how much detail you\u2019ve given on that in the past, how much does that impact in the quarter you just reported or how does that compare it to recent quarters? Bill Rhodes : Yes, what we said on this quarter was that we thought it was about 200 basis points or so, and I think last quarter if I remember right, we said somewhere around 100 basis points or so. And so it has had a big impact and we\u2019re going to anniversary that somewhere towards the middle to the tail end of Q3 relative to the spike that we saw in the peso. But I am sure there is a whole lot of other macro things going on at the same time that are impacting the peso, including lower gas prices et cetera. So there is a lot of what we call natural hedges going on. So it isn\u2019t singular but if we were to single that out, it did almost a 200 basis point impact on EBIT. So we expect that to probably impact us just a little bit in Q3 and then we will fully anniversary it in Q4. Matthew Fassler : And just for your closure on this point, it sounds like just probably both translational and transactional impact, up to the point \u2013 to the extent you\u2019re selling products sourced in the US south of the border? Bill Rhodes : Not necessarily. I mean there is obviously translation transaction from a balance sheet perspective. But it\u2019s mostly transactional from just the Mexico results. Operator : Our next question is Dan Wewer with Raymond James. Dan Wewer : Thanks. Bill, your explanation about the slower rate of program growth makes sense. But then presumably that would benefit the sales per program because they are more mature. But again it looks they were up by less than 1% sales per program during the second quarter. So trying to reconcile that trend with the rollout and the apparent success with the mega hub and distribution frequency initiative? Bill Rhodes : Yes, but first, I would start with -- one of the things that\u2019s happened in the quarter on the more frequent delivery program, we did not roll out any significant amount of stores on that program until very very late in the quarter. It just doesn't make sense to roll out things during the holiday season. So those over 300 stores that went on that program, went on the last couple of weeks to the quarter : So you weren\u2019t able to see that benefit up there. As I said earlier, Dan, some of the slowdown in commercial was clearly the maturation cycle but some of it as we were frankly disappointed, marginally disappointed with our performance in commercial. Our team has all hands on deck and we had a spring sales meeting last week, and that was the predominant topic and I'm highly confident that our team will take the ball from here and reaccelerate our growth. Dan Wewer : That\u2019s a great opportunity to evaluate what\u2019s the benefits from the mega hub coverage, what\u2019s the benefit from the increased delivery frequency and then I think you also, what, 500 stores that have both the mega hub access and multiple delivery availability. When you think about those two different initiatives, what do you think to be getting the biggest sales payback? Bill Rhodes : They were both performing at or above our expectations. Frankly the mega hubs are outperforming our expectations. And by the way, mega hubs which \u2013 a couple of them are multiple years old, are continuing to grow, so we\u2019re really excited that the maturation continues two, two and half years later. As we said before, the combination of those two programs is driving a benefit of between a $1000 and $1500 per program, or first store that they get [ph], and that holds true. In fact, if anything is a little bit stronger, are towards the higher end of that as we roll it out. Dan Wewer : Bill, just real quickly, can you give an example or two of what you're focusing on, the increased education or training in the commercial initiative, just an example of what kind of conversations or teaching will be taking place at the store level? Bill Rhodes : I would say one big thing is a lot of our AutoZoners, myself included, grew up on the retail side of the business, we didn\u2019t grow on the wholesale side of the business. And so to use a baseball analogy, our fastball is retail. Well, we've got to develop a fastball that\u2019s also commercial and so we're really focused on getting everybody in the organization taking our whole one team notion to the next level, and that includes getting our district managers and our store managers along with the sales team even more focused on growing the commercial business. Those are a talented group of people and I am highly confident that they will embrace that notion and take us to the next level. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Seth Basham : My first question is just on the success of the delivery initiatives. When you think about the stores that received increased deliveries earliest in the development of this rollout, are they still out-comping control group stores? Bill Rhodes : I would say as they anniversary that they are not comping on the delivery frequency. They are not comping at a higher level. They pretty much get that benefit very early, because it\u2019s all about the customer calling, and yes, we have the product at a higher level than we had it before. So the benefit is almost immediate. There's not a marketing halo except to the extent that, when we say yes on a water pump we may also get the hose sales as well but all those benefits are pretty much immediate. I wouldn\u2019t anticipate that they would grow year-over-year. Seth Basham : So the mega hubs that are maturing \u2013 Bill Rhodes : Different than that. The mega hubs are continuing to grow. And I think that as the more we say yes for hard-to-find parts, the more customer calls us first versus somebody else for harder to find parts. Seth Basham : And then secondly just looking at your gross margins on a really strong quarter, can you provide a little bit more insight into how you\u2019re reducing your product acquisition cost so much? Bill Rhodes : There\u2019s a variety of things that merchandising organization is doing in order to improve quite frankly sourcing. And so one of the things we talked about last quarter is that we\u2019re increasing our global sourcing efforts and identifying opportunities there. I\u2019d say that\u2019s still early on, so there's more opportunity for that as we look out over the next several quarter, several years frankly. So I think there's opportunities there, it\u2019s mostly acquisition costs to be honest. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Seth Sigman with Credit Suisse. Seth Sigman : I just want to follow up on that gross margin point. So clearly a lot of momentum in gross margin helping offset some of the investments that you've made. How do you think about that playing out in the second half of the year? So just wondering if you'll see greater impact in Q3 and Q4 from the increase in delivery frequency, because you pointed out you\u2019re adding 700 stores in the second half, you only added 300 in that first half which was kind of late in the quarter. So I was just wondering how that plays out and if you will continue to see some of those offsets. Bill Rhodes : We've added more than that. And so we will probably add \u2013 the way to think about it is we\u2019ll probably add about 300 stores a quarter on the more frequent delivery. And so we will probably have this ratable pressure of about 20 to 30 basis points from a supply chain perspective. We've had opportunities to offset that through merchandising tactics working with our vendors as well as lower acquisition costs. So it's difficult to predict out exactly what gross margin will do over the next couple of quarters. But I think we feel pretty good about this quarter's results and we\u2019d expect something similar maybe not quite the strong going forward. Seth Sigman : Okay, that's helpful. And then just as we think about the strength in the retail side of the business, how do we think about the pace versus prior quarters? It\u2019s kind of hard to see with FX, just wondering did it accelerate versus prior quarters? And just in general, how should we be thinking about the drivers there between the inventory availability initiatives? Obviously there's a lot of disruption in the market as well. And then also I think you pointed out just improvements you're seeing within your customer base. Bill Rhodes : I would say that it felt pretty steady overall I think from the performance of the retail business for the quarter, with the exception of the flow of the tax money and that created some volatility overall. And clearly as you pocket the United States, there was probably little bit of a weather impact up in the Northeast. And there is a minor impact in the south-central area from oil. But other than that it seems like it\u2019s been relatively stable and consistent throughout that. And then just, if I heard you correctly, I just wanted to make a footnote to one thing you said. The same store sales are domestic based so the foreign exchange rate wouldn\u2019t have had any impact on that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Lasser with UBS. Michael Lasser : Bill Rhodes, so you\u2019re making progress with the inventory availability initiative, your sales per commercial program billed several hundred thousand dollars below some of the other players in the industry. Do you think what -- the current initiatives that you have in place are going to be able to enable the company to meaningfully close that gap over time, or do you have to be something else to get there? Bill Rhodes : I think we believe strongly in our current strategy. We believe these inventory availability initiatives are going to make a material difference in both our retail and commercial businesses. And I think this discussion we\u2019re having today about taking our one team approach to the next level is really going to get our organization which is an incredibly strong execution oriented organization, that will help take us to the next level.  Where do we end up? When I sit back and think about it, a lot of people want to talk about moving from $9000 a week to $13,000 or $14,000 a week. If you think about it, the DIFM business is bigger than the DIY business. Over time I'd love for our DIFM business to be bigger than our DIY business. That\u2019s going to take years if not decades, but I don\u2019t want to set our sights to any short-term target that would limit our thinking. Michael Lasser : Has the most immediate impact from the increased inventory availability been to the DIY business? Bill Rhodes : No. I would say the most immediate impact is on both sides of the business. In fact, if anything, it is slightly disproportionate to the commercial business, which is what you would expect particularly on the mega hub because these are the later model products that are harder to find. Michael Lasser : And then my follow-up question is, so with that being said and the slowdown in growth on the sales per commercial program basis within the quarter, was that \u2013 was there any consistency or pattern that you saw because it doesn\u2019t sound like it was the stores that are getting the increased inventory availability, if anything, those are doing better than average. So I guess there's some other bucket of stores that is growing? Bill Rhodes : I wouldn\u2019t say it some other bucket of stores. I would say it was generally across the board, certain markets where there were weather impacts were hit slightly more than others. But it was generally across the board. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. Mark Becks : Hi, it's Mark Becks on for Chris. I just want to come back to the commentary around the tax refund. I think you said it was comparable at quarter end. Just wanted to fully understand, so does that mean you wouldn't anticipate any sort of impact as you move into Q3? Or do you think there's still some lift from the delayed tax refunds for the next quarter? Bill Rhodes : What we said was, at the end of the quarter total refunds were generally consistent with where they were last year. But they really flowed very late in the quarter. There was a massive amount of refunds that were processed the Wednesday before our quarter ended. We obviously had a very nice weekend. Did we get all the benefit that we normally get in a quarter? Probably not, but it's really hard to say, in the past we\u2019ve called out two different times that we thought the tax refund timing either benefited us or hut us by 100 basis points in sales for the quarter. We didn't quantify it this time, so it was clearly \u2013 our thoughts are it was clearly than that. But there's probably a bit of it that\u2019s going to flow into the third quarter. Mark Becks : That's helpful. And then just one other quick follow-up, I will let Bill Giles jump in here. Maybe I'm reading a little too much into it, but the repo activity was a little bit of a modest deceleration in the quarter. I think historically that's followed your cash flow, and you've taken out that in the middle of the year to support a ramped repo in the back half. Maybe any insight you'd be able to give there. Thanks. Bill Giles : You said it spot on, that\u2019s exactly right. The second quarter is typically a slightly lower cash flow quarter. We obviously bought more stock this quarter than we did last year at this time because of the IMC acquisition that we incurred last year but share repurchases is a little bit lighter in Q2 but we\u2019ll ramp up back up as we heads towards the back end of the year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Bret Jordan : On the IMC you just mentioned, you said it's got catalog availability to 700 of your stores. Can you talk about how it's impacting those stores' commercial business? Bill Rhodes : Yes, as we said for a long time, the number one reason we\u2019re in the IMC business is for the IMC standalone business. It\u2019s a business that we\u2019re very excited about on a long-term basis. But it does provide for those customers, those AutoZone commercial customers that do some high-end import business it does provide us to increase our ability to say yes on those special needs. So when you think about that business today, it\u2019s maybe a couple hundred dollars per store per week in incremental sales, it's not a meaning -- huge difference in the commercial business but it is a nice help. And any time you can say yes to something that they really need, then that helps you move up the call list over the long term. Bret Jordan : And then in other you mentioned that, between ALLDATA and e-commerce slowed a bit. Was it e-commerce, I guess, is there anything changing in that space or is it just sort of general slowing around the seasonal category, is RockAuto or Amazon having an impact? Bill Rhodes : I would say that we are not seeing much different from an e-commerce perspective overall. And I think that\u2019s just some steady \u2013 I think ALLDATA had a little bit more competitive pressure in the marketplace and that probably slowed their growth a little bit. So that\u2019s kind of more of what you\u2019re seeing now. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Mike Baker with Deutsche Bank. Mike Baker : Hi thanks. Two questions. One, just bigger question. You said at one point earlier in the call that the economy is favorable for DIY right now. Does that imply that you think it's more favorable for DIY than the commercial business? And if so, why is that, and has that changed at all? Bill Rhodes : I would say we're number one much more educated on how the economic cycles impact our DIY business than we are the DIFM business just because we\u2019ve been in that business for so much longer and we have a much more mature business. Clearly the economic cycle that we\u2019re with lower gas prices which are leading to really really high miles driven is very favorable for us. Those same impacts, those same indicators should impact the commercial business but we believe at this stage in our commercial business development it\u2019s much more on us and our development of that business than it is on economic matter of factors. Mike Baker : Understood, that makes sense. And I guess as a follow-up to that DIY and commercial growth, who do you think you're taking market share, and are you taking more or less share in DIY or DIFM? Clearly your DIFM business is growing faster, but is that indicative of the market growing faster or are you taking more share? Bill Rhodes : I think clearly we\u2019re taking share in both businesses, we\u2019ve probably taken a disproportionate share in the commercial business. But again because we\u2019re later to the party than many of our competitors and so we\u2019re earlier in the maturation cycle. As far as getting into specifics, I\u2019ll let you all look at individual companies\u2019 performance and make those determinations for yourself. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Bottiglieri with Wolfe Research. Chris Bottiglieri : The first question I had was, your gross margin has been robust. Obviously a lot of this is for the acquisition cost, but I'd think there are some other drivers. Just want to get your thoughts. How much of this directionally would be just oil-based products -- keeping pricing versus cost coming down, integration, benefits of IMC and general oil benefits on your transportation network? Bill Giles : Some of those in there, and so just to go backwards, there's a little bit of benefit certainly from lower gas prices and fuel cost that\u2019s going to impact supply chain and then frankly probably SG&A a little bit as well. And then in addition to that \u2013 actually inflation deflation has been relatively moderated, I mean there is more deflation a little bit in categories like oil. And frankly deflation typically is not helpful for us from a margin perspective. So inflation would be a little bit better for us on a long-term basis. But I would say that, I would give the credit back to the merchandising organization from an acquisition perspective working with vendors, optimizing where we are buying the inventory, going direct in certain opportunities as well, increasing private-label products where we have opportunities to do so. We\u2019re pretty well penetrated in private-label today but there continues to be opportunities for us to expand our penetration on private-label and that has helped a little bit. So many of the improvements that I would say that we have seen, not all but the majority are sustainable. And so I think we\u2019ve got a good playbook to continue to do that. And having said that, as you mentioned we continue to have headwinds from just lower margin businesses growing at a faster rate and then some of the initiatives that we have from an inventory perspective. Chris Bottiglieri : And then just one follow-up unrelated question. So you guys were obviously well ahead of the rest of the party in terms of putting together a DIY program. And still on a monetary value, it seems you'd exceed your competitors. Are you seeing any impact from some of these traditional DIFM customers on competitors using DIY programs in terms of rewards? Can you talk about retention rates or number of members, anything to give context to how your own rewards loyalty program has performed? Bill Rhodes : Our loyalty program which we\u2019ve had in some form for basically a decade continues to perform very well, it\u2019s an important part of our value proposition to our customers. As other people have gotten into the loyalty program, we obviously paid very close attention to it. But at the macro level our DIY business is performing very well right now. And so we\u2019re confident with what we\u2019re doing, we\u2019re confident with the benefits that we\u2019re getting out of the loyalty program, and look forward to continuing to perform well. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Montani with Evercore ISI. Michael Montani : It's Mike Montani on for Greg Melich. Just had a quick one, on CapEx, can you guys give a little more color on what you think this year will be and then the outlook for the next couple years given the expectations for the DCs and mega hubs? And then I had a follow-up. Bill Giles : I think that we probably said that -- somewhere around $600 million or so for fiscal year \u201916, at this pace it will probably be a little bit lower than $600 million for next year, probably closer to that 600,maybe a little bit over that depending on how we finish up this year and then the following year I think we\u2019ll probably migrate down into mid 500 or so once we get the distribution centers opened. But that would really be the only aberration if you\u2019d call it, from a CapEx perspective. Other than that we\u2019re opening square footage at around 3% and continue to invest in our existing base stores to make sure that they look fresh and current every day and then also to invest in new technology in order to make sure our platform can support our business as we grow. Michael Montani : And then if I could just on the margin side, you mentioned obviously higher wage costs. Can you help understand how much of that is really headcount per store, increased hours versus wage rate and then any kind of healthcare expense that you guys might be seeing or not seeing? Bill Giles : Yes, I think mostly of our payroll is really intentional investment in our payroll dollars in the stores in order to improve customer service as well as the training that Bill talked about earlier. From a wage rate perspective, I would say that we\u2019re continuing to see an increase in wage rates but not anything different than what we had expected to see and frankly not much different than what we\u2019d seen in prior year. Obviously around the country there is pocketed areas, but for the most part it\u2019s been steady as she goes. From a health medical perspective, we\u2019re not seeing any significant changes necessarily to our current cost rates, so that seems to be pretty much in check as well.  End of Q& A Operator : Thank you. At this time I would like to hand the call back to Mr. Bill Rhodes for closing comments. Bill Rhodes : Okay. Before we conclude the call, I'd just like to take a moment to reiterate that our business model continues to be solid. We're excited about our growth prospects for the year. We'll not take anything for granted as we understand our customers have alternatives. We have a solid plan to succeed this fiscal year, but I want to stress that this is a marathon and not a sprint. As we continue to focus on the basics and focus on optimizing long-term shareholder value, we're confident AutoZone will continue to be very successful. Thank you for participating on today's call. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes today's conference. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",

And thank you for joining us today for AutoZone's 2016 third quarter conference call. With me today are Bill Giles, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, IT and ALLDATA, and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax. Regarding the third quarter, I hope you've had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not, the press release, along with slides complementing our comments today are available on our website www.autozoneinc.com. Please click on quarterly earnings conference calls to see them. To begin this morning, I want to thank all of our AutoZoners for another solid quarter. In the third quarter we continued to execute our strategies to organically grow our business. We expanded our US retail footprint with the opening of an additional 33 new stores. Our commercial business continued to grow, with sales increasing 6.5% and we opened 46 net new programs for the quarter. We now have the commercial program in 82% of our domestic stores. And we continue to expand our presence in Mexico, opening 7 stores this quarter. We did not open any new stores in Brazil this quarter and currently have 8 stores in operation. Lastly, we opened 1 new IMC branch, bringing our total branch count to 25. While we currently have approximately 90% of our total company sales coming from our domestic AutoZone stores, we continue to see great growth prospects in international and our other businesses. If I could sum up our quarter's major highlights, we continued on our game plan of executing our inventory availability and delivery frequency initiatives, while maintaining our efforts to constantly improve our customer\u2019s experiences. We continued implementation of our multiple delivery frequency initiative, adding just over 300 locations this quarter. We now have approximately 1,600 of our stores receiving multiple distribution center deliveries each week. And we added two additional mega hubs in the quarter, for a total of seven now, and are targeting to open four more by the end of the fiscal year and we have more in the real estate pipeline for next year. Additionally, we continue to look for opportunities to expand our merchandise margins. And our new global sourcing initiative is a significant part of our focus, and, while still early, those efforts are progressing well. We also experienced some challenges this quarter. Our same-store weekly sales performance was quite volatile during the quarter. We started the quarter very strong, but recall that last year's third quarter started very weak due to a shift in tax refund timing. Additionally, we had a few weeks of poor sales when the weather was materially colder and wetter than last year. On the surface, it appears that the quarter started strong and then moderated. But when you assess it on a two-year basis, sales trends were generally consistent throughout the quarter. On a regional basis, our performance in the Midwestern, Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern states were substantially below other markets, especially in late March, all the way through the end of the quarter, where temperatures were much cooler and it was much wetter than usual. We continue to feel our retail business is benefiting from a continued focus on customer service, improving parts availability, and lower overall gas prices. Lower gas prices, we feel, are contributing to Americans driving more, although recent price increases at the pump have likely muted some of this benefit. Regarding commercial, we underperformed relative to the overall business in the same weather impacted markets noted previously. We don't think we are alone. Some of our large national account customers have told us and yourselves they too experienced weaker sales while temperatures were cooler than usual. What I'm most proud of is what we've done to address those challenges. We are focused on both our large and small account sales growth while incorporating a one team approach in communicating with our customers. As I talk to customers, I continue to see tremendous opportunity to grow sales and we continue to be excited about the performance and future benefit of our inventory availability initiatives. But we really have only scratched the surface with what we can do here. The forecast of a hot summer, which we would welcome, along with continued store level execution makes us optimistic about our sales potential heading into the summer. Getting back to DIY, our number one business priority, the business performance during the quarter was mixed. In markets unaffected by the weather patterns noted above, we continued to perform well. However, for the quarter our DIY traffic count turned slightly negative and our average ticket trends were slightly lower than the first half of the year. While the overall macro economy remains favorable for DIY, we also continue to gain share and would attribute those share gains to our investments in store labor and our inventory availability initiatives. We are committed to providing WOW! Customer Service at every store with every customer. Over the past two years, we implemented new methodologies to improve our hard parts placement techniques in all stores. We continued the rollout of more frequent deliveries to an additional approximately 300 net new stores in the quarter. We now have a total of roughly 1600 locations out of our 5000-plus stores on multiple weekly deliveries. Our results continue to confirm that this new strategy is appropriate, with the varying weekly sales volumes of our stores, replenishment needs vary, as well. For the fourth quarter, we expect to roll this increased frequency model to approximately 350 additional stores ending the fiscal year end with around 1,950 stores with this enhanced service model. The implementation of this initiative continues to create a gross margin headwind due to higher supply chain costs of approximately 20 basis points until we complete the rollout. While this effort will take a few years to complete, we would ultimately expect about two thirds of our stores to have increased frequency of deliveries. This past quarter's deleverage from deliveries was in line with the previous quarter. I appreciate our team\u2019s efforts to manage these rollouts on a cost-effective basis. This is a material change in how we do business and our teams are executing it well and managing the costs effectively. Our sales lift from this effort continues to show the investments make economic sense. Additionally, we continue to be very pleased with our sales results from the mega hub stores. We ended the quarter with seven mega hubs and expect to add up to four additional mega hubs this fourth quarter. As a reminder, these super sized AutoZone stores carry 80,000 to 100,000 unique SKUs of inventory, approximately twice what a normal hub store carries. They provide coverage to both surrounding stores and stores serviced by other hub stores multiple times a day or on an overnight basis. Our sales results thus far in our open mega hubs continue to exceed our expectations, and we're experiencing sales improvements from both our retail and commercial businesses. While there is incremental costs to these rollouts, including payroll and fuel to execute the extra deliveries, we feel their cost deleverage is relatively modest. Our current assumption on this rollout is that we won't experience meaningful deleverage from this initiative this year. Currently, seven mega hubs support approximately 800 stores on a same-day basis and roughly 2,200 stores in total. And once built out, we would expect to have a network of mega hubs in the neighborhood of 25 to 40 total locations. Consistent with increased frequency of delivery from our distribution centers, we expect to complete our mega hub expansion over the next few years. Along with improving our local parts availability and assortment, we continue to manage this organization to provide exceptional service for our customers, provide our AutoZoners with a great place to work, with opportunities for advancement and ensure we do it on a profitable basis to provide strong returns for our shareholders. As with last quarter, we continue to invest in training our AutoZoners to say, Yes, We've Got It more frequently. Yes, We've Got It is the operating mantra for us in 2016. We've made meaningful enhancements in the last few years to our availability of inventory and now it is a time to ensure our customers experience and see that substantial change. We understand and appreciate the need to be appropriately staffed to handle our customer\u2019s needs, as customer service is a key part of our value proposition and a key differentiator. When customers have requests for a part, product or simply advice, our objective is to say to them, Yes, We've Got It. With the current positive macro environment, we want to make sure our AutoZoners have the tools and specifically the staff necessary to provide our customers with the WOW! Customer Service experience they deserve. In regards to learning about our customers shopping behaviors, we are capturing data from all of our selling platforms. We know it is essential to be able to share information and process seamlessly between our stores, commercial shops, phone and online experiences in order to meet all of customers needs. While being several quarters away from truly using the data for marketing purposes, we believe having a holistic and seamless enterprise-wide perspective of our customers will change the way we communicate our message. As we are devoting more resources to building these capabilities, we think this will be a real differ differentiator for us over the next several years, more to come later. In order to support more frequent deliveries to new stores, as well as to mega hubs, we continue to expect to open two or three distribution centers over the next few years. At present, we are in the early stages of planning their openings and don't expect any distribution center to come online until fiscal 2017. Fiscal 2016 will incur some capital and operating expenses related to development, but the larger portion of the capital spend will be in fiscal 2017 and '18. Regarding our expectations for the capital required to open these new distribution centers, as we have completed further due diligence we have updated our expected capital required to $55 million to $60 million per distribution center. To summarize our plans, we expect to roll out more frequent distribution center deliveries and more mega hub locations over the next few years. We also expect to open two or three new domestic distribution centers over this time. While our total company CapEx will not be materially different this year from this past, we do expect to incur an approximate 20 basis point gross margin headwind from the multiple weekly delivery rollouts. Now, turning to the third quarter's results, our sales increased 4% on top of 6.5% growth in Q3 of last year. Our domestic same-store sales were up 2%. Our sales growth in Q3 slowed from the first half of the year and our earnings growth moderated as well. We attribute the majority of the sales and related earnings deceleration to weather patterns, particularly in the Midwest, Mid-Atlantic and Northeast regions, where it was considerably cooler this year. In regard to our three primary merchandise category splits in our US stores, both failure-related product sales and discretionary purchases easily exceeded maintenance this past quarter. Maintenance merchandise sales simply did not sell as expected and drove its piece of the mix below previous third-quarter percentages. We attribute the variance in sales between these businesses to the regional differences. Specifically, spring-related items simply sold at a lesser clip as cooler temperatures prevailed in certain geographic areas. While our total domestic sales grew 4% on the quarter, our domestic commercial sales growth was up 6.5%. As previously discussed, we feel like the ongoing initiatives in place position us well for our summer selling season. We believe our sales potential heading into the fourth quarter remains bright. As part of our strategy of increasing inventory levels in local markets closer to our customers, this past quarter we opened three additional hub locations, now operate 182. In addition to opening over time more mega hub locations, we also expect to open additional standard hub locations. Over time, we expect to operate as many as 200 to 225 stores as hubs. Regarding IMC, we opened one new branch this quarter and continue to be excited by our opportunities. We've opened seven additional branches since Q3 of last year. The IMC parts catalog is currently accessible to over 700 AutoZone stores on a same-day basis and over 1,400 AutoZone stores through overnight shipment. Regarding Mexico, we opened another 7 stores this quarter and now have 458 total locations. While foreign currency headwinds persist, Mexico's peso sales have done well. Assuming the peso stabilizes, we expect the pressure on our US dollar earnings from our Mexico business to begin to abate in the fall, as we begin to lap the most significant exchange rate increases. However, the volatility in the oil markets directly correlate the peso to the US dollar exchange rate and recently the peso has weakened with oil price volatility. For the quarter, the foreign currency headwinds lowered our EBIT growth rate by just over 1 percentage point. At the end of the quarter, the peso to US dollar was 18% worse than last year. Sales in our other businesses for the quarter were up 2% over last year. As a reminder, our ALLDATA and e-commerce businesses, which includes autozone.com and AutoAnything, make up this segment of sales. The biggest sales tailwind at the moment, in our opinion, remains the increased miles driven across the country. While volatility with weather has been the greatest headwind, increasing miles driven leads to more failure and maintenance related demand and benefits both our DIY and DIFM businesses. But unusually cool weather leads to limited sales. While we focus on both short-term and long-term performance, we remain committed to consistently delivering strong earnings performance and extending our streak of 39 consecutive quarters of double-digit EPS growth, which is a very important milestone for us. While our delivery frequency initiatives and expansion of our mega hubs will add some headwinds on our operating margin for the remainder of 2016, our focus remains on growing operating profit dollars at acceptable return levels. Now let me review our highlights regarding execution of our operating theme for 2016, Live the Pledge. The key priorities for the year were great people providing great service, profitably growing our commercial business, leveraging the Internet, improving inventory availability, and Yes, We've Got It. On the retail front this past quarter, under the Great People Providing Great Service priority, we remain focused on improving our store level execution. While we've added payroll this year, we are also stressing to our AutoZoners the importance of communicating our ever improving availability message. We've also been aggressive on our technology investments and believe these initiatives will help differentiate us on a long-term basis. We realize as customers have become much more tech and mobile savvy, we have to have a sales proposition that touches all the ways they desire to interact with us. Our current and future technology investments will lead to sales growth across all of our businesses. On the Yes, We've Got It front, we've added training, metrics and, most importantly, share of voice to educate our store level AutoZoners to help all of our customers with any part, product or advice needs they have. We are excited about this initiative. We should also highlight another strong performance in return on invested capital, as we were able to finish the quarter at 31.2%. We are proud of this metric, it is one of the best, if not the best, in all of hard lines retailing. However, our primary focus has been and continues to be that we ensure every incremental dollar of capital that we deploy in this business provides an acceptable return, well in excess of our cost of capital. It is important to reinforce that we will always maintain our diligence regarding capital stewardship, as the capital we invest is our investor\u2019s capital. Before I pass the discussion over to Bill Giles to talk about our financial results, I'd like to thank our entire organization for executing on our many operating initiatives, while providing our customers with great service and managing our expenses appropriately and prudently. Now I'll turn the call over to Bill Giles. Bill Giles : Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to talk more specifically about our retail, commercial, and international results for the quarter. For the quarter, total auto parts sales, which includes our domestic retail and commercial businesses, our Mexico and Brazil stores, and our 25 IMC branches increased 4.1%. Our switching to macro trends, during the quarter nationally unleaded gas prices started out at $1.72 a gallon and ended the quarter at $2.22 a gallon, a $0.50 increase. Last year gas prices increased $0.42 per gallon during the third quarter, starting at $2.27 and ending at $2.69 a gallon. It is usual for gas prices to go up during this time of year as summer blend begins to take effect with refiners. We continue to believe gas prices have a real impact on our customers' ability to maintain their vehicles. And as cost reductions help all Americans, we hope to continue to benefit from this increase in disposable income. We also recognize that the impact of miles driven on cars over 11 years old, the current average, is much different than on newer cars in terms of wear and tear. Miles driven increased in both January and February. We don't have March or April data yet. The other statistic we highlight is the number of seven-year and older vehicles on the road, which continues to trend in our industry\u2019s favor. For the trailing four quarters, total sales per average AutoZone store were $1,785,000. For the quarter, total commercial sales increased 6.5%. In the third quarter, commercial represented 19% of our total sales and grew $29 million over last year's Q3. As Bill said previously, we remain confident in our strategies to grow sales with this customer base for many years to come and we are particularly excited about the long-term benefits our inventory availability initiative will provide. Our commercial sales growth has decelerated some from the pace we have experienced in the last few years. In prior years, we had a much larger percentage of our commercial programs recently opened or going through the maturation cycle. As more of our programs have matured, the contribution to our sales growth or the maturation cycle has declined. This only partially contributed to our decelerated growth this past quarter. Regarding Q3 in particular, we also experienced slower growth in the Midwest, Mid-Atlantic and Northeast markets where the spring season has been very late to arrive. These markets commercial sales performance was materially below other regions for us. This past quarter we opened 46 net new programs versus 72 programs opened in our third quarter of last fiscal year. We now have our commercial program in 4,274 stores, supported by 182 hub stores, approximately 1,000 of our programs are three years old or younger, which is about 24% of the base. With our inventory additions and the support of the IMC acquisition, we are well positioned to grow our base business. This year we plan on opening around 250 commercial programs, approximately 120 more programs in Q4 alone. We have a very talented sales force and we are enhancing training and introducing additional technology to optimize the productivity of the sales force. We have increased our efforts around analyzing customer purchasing trends and in stock trends. We believe we are well-positioned to grow this business and capture increased market share as we continue growth profitably We continue to be excited about our opportunities in this business for many years to come. Our Mexico stores continue to perform well. We opened 7 new stores during the third quarter. We currently have 458 stores in Mexico. For the year, we expect to open approximately 40 new stores and we are on target to open a new distribution center this calendar year. This will mark our second DC in the country and it will support further Central Mexico store growth. As Bill previously mentioned, for the quarter the foreign exchange headwinds lowered our company EBIT growth rate by 1 percentage point. While we cannot control movements in functional currency versus planned assumptions, the Mexico leadership team continues to do an exceptional job managing the peso denominated business. If the peso stays at these elevated levels, it will continue to pressure our US dollar earnings into the fall. Regarding Brazil, we did not open stores in the quarter and continue to operate 8 stores. While sales growth has been very encouraging, we have been challenged by a weak Brazilian real relative to US dollars, as well. Similar to the peso's challenges versus the dollar, the real is devalued at 17% this year versus last year. When we embarked on this initiative, our intentions were to be very methodical and measured as we entered and learned about this market. Our objective was to assess whether or not our model was embraced by the Brazilian consumer and whether or not it was financially viable. We also wanted to very carefully manage the risk associated with entering a new market. We have determined that our model works well for the consumer and we continue to make good progress on the economic operating model, although we continue to operate at a loss currently. However, it is difficult to determine the long-term economic model with such a small group of stores. Therefore we've decided to reinitiate our store development efforts with a goal over the next few years to expand the store base to 20 to 25 locations. We characterize this as an expansion of our initial test. We haven't declared success or built long-term expansion plans but we are encouraged by the progress we have made and believe our progress warrants going to the next phase. Recapping this past quarter's performance for the company, in total our sales were $2.594 billion, an increase of 4% over last year's third quarter. Domestic same-store sales or sales for stores open more than one year were up 2% for the quarter. Gross margin for the quarter was 52.8% of sales, up 58 basis points. The improvement in gross margin was attributable to higher merchandise margins, partially offset by higher supply chain costs associated with current year inventory initiatives. In regards to inflation it remains subdued, down slightly last year. Currently we feel costs will be predictable and manageable. We remain cognizant of future developments regarding inflation and will make the appropriate adjustments, should they arise. SG&A for the quarter was 32.2% of sales, higher by 52 basis points from last year's third quarter. The increase in operating expense as a percentage of sales was due to higher legal expenses. The legal expense was driven by a single discrete item. I should also point out, like the previous two quarters, this fiscal year we had deleverage from our store payroll initiatives. We feel our customer service is a key differentiator for us versus the competition and we remain committed to investing in our AutoZoners. We continue to believe we are well positioned to manage our cost structure in response to our sales environment. EBIT for the quarter was $536 million, up 4.4% over last year's third quarter, our EBIT margin was 20.7%. Interest expense for the quarter was $34 million, compared with $32 million in Q3 a year ago. We expect our upcoming fourth quarter's interest expense to be up from last year's fourth quarter by a similar amount. As we sold $650 million in bonds this past quarter, the coupon was higher than the retired commercial paper, thereby raising interest expense. Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $4.95 billion or approximately $400 million more than last year's balance of approximately $4.5 billion. Our adjusted debt level metric finished the quarter at 2.56 times EBITDAR. While in any given quarter we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on management's opinion regarding debt and equity market conditions, we remain committed to both our investment grade rating and our capital allocation strategy and share repurchases are an important element of that strategy. For the quarter, our tax rate at 34.8% was lower than last year's Q3 tax rate. This rate was lower than planned, as we had a discrete item that lowered our tax rate, an expected ongoing rate for us is approximately 36%. Net income for the quarter was $328 million and up 6% over last year. Our diluted share count of 30.4 million was down 5.9% from last year's third quarter. The combination of these factors drove earnings per share for the quarter to $10.77, up 12.6% over the prior year's third quarter. As Bill said in the press release this morning, the quarter was impacted by a legal charge, along with a discrete tax benefit, which netted to a reduction to earnings per share of $0.11 per share. Now, related to the cash flow statement, for the third fiscal quarter we generated $516 million of operating cash flow. Net fixed assets were up 5.6% versus last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $113.3 million and reflected the additional expenditures required to open 41 new locations this quarter, capital expenditures on existing stores, hub and mega hub store remodels or openings, work on development of new stores for upcoming quarters, and information technology investments. With the new stores opened we finished this past quarter with 5,226 stores in 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, 458 stores in Mexico, and 8 in Brazil, for a total AutoZone store count of 5,692. We also had 25 IMC branches open at fiscal quarter end, taking our total locations to 5,717. Depreciation totaled $69 million for the quarter versus last year's third quarter expense of $62 million, in line with the recent quarter growth rates. With our excess cash flow we repurchased $533 million of AutoZone stock in the third quarter. At quarter end we had $765 million remaining under our share buyback authorization and our leverage metric was 2.56 times at quarter end. Again, want to stress we manage to appropriate credit ratings and not any one metric. The metric we report is meant as a guide only as each rating firm has its own criteria. We continue to view our share repurchase program as an attractive capital deployment strategy. Accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 110.9%. Next, I'd like to update you on our inventory levels in total and on a per location basis, the company's inventory increased 3.7% over the same period last year, driven primarily by new stores over the last 12 months. Inventory per location was $629,000, consistent with last year, and $633,000 last quarter. Finally, as Bill previously mentioned, our continued disciplined capital management approach resulted in return on invested capital for the trailing four quarters of 31.2%. We have and will continue to make the investments that we believe will generate returns that significantly exceed our cost of capital. Now I'll turn it back to Bill Rhodes. Bill Rhodes : Thanks, Bill. We are very pleased to report our 39th consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth, growing this quarter at a rate of 12.6% over last year. To execute at a high level, we have to consistently adhere to Living the Pledge. We cannot and will not take our eye off of execution, success will be achieved with a strong attention to detail and exceptional execution. We are confident in our initiatives, and we are pleased with the progress we are making in rolling out our new supply chain model by delivering inventory to our stores on a more frequent basis. In addition, the performance of our mega hubs has been strong and ahead of our expectations and we look forward to opening more. We believe these initiatives will benefit both our retail and commercial businesses. Our long-term model is to grow new store square footage at a low single digit growth rate, and we expect to continue growing our commercial business at an accelerated rate. Therefore, we look to routinely grow EBIT dollars in the mid single-digit range or better in times of strength, and we leverage our very strong and predictable cash flow to repurchase shares, enhancing our earnings per share growth into double-digits. We feel the track we are on will allow us to continue winning for the long term. We believe our steady, consistent strategy is correct. It is the attention to details and consistent execution that will matter. Our belief is that solid, consistent strategy, combined with superior execution drives success. Our charge remains to optimize our performance, regardless of market conditions, and continue to ensure we are investing in the key initiatives that will drive our long-term performance. In the end, delivering strong earnings per share growth and ROIC each and every quarter is how we measure ourselves. We are proud of our results this past quarter. But we are capable of doing better. We have a lot of work in front of us, but the future looks bright. Now we'd like to open up the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Simeon Gutman of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Simeon Gutman : Thanks. Good morning. Could you guys - can you share with us the spread between the weather and non-weather affected markets? Bill Rhodes : Yes. It was roughly 500 basis points. Simeon Gutman : Okay. So if its \u2013and I guess we could make some assumptions on the percentage of stores that are affected. But if you look then at the non-weather affected markets, then that would probably equal something between a 3 and a 4 comp, I don't know if you'd agree or disagree with it. But if you look at that trajectory, are there any changes in those markets, whether it's internal efforts from some of the supply chain investments, anything miles driven in those markets, I mean, what's the trajectory like in the non-weather, is there anything notable? Bill Rhodes : Yes, I would start with any time you're in the springtime, regardless of the markets you're in, things are changing. They're pretty volatile week-to-week. That's just the nature of the spring business. But I would say that the unaffected markets that we were talking about generally performed consistently with how they've been performing the last couple of quarters. Simeon Gutman : Okay. That's fair. And then in the commentary you were talking about the distribution strategy, the DCs and the mega hub. Maybe it was the tone, but you sounded a little more bullish than you did in the last quarter. I don't know if that's the right read or not. But in general can you talk about the changes you are seeing or the adoption you are seeing with the distribution rollout? Bill Rhodes : Well, I would say a couple of things on that front. I wouldn't say I'm necessarily more bullish. I think we continue to be pleased with the performance of the multiple deliveries per week program. We've said all along that as we rolled out the mega hubs they were outperforming our expectations. I guess, there was one piece of negative news and that is we updated our guidance on what our new distribution centers are going to cost. They are going to cost substantially more amount of money as we got further into the due diligence. But we believe in this strategy we're rolling it out. We're pleased with the performance so far. We can see how it is benefiting our business and think it will only gain more traction over time. Simeon Gutman : Okay. Thank you. Bill Rhodes : Yes. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of David Schick of Consumer Edge Research. Your line is now open. David Schick : Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking my question. I was hoping you could update us on the competitive environment. There's a lot going on out there, just your view on that. And then anything you could add on how you're thinking about SKU additions to the autoanything.com? Thank you. Bill Rhodes : Thanks, Dave. On the competitive environment, number one, we have fantastic competitors. We have a lot of very strong competitors and have for a number of years, and that's both on the retail side and the commercial side. There is more than normal going on in the competitive environment. Obviously we have one competitor that's going through an integration effort and they're converting and or closing some stores. We're obviously monitoring that very closely and seeing how we can optimize our performance. But the biggest thing that we're focused on is us and our initiatives. We've got to make sure we believe in the game plan that we have and we've got to execute that game plan. So, I don't want to get too overly focused on what's happening short term in the competitive market. Bill Giles : An AutoAnything, that's obviously primarily focused on performance and accessories business. But as you may have seen, we are beginning to expand in some replacement parts on AutoAnything. That's still relatively new but we're continuing to expand the SKU count on the site to be more encompassing and to really take advantage of the name AutoAnything. David Schick : Thanks so much. Bill Rhodes : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Kate McShane of Citi Research. Your line is now open. Kate McShane : Thanks. Good morning and thanks for taking my question. My question is centered around commercial. I know you had said commercial was impacted by the weather, just as DIY was, and while accelerating in the quarter it didn't accelerate on the two year. How should we expect for the rest of the year to play out especially considering the two year stack? Bill Rhodes : Yes, clearly, our commercial performance, if you go back to Q4 of last year, our commercial performance has decelerated. We talked about some of that deceleration, but not all of that deceleration has been due to the number of new stores that are going through the maturation process. But there's still a gap and we are very focused on why that gap exists and what are we going to do about it. We talked on the last call about really significantly increasing the engagement of our district managers and our store managers in the commercial business. We said at the time that will take time. That's proving to be you true, but I'm very excited about getting those great leaders more involved in the commercial business. We're also looking at what else can we do to drive sales in this business over the long term. We think inventory availability is having an impact and will continue to have an impact over the long term. But we've got to get more acceleration in our commercial sales growth. Kate McShane : And just a follow up to the question prior about the competitive environment, do you have a sense of how much share gains is contributing to your business at this point and are you seeing more in DIY versus DIFM? Bill Rhodes : I think we're seeing pretty fairly significant share gains on both sides. Clearly the market, we grew 6.5% on the commercial. I don't think anybody thinks the commercial market grew 6.5%. Now, that's not as wide a gap as we had before, and then all the indicators that we have on the retail side of the business show that we continue to gain share. Kate McShane : Thank you. Bill Rhodes : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Dan Wewer of Raymond James. Your line is open. Dan Wewer : Thanks. I just wanted to drill into commercial a bit further. You did note that mega hubs are [exceeding plans] [ph], multiple delivery sounds like it's in line with expectation. And in the past you talked about stores with both initiatives, mega hub and increased fulfillment, to increase their weekly sales $1,000 to $1,500. But how do we reconcile those comments with the deceleration, that gap between 6.5% and 10% plus can't all be due to weather. So, is there any other company specific initiatives or challenges, let's say, with these initiatives that's not working out as you had intended? Bill Rhodes : Let's make sure I'm clear on one thing first, Dan, when we talked about $1,000 to $1,500 per store, that's both our retail and commercial business. And, frankly, more than half of that goes to the retail side of the business, okay. We do believe inventory availability and saying Yes, We've Got It more frequently will build to longer and stronger relationships with our customers over time. But I don't think it is a flip the switch, and obviously that's playing out to be true. You said, yes, weather was a material drag on commercial. Also this maturation cycle is a significant drag. But, frankly, there is some more sales that we haven't figured out why we're missing those and we're working on that. And I have a high degree of confidence we'll figure it out and hopefully reaccelerate our commercial growth rate. But it's not lost on us. We're marginally disappointed with our commercial sales performance and frankly, disappointed with our sales performance overall for the quarter. But we're not managing this business for one month or one quarter or frankly, even one year. Dan Wewer : Are you customers aware of the improved parts availability? Has that message been communicated recently? Bill Rhodes : Yes, absolutely. We have territory sales managers on the ground in those markets. And nobody's more excited about turning on a mega hub or getting increased frequency of delivery than a territory sales manager or a store manager and they are preaching that from the rooftops. Dan Wewer : And the last question I had, subtracting out the extra supply chain costs, it implies your merchandise margins are improving over 70 basis points year-over-year. Are we going through a new cycle of this gross margin expansion cycle or just the magnitude of further cost concessions from your vendors, is that accelerating? Bill Giles : I think it's probably a combination of both cost concessions and also sourcing. And so we've put a lot more time, energy and effort around improving our capabilities around sourcing. We've mentioned earlier that we had established an office overseas to help support that effort. That's still relatively immature. And so from our vantage point we're very pleased with the hard work the merchandising organization has done to improve our overall margin rates and we really think there is continued opportunity for us to continue on that track some time into the future. Obviously I don't know exactly what that rate will be, but we're really pleased with the health of the margin and our opportunity to continue to grow it. Dan Wewer : Okay. Thank you. Bill Giles : Thanks, Dan. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Matthew Fassler of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Matthew Fassler : Thanks, excuse me, thanks a lot and good morning. You are executing the enhanced distribution and supply chain efforts with increasingly tight inventories. Can you just give us some insight as to how you are pulling this off, where the inventory is relative to where you'd optimally like to see it please? Bill Giles : Actually, I'd say our overall inventory level right now at $629,000 a store is pretty close to where we think it should be able to sustain itself, between 629 and say, 640. I think that the more frequent delivery has allowed us to optimize some of the inventory even though we're increasing the amount of inventory we have in the mega hubs. So I think the organization's done a pretty good job of balancing out. We've obviously increased it pretty significantly, if you go back a couple of years. But we think that probably that 630, 640 is a pretty good range for us at the moment. Matthew Fassler : Got it. A second question, Bill Rhodes, you talked about data capture and deployment of that data. Can you talk about what if anything is changing in your capacity to get that done and how you would envision deploying some of this in the future? Bill Rhodes : Yes, I mean, if you think about it in the simplest form, we've acquired businesses over the years, and many of those businesses have some of the same customers that we have in the AutoZone business. So, think about ALLDATA and the customers that they overlap with our commercial customers, and think about IMC and some of the overlaps we have with those customers. So, we're really trying to build what we call one view of the customer, so that we have a holistic view of how we as an enterprise interact with that customer. And it's going to take us some time. We've been working on it\u2019s for a while, but it's very hard to get all those data sets the same. I'm really pleased with the work our IT organization's doing but it's going to take us a while. When we come out the other side of it we think we'll be in a much better position in the market to those customers, be they retail or commercial. Matthew Fassler : That's great. And then, finally, very briefly, you spoke about weather. You also spoke about traffic and ticket. To the extent that weather was an impact on the quarter and the markets where it was impacting you, is that felt more on the traffic side, on the ticket side or evenly? Bill Rhodes : It's generally more on the traffic side, Matt. You do see some compression, for instance, if your battery business is off, because its - then that's going to hurt your ticket because that's a high-price ticket. But most of it is in the traffic count. Matthew Fassler : Got it. Thank you so much, guys. Bill Rhodes : Yes. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Greg Melich of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Greg Melich : Thanks. I want to talk two things, one on sales and the other one is on payroll cost. First, on sales, I want to make sure I interpreted this right. Do we actually go negative in April, May? And if the two year stacks was stable through the quarter, why shouldn't we roll that into the fourth quarter because this is a harder comparison and assume comps are less than one. Then I had a follow-up on payroll costs. Bill Rhodes : To answer your first part of your question, they were flat to slightly negative in the latter part of the quarter. But really, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, Greg, sales were really volatile week-to-week, and it directly correlated with when those weather patterns were coming through. To your question about should you straight-line the two year comp, our premise at this point in time, as you know we don't give guidance. But we think the weather was a pretty significant headwind in this quarter. They are calling for a hot summer. We haven't seen it yet. It's starting to heat up around here a little bit, and hopefully it does in the Northeast. But we think if that comes to fruition we could have a pretty strong fourth quarter. Greg Melich : Got it. So, the point is the two-year would have been influenced by weather? Bill Rhodes : No question about it. Greg Melich : Okay. Great. And then the second question was, I think in your prepared comments, and maybe I read it in the release, the pressure on payroll cost. Could you describe where that's coming from, if any of that is due to the new Department of Labor salary to hourly switches or just help us understand what happened there and what we should expect? Bill Giles : Yes, I would think of it as more intentional. I think that we're very focused on improving customer service and so we've made some investments from a payroll perspective. Yes, we're getting some pressure from some of the regulatory environment in terms of wage rates, et cetera. But I would say that's much to a lesser extent currently. So today, I would say that it's more intentional from ensuring that we've got great customer service in the stores. Greg Melich : Okay. And, I guess, Bill, while I've got you, then, on the higher CapEx cost for the DCs, should we just take the current CapEx and for modeling out just sort of add $50 million to $60 million for three DCs over a couple years? Is there any other thing we should\u2026 Bill Giles : Yes, nothing much more dramatic than that, Greg. I mean, we've already added tractors and trailers to support more frequent deliveries. There will be a little bit more of that as we open up new distribution centers. But for the most part I would think of it as those three distribution centers over the next couple of years. Exactly right. Greg Melich : That's great. Hope it gets hot soon. Thanks, guys. Bill Giles : Me too. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Tony Cristello of BB&T. You may now ask your question. Tony Cristello : Hi. Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to ask a little bit about the IMC business. It sounds like there continues to be a lot of potential opportunity, but you don't discuss it much in terms of the plan for the rollout, just sort of integration into a potential to have those parts touch on some of your existing businesses. Can you elaborate a bit more on where you are in that rollout and how we should think about that alongside your initiatives to increase parts availability? Bill Rhodes : Yes, I would say, first of all, the premise behind the acquisition of IMC was it's a good business and we think it can be a great business and can be substantially larger than it is today. After we bought them, we quickly started increasing the branch count. We were at 17 branches less than 2 years ago when we acquired them. We're now at 25, that's over 50% growth or right at 50% growth. And frankly, we've probably got a little bit out in front of our skis, we were moving too fast for an organization that had not opened a lot of branches over time, and we were also doing a lot of integration with AutoZone. And so, we've slowed down a little bit and intend to slow down our branch growth and really work on the fundamentals of the business in the 25 branches that we have and then restart the branch expansion later. We are using, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we have about 700 stores that are using and selling IMC parts. That is just to supplement our commercial offerings. It's not going to be a radical change in the sales trajectory of our commercial business. But it's a nice way to say Yes, We've Got It to a commercial customer who has a unique need. Tony Cristello : And are the same territory managers or regional managers working on expanding that IMC as relationships of that part, as well as the newer initiatives? What I'm asking is, do you need to, as you grow your parts availability and your frequencies of delivery, add more sales in order to sort of educate and get that message out there? Bill Rhodes : Yes, as far as a separate sales organization, we have separate and distinct sales organizations for AutoZone, commercial, ALLDATA and IMC. Now, we are doing some work around them on lead generation between the three different businesses, but each one of those is really a standalone organization. As far as on the AutoZone side regarding mega hubs and increased frequency of delivery, at the current point we don't believe we need a significant expansion of our sales force. We've got a very talented sales force that we've built over the last seven or eight years and think they are performing well. We've just got to keep telling our story. Tony Cristello : Okay. And then just quick on a follow-up, I'm not sure if you categorized why you are increasing the cost in terms of those DC rollouts. Was there something that you found, whether it's automation or something, that you needed to provide, and I apologize if I missed it in the prepared remarks. Bill Rhodes : No, I don't think we addressed it. Frankly, we just missed our estimate. It's been a while since we built a distribution center. These are in different geographies which have different site preparation costs. It was just a function of we got deeper into the due diligence and found out they were going to be more expensive than we thought. It's the same general operating model that we've opened in the last couple of distribution centers we've opened. Tony Cristello : Great. Thank you for your time. Bill Rhodes : Yes. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Chris Horvers of JPMorgan. Your lines is now open. Chris Horvers : Thanks. Good morning, guys. Bill Rhodes : Morning. Chris Horvers : Bill, I want to get your thoughts on how much of the slowdown could simply be the lapping of the benefit of lower gas prices. Could you refresh us on what you thought the benefit of lower gas prices was to your business in 2015 impacted it and when you thought it peaked during the year? Bill Rhodes : Yes, I'm trying to remember back, I think we quantified it and said we thought it might be 1 point, 1.5 points, something like that. As we're thinking about gas prices currently and yes, they are elevated but they are still at historically low levels for the last decade or so. So, when we're thinking about it, yes, it may have muted that benefit, and maybe slightly a headwind, but we don't think it's a significant major driver. It will be interesting to watch what happens to miles driven as we get those data sets that show when gas prices started to increase. So far, all the miles driven data we've seen has been incredibly positive. Chris Horvers : Okay. So, I guess, said another way, it's not as if we have to - any of your business out perform by that point, 1.5, and it's not symmetrical where we maybe have to give that back versus what the underlying trend was? Bill Rhodes : No, what we've really seen is in gas prices the real shocks that we've seen have been when gas prices got to $4. And there seemed to be almost a magic switch there, that it changed customer behavior. People started changing where they lived or where they worked or using public transportation. There was a meaningful change in miles driven at those levels. Below those levels it's really hard to ferret out. Chris Horvers : Understood. Thanks very much, guys. Bill Rhodes : Yes. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Michael Lasser of UBS. You may now ask your question. Michael Lasser : Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. It's on the commercial side. If we look at your sales per commercial program, on a two year stack it decelerated to 3.5% from 5% the last couple of quarters. Can we attribute all of the 150 basis point sequential slowdown to the weather? Bill Rhodes : No. I think you can contribute some of it to the maturation cycle change. You can contribute some of it to the weather, and I think there's still a gap there that we haven't identified yet. Michael Lasser : So you previously talked about adding new commercial programs in areas where you already have a store, so there's some cannibalization impact. So are you still seeing that and is it now being compounded by the maturation curve issue such that\u2026 Bill Rhodes : No, I think cannibalization by definition is less today than it was three or four years ago when we were opening 400 programs. We're just not opening as many on top of the other programs. Michael Lasser : I guess, the question was getting at is, are those mature programs still in decline or has the decline started to abate? Bill Rhodes : Yes, I don't think they were ever in decline. I think that they were not growing as rapidly as we would have expected because that cannibalization was coming in. Now a specific store, if we open a store two miles down the road, yes, it might go in decline for six months. But as a general rule, most of them were continuing to grow. Michael Lasser : And Bill, my last question is, in your mind, did you have some time frame on how long it might take for these investments to pay off? And has that been slower than you expected and now you have updated thinking on the time frame for earning return there? Bill Rhodes : No, I think we're absolutely on par, if not ahead, with our initiatives, particularly the mega hubs. We see the performance every week. We know that they are outperforming where we thought we would be. We see the inventory, the frequency of deliveries, they continue to perform in line with our expectations, if not even a little bit ahead there. So, we're seeing that performance. There's just other things that are going on in the business too, that are giving us a little bit of headwind and that happens over time. Michael Lasser : Got it. Okay. Thank you so much and good luck. Bill Rhodes : Yes. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Bret Jordan of Jefferies. Your line is now open. Bret Jordan : Good morning, guys. Bill Rhodes : Morning. Bret Jordan : A quick question on IMC and those 700 stores that have same-day distribution of the catalog, are you seeing any impact on those commercial volumes relative to the other stores? Bill Rhodes : We're clearly seeing that we're selling some products to them, but it's not going to be a meaningful change in the overall performance of the commercial program. Bret Jordan : Okay. And then on AutoAnything, as you're beginning to put some replacement parts through that channel, is the pricing strategy the same or as you're selling on an online platform like AutoAnything, do you have to price against the RockAutos as opposed to the other brick and mortar retailers? Bill Giles : I'd say that we're focusing it more on an online strategy and we're basing it based on the level of value proposition that the online retailer has. So obviously returns are a little bit more difficult, you don't have the trustworthy advice that you have at a brick-and-mortar store. So we're pricing it appropriately based on that and based on the level of service that we provide. Bret Jordan : Are you differentiating the products so people don't wind up going to AutoAnything to buy the same thing cheaper that they could have bought at AutoZone? Bill Giles : Yes, it will be a different product, different brand, et cetera. Bret Jordan : All right, great. Thank you. Bill Rhodes : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Alan Rifkin of BTIG. Your line is now open. Alan Rifkin : Thank you very much. With respect to the 1,600 stores that are getting greater deliveries, can you maybe provide some color on the relative comp of those stores relative to the corporate average? Bill Rhodes : It's a great question, Alan, but we don't focus on it that way. What we're doing, we run simulations so we can understand what they wouldn't have sold. And those stores are all over the country. So some of these weather patterns that we're seeing would distort those views in certain areas versus other areas. I think we're just going to stick with what we've said all along, that we expect, when a store gets each of these two initiatives, then their sales will grow between $1,000, $1,500 per week, and we're seeing that's being confirmed in our test results, excuse me, our roll outs. Alan Rifkin : Okay. And on the commercial side, you said that it was slowing a little bit but could you maybe provide some color as to the increases? Is it coming from you new customers or are you just seeing greater traffic or greater ticket from already existing accounts? Bill Rhodes : I think we're seeing both. Clearly we're constantly out there trying to hunt for new accounts and build better relationships. We also are out there building deeper relationships with the customers that we have. So I would say it's on both sides. Alan Rifkin : Okay. Just a quick point of clarification, the two to three additional DCs does not include the one in Mexico you're adding later this year, correct? Bill Giles : That is correct. That's exactly right, Alan. Alan Rifkin : Thanks for that clarification. Thank you. Bill Rhodes : All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our last question is coming in the line of Scot Ciccarelli of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Bill Rhodes : It sounds like Scot - I think he already asked a question. So we'll just go into the closing. Before we conclude the call I want to wish everyone a nice Memorial Day weekend, and look forward to updating you on our initiatives in September. While we're excited about our growth prospects for the remainder of the year, we will not take anything for granted as we understand our customers have alternatives. We have a solid plan to succeed this quarter, but I want to stress that this is a marathon and not a sprint. As we continue to focus on the basics and focus on optimizing long-term shareholder value, we are confident AutoZone will continue to be very successful. Thank you for participating in today's call. Operator : Thank you. That concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

Bill Rhodes : Good morning and thank you for joining us today for AutoZone's 2016 fourth quarter conference call. With me today are Bill Giles, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, IT and ALLDATA and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax. Regarding the fourth quarter, I hope you have had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not the press release along with slides complementing our comments today are available on our website, www.autozoneinc.com. Please click on quarterly earnings conference calls to see them. To begin this morning, I want to thank all AutoZoners across the globe for another solid quarter and year. 2016 was a very busy and productive year for us. We continued growing our business on many fronts. Our U.S. retail business expanded again in 2016 with the opening of another 156 new stores. Our commercial business continues to gain traction growing sales 7.1% for the year with 249 net new programs opened. We now have the commercial program in 83% of our domestic stores having opened 969 net new programs in just the past three years and we continue to expand our presence in Mexico. This quarter we celebrated the opening of our 483rd store. We didn't open any additional stores in Brazil this quarter and opened one for the year ending the year with eight stores in operation. Lastly, we opened six new IMC branches during the year with one opening in the fourth quarter. We continue to see significant opportunities to open new stores and commercial programs in all of the geographies where we operate. We currently have approximately 90% of our total company sales coming from our domestic AutoZone stores. While the domestic business dominates our sales mix and continues to be our primary focus, we believe we have great growth opportunities outside the U.S. for many years to come. I would expect the international mix of our business to only grow from here. In 2016, we expanded our online offerings in both our traditional autozone.com and autozonepro.com website as well as on AutoAnything. Along with these strategic investments, we spend a lot of time on initiatives to drive our core domestic retail business. DIY operations remain our number one priority. Our DIY business continues to grow and remains the largest portion of our sales. Also, DIY continues to generate tremendous returns. We continue to see opportunities for new store growth and improved productivity in our existing stores, which positions us well in this business for years to come. As our commercial business continues to grow and is intertwined with our retail business, we have continued with our inventory placement and distribution initiatives in order to respond to the ever increasing challenge of parts proliferation in the industry. This past year, we opened six additional hub locations and expanded our mega hub count to 11 increasing by six for the year. We have also continued to expand our multiple frequency of deliveries from our DCs to over 1,900 stores and we are continuing with our new distribution center strategy with an expectation of having two new domestic DCs open over the next three years. Our current expectations are for the first facility to come online in late fiscal 2017 or early 2018, while the other will open six to 12 months later. Along with improving our local parts availability and assortment, we continue to manage this organization to provide exceptional service for our customers, provide our AutoZoners with a great place to work with opportunities for advancement and ensure that we do it on a profitable basis to provide strong returns for our shareholders. To this end, our National Sales Meeting in Memphis next week will be entirely focused on providing WOW! Customer Service while focusing on saying, Yes! We've Got It, to all of our customers' parts, products and advice needs. Like everything at AutoZone, our pledge starts with putting customers first and we will continue to stress the importance of going the extra mile to fulfill our customers' needs regardless of how difficult the request. Last year we made the Yes! We've Got It theme a key priority. For 2016, we focused on literally getting the merchandise SKUs into our network of DCs, mega hubs, hubs and stores. This year is different and requires a different message because we have more ways to solve our customers' desires than ever before. This year is about ensuring our store AutoZoners are able to utilize the significantly enhanced availability and close the sale. It is also surprising and disappointing to see how many customers leave our stores every day not having completed their intended purchase because we didn't have or couldn't find what they needed within our network. In this spirit, to help the customer we are making ongoing significant systems enhancements to capture data about our customers' shopping patterns across all of our platforms. We understand we have to be able to share information and process seamlessly between our stores, commercial shops, phone and online experiences in order to meet all of our customers' needs. Before getting into specifics on the fourth quarter, I would like to take a moment to go into detail on our inventory availability initiatives. These are two very discreet and different strategies addressing different opportunities. Multiple frequency of delivery is solely focused on improving the in-stock levels for the SKUs that are stocked in our stores. And the mega hubs are focused on adding additional coverage to the local markets meaning adding SKUs that would not have been available before. We tested these two enhancements for a couple of years before beginning our implementation. In our test, when combined, the initiatives were increasing sales between $1,000 and $1,500 per store per week. It is easier to evaluate the mega hub success because we would have had to order these parts through our special order system or bought them from someone else historically. The multiple frequency of deliveries initiative is more difficult to evaluate because we have transferred the merchandise from a different store or sent the customer to a different store. We been very pleased with the implementation of both of these initiatives to-date, but we are still working on methods to quantify their exact benefits as it is not lost on us that it's hard to see the benefit showing up in our 1% domestic same store sales increase. However, we are confident that we are providing better customer service and our in-stock positions are noticeably higher. Additionally, as is our custom we are studying our performance on various elements and as we complete these reviews we are optimistic we will find optimization opportunities to enhance our performance even further. Regarding multiple frequency of deliveries, we have implemented this enhanced service in roughly 1,000 additional stores during fiscal 2016 and now have over 1,900 of our nearly 5,300 domestic stores receiving deliveries from their distribution center at least three times per week. Some stores receive more weekly deliveries than three, but weekly volumes determine needs as the sales lift from delivering to every store every day can't justify the higher expense. Therefore, we have settled on a more staggered approach. I should emphasize, this is up from the usual once-a-week delivery schedules we have historically run. With approximately 23,000 SKUs in an average AutoZone store, our inventory turns at a relatively low rate, around 1.4 times per year. The vast majority of our SKUs have an on-hand quantity of one. Therefore, given the randomness of demand, there is potential for out-of-stocks. It is important to note that our current plans do not contemplate providing this level of service to all stores. It just isn't currently economically viable everywhere. Over the next 12 months, we expect to roll this increased frequency model to roughly an additional 1,000 stores. We are targeting to have around 3,000 stores receiving this level of service by the end of fiscal 2017. We continue to model 15 to 20 basis points of gross margin headwind from this initiative in 2017. The second ongoing initiative is the mega hub store concept. With 11 now open, we will open and/or expand another handful of mega hub stores in 2017. We are very excited about what the mega hubs allow us to offer our customer. As a reminder, these supersized AutoZone stores carry 80,000 to 100,000 unique SKUs, approximately twice what a hub store carries today. They provide coverage to both surrounding stores and other hub stores multiple times a day or on an overnight basis. Our sales results thus far in our open mega hubs continue to exceed our expectations. At the end of the year, we had over 3,000 stores with access to mega hub inventory. Now, not all of these 3,000 stores were having mega hubs SKUs delivered the same day, a majority of these stores received overnight deliveries from mega hub locations and will continue until we open more mega hubs. We expect to ultimately operate 25 to 40 mega hubs once the implementation is complete. While there was incremental costs to these rollouts in payroll and fuel to manage the extra deliveries to surrounding stores, we continue to feel these investments will provide a better customer experience and increased market share. Our assumption for this rollout is that we won't experience meaningful deleverage from this initiative in fiscal 2017. In order to support more frequent deliveries to new stores as well as the mega hubs, we are moving forward on our planned openings of two domestic distribution centers over the next few years. For your modeling purposes, each new distribution center is expected to cost approximately $60 million and those expenses began to flow in a small way in our CapEx spend in 2016. 2017 will have a more substantial amount of the spending. We don't expect any distribution center to come online until late fiscal 2017 or early 2016. Now let's turn to our fourth quarter results. Our sales increased 3.3%. Our domestic same-store sales were up 1%. This quarter sales result were stronger at the end of the quarter. While every month had positive comp performance, it was clear to us that the lingering effects of last year's mild winter hampered our growth, especially in the Northeast, Midwest and mid-Atlantic markets. This is similar to 2012 when we also experienced a mild winter. We highlighted on last quarter's call, our belief that a hot summer could offset the mild winter. Clearly, later in the quarter the heat helped as our heat related categories performed well for the quarter, but we weren't able to completely offset the mild winter's effects. Last year, we mentioned roughly 500 basis point spread in comp store results between the Northeast, Midwest and mid-Atlantic markets and the rest of the chain. While it was less than 500 basis points this quarter, it was still over 400 basis points. At the end of the quarter, the spread tightened a bit. However, our expectation is that this overhang will persist until we get a robust winter weather pattern again. In regard to our three primary merchandise categories, failure, maintenance and discretionary merchandise, we didn't experience any significant divergence of trends. Failure and maintenance for AutoZone represented approximately 85% of our domestic business. This was usual for this time of year. Again, all categories were positive but their performance was significantly different based on regionality. While our ticket was positive for DIY and commercial, we saw traffic slightly negative for our DIY business. Again, regional performance played a key role in this result. We opened 116 net new commercial programs in the quarter versus 134 programs last year. For the year, we opened 249 net programs reaching 83% of our domestic store base. While our sales grew 7.1% on the year in commercial, our programs open grew by 6%. As our programs mature, we believe our sales potential remains strong. As part of our strategy of increasing inventory levels in local markets, we opened four mega hub locations during the quarter. Over time, we expect to open more hub and mega hubs in order to provide more inventory closer to our customers. Regarding Mexico, we opened 25 stores this quarter and now have 483 total stores. In local currency, Mexico experienced a strong year. However, Mexico sales in U.S. dollars were below historic growth rates, given the roughly 9% decrease in the value of the peso to the U.S. dollar based on fiscal year end rates. Additionally, we are in the final stages of building our second distribution center in Mexico and it is scheduled to begin servicing stores in the first quarter of 2017. Sales in our other businesses for the quarter were up 4.3% over last year. As a reminder, our ALLDATA and e-commerce businesses, which includes AutoZone.com and AutoAnything, make up this segment of sales. While we are excited about our online sales opportunities and growth potential, we believe expectations for our space to experience growth like in other merchandise categories is not likely. We recognize the majority of our site traffic is providing information to our customers prior to purchase and our e-commerce platform represents an important part of our omnichannel experience. We see customers doing lots of research to learn about the products and how to do their repairs. While these businesses are small for us at less than 5% of our total sales mix for the quarter, the omnichannel experience is important and we will continue to invest in our e-commerce platform. With the continued aging of the car population, we continue to be optimistic regarding trends for our industry in both DIY and DIFM. As new vehicle unit sales are reaching all-time highs and gas prices on average are down year-over-year, miles driven continue to increase. The lower end customer benefits the most from lower gas prices relative to income. This trend is encouraging. Regarding our expectations for 2017, our first and second quarter results are more difficult comparisons. However, we are optimistic we can grow sales in all of our upcoming quarters. While having underperformed in the Northeast, Midwest and mid-Atlantic during the winter and beyond this past year, we believe we should improve in these regions. As our history has shown, we manage this business focusing on both short and long-term performance. We will continue to balance short-term and long-term performance and will be keenly focused on delivering consistent strong performance and extending our streak of 40 consecutive quarters of double-digit EPS growth. However, with our delivery frequency initiative, our expanding mega hubs and the opening of new DCs, we will likely have some headwinds on our operating margin. Now let me review our highlights regarding execution of our operating theme for 2016, Live the Pledge. The key priorities for the year were one, great people providing great service, two, profitably growing our commercial business, three, leveraging the Internet, four, improving inventory availability and five, Yes! We've Got It. On the retail front this past quarter, under the great people providing great service theme, we continued with our intense focus on improving execution. While we have been adding store payroll this year, we are now enhancing our training to store level AutoZoners increasing the share of voice regarding availability with the Yes! We have Got It theme. We have been aggressive on our technology investments and believe these initiatives will help differentiate us on a go-forward basis. We realize as customers have become much more tech and mobile savvy, we have to have a sales proposition that touches all the ways they desire to interact with us. Our current and future technology investments will lead to sales growth across all of our businesses. In regards to commercial, we opened 116 net new programs during the quarter. For the year, we opened 249 net new programs versus 296 last year. Our expectation is we will continue to open new programs in the range of 200 to 250 programs in 2017. While our commercial sales results were below our expectations this year, the entire industry sales were below our expectations. In previous years, we saw the commercial business grow for our industry in the low to mid-single-digit range while we grew at double digits. It appears to us the industry, predominantly from the impact of a mild winter in the northern part of the country, grew at a much slower rate in 2016. While our sales growth rate slowed versus last year's pace, the industry saw a similar slowdown in growth. Our data shows we again saw our sales gaining share this past quarter. Regional discrepancies played a big role in commercial as well as retail. As we continue to improve our product assortments and availability and as we make other refinements to our offerings, we expect that the estimated sales potential from the market will grow. Our results continue to provide us confidence to be aggressive in making additional resources, adding additional resources and new programs to this important growth initiative. We should also highlight another strong performance in return on invested capital as we were able to finish 2016 at 31.3%. We are very pleased with this metric as it is one of the best, if not the best, in all of hardlines detail. However, our primary focus has been and continues to be that we ensure every incremental dollar of capital that we deploy in this business provides an acceptable return well in excess of our cost of capital. It is important to reinforce that we will always maintain our diligence regarding capital stewardship as the capital we invest is our investor's capital. Before I pass the discussion over to Bill Giles to talk about our financial results, I would like to thank and reinforce how proud we are of our entire organization's efforts to manage the business appropriately and prudently. 2016 was not an easy year. While our industry's performance was volatile, we asked our organization to accomplish a tremendous amount. Even with our ongoing supply chain initiatives as well as new store openings, we were ready to continue to provide WOW! Customer Service to all of our customers. 2017 will be no different. We are looking forward to an even better 2017 because of our AutoZoners' efforts in 2016. Now I will turn the call over to Bill Giles. Bill? Bill Giles : Thanks Bill and good morning, everyone. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to talk more specifically about our retail, commercial and international results. For the quarter, total auto parts sales which include the domestic retail and commercial businesses, our Mexico and Brazil stores and our 26 IMC branches, increased 3.3%. Let me touch on domestic macro trends for a second. During the quarter, nationally unleaded gas prices started out at $2.22 a gallon and ended the quarter at $2.24 a gallon, a $0.02 increase. Now, last year gas prices decreased $0.18 per gallon during the fourth quarter, starting at $2.69 and ending at $2.51 a gallon. We continue to believe gas prices have a real impact on our customers' ability to maintain their vehicles and as cost reductions help all Americans, we hope to continue to benefit from this increase in disposable income. We also recognize the impact of miles driven on cars over 10 years old, the current average is much different than on newer cars in terms of wear and tear. Miles driven increased 2% in May and 3.2% in June and we don't have July or August data yet. But year-to-date through June, miles driven were up 3.3% and ahead of last year's increase at this time. The other statistic we highlight is the number of seven year and older vehicles on the road, which continues to trend in our industry's favor. For the trailing 52 weeks ended, total sales per AutoZone store were $1,773,000. Now for the quarter, total commercial sales increased 5.2%. In the fourth quarter, commercial represented 19% of our total sales and grew $32 million over last year's Q4. This past quarter, we opened 116 net new programs versus 134 programs opened in our fourth quarter of last fiscal year. We now have our commercial program in 4,390 stores supported by 182 hub stores. Approximately 1,000 of our programs are three years old or younger. It's important to highlight that we accelerated our new program growth over the past few years as approximately 22% of our programs are younger than three years old. However, we focused on a more deliberate opening schedule starting this past year. We feel openings in the range of 200 to 250 is more realistic for our future growth. Not only is it easier to hiring staff, but also allows us the ability to devote resources to our existing programs. During fiscal 2016, our sales growth in commercial decelerated. Some but certainly not all of a deceleration was due to fewer new programs going through the maturation cycle. Our growth was also negatively impacted by what we perceived to be an overall industry slowdown in commercial, particularly in the Northeast, Midwest and mid-Atlantic markets. As we exited 2016, our trends had accelerated modestly, which is encouraging to us. We are very focused on having a great sales team and having much stronger engagement of our store management teams particularly the store managers and district managers. We remain confident that we will continue to gain market share with our commercial customers. I complete my comments here by saying, we feel 2017 should be better sales growth year than 2016. This belief is based on all of the initiatives we have in place. Our Mexico stores continued to perform well. We opened 25 new stores during the fourth quarter and 42 for the full year. We currently have 483 stores in Mexico. This upcoming year, we expect to open similar 40 new stores and we are on target to open our new distribution center in October. This will be our second DC in the country and it will support Central Mexico store growth. As Bill said earlier, we were challenged by difficult foreign exchange rate in regard to the peso. While sales in base currency were above plan this past year, the devaluation in the peso is much greater than we assumed at the start of the year. The peso devalued over the course of the year. This created a headwind that caused our reported U.S. dollar EBIT to be lower than if rates had remained constant. If EBIT dollar impact on the quarter assuming constant currency with last year's exchange rate was meaningful, it's $10 million impact to EBIT. We feel the Mexico leadership team did an exceptional job managing the peso denominated business. Regarding Brazil, we currently are operating eight stores. Our plans are to open between 15 and 20 stores over the next few years. While sales growth has been very encouraging, we have been challenged, like with Mexico, by a weak Brazilian real relative to U.S. dollars. Recapping this past quarter's performance for the company, in total, our sales were $3,399 million, an increase of 3.3% over last year's fourth quarter. Domestic same-store sales or sales for stores opened more than one year were up 1% for the quarter. Gross margin for the quarter was 52.8% of sales, up 30 basis points. The improvement in gross margin was attributable to lower acquisition costs, partially offset by higher supply chain costs associated with the current year initiatives. In regards to inflation, it has been down slightly year-over-year. Currently we feel costs will be predictable and manageable. We will remain cognizant of future developments regarding inflation and we will make the appropriate adjustments should they arise. Looking forward, we continue to believe there remains opportunity for gross margin expansion within both retail and commercial businesses, but our commercial business is growing at an accelerated rate and it has lower margins, which is adding pressure to our overall gross margins. It is important to note, we do not manage to target gross margin percentage. We also understand the headwinds expanding our distribution center deliveries will cause. We work diligently to offset these headwinds with a focus on lower acquisition cost. Our primary focus remains growing absolute gross profit dollars in our total auto parts segment. SG&A for the quarter was 32.1% of sales, lower by five basis points from last year's fourth quarter. SG&A as a percent of sales benefited from the favorable comparison to last year's higher legal costs, which was partially offset by our continued investment in store payroll. We continue to believe we are well positioned to manage our cost structure in response to our sales environment. EBIT for the quarter was $703 million, up 5.1% over last year's fourth quarter. Our EBIT margin was 20.7%. Interest expense for the quarter was $45.8 million compared with $47.1 million in Q4 a year ago. Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $4,924 million or approximately $300 million more than last year's balance of $4,625 million. Our adjusted debt-level metric finished the quarter at 2.5 times EBITDAR. While in any given quarter, we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on management's opinion regarding debt and equity market conditions, we remain committed to both our investment grade rating and our capital allocation strategy. And share repurchases are an important element of that strategy. For the quarter, our tax rate was 35.1% versus last year's Q4 of 35.5%. The deviation in results is primarily driven by the resolution of discrete tax items that arose. Net income for the quarter was $427 million, up 6.4% over last year. Our diluted share count of 29.8 million was down 5.2% from last year's fourth quarter. The combination of these factors drove earnings per share for the quarter to $14.30, up 12.2% over the prior year's fourth quarter. Relating to the cash flow statement for the fourth fiscal quarter, we have generated $530 million of operating cash flow. Net fixed assets were up 6.5% versus last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $189 million and reflected the additional expenditures required to open 99 new locations this quarter along with capital expenditures on existing stores, hubs and mega hub store remodels or openings, work on the development of our new stores for upcoming quarters and development of our new Mexico DC, some investments in our new domestic DCs and information technology investments. For all of fiscal 2016, our CapEx was approximately $489 million. With the new stores opened, we finished this past quarter with 5,297 stores in 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, 483 stores in Mexico and eight in Brazil, for a total AutoZone store count of 5,788. We also had 26 IMC branches open at fiscal year-end, taking our total locations to 5,814. Depreciation totaled $94 million for the quarter versus last year's fourth quarter expense of $87 million, in line with recent quarter growth rates. With our excess cash flow, we repurchased $370 million of AutoZone stock in the fourth quarter. At year-end, we had $395 million remaining under our share buyback authorization and our leverage metric was 2.5 times at year-end. Additionally, this morning, we increased our authorization an additional $750 million, taking our total authorization outstanding to $1,145 million. Again I want to stress, we manage through appropriate credit ratings and not any one metric. The metric we report is meant as a guide only as each rating firm has its own criteria. We continue to be view our share repurchase program as an attractive capital deployment strategy. Accounts payable, as a percent of gross inventory, finished the quarter at 112.8%. Next, we would like to update you on our inventory levels in total and on a per store basis. The company's inventory increased 6.1% over the same period last year driven primarily by new stores during the fiscal year. Inventory per location was $625,000 versus $610,000 last year and $629,000 just last quarter. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventory less accounts payable on a per location basis, was a negative $80,000 versus a negative $79,000 last year and a negative $69,000 this past quarter. Finally, as Bill previously mentioned, our continued disciplined capital management approach resulted in return on invested capital for the trailing four quarters of 31.3%. We have and we will continue to make investments that we believe will generate returns that significantly exceed our cost of capital. Now I will turn it back to Bill Rhodes. Bill Rhodes : Thank you Bill. We are pleased to report our 40th consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth and for the year to report an EPS growth rate of 13%. We are also quite pleased with all we accomplished during 2016. While we experienced more regional sales differences than either planned or usual, our company executed exceptionally well. Our focus remains on being successful over the long run. That success will be attributable to our approach to leveraging our unique and powerful culture and focusing on the needs of our customers. To execute at a high level, we have to consistently adhere to living the pledge. We cannot and will not take our eye off of execution. We must stay committed to executing day-in and day-out on our game plan. Success will be achieved with an attention to detail and exceptional execution. Before I conclude, I want to take this opportunity to reflect on fiscal 2016. We were able to build on past accomplishments and deliver some impressive results. In recognition of the dedication, passion and commitment of our AutoZoners, I want to highlight that we grew sales to a record $10.6 billion this past year and we grew same-store sales at 2.4% and we continued with our double-digit EPS growth streak, reaching our 40th consecutive quarter. We grew our store base in Mexico and managed our expenses exceptionally well in spite of the foreign currency headwind with the peso. We continued with our IMC integration, opened six new branches and now have 26 in total. Our inventory availability rollouts continued on plan. I could not be more proud of the tremendous work everyone on these projects contributed. And lastly, we are talking more, more about saying Yes! We've Got It to our customers. We are determined to meet all our customers' needs in 2017. Our offerings are the best they have ever been and we are determined to communicate this to our customer base. At the end of the day, our customers have choices and we must exceed their expectations. Again, we are excited about our initiatives around inventory assortments and availability, hub stores, commercial growth, Mexico, ALLDATA, eCommerce, Brazil and IMC. Our long-term model is to grow new store square footage at a low single-digit growth rate and we expect to continue growing our commercial business at an accelerated rate. Therefore, we look to routinely grow EBIT dollars in the mid-single-digit range or better in times of strength. And we leverage our very strong and predictable cash flow to repurchase shares, enhancing our earnings per share growth into double digits. We feel the track we are on will allow us to continue winning for the long run. We believe our steady, consistent strategy is correct. It is the attention to detail and consistent execution that will matter. Our belief is solid, consistent strategy combined with superior execution is a formula for success. Our charge remains to optimize our performance regardless of market condition and continue to ensure we are investing in the key initiatives that will drive our long-term performance. In the end, delivering strong EPS growth and ROIC each and every quarter is how we measure ourselves. With 2016 behind us now, we must remain committed to delivering on our strategic and financial objectives. I can't wait to sit down and talk with our leadership team at our upcoming national sales meeting. This team is comprised of the best leaders in our industry. We are launching our Yes! We've Got It theme and I know our leaders, combined with our talented team of more than 84,000 AutoZoners will do a fantastic job in 2017. Now we would like to open up the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will be from Mr. Alan Rifkin of BTIG. Your line is now open. Alan Rifkin : Thank you very much. My first question has to do with commercial. As you continue to expand the MFT program as well as the hubs and the mega hubs and I realize that certainly you are earlier in the program on some versus others, but as you assess the expenses associated with each of these initiatives and the potential benefits, how would you rank order where between the three of these initiatives you think can be most profitable to you down the road? Bill Rhodes : Help me with the three. Are you talking about multiple frequency of deliveries, mega hubs and what was the third one, Alan? Alan Rifkin : And hub stores, Bill. Bill Rhodes : And hub stores. Yes, I would say hub stores are pretty much baked in the cake at this point in time. We will open a few more. They have been a great addition to our strategy and we will continue to leverage them long-term, always looking for more opportunities to leverage them further. As I said in our prepared remarks, the mega hubs continue to outperform our expectations. They are doing really, really well. We have got 11 of them now. We will hopefully open more than a handful this year and are proceeding very well with that. That one is much easier to measure and qualify the results. Multiple frequency of delivery, because you are talking about the randomness of demand, it's a little bit harder to evaluate that. In our test store, we feel very good about it. We are just trying to go back now and validate it. But I would say, the mega hubs are out performing at this point in time and we are continuing to try to refine both multiple frequency of delivery and mega hubs. Alan Rifkin : Okay. Thank you. And my follow-up, if I may, it was mentioned during the call that the trends accelerated elevated as the quarter ended. I was wondering if maybe you could provide a little bit of color on the performance within the quarter of the weather impacted versus non-weather impacted markets or discretionary versus non-discretionary items, just to give a little bit more clarity around what drove the comp? Thanks. Bill Rhodes : Yes. Clearly the quarter started softer than it ended. I don't want to overstate that. These were modest improvements that kind of built throughout the quarter. As you know, it got much hotter around July 1. And as we said on the last call, heat's going to help us in the summertime and it certainly did. We saw those benefits across the board in those in heat-related categories. And yes, we saw the weather impacted regions improve modestly, but I think as we have said before, we think that it's going to have a lingering effect until we get into a more normalized winter. Alan Rifkin : Okay. Thank you very much. Bill Rhodes : All right. Thank you Alan. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will be from Mr. Seth Sigman of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Seth Sigman : Thanks. Good morning guys. Just a follow-up on that last question. So is it fair to assume that the gap between the stronger and weaker markets has continued to narrow here in the first quarter, even if just modestly? Bill Rhodes : Yes. We have got kind of a standing practice. We announce our earnings so early in the quarter that we really don't want to get into this quarter's results. We are three weeks in and things can't just happen in three week periods. So I don't ever want to talk about what's happened in the current quarter. I am sorry. Seth Sigman : Understood. Maybe I will just ask it a different way. So is it your sense that the gap has really just been weather? Or could there be something else going on, either from a consumer perspective or a competitive perspective? And I guess on the consumer side, I think some of the regions that you have highlighted have also been highlighted by some other companies, even in different sectors. So just wondering your thoughts on that. Bill Rhodes : Yes. For us, I don't think the health of the consumer is really that significant of a driver. If you turn back the clock to 2009, 2010 and 2011 when everybody was really struggling, we performed exceptionally well. So I don't think we are a good barometer of the consumer and the consumer's health. I think the biggest differentiator for us has been the weather that happened in those parts of the country. We saw it back in 2012. We have gone back and studied it now. That's why we are saying we think the effects will linger until we get into a good, strong winter again. Seth Sigman : Okay. Thanks for that. And then just my follow-up question is on the online business. So you have mentioned a couple of times on the call. Can you talk a little bit about the expanded offerings that you mentioned and also some of the investments that you alluded to? And I guess ultimately do you expect to be spending more on online as we look out over the next year versus what we just saw? Thanks. Bill Rhodes : Yes. I think that we will continue to spend a little bit more on our eCommerce platforms, particularly on autozone.com. Because although our volumes may not be a significant from an eCommerce perspective, we have a lot of eyeballs coming to our site to learn more about our products or availability, maybe even get some repair information, et cetera. And we believe that that traffic migrates itself to the stores and winds up resulting in a purchase. So from an omnichannel perspective, our eCommerce platform is very important relative to providing a complete WOW! Customer Experience for our customers in terms of learning about the products, understanding the location of the stores, pricing, et cetera and then transferring that to the stores and then executing the transaction. We also make it easy for our customers to do buy online and pick up at store. So we are trying to be able to provide great service to the customers in any form that they want to be able to shop in. And so we think eCommerce is an important element of that and we will continue to invest in it. Seth Sigman : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question will be from Mr. Michael Lasser of UBS. Your line is open. Michael Lasser : Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Presumably, given your comp in the quarter, you are not seeing the $1,000 to $1,500 of incremental sales from all the initiatives you have put in place. So why do you think you are not seeing that as you expand the availability of those initiatives? Bill Rhodes : I am not sure that I am prepared to say that we are not seeing it or whether or not there's something else. As I mentioned, there was a 400 basis point impact in the comp. One of the things is, a lot of the multiple frequency of delivery work has been done in those weather impacted regions. So maybe it would have been more pronounced without it. What we are saying is, look, we hear you loud and clear. We don't see it showing up in the 1% comp, but it might be something else. We are going back to the drawing board and reassessing everything we can to make sure that we optimize those resources. At the end of the day, we know we are improving customer service and we know our in-stocks are up materially. That has to ultimately help our business. Michael Lasser : And Bill, on the whole online discussion, can you give us a sense of what your customer base on the DIY side breaks down between heavy DIYers and more casual DIYers? And how much of a sale is the nature of each transaction involved so we can kind of scope out what the potential risk is if this category doesn't go online? Bill Giles : I think that from an online perspective, we are seeing that mostly in somewhat nondiscretionary purchases as far as traffic is concerned and where it's going, et cetera. But I think also the way we think about online a little bit is there will always be an element of transactions that are going to occur online. But from our perspective, we provide trustworthy advice at the counter for the customer. We also provide an ability for us maybe to replace wiper blades or install batteries, et cetera. So there's a service element that takes place at the store as well. So there's a value proposition that takes place in the store that's different than anything you are going to receive online. You have got somebody you can talk to you, get repair information that can be printed out and provided to you, get somebody who can walk out to your car and look at it and help you assess what it is you want to accomplish. So in addition to that, there's cores attached to many of the products that we sell which create a two-way transaction. So there's all sorts of elements that from our perspective, we provide a great value proposition. And I know that there is a discrepancy in the pricing that you are going to see online versus what you get in the stores and that's all part of the equation. So we think from a long-term perspective that we are cognizant of those price discrepancies, but we will also make sure that we continue to add a value proposition that's warranted. Michael Lasser : Maybe I can just ask the question differently. What percentage of your DIY sales come from customers who spend more than $500 a year with you? Bill Giles : It would be exceptionally low. Michael Lasser : Okay. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will be from Mr. Simeon Gutman of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Simeon Gutman : Good morning guys. First question on the commercial sales program. Bill, you mentioned you are looking backwards or looking at all options, trying to figure out how to optimize it. What's your sense on the investments that you are making, the ones that are in place, are these things that will take time to get more traction? Or do you think that somehow you have to put more money or put more dollars or CapEx or more SG&A into it to drive the commercial growth? Bill Rhodes : Yes. I think it's something that has to mature over time. These are relationships built with customers over long periods of time. And because you enhance your availability either from in-stock position or from an expanded parts assortment, they are not necessarily going to switch to you over time. Particularly on the expanded parts assortment, when they are calling around and they find that you do have that product, that's going to help you move up that call list, but it's not going to happen overnight. Simeon Gutman : Okay. And then I guess maybe for Bill Giles, when you initially talked about the rollout of more frequent delivery, right? We dimensionalized the cost. I think it was 20, 30 basis points or so a year. I am not sure that included the rollout of DCs. And so next year, we talked about the DC starting to come into the picture. Does that mean the EBIT margin starts to get inhibited? I know you reiterated the earnings growth algorithm and it sounds pretty typical, but I am curious what happens at the line with margin. Could we see margins flat or if not, maybe down in this investment scenario? Bill Giles : I think that the MFT, like we said, was like you articulated, was 20 to 25 basis point impact on gross margin. When we roll out the distribution centers, just by the geographic nature of where they get rolled out, our anticipation is that some of the transportation cost savings will wind up offsetting a big chunk of that. So there may be a little bit of deleverage from the start-up perspective, but on an ongoing perspective, we would not expect the new distribution centers to really deleverage gross margin in any meaningful way. Simeon Gutman : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will be from with Ms. Kate McShane of Citigroup. Your line is open. Kate McShane : Thank you for taking my question. A couple of questions on commercial also from me. You had mentioned that commercial had been growing the low to mid single-digit range for the industry. Can you tell us how much you think the industry grew this year? And then second to that can you walk us through how you think about the maturation of programs weighing on your comp versus the market share gains you mentioned for commercial? Bill Rhodes : Let me get into the first one. We don't have the exact numbers of what happened in the commercial industry. From what we have seen, from watching our competitors and some of our public customers and what we have seen, we think it probably slowed 200 to 400 basis points year-over-year. That's not a very finite number, but we have certainly seen virtually everybody show a deceleration in their growth, particularly in the second half of our year. And I am sorry, what was the second part of your question? Kate McShane : You quantified some of the impact from weather, but I just was more curious about any kind of magnitude with regards to your commentary around the maturation of programs, which I know you have mentioned before, versus the market share gains you think you gained in commercial during the year. Bill Rhodes : Yes. The deceleration of our program growth and it wasn't just this year, it's really what's happened over the last three or four years, if we qualify that, it's about 300 basis points of the deceleration in our commercial growth. Kate McShane : Okay. Great. And just kind of a nuanced question, but I am curious why the mild winter can still impact your business before the actual winter hit? Is there still repairs from a severe winter happening in the months of June and July? And how much of that is the percentage of your business during those months? Bill Rhodes : Yes. It absolutely impacts it going forward and we can go and look at specific markets and see it crystal clear in their performance in certain categories. One of the things that happens in the wintertime in those regions is the snow and ice. Either we have to put salt down to take care of it or there's snow piles that are tearing up the roads. That puts pressure on the under-car parts. Think about chassis and the like. And also the salt makes things rust. And so they don't just rust that day. They rust over time and those rusted parts have to be replaced over time. So we are very confident that we understand what the weather implications are and we are also very confident that they kind of last until we get to another big winter cycle. Kate McShane : Thank you. Bill Rhodes : Yes. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will be from Mr. Chris Bottiglieri of Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Chris Bottiglieri : Hi. Great. Thanks for taking my question. First one I had was, it seems like you are hedging a little bit and I could be wrong here, but it seems in terms of the daily deliveries and if it ultimately will work. I am trying to understand in that core 20,000 SKUs, realistically how many of those need to be replaced more than once a week? Is there some kind of other median between the mega hub and the DCs that you could do to maybe service those SKUs? Then lastly, if you decide that mega hubs is a solution and daily delivery more than once or 2x a week isn't a solution, would you consider expanding the rollout of those mega hubs? Bill Rhodes : We are going as fast as we can go on the mega hubs. Nothing is holding us back, not capital, not operating expenses. We want to go as fast as we can go. The challenge of that is the real estate projects. And real estate projects can easily take two years from the time you initiate until the time you are completed. These are even more complex than our regular projects. So I don't think it would have any bearing on where we are with the mega hub rollout. But what I would characterize multiple frequency of delivery is yes, we are trying to find the benefits in the numbers and it's a little bit more difficult than we would like. We knew that going in. It was more difficult in the test as well. We also are looking at it at a more granular level and are trying to find some opportunities and are seeing some interesting things where we might have had some unintended consequences that we can reverse and improve on. So all we are saying is, we get it that it's hard to say. We have seen $1,000 to $1,500 per store and a 1% comp. That's not lost on us and we are going back to work to make sure we can find it. Chris Bottiglieri : Okay. That's great. And then just one related follow-up. Could you talk about the key drivers across the industry right now to the best you are able to? Are like-for-like SKUs still deflationary? What about part complexity? How much do you think it's adding to average selling prices? Maybe attempt to quantify that? Bill Giles : Yes. I think on the parts complexity, there's probably a natural inflation, right, that occurs from a technology perspective that we have seen over time and continue to see. So that helps us a little bit from inflationary perspective. On commodity or a cost basis, we have seen very little inflation. In fact, in some cases, deflation. So from that perspective, on an average transaction value, we would say that we have seen little benefit and possibly a slight deterioration from commodity based prices. And then that's been offset by some enhancements or increase, if you will, from technology inflation that always exist. So actually when you think about it over the last three years, our comp store sales, same with the industry, has probably not been helped by inflation. Inflation usually can be a help in terms of same-store sales and that just hasn't existed over the last couple of years. Chris Bottiglieri : Got you. Okay. It makes a lot of sense. Thanks again for your time. I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Next question will be from Mr. Seth Basham of Wedbush. Sir, you may begin. Seth Basham : Thanks a lot and good morning. Bill Rhodes : Good morning. Bill Giles : Good morning. Seth Basham : My question is around the lift you guys have gotten from the two initiatives, frequency of delivery and mega hubs. Of the $1,000 to $1,500 per week lift that you are experiencing, how much can you attribute to frequency of delivery versus mega hubs? Bill Rhodes : Yes. We really haven't quantified it because it's so hard to quantify it. But a little bit more than half, I would believe, from the multiple frequency of deliveries and the balance from mega hubs on a per store basis when it's rolled out. Seth Basham : Got it. That's helpful. Okay. And then secondly, I was just hoping you give us a little bit more perspective on the comp trend through the quarter. Not to beat a dead horse here, but as you think about the weakness earlier in the quarter and the strength at the end, was August in fact stronger from a comp trend perspective than July? Bill Rhodes : Yes. Seth Basham : Great. Thank you very much. Bill Rhodes : All right. Thank you Seth. Operator : Thank you. Next question will be from Mr. Matt Fassler of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Matt Fassler : Thanks a lot and good morning to you. I want to follow-up on a couple of comments you made online. First of all, I realize that online is less than 5% of your business, but can you give us a sense of the growth rate that you have experienced there, I guess particularly within AutoZone as you can think about it kind of on a full year basis? Bill Giles : I would say on AutoZone, it's going to grow at a faster rate slightly than the retail business, but you are right, Matt, it is less than a 5% business. It's growing a little bit. But our emphasis and focus on autozone.com is about providing customers with information because in more cases than not, they are executing that transaction in a store or even through a buy online, pick up in store or a visit to the store after they have visited the website. So we will continue to execute commerce on our website and we will continue to make it a better site in order to do that. But the real emphasis is creating that whole omnichannel experience for the customer between getting online, getting information and getting to the stores. Matt Fassler : And if I can ask a follow-up on that. So you have talked about the expertise of the parts pros behind the counter and you also talked about AutoAnything. If you go to the AutoAnything site, it leads right at the top with a live chat option and really stresses the presence of phone experts. And I realize that at AutoZone, you certainly have that in the store. Are you considering bringing some of that functionality, some of those features to the AutoZone site to make the brand truly omnichannel from a knowledge perspective as well as from a logistics perspective? Bill Giles : Probably to some extent. But you are right about AutoAnything. One of the real competitive differentiators is the online chat and the call center and the ability to help customers through more complicated transactions. And also to back on to, I think it was Michael's question before, I mean, the average transaction value on AutoAnything is dramatically even in what we experience in the store. So keep in mind that the majority of things that we are selling are way less than $100 per unit items and so they are significantly smaller tickets. Matt Fassler : Are you deliberately perhaps trying to position the websites differently at this point in time? Or is it a matter of time until you bring more functionality and more of that engagement opportunity to the zone site? Bill Giles : Yes. I think we will continue to enhance the zone site and continue to bring more and more functionality enhancements. But those two sites will always be positioned differently because one is strictly an online-only website and the other has the over 5,000 stores with 84,000 people being able to provide great customer service. So it's a different value prop. Matt Fassler : Great. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. Our last question is from Mr. Chris Horvers of JPMorgan Chase. Your line is open. Chris Horvers : I made it in. Thanks for taking my question. 10:59, so I wasn't sure. Bill Rhodes : Congratulations or condolences? Chris Horvers : So my question is, how do you think about the risk that sales trends decelerate from what you have seen in August and September? The hot summer is behind us. Are you seeing acceleration in non-heat affected categories? And related to that, do you think the boost from the lower gas prices last year is now getting behind us and it's a part of the outlook until we get to cold weather? Bill Rhodes : I think anytime gas prices are low, it's going to benefit us. Especially when you think about the impact of lowering gas prices on the low end consumer, that's putting more dollars in their pocket. No different than the fact that we see significant increases in our business when tax refunds happen in February and March. Whenever our customer has some money in their pocket, we seem to benefit from it fairly significantly. As for what are the trends going to be in Q1 and Q2, you know we don't really give guidance. As we look at Q1 and Q2 last year, we are comping against more difficult comparisons. We do believe that the weather implications or weather impacts are going to continue to be a bit of a headwind. But we like where we stand. We are going to continue to fight it out and do the best that we can every day. Chris Horvers : So it sounds like getting beyond batteries and AC repair, there's got to be some sort of other parts of the business that get better to compensate for that lift that you see when you see extreme heat? Bill Rhodes : Yes. Batteries and AC heating parts are the big parts. By the way, it's still quite hot across lots of parts of the country right now. Hopefully, we will have a bit of an Indian summer and that will help us too. Chris Horvers : And then my follow-up is, so it looks like if you look at the narrowing of the gap between what we calculate as commercial and DIY comp, it went from 600 basis points the past two years to 300 this year. So it sounds like the maturation is really the single and almost exclusive factor that drove the narrowing gap between the performance? Bill Rhodes : I think that's a good way to put it. Chris Horvers : Okay. Thanks very much. Good luck. Bill Giles : Thank you. Bill Rhodes : Well before we conclude the call, I would just like to take a moment to reiterate that our business model continues to be solid. We are excited about our growth prospects for the year. We will not take anything for granted as we understand our customers have alternatives. We have a solid plan to succeed this fiscal year, but I want to stress, this is a marathon and not a sprint. As we continue to focus on the basics and focus on optimizing long-term shareholder value, we are confident AutoZone will continue to be very successful. We thank you for participating in today's call. Operator : Thank you. That concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect.",

Bill Rhodes : Good morning and thank you for joining us today for AutoZone's 2017 first quarter conference call. With me today are Bill Giles, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, IT and ALLDATA; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax. Regarding the first quarter, hope you've had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results, if not the press release along with slides complementing our comments today are available on our website www.autozoneinc.com. Please click on Quarterly Earnings Conference Calls to see them. To begin this morning, I want to thank all AutoZoners across our company for again delivering solid results this past quarter. We continue to execute our plan and generally achieved our goals although our sales results were below our plan. Our domestic AutoZone business expanded growing same-store sales 1.6% while opening another 16 new stores. We expect to open approximately 150 new domestic stores in fiscal 2017. Our commercial business continued to expand with 6.3% sales growth over last year's first quarter while opening 35 net new programs. We expect to open approximately 200 net commercial programs this fiscal year. At the end of the quarter, 83% of our domestic stores had a commercial program, and we continue to expand in Mexico opening five new stores. We didn't open any additional locations in Brazil or IMC this quarter. We currently have approximately 90% of our total company sales coming from our domestic AutoZone business. While the domestic business dominated our sales mix and continues to be our primary focus, we believe we have great growth opportunities outside the U.S. Regarding the Internet, we experienced a challenging quarter. When I discuss online, I am referencing business shipped directly to the customer and not buy online and pick up in store. Our pickup in store business sales are recorded in store sales and are not in our all other category. While our pickup in store business continues to thrive and is growing rapidly, our ship-to-home businesses were softer than last year. Our objective is to provide our customers with exceptional service regardless of how they want to interact with us, and it isn't surprising to us that many of them want to research their purchases online and then purchase or pick up their products in store. This allows them to have immediate access to their purchases and afford them the opportunity to get the trustworthy advice they had come to expect from our AutoZoners. While our sales shortfall on ship-to-home purchases is not surprising to us, we're continuing to invest at an accelerated rate to improve the online shopping experience to ensure that our customers\u2019 interactions with us through any channel are exceptional. While our DIY operations remain our number one priority, we are focused on growing our commercial business where our share is smaller. To this end, we've continued with our inventory placement and distribution initiatives in order to respond to the ever increasing challenge of parts demand in the industry. This past quarter, we've expanded our multiple delivery frequency rollouts to an additional 161 net locations and now have approximately 2100 of our 5300 domestic stores receiving three or more deliveries per week from our distribution centers. Regarding our Mega Hub rollouts, we are working diligently on the development of future sites but we did not open any incremental locations this quarter. We continue to operate 11 Mega Hubs and expect to open several more over the remainder of fiscal 2017. Our Mega Hubs continue to exceed our expectations. Additionally, we are continuing to expand our distribution network. In the first quarter, we opened our second distribution center in Mexico and have two distribution centers under construction in the United States. Our current expectations are for the first facility to come online in late fiscal 2017 or early 2018, while the other will open 6 to 12 months later. Along with improving our local parts availability and assortment, we continue to manage this organization to provide exceptional service for our customers, provide our AutoZoners with a great place to work with opportunities for advancement, and ensure that we do it on a profitable basis to provide strong returns for our shareholders. To this end, our national sales meeting held in Memphis at the end of September, was entirely focused on providing wow customer service with an emphasis on saying, \u201cYes, We've Got It,\u201d to all of our customers\u2019 parts, products and advice needs. We demonstrated our enhanced abilities to allow AutoZoners to be able to see and excess inventory at their stores, nearby stores, hubs, mega hubs, and vendor stocked inventory. We will continue to stress the importance of going the extra mile to fulfill our customers\u2019 needs regardless of how difficult the request. Under the Yes, We've Got It theme, we're focused on improving our closure rates. It is always surprising and disappointing to see how many customers leave our stores every day not having completed their intended purchase because we didn't have or couldn't find what they needed within our network. In this spirit to help the customer, we're making ongoing significant systems, investments, and enhancements to capture data about our customers\u2019 shopping patterns across all of our platforms. We understand we have to be able to share information and process seamlessly between our stores, commercial shops, phone, and online experiences in order to meet all of our customers\u2019 needs. Before getting into specifics on the first quarter, I would like to take a moment to go into detail on our inventory availability initiatives. These are two very discreet and different strategies addressing different opportunities. Multiple frequency of delivery is solely focused on improving the in-stock levels for the SKUs that are stocked in our stores, and the mega hubs are focused on adding additional coverage to the local markets, meaning adding SKUs that would not have been available in the market before. In our tests when combined, the initiatives were increasing sales between $1,000 and $1,500 per store per week. It is easier to evaluate the mega hub's success, because we would have had to order the parts through our special order system or bought them from someone else historically. The multiple frequency of deliveries initiative is more difficult to evaluate because we would -- we could have transferred the merchandise from a different store or sent the customer to another store. Regarding multiple frequency of deliveries, we've implemented this enhanced service in roughly 2,100 of our 5,300 domestic stores, and these stores are receiving deliveries from their distribution center at least three times a week. Some stores receive more deliveries than three, but weekly volumes determine the need as the sales lift from delivering to every store every day can't justify the higher expense. Therefore, we sell it on a more staggered approach. I should emphasize this was up from the usual once-a-week delivery schedules we had historically run. With approximately 23,000 SKUs in an average AutoZone store, our inventory turns had a relatively low rate around 1.4 times per year. The vast majority of our SKUs have an on-hand quantity of one. Over the next nine months, we expect to roll this increased frequency model to roughly an additional 300 stores. We have moderated our rollout pace over the remainder of the year to temper the significant change our distribution centers have to absorb and to manage our cost structure. This past quarter's deleverage was above our cost expectations. Once we open our new distribution centers, it will allow us to expand the service in those areas at lower costs. We continue to model 15 to 20 basis points of gross margin headwind from this initiative in 2017. The second ongoing initiative is the Mega Hub store concept. We are currently operating 11 Mega Hubs and will open or expand several more Mega Hub stores in 2017. We are very excited about what the Mega Hubs allow us to offer customers. As a reminder, these supersized AutoZone stores carry 80,000 to 100,000 unique SKUs, approximately twice what a hub store carries today. They provide coverage to both surrounding stores and other hub stores, multiple times a day or on an overnight basis. Our sales results thus far in our open mega hubs continue to exceed our expectations. Currently we have over 3500 stores with access to Mega Hub inventory. A majority of these 3500 stores receive their service on an overnight basis today, but as we expand our Mega Hubs, more of them will receive the service, same day and many will receive it multiple times per day. We expect to ultimately operate 25 to 40 mega hubs once the implementation is complete. The constraint on the speed with which we can open these is availability and location of real estate. While an average AutoZone location is just under 7,000 square feet, a Mega Hub is on average 20,000 square feet to 30,000 square feet or more. Identifying and developing these locations in prime retail areas is challenging and takes time. While there are incremental costs to these rollouts, we continue to feel these investments will provide a better customer experience and increased market share. Our current assumption on this rollout is that we won't experience meaningful deleverage from this initiative in fiscal 2017. In order to provide more frequent deliveries to new stores, as well as to Mega Hubs, we're moving forward on our planned openings of two domestic distribution centers over the next couple of years. For your modeling purposes, each new distribution center is expected to cost approximately $60 million. For 2017, we will incur a majority of these two distribution centers investments in our CapEx budget. However we don't expect any domestic distribution center to come online until late fiscal 2017 or early fiscal 2018. Now let's turn to our first quarter's results. Our sales increased 3.4%. Our domestic same-store sales were up 1.6%. This quarter's sales were consistent until the last couple of weeks of the quarter. Our sales were challenged the week of the Presidential election, which slowed our performance. We did experience positive comps in every month of the quarter, however November's first week was challenging for us. We also continue to see the lingering effects of last year's mild winter, hampering our growth in the Northeast, Midwest and Mid-Atlantic markets. This is similar to 2012 when we also experienced a mild winter. While we saw over a 400 basis point spread between these three markets and the others in the fourth quarter, the gap continue to tighten this quarter, where we saw an approximately 250 basis point spread, but in the last few weeks, that gap shrunk considerably. Our expectation is that this overhang will continue until winter weather returns. In regard to our three primary merchandise categories, failure maintenance and discretionary merchandise, we didn't experience any significant divergence of trends. Failure and maintenance for AutoZone represented approximately 85% of our domestic business's mix. This was usual for this time of the year. While the failure and discretionary categories were positive for DIY, the maintenance category was slightly negative. Our results were driven really by geography. Also our ticket was positive for both DIY and commercial, we saw traffic slightly negative for our DIY business, again regional performance played a key role in this result as the Midwestern or Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern market underperformance was traffic driven. We opened 35 net new commercial programs in the quarter versus 55 net new programs in last year's first quarter. Our sales grew 6.3% on the quarter and commercial and our programs opened grew by 5%. As our programs mature, we believe our sales potential remains strong. Regarding Mexico, we opened five stores this quarter and now have 488 total stores in Mexico. In local currency, Mexico experienced a strong quarter. However Mexico sales in U.S. dollars were below historic growth rates, given the roughly 23% decrease in the value of the peso to the U.S. dollars based on year-over-year quarter ending rates. Additionally as I said earlier, our second distribution in Mexico opened this past quarter. Sales in our other businesses for the quarter were down 4.2% over last year. As a reminder, our all data and e-commerce businesses, which includes AutoZone.com and AutoAnything, make up this segment. As I mentioned, we saw slight traffic and ship-to-home sales challenged during the quarter. However we saw strength in our pickup in store sales. The strength in pick up in store encourages us to continue investing in our in-store experience, pickup in store while smaller than home delivery is quickly catching up and sales volume. We recognize that the majority of our site traffic is providing information to our customers prior to their purchase and our e-Commerce platform represents an important part of our omnichannel experience. We see customers doing lots of research to learn about the products and how to do repairs. While these businesses are small for us at less than 5% of our total sales mix for the quarter, the omnichannel experience is important and we will continue to invest in our e-Commerce platform. With continued aging of the car population, we continue to be optimistic regarding trends for our industry in both DIY and DIFM, as new vehicle unit sales are reaching all-time highs and gas prices on average are down year-over-year, miles driven continue to increase. The lower end customer benefits the most from lower gas prices, relative to income. This trend is encouraging for us. Regarding our expectations for the remainder of 2017, our second quarter results are our most difficult comparison. However we are optimistic we can grow sales in all of our upcoming quarters. While having underperformed in the Northeast, Midwest and mid-Atlantic during the winter and beyond, we believe we should improve in those regions. Our history has shown we manage this business focusing on both short and long-term performance. We will continue to balance short-term and long-term performance and will be keenly focused on delivering consistent strong performance and extending our streak of 41 consecutive quarters of double-digit EPS growth. Now let me review our highlights regarding execution of our operating plan theme for 2017; Yes, We've Got It. The key priorities for the year are great people providing great service, profitably growing our commercial business, leveraging the Internet, Yes, We've Got It and leveraging information technology. On the retail front this past quarter, under the great people providing great service theme, we continued with our intense focus on improving execution. While we've been adding store payroll this year, we're now enhancing our training to store level AutoZoners and increasing the share of voice regarding availability with the Yes, We've Got It theme. We've been aggressive on our technology investments and believe these initiatives will help differentiate us on a go forward basis. We realize as customers have become much more tech and mobile savvy, we have to have a sales proposition that touches all the ways they desire to interact with us. Our current and future technology investments will lead to sales growth across all of our business. The focus is on making sure AutoZoners can see inventory availability across the entire organization, not just their store swiftly and accurately. In regards to commercial, we opened 35 net new programs during the quarter. Our expectation is we will continue to open new programs in the range of 200 programs into 2017. Our sales growth rate slowed in recent quarters. The industry saw a similar slowdown. Our data shows we again gain share this past quarter. We believe last year's mild winter continue to hamper industry sales growth as regional discrepancies played a big role in commercial as well as retail. As we continue to improve our product assortments and availability and as we make other refinements to our offerings, we expect that the estimated sales potential from the market will grow. Our results continue to provide us confidence to be aggressive in adding additional resources and new programs to this very important growth initiative. We should also highlight another strong performance in return on invested capital, as we were able to finish our first quarter at 31.3%. We're very pleased with this metric at it is one of the best if not the best in all of hard lines retailing. However, our primary focus has been and continues to be that we ensure every incremental dollar of capital that we deploy in this business provides an acceptable return, well in excess of our cost to capital. It is important to reinforce that we will always maintain our diligence regarding capital stewardship as the capital we invest is our investor's capital. Before I pass the discussion over to Bill Giles to talk about our financial results, I'd like to thank and reinforce how appreciative we are of our entire team's efforts to continue to deliver on their commitments. We remain bullish on our future performance because we have a great business operated by exceptional AutoZoners. Now turn it over to Bill Giles. Bill Giles : Thanks Bill and good morning, everyone. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to talk more specifically about our retail, commercial and international results for the quarter. For the quarter, total auto part sales, which includes our domestic retail and commercial businesses, our Mexico and Brazil stores and 26 IMC branches, increased 3.7%. Switching over to macro trends during the quarter, nationally unleaded gas prices started out $2.24 a gallon and ended the quarter at $2.16 a gallon, a slight decrease. Now last year, gas prices decreased $0.42 per gallon, during the first quarter, starting at $2.51 and ending at $2.09 a gallon. We continue to believe gas prices have a real impact on our customer's abilities to maintain their vehicles and as cost reductions of all Americans, we hope to continue to benefit from this increase in disposable income. We also recognize that the impact of miles driven on cars over 10 years old, the current average is much different than on newer cars in terms of wear and tear. Miles driven increased 1.6% in July. 2.9% in August and 2.9% in September. Now we don't have October or November data yet, but year-to-date through September, miles driven are up approximately 3% and ahead of last year's increase at this time. The other statistic we highlight is the number of seven-year and older vehicles on the road, which continues to trend in our industry's favor. For the trailing 52-weeks ended, total sales per AutoZone store were $1,781,000 million -- or $1,781,000 for the quarter for the 52 weeks ended. Now for the quarter, total commercial sales increased 6.3%. In the first quarter, commercial represented 19% of our total sales and grew $27 million over last year's first quarter. This past quarter, we opened 35 net new programs versus 55 programs opened in our first quarter of last fiscal year. We now have our commercial program in 4,425 stores or 83% of our domestic stores supported by 182 hub stores. Approximately 900 of our programs are three years old or younger. In 2017, we expect to open approximately 200 new programs. As we've begun our fiscal 2017, our trends have accelerated modestly, which is encouraging to us. We are very focused on having a great sales team and having much stronger engagement of our store management teams, particularly the store managers and district managers. We remain confident that we will continue to gain market share with our commercial customers. We're encouraged by the initiatives that we have in place and feel 2017 should be a better sales growth year than 2016. Our Mexico stores continue to perform well. We opened five new stores during the first quarter. We currently have 488 stores in Mexico. This upcoming year, we expect to open approximately 40 new stores. As Bill said earlier, we were challenged by difficult foreign exchange rate in regard to the peso. While sales and base currency were above plan this past year, the devaluation of the peso was much greater than we assumed at the start of the year. The peso devalued over the course of the quarter, but moved materially post the U.S. Election in November, while devaluing 23% year-over-year and weakened 11% in just this quarter, with the majority of the decline in the quarter in the first two weeks of November. This created a headwind that caused our reported U.S. dollar EBIT to be lower than if rates had remained constant. The EBIT dollar impact on the quarter assuming constant currency with last year's foreign exchange rate was meaningful, a roughly $6 million impact to EBIT. We do believe the Mexico leadership team has done an exceptional job managing the peso denominated business and we continue to feel like the moves will be manageable. Regarding Brazil, we currently are operating eight stores. Our plans are to open between 15 and 20 stores over the next few years, while our sales growth has been very encouraging, we have been challenged over time by a weak Brazilian real relative to U.S. dollars. Recapping this past quarter's performance for the company in total, our sales were $2,468,000, an increase of 3.4% over last year's first quarter. Domestic same-store sales or sales for stores open more than one year were up 1.6% for the quarter. Gross margin for the quarter was 52.7% of sales up 23 basis points. The improvement in gross margin was attributable to lower acquisition costs, partially offset by higher supply chain costs associated with current year inventory initiatives. In regards to inflation it was again slightly down year-over-year. Currently we feel costs will be predictable and manageable. We will remain cognizant of future developments regarding inflation and we'll make the appropriate adjustments should they arise. Looking forward, we continue to believe there remains opportunity for gross margin expansion within both the retail and commercial businesses, but our commercial business is growing at an accelerated rate and it has lower margins, which is adding pressure to our overall gross margins. It is important to note, we do not manage the targeted gross margin percentage. We also understand the headwinds expanding our distribution center deliveries caused. We'll work diligently to offset these headwinds with a focus on lower acquisition costs. Our primary focus remains growing absolute gross profit dollars in our total auto parts segment. SG&A for the quarter was 34.1% of sales, lower by one basis point from last year's first quarter. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales were relatively flat to last year as favorability across several areas was offset by higher domestic store payroll. We continue to believe we are well positioned to manage our cost structure in response to our sales environment. EBIT for the quarter was $459 million up 4.8% over last year's first quarter. Our EBIT margin was 18.6%. Interest expense for the quarter was $33.3 million, compared with $35 million in Q1 a year ago. Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $4.997 billion or $243 million more than last year's quarter balance of $4.754 billion. Our adjusted debt level metric finished the quarter at 2.5 times EBITDAR, while in any given quarter, we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on management's opinion regarding debt and equity market conditions, we remain committed to both our investment grade rating and our capital allocation strategy and share repurchases are an important element of that strategy. For the quarter our tax rate was 34.7% versus last year's Q1 of 35.9%. The deviation results was primarily driven by the resolution of discrete tax items that arose, but additionally I want to take a moment to discuss AutoZone's first quarter adoption of a new accounting standard. The new standard has us recognizing the tax benefit received from the gains employees have on stock options as a credit to income tax expense on the P&L previously at flow through stockholder's equity. This past quarter it lowered our tax rate 74 basis points and benefited EPS accordingly. However, this accounting change also has an effect on the diluted share count calculation, resulting in higher or more dilutive share count. Net income for the quarter was $278.1 million up 7.8% over last year. Our diluted share count of 29.7 million was down 4.6% from last year's first quarter. The combination of these factors drove earnings per share for the quarter to $6.36 up 13% over the prior year's first quarter. The new accounting standard just mentioned increased our diluted share count by 226,000 shares, reducing our reported EPS by $0.08 a share, netting the benefit in our tax rate with the impact from a higher reported diluted share count raised our EPS by $0.03 on the quarter. While not a large impact on the EPS, we feel it is important for investors to know how the accounting change will affect results, we'll continue to keep you abreast of any impacts going forward in future quarters. Relating to the cash flow statement for the first fiscal quarter, we generated $407 million of operating cash flow. Net fixed assets were up 6% versus last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter, totaled $98 million and reflected the additional expenditures required to open 23 new locations this quarter, capital expenditures on existing stores, hub and Mega Hub store remodels and openings, work on development of new stores for upcoming quarters, development of our new Mexico DC and some minor investments in our new domestic DCs and information technology investments. With the new stores opened, we finished this past quarter with 5,313 stores in 50 states, the district of Columbia and Puerto Rico. 488 stores in Mexico and eight in Brazil for a total AutoZone store count of 5,809. We also had 26 IMC branches open at fiscal year-end, taking our total locations to 5,835. Depreciation totaled $71.8 million for the quarter, versus last year's fiscal quarter expense of $66.3 million. This is generally in line with recent quarter growth rates. With our excess cash flow, we repurchased $363 million of AutoZone stock in the first quarter. At quarter end, we had $783 million remaining under our share buyback authorization and our leverage metric was 2.5 times at quarter end. Again I want to stress we manage to appropriate credit ratings and not any one metric. The metric we report is meant as a guide only as each rating firm has its own criteria. We continue to view our share repurchase program as an attractive capital deployment strategy. Accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 110.3%. Next I would like to update you on our inventory levels in total and on a per store basis. The company's inventory increased 7.3% over the same period last year, driven primarily by new stores during the fiscal year. Inventory per location was $647,000 versus $624,000 last year and $625,000 just this past quarter. Net inventory defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable, on a per location basis was a negative $67,000 versus a negative $66,000 last year and negative $80,000 this past quarter. Finally as Bill previously mentioned, our continued disciplined capital management approach resulted in return on invested capital for the trailing four quarters of 31.3%. We have and will continue to make investments that we believe will generate returns that significantly exceed our cost of capital. Now, I'll turn it back to Bill Rhodes. Bill Rhodes : Thank you, Bill. We're pleased to report our 41st consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth delivering an EPS growth rate of 13% this quarter. While we continue to experienced more regional sales differences than usual, our company executed exceptionally well. Our focus remains on being successful over the long run. That success will be attributable to our approach of leveraging our unique and powerful culture and focusing on the needs of our customers. To execute at a high level, we have to consistently adhere to living the pledge. We cannot and will not take our eye off of execution. We must stay committed to executing day in and day out on our game plan. Success will be achieved with an attention to detail and exceptional execution. Before I conclude, I want to take this opportunity to highlight some of the exciting initiatives we have in store for fiscal 2017. We will continue to expand our AutoZone store footprint in the United States, Mexico and Brazil, opening approximately 200 locations combined. We will open roughly 200 additional commercial programs, our inventory availability efforts will expand with the opening of another handful of Mega Hubs and with the further expansion of multiple deliveries per week to 300 or so more stores. We've already opened our second distribution center in Mexico and we have two domestic distribution centers currently under construction. Our investments in technology continue to accelerate with an intensified focused on our online offerings. And lastly, we are talking more, more about saying, Yes, We've Got It to our customers. We are determined to meet all of our customer's needs in 2017. Our offerings are the best they have ever been and we are determined to communicate this to our customer base. At the end of the day, our customers have choices and we must exceed their expectations. We're excited about our initiatives around inventory assortments and availability, hub stores, commercial growth, Mexico, All Data, e-Commerce, Brazil and IMC. Our long-term model is to grow new store square footage at a low single-digit growth rate and we expect to continue growing our commercial business at an accelerated rate. Therefore we look to routinely grow EBIT dollars in the mid-single-digit range or better in times of strength and we leverage our very strong and predictable cash flow to repurchase shares, enhancing our earnings per share growth into double digits. We feel the track we are on will allow us to continue winning for the long run. We believe our steady, consistent strategy is correct. It is the attention to details and consistent execution that will matter. Our belief is solid, consistent strategy, combined with superior execution is a formula for success. Our charge remains to optimize our performance regardless of market conditions and ensure and continue to ensure we are investing in the key initiatives that will drive our long-term performance. In the end, delivering strong EPS growth and ROIC, each and every quarter is how we measure ourselves. Now we would like to open up the call to questions. Operator : Thank you. We'll now being the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Alan Rifkin from BTIG. Your line is now open. Alan Rifkin : Thank you very much. My first question relates to, Bill your commentary regarding e-Commerce. Not the buy online, pick-up-in-store aspect, but the e-Commerce that\u2019s transacted and shipped. You said that that business you felt was challenging. Can you maybe provide a little bit of color behind that, and as a bigger picture, do you think net-net, your industry really lends itself to e-commerce penetration in a significant way going forward? Bill Giles : Thanks Alan. Actually, ladies and gentlemen first, just to level set, it's not a material amount of business being conducted from an e-commerce perspective for AutoZone overall. Secondly during the quarter, we were little less promotional online, and we pulled back a little bit from some of our paid advertising as well. What we're more focused on is improving the experience for the customer; and as Bill mentioned before, we continue to drive a lot of sales through buy online and pick up in store, and that part of the business continues to remain very strong. From a pure ship to home basis on both AutoZone.com and AutoAnything, those were little softer during the quarter, but like I said, we - that we were a little less promotional during the quarter, and we're also investing some things in the platform that will probably slow us down a little bit as we continue to migrate through that. So when you think about e-commerce, we're not immune to sales through e-commerce, but at the same time, when you think about the experience that you have walking into an AutoZone store, there's a lot of trustworthy advice that\u2019s taking place, and so when someone walks in and wants to buy a battery which you can't buy online because you can\u2019t ship it, we\u2019ll likely test your entire starting and charging system in order to ensure that that is the problem that you are - we are going to solve for you. So there's a lot of things that take place in the store between starters and alternators that are core - that have cores attached, that require those products to come back. There's an ability for an AutoZoner to walk out to the car and be able to assess and ensure that the customer is getting what they need and being able to resolve their issues and being able to see the part before they purchase it. So there's a lot of things that experience inside of a store that you can't duplicate online. Again we're not immune to online sales, but we believe that there are a lot of attributes that make it unique inside the store, the experience inside the store. Alan Rifkin : Okay, thank you Bill. My follow up is for Bill Rhodes. Bill you said that with respect to the increased delivery program, the frequency of delivery program, there will be a total of 300 in this fiscal year, more than half of which have already been opened. It sounds like though you\u2019re slowing that program down just a little bit so that the DC infrastructure can be built. Is that a correct assumption in my part, and if so what would be the incremental savings with respect to just pulling back a little bit on the increased delivery frequency program. Thank you. Bill Rhodes : It's hard to say and to net out. So couple of things, one, I may not have been perfectly clear in my remarks. We\u2019ve opened roughly 161 so far this year, we opened 161. We're going to open 300 more. So think about 100 per quarter for the balance of the year where we had been running at about 300 stores per quarter. So, we are deliberately slowing the rollout of multiple frequency of delivery. The biggest reason that we are slowing the rollout is because we put a massive amount of change on our supply chain over the last couple of years getting to these 2100 locations that are already on there. So just think about that, that\u2019s 4200 incremental deliveries for our supply chain in just two years alone and that has just been a massive amount of change, and we need to slow down and let them absorb that change. We're also mindful that it does impact our cost structure, and so we want to slow it down mainly for the supply chain but also to make sure that we continue to have reasonable profitability, and as we mentioned it cost us roughly 15 basis points in the quarter but there are other costs that aren\u2019t in that number just from the amount of change that we\u2019ve had in our supply chain and those kind of things. So we're going to slow it down a little bit. Alan Rifkin : Okay. Thank you both very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Simeon Gutman : Thanks. Good morning. Bill, I guess without the - Bill Rhodes sorry, without maybe that election time frame or bump - that you mentioned you experienced, I guess we\u2019re left to assume that the business is running maybe around two or little better than that. Does the business need weather to get back to that level sustainably or is that about sort of the right run rate, and I guess connected to it, can you tell us if the weather impacted markets, are they running in positive territory or are they at negative territory? Bill Rhodes : Great question, Simeon. First of all, your assessment about what would happen without the week of the election is probably pretty accurate. We are running close to it two comp for the quarter. I do believe that there is still a headwind in our overall comp from the lingering effects of last year's mild winter. We said that it moderated but we still had a 250 basis point gap between what happened in those markets and what happened in the other markets. So to do the math, if there's 250 basis points, we ran a 1.6 comp, clearly those markets ran negative comp for the quarter. I believe just as we saw in 2012, once the effects of a cold winter hit, we will see improvements in our overall comps in those markets clearly. But I would also want to be careful it is not going to happen overnight and I'll give you some examples. Last year during this period of time in December, it was very robust and our sales were really strong but they weren\u2019t strong in the categories that we traditionally sold, we were doing really well with things like under car brakes and the like chassis because the weather was conducive for people to do maintenance projects that they normally don't do this time of year. So we in essence, pulled brake business forward and we didn\u2019t get the failure business. So we had a pretty strong Q2 last year, it was really Q3 and Q4 and now into Q1 where we saw the bigger impact from the lack of serious winter last year. So we\u2019re excited that we're about to see the first really cold snap of the year. We're excitedly to see what that will mean to us but it'll be really Q3 before we expect to see any rebound. Simeon Gutman : Okay. And my follow-up I think you mentioned that some of the supply chain costs were higher than what you would've liked and I think that's what you mentioned, if I\u2019m not mistaken the press release at 14 basis point to supply chain cost, that seems a little lower than the 20 basis point run rate that I think was in the long-term guidance and roughly where you been running. So why if that's all right, why is 14 basis points I guess disappointing? Bill Giles : Yes, I would say that, the 14 basis point is really what we can tie specifically to more frequent deliveries. We definitely believe that there is some overhang costs that are occurring inside the distribution centers that are probably related to that. We just didn't tag to it specifically, so our de-leverage on supply chain was in the mid-20s for the quarter but it was probably only 14 that we could specifically call for the actually -- more frequent deliveries. But we recognize look based on the run rate that we were going as far as the rollout is just prudent to pullback a little bit and be able to improve the efficiencies of the organization as we move through this but still committed to rolling it, we\u2019re just going to roll a few left as we move forward. But going forward I would think it would be around 15 basis points and hope for the overall de-leverage to be a little bit less. Simeon Gutman : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Lasser from UBS. Your line is now open. Michael Lasser : Good morning, thanks a lot for taking my question. First on your commentary around the Internet. Can you contrast the customer who would buy online and have a product shipped either at home versus the customer that would quote your store and either buy there or initially by it online and pick up it in a store. Are they the same customers that you're migrating customers from one channel to another or is the profile different. Bill Rhodes : I think that in many cases the customers are saying, they\u2019re probably omnichannel customers overall. They just may have different shopping needs at the moment so think about things like accessories et cetera, those might lend themselves a little bit more tuned online because they're not needed at the moment and there may not be a significant amount of advice required for making that purchase versus it could be the very same customer who wants to do a great job or wants to do engine management job but also wants to make sure that they know what they're doing. So they walk into the store and be able to see the product make sure it matches up with the exact fit et cetera, they may also want to get some repair instructions that they can get at the store and they may also need a tool that is very specific to that job that quite frankly they don't want to go out and spend the money to buy that tool for a one-time usage and they can come to the store for a longer tool. So I think that it's because it can be both the customer using both channels overall, just different purposes. Michael Lasser : And you had indicated that both your AutoAnything and your core AutoZone business decelerated is that right, can you just size the relative difference of those businesses within the e-commerce portfolio? Bill Rhodes : Yes, I would say that the AutoAnything business is obviously larger than the AutoZone e-commerce businesses from a shift to home perspective. AutoZone.com is really about being able to again create an omnichannel environment for a customer to come and be able to do research on products ensure that it's in stock and then possibly either buy it online or pick it up in store, buy it online have it shipped to home or just gain the information which is typically what happens and then go to the store for the purchase. So both sides were down and the number we reported is probably close enough for both and again different reasons but we did pull back from our sales perspective and also from paid advertising perspective. Michael Lasser : Let me add one last follow-up question. On the difference between the weather and the non-weather affected market, do you see, you saw the spread narrow and trends were improved a bit from last quarter, could it be non-weather impacted markets decelerate over the course of the quarter or was the gap narrowed only because the weather impacted markets got better? Bill Giles : Remember our comps this quarter were about 60 basis points ahead of where they were last quarter, I think it's fair to say I don't have it right in front of me but the balance of the chain ran about the same that they ran last quarter plus or minus 20 basis points. Michael Lasser : Okay. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Matthew Fassler from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Matthew Fassler : Thanks a lot, good morning to you. So my first question most likely for Bill Giles, your SG&A dollars were up I believe 3.4% year-on-year year which is a very mild increase relative to trend and I know you had acquisitions were part of that time, so the dollar growth is an apples-to-apples but that\u2019s still a very tight kind of quarter from an expense control perspective. Can you talk about how expense dollars trended versus your budget and if we can give about expenses per store or whatever the appropriate metric is whether this is a good benchmark or whether as the sales recover presumably what compares and weather et cetera that expense growth rate would pick up a bit from here. Bill Giles : Yes, that\u2019s a great question Matt, and I think as we've always said you know we\u2019re going to play the environment we operate in, so we have managed costs tight during this quarter and the whole organization quite frankly has done a really terrific job of pitching in and finding opportunities for them to reduce cost during this quarter and as you know we get harsher weather as we progress through the year and sales get back to higher numbers than they are today, then we probably will invest a little bit back more into the SG&A and be able to support some of the things people may wanted to do this quarter that they were unable to do So I think will continue to manage it really tight and we\u2019ll continue to play in an environment we exist in. Matthew Fassler : Thanks for that. A question related to expenses there is obviously a court ruling a couple weeks back about some of the adjustments to overtime laws which I know has attended some of the planning a lesser companies have done, we\u2019re going to have to maintain just the compensation structures. Can you talk about what kind of contingencies you have put in place to accommodate what we're going to be to new laws and what you're planning is from here going forward on that front? Bill Rhodes : It's a great question Matt. First of all based upon our compensation programs and where we were, we didn't have terribly material changes to have to make. Certainly there were some people that we had to move up on the scale and we had already communicated that to them and so we're living up to that communication and we're sticking with the changes. You will not hear us call that out as a material driver of our labor going forward but there's a little bit of an impact there. Matthew Fassler : And then finally you had this accounting change with stock option exercise tax treatment et cetera, will we see that anymore or just a one-time adjustment and do we have tax rate and share count moving around in all from here on it. Bill Rhodes : Actually we will. Unfortunately, I mean - from an accounting perspective that came through that, I think will just create a little bit of volatility on the EPS number but we are committed to basically breaking it out for you guys so you can see in just as we did this quarter and our highlights page so you can see the breakout but yes it's basically a function of when options are exercised and there'll be an impact so we\u2019ll report as we go forward. Matthew Fassler : So that's depending on activity in any given quarter rather than to having a new baseline tick to put in place? Bill Rhodes : 100%. Bill Giles : It was pretty muted this quarter by the way, so it will increase volatility going forward. Matthew Fassler : Understood. Thank you so much guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Seth Sigman from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Seth Sigman : Thanks a lot and good morning. I just have two follow-ups. First just on the online business, if you look at the pure online sales plus whatever is bought online and pick up in the store, so sort of the omnichannel sales, what sort of growth are you seeing and like how would you size up the omnichannel business in aggregate? Bill Rhodes : Yes, I would say in fairness it's not a material dollar amount to the organization and so we can quantify et cetera but it's \u2013 it's not significant to the organization overall. But we\u2019re more focused on as making sure that we have a great experience for our customers when they come to the website so that they can get all the information that they want, they can learn about product, find-out whether it tends stock pricing et cetera and then learn if it showing good, better, best et cetera and then go to the store and be able to purchase it or ship it to their home or buy online and pick up and store it. At the moment, many people come to the website to gain information before shopping at the store so that - what we're looking for is to ensure that we've got a great shopping experience in all different channels that the customers coming to. At the moment, many of them are coming to get information and then shopping at the store. However our buy online and pick up at store program albeit small is growing at a quick rate. Seth Sigman : And Bill given that earlier you discussed how most SKUs in the store have maybe a quantity of one on hand and given the popularity to buy online pick up in store obviously the consumer wants to come to the stores in these situations, how do you effectively manage the availability to serve that trend? Bill Giles : I think that\u2019s no different, that trend is no different than the trend that we have in people that are walking in the store today. It is very challenging to make sure that we're in stock when we have roughly 70% of the skews and the store have one piece on the shelf and frankly that's why we're doing this multiple frequency of delivery. Before if you bought at the first day we get the truck, we would be out for seven or eight days or trying to get it back in stock quicker for whether it's for the walk-in customer, the commercial customer and the online customer. Seth Sigman : Okay. And just one follow-up on the gap in regional trends, so if the gap this quarter was 250 basis points and then last few weeks, you said that gap shrunk considerably, it doesn't seem like weather really changed meaningfully over that period. So is there something else that would be causing that improvement? Bill Rhodes : No I think we probably don't need to be focused too much on a week or two and what happened. What we did say was we had closed at the end of the quarter. There was a lot of things going on at the end of the quarter, including the election. What we did say was we anticipate there will continue to be a gap this quarter, hopefully beyond that of close. Seth Sigman : Understand. Thank you very much. Bill Rhodes : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Brian Nagel from Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Brian Nagel : Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Bill Rhodes : Good morning. Brian Nagel : I wanted to follow-up on your election comment and with a number of retailers across sector had discussed this selection back lately. So the question I have is, if you look at the AutoZone data, do you think that the weakness we saw heading in June and around the election was just simply reflection trepidation on the part of the consumer or did AutoZone pull back on marketing as some other companies have eluded to that may have maybe impacted the call to action for consumer spend. Bill Rhodes : We absolutely didn\u2019t change our game plan one bit and won't change it going forward. When we talk about the election, in fact yes it was a little bit softer going into the election. A couple of days after the election, there were a lot of people -- there were a lot of people who were surprised by outcome of the election and we saw it clearly in our sales and then it kind of rebounded from there. So I don\u2019t want to overplay that, but it clearly was a -- it was a meaningful difference for two or three days. Brian Nagel : Thank you. And then the follow-up question I had, going back some comments you made in your script regarding closures and that opportunity within your stores, we discussed this before. So a two-part question, we wonder are you seeing with the initiatives behind improving closures from the store, are we seeing some progress not front. And then maybe help us reframe again frame just the what the magnitude of the opportunity is to improve that closure metric? Bill Rhodes : I think clearly the closer we get the parts to the customer, we see improvements in closure rates and clearly the easiest way for us to see it and measure it definitively is with the Mega Hubs and the Mega Hubs are really performing well and that\u2019s why we're pushing as hard as we can on the them to get that inventory closer and closer to the customer. Brian Nagel : Okay. Got it. Thank you. Bill Rhodes : All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Greg Melich from Evercore/ISI. Your line is now open. Greg Melich : Great. Actually I have a couple follow-ups. How much did inflation or deflation impact the COGS and the topline in the quarter and then I've a follow-up? Bill Rhodes : I would say not significant Greg. We have a little bit of deflation, a lot of its oil related to some extent, but I would say there is a mix between category. Some categories did have inflation but let's just answer the question quickly and I would say not material. Greg Melich : Got it. And then the second question I had was where are we now in terms of private label penetration? If we were thinking about your sourcing and put in the three buckets, how much has sourced domestically, how much do you think comes from outside the U.S. and I know that like how much is your own sourcing versus the vendor finding them and bringing it in just rough numbers? Bill Giles : Yeah, I would say our private label product is probably in the over 50%, probably in the 50% tile 50% to 55% overall. I would say that direct imports is probably in the teams kind of a number. As far as products that are sourced overseas that we sell in its entirety, it's got to be now with our around 70% I don\u2019t know the number exactly, but it's probably pretty close to around that 70% number. Greg Melich : Okay. Great. Nice summary. And then last and this is shifting on inventory, but more about where you put it and why, as you put them the more inventory in the stores, I think you mentioned that it gets picked up by everybody. It helps sales in both DIY and Do It for Me. What is the percentage like when you find that you're in stock, are you with these additional SKUs closer to the customer? Is it still 80-20 DIY versus commercial or a 50-50 or helpful about how that's progressed? Bill Giles : I would say it's between those two. It's not the traditional 80-20. Generally when we're doing particularly with the Mega Hub inventory, that is newer vehicle inventory. So it skews towards commercial, but we're always amazed at how much we actually sell in DIY. So it's probably and it depends by category that\u2019s hard to give you a generic answer, but it's probably in the 60-40 range. Greg Melich : Interesting. Thanks a lot. Good luck guys. Bill Giles : All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Dan Wewer from Raymond James & Associates. Your line is now open. Dan Wewer : Hi. Thanks. Bill Giles, you noted that commercial sales growth should accelerate in 2017 compared to 2016, how would you look at the outlook for the do-it-yourself channel? Do you think it accelerates as well? Bill Giles : I think when you think about some of the impacts that we've had from the weather overall, I think that it was an overhang for both sides of the business quite frankly and so I think that we're optimistic as we head into fiscal 2017 with a normalized winter. I think the business overall should improve. Dan Wewer : And I just want to clarify, Bill Rhodes your comment that perhaps the Thursday or Friday after the election, you did see business return back to that 2% same-store sales run rate. Bill Rhodes : I wasn\u2019t that specific Dan to be more specific than I appear to be. What I said was there was a notable meaningful drop in our sales call it Wednesday, Thursday and even into Friday. I think it's more driven by weather and other impacts but you can clearly see it for two or three days. Dan Wewer : And then the last question going back to Bill Giles, with the sharp change in interest rates since the Election, how does that impact the performance and profitability of the vendor financed inventory model? Bill Giles : We've always looked at -- as you know we always look at interest as an input cost overall. So there's a variety of input costs that it takes to manufacture a product whether it's the dealer energy or an interest as another component of that. So we'll just continue to manage that with our vendors like we do all other costs. Dan Wewer : Okay. Thank you. Bill Giles : All right. Thank you, Dan. Bill Rhodes : Okay. Before we conclude the call, I would just like to take a moment to reiterate that our business model continues to be very solid. We're excited about our growth prospects for the year. We will not take anything at all for granted as we understand our customers have alternatives. We've a solid plan to succeed this fiscal year, but I want to stress that this is a marathon and not a sprint. As we continue to focus on the basics and focus on optimizing long-term shareholder value, we are confident AutoZone will continue to be very successful. We thank you for participating in today's call and we would like to wish everyone a very happy and healthy holiday season and a prosperous new year. Thanks for joining us today. Operator : That concludes today's conference. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect.",

Rhodes, III - AutoZone, Inc.: Good morning and thank you for joining us today for AutoZone's 2017 second quarter conference call. With me today are Bill Giles, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and IT; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax. Regarding the second quarter, I hope you've had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not, the press release along with slides complementing our comments today, are available on our website, www.autozoneinc.com. Please click on Quarterly Earnings Conference Calls to see them. To begin this morning, I want to thank all AutoZoners across the company for their tremendous efforts during what ultimately resulted in a challenging quarter. Our results this quarter were below our expectations due largely to a delay in tax refunds this year compared to last. Unfortunately, our performance this quarter ended our remarkable string of 41 consecutive quarters of double-digit growth in earnings per share. While this is clearly disappointing, I want to recognize and acknowledge the incredible performance of our teams across the company for delivering this virtually unheard of level of consistent performance for over a decade. Our sales increased 1.4% for the quarter and our domestic same-store sales were flat. It's worth highlighting, the first nine weeks' comp sales were up 2.2% while the last three weeks' comp sales declined 6.3%. And unfortunately, the last week was materially weaker than the other two weeks. As a result of these weaker than expected sales in the last few weeks, we ended the quarter with flat same-store sales. In an effort to provide a little more color, our sales through the Christmas holiday season were quite strong. Remember, prior to Christmas, we had some significant winter conditions and our sales, as expected, were strong. After Christmas, the weather was much more mild with minimal snow and ice in the Midwest, Northeast and Mid-Atlantic. During this period, our sales growth moderated. Then, as noted above, in the last three weeks when we began lapping the beginning of last year's tax refund season, our same-store sales declined fairly significantly. Late last year, the IRS announced that, in an effort to combat fraudulent tax refund filings, they would be delaying the issuance of refunds associated with returns claiming the earned income tax credit. Unfortunately, the timing of refunds typically begins in the last two or three weeks of our second quarter, and this year most of the refunds were delayed until after our quarter concluded. As context, as of the end of our quarter this year, the IRS had issued $24 billion in tax refunds compared to last year when they had issued $70 billion. This delay clearly created a material headwind this past quarter, but all indications are that total tax refunds for the year will be generally consistent with last year. Our expectation is we have shifted some sales from Q2 into Q3. Regarding regional discrepancies, our Northeast, Mid-Atlantic and Midwestern stores performed slightly better for the quarter than the remainder of the country. As a reminder, our Northeastern, Mid-Atlantic and Midwestern stores represent approximately 25% of our overall sales. Clearly, this year we experienced more winter conditions early in the quarter than we did last year, but we expected the winter conditions to be more pronounced and last longer. We are exiting this winter with two consecutive fairly mild winters. In regards to our three primary merchandise categories, failure, maintenance, and discretionary merchandise, we experienced similar slowing trends across all three categories during the last three weeks of our quarter. The majority of our sales are in the failure category, and close behind is maintenance. The deterioration in the last three weeks also drove our retail traffic count down for the quarter, while our average ticket trends were consistent with Q1. During the quarter, we opened another 33 new stores in the United States. We expect to open approximately 160 new domestic stores in fiscal 2017. Our commercial business continued to expand with 7.2% sales growth over last year's second quarter, while opening 12 net new programs. We expect to open approximately 200 net new commercial programs for the fiscal year, or approximately 150 additional programs in the last two quarters of the year. At the end of the quarter, 83% of our domestic stores had a commercial program, and we continued to expand in Mexico, opening three new stores. We didn't open any additional IMC branches this quarter, but we did open one new store in Brazil. While the domestic business dominates our sales mix and continues to be our primary focus, we believe we have great growth opportunities outside of the U.S. Regarding the Internet, we experienced improving trends versus our first quarter as our results improved sequentially as the quarter moved along. When I discuss online, I'm referencing business shipped directly to the customer and not buy-online and pickup-in-store. Our pickup-in-store business sales are recorded in store sales and are not in our All Other category. Our pickup-in-store business continues to grow rapidly, up over 20% for the quarter. Under the Yes! We've Got It theme, we are focused on improving our store closure rates. While our winter quarter is a lower-volume quarter, we still see plenty of examples of not being able to say yes to product requests because we didn't have or couldn't find what the customers needed within our network. In the spirit of satisfying our customers, we are making ongoing significant system investments and enhancements to capture data about our customers' shopping patterns across all of our platforms. We understand we have to be able to share information and process seamlessly between our stores, commercial shops, phone and online experiences in order to meet all of our customers' needs. As our primary objective remains growing our domestic, retail and commercial businesses, we continued with our inventory availability initiatives in order to respond to the ever-increasing challenge of parts demand in the industry. This past quarter, we rolled out two additional mega hub locations and now have 13 in operation. We are working diligently on the development of future sites and we expect to open approximately five more over the remainder of fiscal 2017. Our mega hubs continue to exceed our expectations. Additionally, we are continuing development on our two new distribution centers based in Washington State and Florida, and we are expanding our distribution center in Illinois. Our current expectations are for the Washington State facility to come online in late fiscal 2017 or early 2018, while the Florida facility will open six months to 12 months later. For your modeling purposes, each new distribution center is expected to cost approximately $60 million. Now, I'd like to take a moment to go into detail on our inventory availability initiatives. These are two very discrete and different strategies addressing different opportunities. Multiple frequency of delivery is solely focused on improving the in-stock levels for the SKUs that are stocked in our stores. And the mega hubs are focused on adding additional coverage to the local markets, meaning adding SKUs that would not have been available locally in our network before. Regarding multiple frequency of deliveries, we had roughly 2,200 stores receiving three or more deliveries per week at the end of Q2. This quarter, we added just over 100 additional sites as we tempered our rollout to focus on standardizing our operations and refining some of our methodologies. This has been a considerable change, and we haven't yet been able to fully achieve our desired results on a variety of fronts. As you remember, up until recently, we have serviced the vast majority of our stores once a week. All of our systems, processes and practices were focused on the cadence of these activities being once-a-week. This past quarter's deleverage was generally as expected, but still a bit higher than we thought at the beginning of the quarter due to the softness in sales at the end of the quarter. Once we open our new distribution centers, it will allow us to alleviate some of the cost pressures. We continue to model 15 basis points to 20 basis points of gross margin headwind from this initiative in 2017. The second ongoing initiative is the mega hub store concept. We are currently operating 13 mega hubs. We are very excited about what the mega hubs allow us to offer customers. As a reminder, these super sized AutoZone stores carry 80,000 to 100,000 unique SKUs, approximately twice what a hub store carries today. They provide coverage to both surrounding stores and other hub stores multiple times a day or on an overnight basis. Our sales results thus far in our open mega hubs continue to exceed our expectations. Currently we have just over 3,900 domestic stores with access to mega hub inventory. A majority or about two-thirds of those 3,900 stores receive their service on an overnight basis today, but as we expand our mega hubs, more of them will receive this service same day and many will receive it multiple times per day. We expect to ultimately operate 25 to 40 mega hubs once the implementation is complete. The constraint on the speed with which we can open these is availability and location of real estate. While an average AutoZone location is just under 7,000 square feet, a mega hub is 20,000 to 30,000 square feet or even more. Identifying and developing these locations in prime retail areas is challenging, and it takes time. While there are incremental costs to those rollouts, we continue to feel these investments will provide a better customer experience and increased market share. Our current assumption on this rollout is that we won't experience meaningful deleverage from this initiative in fiscal 2017. Along with improving local parts availability and assortment, we continue to manage this organization to provide exceptional service for our customers, provide our AutoZoners with a great place to work with opportunities for advancement, and ensure we do it on a profitable basis to provide strong returns for our shareholders. We will continue to stress the importance of going the extra mile to fill our customers' needs regardless of how difficult the request. Regarding Mexico, we opened three stores this quarter and now have 491 total stores. In local currency, Mexico experienced another solid quarter. However, Mexico sales in U.S. dollars declined given the decrease in the value of the peso to the U.S. dollar. As our peso financial results are converted to U.S. dollars on an average rate over the quarter, we continued to experience headwinds to our net earnings as a result. Based on exchange rate differences this year to last, we experienced an $0.18 headwind to EPS this past quarter alone. Sales in our other businesses for the quarter were down 3% over last year's second quarter. As a reminder, our ALLDATA and E-Commerce business, which includes AutoZone.com and AutoAnything, make up this segment of sale. This compares to being down 4.2% last quarter and reflects stronger performance in AutoZone.com's business for Q2. As I previously mentioned, we continue to see 20% plus growth in our buy-online pickup-in-store sales. This strength in pickup-in-store encourages us to continue investing in our in-store experience. Pickup-in-store while smaller than home delivery is quickly catching up in sales volume. We recognize that the majority of our site traffic is providing information to our customers prior to purchase and our E-Commerce platform represents an important part of our omni-channel experience. We see customers doing lots of research to learn about the products and on how to do repairs. While these businesses are small for us and less than 5% of our total sales, the omni-channel experience is important and we will continue to invest in our E-Commerce platform. With the continued aging of the car population we continue to be optimistic regarding trends for our industry in both DIY and DIFM. As new vehicle unit sales are reaching all-time highs and gas prices on average remain subdued, miles driven continue to increase. The lower end consumer benefits the most from lower gas prices relative to income. This trend remains encouraging. Regarding our expectations for the remainder of 2017, we expect performance to improve in Q3 if for no other reason than the shift in timing of income tax refunds. As we exit a disappointing performance in Q2, we are reinforcing to ourselves that we must continue to focus on both short-term and long-term performance, and we will be keenly focused on continuing to deliver consistently strong performance. Now let me review our highlights regarding execution of our operating theme for 2017 : Yes! We've Got It. The key priorities for the year are great people providing great service, profitably growing our commercial business, leveraging the Internet, Yes! We've Got It, and leveraging information technology. On the retail front this past quarter under the great people providing great service theme, we continued with our intense focus on improving execution. While we've been adding store payroll this year, we're now enhancing our training to store-level AutoZoners and increasing the share of voice regarding availability and the Yes! We've Got It theme. We've been aggressive on our technology investments and believe these initiatives will help differentiate us on a go-forward basis. We realize as customers have become much more tech and mobile savvy, we have to have a sales proposition that touches all the ways they desire to interact with us. Our current and future technology investments will lead to sales growth across all of our businesses. The focus is on making sure AutoZoners can see inventory availability across the entire organization, not just their store, swiftly and accurately. In regards to commercial, we opened 12 net new programs during the quarter. Our expectation is we will continue to open new programs in the range of 200 programs in 2017. As we continue to improve our product assortments and availability and as we make other refinements to our commercial offerings, we expect that the estimated sales potential from the market will continue to grow. Our results continue to provide us confidence to be aggressive in adding resources and new programs to this very important growth initiative. We should also highlight another strong performance in return on invested capital, as we were able to finish our second quarter at 31.0%. We continue to be pleased with this metric as it is one of the best, if not the best, in all of hardlines retailing. However, our primary focus has been and continues to be that we ensure every incremental dollar of capital that we deploy in this business provides an acceptable return well in excess of our cost of capital. It is important to reinforce that we will always maintain our diligence regarding capital stewardship as the capital we invest is our investors' capital. Before I pass the discussion over to Bill Giles to talk about our financial results, I'd like to thank and reinforce how appreciative we are to our entire team's efforts to continue to meet and exceed our customers' wants, needs and desires. We remain bullish on our future performance because we have a great business operated by exceptional AutoZoners. Now, I'll turn the call over to Bill Giles. Bill? William T. Giles - AutoZone, Inc.: Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to talk more specifically about our retail, commercial, and international results. For the quarter, total auto parts sales, which includes our domestic, retail and commercial businesses, our Mexico and Brazil stores, and our 26 IMC branches, increased 1.6%. Switching over to macro trends, during the quarter, nationally unleaded gas prices started out at $2.16 a gallon and ended the quarter at $2.31 a gallon, a slight increase. Last year, gas prices decreased per gallon during the second quarter starting out at $2.09 and ending at $1.72. While prices at the pump are higher today than they were last year at this time, we continue to feel the absolute price of $2.31 a gallon is not high enough amount to change the driving behavior of Americans as we continue to see miles driven increasing. We also recognize that the impact of miles driven on cars over seven years old, the current average, is much different than on newer cars in terms of wear and tear. Miles driven increased 1.6% in October, 4.2% in November, and 0.5% in December. And for all of 2016, miles driven were up 2.8%. The other statistic we highlight is the number of seven-year-old and older vehicles on the road, which continues to trend at our industry's favor. For the trailing 52 weeks ended, total sales for AutoZone store was $1.775 million. For the quarter, total commercial sales increased 7.2% and the second quarter commercial represented 19% of our total sales and grew $29 million over last year's Q2. This past quarter, we opened 12 net new programs versus 32 programs opened in our second quarter of last fiscal year. We now have our commercial program in 4,437 stores, or 83% of our domestic stores, supported by 183 hub stores, and approximately 900 of our programs are three years old or younger. In 2017, we expect to open approximately 200 new programs. As we have begun our fiscal 2017, our trends have accelerated, which is encouraging to us. We are focused on having a great sales team and having much stronger engagement of our store management teams, particularly the store managers and district managers. We remain confident that we will continue to gain market share with our commercial customers. We are encouraged by the initiatives that we have in place and feel 2017 should be a better sales growth year than 2016. Our Mexico stores continued to perform well. We opened three new stores during the second quarter. We currently have 491 stores in Mexico. This upcoming year, we expect to open approximately 40 new stores. As Bill said earlier, we were challenged by difficult foreign exchange rate in regard to the peso. While sales and base currency were above plan this quarter, the devaluation in the peso was much greater than we assumed at the start of the year. The peso devalued over the course of the quarter and this has created a headwind and our EPS was negatively impacted by $0.18 a share. We do believe the Mexico leadership team has done an exceptional job managing the peso-denominated business. Regarding Brazil, we opened one new store and currently are operating nine stores. Our plans are to grow between 20 and 25 total stores over the next few years. And while sales growth has been very encouraging, we continue to refine our business model to make sure that it works for us financially. Gross margin for the quarter was 52.7% of sales, down 9 basis points. The decrease in gross margin was attributable to higher shrink expense and higher supply chain costs associated with the current inventory initiatives, partially offset by lower acquisition costs. In regards to product cost inflation, it was relatively insignificant. Currently, we feel costs will be predictable and manageable, and we remain cognizant of future developments regarding inflation, and we'll make the appropriate adjustments, should they arise. Compared to the prior year, we have incurred more costs related to our supply chain in support of our inventory availability initiatives, along with rising shrink expense after several years of declining expenses. The merchandising organization has and will continue to work diligently to offset these headwinds with a focus on lowering acquisition costs. Our primary focus remains growing absolute gross profit dollars in our total auto parts segment. SG&A for the quarter was 35.9% of sales, higher by 9 basis points from last year's second quarter. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales were higher than last year due to higher domestic store payroll, offset in part by lower incentive compensation. We are beginning to see an acceleration in average wage rates as certain states and municipalities have increased minimum wages and as some national retailers have also increased entry-level wages. EBIT for the quarter was $384 million, up 0.3% over last year's second quarter. Our EBIT margin was 16.8%. Interest expense for the quarter was $34 million compared with $32.8 million in Q2 a year ago. Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $5.152 billion, or $307 million more than last year's balance of $4.845 billion. Our adjusted debt level metric finished the quarter at 2.6 times EBITDAR. While in any given quarter we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on management's opinion regarding debt and equity market conditions, we remain committed to both our investment-grade rating and our capital allocation strategy; and, share repurchases are an important element of that strategy. For the quarter, our tax rate was 32.2% versus last year's Q2 of 34.7%. And I want to take a moment to remind listeners of AutoZone's first quarter adoption of a new accounting standard. The new standard requires us to recognize the tax benefit received from the gains employees have on stock options as a credit to income tax expenses on the P&L. This past quarter, it lowered our tax rate 358 basis points. This accounting change also increases the diluted share count calculation. Net income for the quarter was $237.1 million, up 3.7% over last year. Our diluted share count of 29.3 million was down 4.7% from last year's second quarter. The combination of these factors drove earnings per share for the quarter to $8.08, up 8.8% over the prior year's second quarter. Excluding the impact of the previously mentioned change in accounting for stock option exercises, our EPS would have increased by 3.8% for the quarter. Relating to the cash flow statement, for the second fiscal quarter, we generated $157 million of operating cash flow. Net fixed assets were up 7.3% versus last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $118 million and reflected the additional expenditures required to open 37 new locations this quarter, capital expenditures on existing stores, hub and mega hub store remodels or openings, work on development of new stores for upcoming quarters, initial investments in our new domestic DCs and information technology investments. With the new stores opened, we finished this past quarter with 5,346 stores in 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, 491 stores in Mexico, and nine in Brazil for a total AutoZone store count of 5,846. We also had 26 IMC branches open at fiscal year-end, taking our total locations to 5,872. Depreciation totaled $72.8 million for the quarter versus last year's second quarter expense of $68.7 million. This is generally in line with the recent quarter growth rates. We repurchased $198 million of AutoZone stock in the second quarter and, at quarter-end, we had $585 million remaining under our share buyback authorization, and our leverage metric was 2.6 times at quarter-end. Again, I want to stress we manage to appropriate credit ratings and not any one metric. The metric we report is meant as a guide only, as each rating firm has its own criteria. We continue to view our share repurchase program as an attractive capital deployment strategy. Next, I'd like to update you on our inventory levels in total and on a per store basis. The company's inventory increased 8.7% over the same period last year, driven primarily by our ongoing inventory initiatives during the fiscal year and, to a lesser extent, by the deterioration of sales trends at the end of the quarter. Inventory per location was $665,000 versus $633,000 last year, and $647,000 just this past quarter. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable, on a per location basis was a negative $36,000 versus a negative $57,000 last year, and a negative $67,000 last quarter. As a result, accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 105.5%. Finally, as Bill previously mentioned, our continued disciplined capital management approach resulted in return on invested capital for the trailing four quarters of 31%. We have and will continue to make investments that we believe will generate returns that significantly exceed our cost of capital. Now, I'll turn it back to Bill Rhodes. William C. Rhodes, III - AutoZone, Inc.: Thank you, Bill. This quarter, our sales and profitability performance were not up to our standard. Much of the challenge was macro in terms of delayed IRS refunds, but we have also incurred rising operating costs, which include our initiatives. At the end of the day, we have had a remarkable track record of success and we will continue to focus on optimizing both short and long-term performance. We have an exceptional team that executes extremely well. Our focus remains on being successful over the long run. That success will be attributable to our approach to leveraging our unique and powerful culture and focusing on the needs of our customers. To execute at a high level, we have to consistently adhere to living the pledge. We cannot and will not take our eye off of execution. We must stay committed to executing day in and day out on our game plan. Success will be achieved with an attention to detail and exceptional execution. Over the course of the last quarter, two topics have garnered a significant amount of attention and, before we move to Q&A, I would like to address those directly. First, following the election, the border-adjustable tax has become a hot topic. As I'm sure many of you know, I was part of a contingent of Retail Industry Leaders Association CEOs who went to Washington, D.C. and met with President Trump, members of his administration, and various members of Congress to share our perspective on the potential harmful effects of this proposal. While we are concerned about the impact on retail business models, we are more concerned about the ramifications for hard working American families due to likely significant inflation that would ensue. Our key message is that we certainly support a pro-growth agenda, including corporate and individual tax reform, but we stress the importance of a thoughtful approach to tax reform to avoid any unintended consequences. Secondly, there have been articles written and increased dialogue around online retailers encroaching on our space. Much of the information highlighted is not new news. There haven't been any significant changes in the competitive landscape, including suppliers' relationships with online retailers. We are very aware of online threats and we are very focused on leveraging our longstanding strengths to effectively compete with all competitive sets. While clearly the online channel has grown their share in the automotive aftermarket and virtually every other retail sector, to-date our portion of the sector of the industry has continued to grow generally in line with the overall market. While we can never take any competition lightly, we believe we have some clear strengths that allow us to more than effectively compete. Specifically, the trustworthy advice provided by our AutoZoners each and every day helps customers in many ways, in many cases where they don't know what parts or services that they need, and we provide basic services to get them on their way. We also have the ability to test parts on cars to determine exactly what the problem is. With 80% of the U.S. population within eight miles of an AutoZone, the immediacy to resolve a customers' needs with trustworthy advice and having the right high-quality parts remains a competitive advantage for us. Our customers have choices and we must exceed their expectations in whatever way they choose to shop with us. We are fortunate to operate in one of the stronger retail segments and we continue to be excited about our industry's growth prospects for 2017. As consumers continually look to save money while taking care of their cars, we are committed to providing the trustworthy advice they have grown to expect. It truly is the value-add that differentiates us from any other faceless transactions. Customers have come to expect that advice from us. It is with this focus we will implement more enhancements on both our website and in-store to provide even more knowledgeable service. We don't ever expect an online experience to replace the advice our customers want, but they do expect more information on repairing their vehicles. This aspect of service has always been our most important cultural cornerstone, and it will be long into the future. Our long-term model is to grow new store square footage at a low single-digit growth rate and we expect to continue growing our commercial business at an accelerated rate. Therefore, we look to routinely grow EBIT dollars in the mid single-digit range or better in times of strength. And we leverage our very strong and predictable cash flow to repurchase shares, enhancing our earnings per share growth into double-digits. We feel the track we are on will allow us to continue winning for the long run. We believe our steady, consistent strategy is correct. It is the attention to details and consistent execution that will matter. Our belief is strong consistent strategy combined with superior execution is a formula for success. Our charge remains to optimize our performance regardless of market conditions and continue to ensure we are investing in the key initiatives that will drive our long-term performance. In the end, delivering strong EPS growth and ROIC each and every quarter is how we measure our sales. Now, we'd like to open up the call for questions. Operator : Our first question comes from Alan Rifkin from BTIG. Your line is open. Alan Rifkin - BTIG LLC : Thank you very much. Bill Rhodes, based on your past experience with the delays in income tax refunds, is there any reason why we should not believe that the revenues lost in Q2 will be replaced dollar-for-dollar in your fiscal third quarter? William C. Rhodes, III - AutoZone, Inc.: That's a great question, Alan. How are you? I would say, first of all, all indications that we see are that the total tax refund dollars will be the same as they have been the last few years, so that is a good thing. The piece that we don't know and which is unchartered waters for us is the timing is going to be delayed significantly more than it has been in the past. We've had times where it's been a week or a week-and-a-half. This time there was a full three-week or more delay for the most significant of those refunds. And so, one thing that we question \u2013 we don't have any facts to know whether it's good, bad, or indifferent for us is with the timing being in a different time of year, do more of those dollars come into our sector or do more of those dollars go into another sector. We don't know the answer to that, so we're somewhat going to have to wait and see what happens. Alan Rifkin - BTIG LLC : Okay. Thank you. And a follow-up, if I may. So, with respect to your three initiatives : increased delivery, the hubs, and the mega hubs, all of which are at various stages of maturity, can you just go through and assess your belief in terms of the potential progress of each of those three, and what the ultimate revenue gains and profitability gains and, most importantly, ROIC gains can be? If you had to rank the three initiatives, Bill, in terms of ultimately what would give you the biggest bang for the buck, how would you rank them? Thank you. William C. Rhodes, III - AutoZone, Inc.: Yeah. Great. First of all, I would start with hubs. We've got 183 or so hubs that are out there today. They are tried and true. We first started them around 2000-2001. We somewhat deemphasized them in the middle 2000s and realized in 2008 or 2009 how vitally important they were, so we rejuvenated them in 2008 or so, and they have been humming right along ever since. That gave us the insight that expanded parts coverage is a material differentiator in the marketplace. So, then we came up with the concept of mega hubs, which basically doubles the number of SKUs that we carry in the local marketplace that takes it to 80,000 to 100,000 SKUs. Ever since we began talking about the mega hub, every time we've talked about it, we've said they continue to exceed our performance. I don't know that we could be more bullish or more open about how good that has worked for us so far. So, we're really excited about that. Everybody keeps asking us why don't we go faster. I promise you we're going as fast as we can, but a big part of this is finding really high-quality retail space that's 30,000 square feet. That's not easy to do. I think our teams have done a great job getting the 13 that we have open. We have about five or so more to open in the second half of the year. We hope to be able to open 25 to 40. We're still trying to figure out what that right number is. As we continue to outperform, I think that makes the likelihood of the number being higher rather than lower. And then, the third one is... Alan Rifkin - BTIG LLC : (39:35) William C. Rhodes, III - AutoZone, Inc.: I'm sorry? Alan Rifkin - BTIG LLC : No, I'm sorry, Bill. Please go ahead. William C. Rhodes, III - AutoZone, Inc.: The third one is multiple frequency of delivery, MFD, for us. And that one's been a little bit of a mix bag. So far, we absolutely believe it's the right thing to do. But we've gone and we've changed a significant amount forever. In our 37-year history, the vast majority of our stores we've delivered once-a-week and so our replenishment algorithms are based on once-a-week deliveries. Our DCs and the way they're structured are set for once-a-week deliveries. Our stores and the way they put up trucks are set for once-a-week deliveries and on and on and on. And as we've gone further, if you know, we kind of slowed this one down about six months ago. We slowed it down because we started to uncover some unintended consequences that were happening as a result of those changes. We still believe, this, in some form, is going to be the right thing to do for our customer and for our business. We still got quite a bit of work to do to make sure that we optimize it. So, that one is still a little bit in flux, the other two are tried and true. They're in full implementation mode. We just got some work to do to refine MFD. Sorry, Alan. Alan Rifkin - BTIG LLC : No, thank you very much. Does the potential exist for any of the hubs to be converted to mega hubs? William C. Rhodes, III - AutoZone, Inc.: Yeah, that's what's happened with some of them. Some of them are on a piece of property where we can add another 15,000 square feet and so we've done that. Others of them are landlocked and it may be a great hub store that's in the right place, but we have to move it because we've got to get a bigger facility. It's strictly about the size of the facility. Alan Rifkin - BTIG LLC : Okay. Thank you very much. William C. Rhodes, III - AutoZone, Inc.: Yeah. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Seth Sigman, Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Seth I. Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thanks. Good morning, guys. William C. Rhodes, III - AutoZone, Inc.: Good morning. Seth I. Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: A couple of questions on gross margin. First on the shrink issue, it seemed to be one of the biggest differences versus prior quarters. Have you seen a change in the actual losses or does that just reflect inventory growth over the last few quarters, and how do we think about that drag on margin rate going forward into the back half of the year? William T. Giles - AutoZone, Inc.: That's a good question. I mean, we've had really a number of years of unprecedented shrink results, they've been really historically low, and now we're seeing that turn the other way. And we recognize, as you highlighted, we've made a lot of changes, as Bill just kind of walked through a little bit on some of the inventory availability initiatives, particularly on more frequent deliveries. So, we've introduced a lot more activity in the supply chain and the store operations and suspect that that probably has contributed a little bit, but I would expect that headwind to continue for a little bit of time. It takes time for shrink to be able to turn around. It's not something that's going to turn around in a particular quarter, but I suspect it will continue to improve and the teams are working really hard to be able to bring it down. Seth I. Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. And then, I guess, more broadly, there has been some gross margin pressure across the space. As you think about pricing, have you seen any change in pricing behavior? I mean, it seems like most of the gross margin issues are company-specific or isolated, but just wondering if you've seen any sort of promotions or pricing changes across the group. William T. Giles - AutoZone, Inc.: Yeah, that's a good question, because when you look at our gross margin, we've rifle shot at two (42:50) particular individual items, both supply chain, which is inventory availability initiatives that we're very conscious (42:57) about; shrink, which has been in the historic lows and now a little bit higher. Past that, our gross margin rate is very healthy. We have not seen any kind of pricing activities in the marketplace that I would consider to be disruptive. Our merchandising organization continues to work very hard at lowering acquisition costs and have been very successful at it. So, overall, I would categorize our gross margin is very healthy. It continues to be very healthy in rational industry. We've got a couple of items that are in our control, and we're working hard at reducing them. Seth I. Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : The next question comes from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Benjamin G. Zerman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. This is Ben Zerman on for Simeon. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to piggy back a little bit on the inventory initiatives and then ask another question related to miles driven trends. Related to inventory initiatives, it looked like you actually slowed the multi-frequency delivery rollouts a little bit this quarter, yet the shrink expense popped up. Can you give us any color around what to expect in terms of gross margins for the back half of the year? Should we expect them to expand if the shrink in inventory headwinds persist or can you give us some color on that? And then I have one more question. William C. Rhodes, III - AutoZone, Inc.: I think, first of all, we did intentionally slow down the multiple frequency delivery rollout. We actually tipped that on the last call that we were going to move from 300, 350 stores a quarter to 100 stores in a quarter, and that's what we did. And we did that because it's causing quite a bit of change and with change comes some disruption in our supply chain and we wanted to slow it down so that we can work through some of those elements to change management. And honestly, it's had the desired result. I think things are settling down a bit in our distribution centers. We added a tremendous amount of workload to them over the last couple of years, so we're pleased with that change. Clearly, that has resulted in some increased cost in our supply chain. You saw that called out in our press release. Part of that was due to MFD. Part of that was also due to the significant decline in sales that we had in the last three weeks. So, I think, as we think about it going forward, we've been sayings it's 15 or 20 basis points of headwind going forward. Regarding the shrink question, I wouldn't necessarily draw a direct correlation in slowing down MFD and an increase in shrink. As Bill previously stated, I do think we've been moving a lot of inventory throughout our network over the last couple of years. And when you move inventory, the more times you handle it, the more susceptible you are to shrink. I again want to say what he said. We've had unprecedented improvements in our shrink expense over the last six years. It's going the other way now, but I am highly confident that our team will get back out in front of it and control it effectively. The only problem is, when shrink starts going one way or the other, it has a bit of a tail to it and takes some time to turn around; but, I think we would expect that to be a bit of a headwind for the balance of the year. Benjamin G. Zerman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. Thank you. And then, just one more question around miles driven. I know miles driven on at least a one-year, two-year basis decelerated a little bit in December. I don't know if you've seen this data, but if you were to slice the miles driven data by average vehicle age and look at each individual vehicle bucket, are you seeing any difference in trends between miles driven within your sweet spot of, say, 7-year old to 13-year old vehicles versus newer vehicles that tend to be with more the dealer while they're under warranty? William T. Giles - AutoZone, Inc.: No, and I'm not so sure that we have access to slice it that way. I mean, from our perspective, the 2.8% increase for 2016 is a great number. I mean, for us to be able to be anything above a 1% on miles driven is a really solid number. And so, it's going to reflect more wear and tear, and we feel really good about where the age of the vehicles are and the increased wear and tear that they are incurring given the higher miles driven. So, I think, again, it points to a really healthy industry. Benjamin G. Zerman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks, guys. William T. Giles - AutoZone, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Lasser from UBS. Your line is open. Michael Goldsmith - UBS Securities LLC : Good morning. It's Michael Goldsmith on for Michael Lasser this morning. Thanks a lot for taking my questions. My first question is on the tax refunds. And the delay in those tax refunds, did that have an outsized impact on particular parts categories or the DIY or commercial side of the business, and does the amount that you can recapture differ between these segments? William C. Rhodes, III - AutoZone, Inc.: Yeah. I think the second part of your question is yet to be determined. Historically, we think we've recaptured them. This time, as I said earlier, the timeframe is significantly different, so we'll have to wait and see a little bit. I think \u2013 the parts categories, yeah, there's some differences. I don't think there's really any material differences in which categories respond differently. There's some of them deferred maintenance categories, like brakes, where you'll see a more pronounced difference. Failure category is a little bit less pronounced because you have to get the car up and running that day. You asked specifically about differences between retail and commercial, and I would say it's definitely more pronounced in retail; but, as it lingered, we saw it increase in commercial. All of this is going to play itself out over the next three weeks or four weeks. We think it is transitory in nature. There's nothing we could have done about it. As we now look back on it, I don't think there's anything we would do differently as a result. We'll just somewhat have to deal with the consequences of them trying to deal with fraud, which I think is the right thing to do. Michael Goldsmith - UBS Securities LLC : That's helpful. And then, as a follow-up, given that we had a little bit of a colder December than last year, but generally a milder winter overall, how does that impact the setup for the rest of the year for Zone and the industry overall? William C. Rhodes, III - AutoZone, Inc.: Yeah, to me, that's the most germane question that we're talking about. We loved what happened in December. Last year, we didn't have that kind of winter weather, and it was very encouraging to us. All the long-term forecasts said that it was going to last longer and be more pronounced, but basically as soon as we got through the Christmas holidays, the weather got much more mild. We would have preferred that December would have repeated itself in January. In the past, we've had a very mild winter followed by a more normalized winter, and we've seen those sales rebound in the spring and, particularly, in the summer. We're a little bit uncertain as we go into this year. We think, clearly, some of the deferred maintenance items that were pulled into December and January last year, that did not happen, so we would anticipate getting those deferred maintenance items in the third quarter and in the beginnings of the fourth quarter. But as far as failure items, because of the difficult winter, I think it's still yet to be seen, so \u2013 chassis parts and brakes and the like. So, we're going to have to wait and see if it's a little bit of a different cycle for us. Michael Goldsmith - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks, again. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Brian Nagel from Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Brian Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Hi. Good morning. William T. Giles - AutoZone, Inc.: Good morning. Brian Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: So, I hope not to beat a dead horse here, but first question quickly on the tax refunds; I think it's basically a follow-up to the prior question. If you look at, I guess, the results we saw today, it seems as though this delay likely had a larger impact on the DIY side. So, the question I have, is that \u2013 and I understand this delay is different than prior delays. But as you look back over time, is that usually what happens? Do you usually see a more pronounced impact on the DIY side? William C. Rhodes, III - AutoZone, Inc.: Yeah. I would say, number one, we're much more mature in our retail business than we are in our commercial business. So, any macro headwinds or tailwinds we see more pronounced in the retail business. But clearly, every time we've seen it, it has been a bigger impact on retail than it has commercial. This time, we clearly saw it in commercial; although, it lagged a week-and-a-half or so. Brian Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay. And the second question I have \u2013 and I appreciate your comments, Bill, in your prepared remarks regarding E-Commerce because that has been a topic lately. So, the question I have is, has AutoZone taken any proactive \u2013 any more proactive actions lately, such as pricing \u2013 more aggressively pricing against some of the online competitors or even in advertising to protect the business more from this type of competition? William C. Rhodes, III - AutoZone, Inc.: I would say, no. I would say we are continuing to execute our strategy. And I also want to say our head's not in the sand. We're very much cognizant of what's going on in and around us, but I would say our pricing philosophies, our advertising philosophies to-date have not changed as a result of any competitive threat. I would say we're constantly looking for ways to optimize our pricing and we're constantly looking for ways to improve our advertising. And clearly, digital advertising is becoming more and more important, whether that's going up against an online-only competitor or going up against traditional brick-and-mortar competitors. That is becoming a more and more important element, but I don't see that as a shift because of online competition. Brian Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Got it. Thank you. William C. Rhodes, III - AutoZone, Inc.: Yeah. Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from Matt Fassler from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Chandni Luthra - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks. Thank you for taking my question. This is Chandni Luthra on behalf of Matt Fassler. Most of my questions have been answered, but just quickly wanted to touch base on one or two topics. In terms of tax refunds, last week seemed to have seen a little bit of a pickup in the refund activity. Bill, could you talk if your comps also saw a bit of refunds in the last week or this week? Just curious there. William C. Rhodes, III - AutoZone, Inc.: Yeah, sure. Last week, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday I think there was something like $70 billion of tax refunds that were released, not that we're paying attention. We clearly saw our sales increase as a result of that. I want to be really careful about getting into too finite of issues on what's going on day-to-day or even over a weekend. We're in this business for the long term. But clearly, as those large amount of refunds hit the market, we saw a pickup in our business. And I'll leave it at that. Chandni Luthra - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thank you. And then a follow-up on the lines of a question that Brian just asked in terms of the online business, the other category, ALLDATA, AutoAnything that declined 3% and was weak second quarter running, how are you thinking about improving trends in this business? Thank you. William T. Giles - AutoZone, Inc.: Yeah. I think on both very different businesses, by the way, and they have made some improvements since the previous quarter, so I think they'll continue to grow. I think AutoAnything has had some challenges over the last six or so months and there's some real opportunities for us to expand SKU assortments and also to increase our search engine optimization activities, et cetera, in order to drive traffic. So, I think that we'll continue to be competitive there. And ALLDATA continues to be a very strong business and a very important business in the commercial segment as well. So, both businesses are flattish at the moment, down a little bit, but they're making some improvements and we expect to see them continue to make improvements over the next few quarters. Chandni Luthra - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Perfect. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Mike Baker from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks. I guess, you had said you haven't really changed your pricing strategy, so I'll ask the question why not? How do you look at Amazon's pricing versus yours? I think a lot of us have done pricing studies and it does look like they are a little bit below you, so why wouldn't that necessitate a change to your strategy? William C. Rhodes, III - AutoZone, Inc.: Yeah. I don't think there's any question that they're priced below us in many different cases, but I think the value proposition is extraordinarily different. Number one, the convenience factor, you can walk into our store and the sense of immediacy, particularly if you have a failure part that's right at your hand, so you can get back on the road immediately versus having to wait overnight or a couple of days in most cases. I don't think many consumers today are willing to wait when their car is down for that. So, that's one element. There are many elements. Another element is we've got tremendous trustworthy advice in our AutoZoners in-store. That comes with a cost and, therefore, it's part of the value proposition. But for an AutoZoner to help a customer figure out what is going on with their vehicle and what the solution is, there's value to the customer in that. We do core returns \u2013 a significant amount of our sales come with a core return where they're to take that core back and on and on and on. So, I think we feel like there's a significant value proposition differential between us and any online competitor. And what happens with that over time, we'll see. We've dealt with price competition for years. And some of that price competition, for instance, is in mass merchandising, and we've effectively managed through that over the years because there's a different value proposition. So, we don't see it necessarily any different. Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: So, I guess, to follow up on that \u2013 and those are good points, are there any way to quantify those points, whether it be the need for immediacy? You gave us the year-over-year growth in buy-online in-store pickup, but what percent of your total sales was that or maybe what percent of your sales come with some consultation rather than just someone grabbing an item and going percent of returns, anything like that? And by the way, can you help us what do you mean by a core return? I'm not familiar. William C. Rhodes, III - AutoZone, Inc.: So, a core return is, if you buy an alternator from us, we will sell you the alternator for, let's say, $100, and has a $25 core because the old alternator is \u2013 it's a remanufactured alternator and the old alternator is the raw material to make the next one, so there's a deposit, if you will, is what a core charge is. So, the point is there's a tremendous reverse supply chain in this business that doesn't exist in many other businesses. A lot other businesses can talk about returns, but this one has a significant reverse supply chain. On buy-online pickup-in-store, it's not a significant part of our business today, so I don't want to overstate that. And then you asked how are we going to determine what this right price differential is over time. I think we're going to do it just the same way we've done the last 37 years. It's trial and error. We've had different competitive channels over the years and we have very effectively been able to optimize our pricing in light of the different competitive sets and I think we'll continue to do that. Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Good. I think I'll turn it over to someone else now. Thanks. William C. Rhodes, III - AutoZone, Inc.: Thanks. William T. Giles - AutoZone, Inc.: Thanks, Mike. Operator : The next question we have is coming from Dan Wewer, Raymond James. Your line is open. Dan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thanks. Bill, one of the territories that did not achieve above-average same-store sales growth was the Southeast. We've seen a large number of O'Reilly stores opening in the State of Florida. Can you talk about how the growing competitive overlap in that state could be impacting sales growth? William C. Rhodes, III - AutoZone, Inc.: Yeah. Dan, I wouldn't overstate their role into South Florida. We have different competitors that are going into different parts of the country all the time. Clearly, Florida is a strong market for us, but we're not the most dominant player as far as store count in Florida. There are others that have significantly more stores than us. I don't think we're seeing anything different in Florida than we've seen as we've had competitive encroachments in other parts of the country. Dan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And then just a second question and talking about Mexico. It sounds like that could be a longer-term challenge, given some of the political decisions being made in Washington. Is there anything that you can do to \u2013 whether it's hedging or pricing, anything to improve the profitability of your stores in Mexico? William C. Rhodes, III - AutoZone, Inc.: Yeah. I would start with, first of all, we're very pleased with the performance of our Mexico business. I think our team down there has done a superb job of managing in light of this significant devaluation of the peso. Frankly, this all started a couple of years ago and, if you recall, we were talking last year that we thought it would kind of be a one-time deal and then would have muted impact going forward. That clearly has not happened. Post the election, the peso significantly deteriorated yet again. We can't manage the peso. We can go off and hedge, but we've elected not to do that. We've elected to try to do most of our hedging by buying in local currency and, therefore, we hedge the product cost versus hedging the profitabilities. But at the end of the day, if there's a deterioration in the peso, it hurts our U.S. dollar profits. But at the end of the day, we would be doing the same thing in Mexico that we've been doing all along, and it's been a good business for us and we anticipate it being a good business for a long time. Dan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: And then the last question I have is on the better momentum in commercial. Do you think that's primarily the sales training that you alluded to earlier focusing on Yes! We've Got It? Are you expanding that message to a larger number of commercial customers or is it just going to your existing Platinum or Gold accounts and hitting them more aggressively? William C. Rhodes, III - AutoZone, Inc.: I think it's multifaceted. Number one, yes, we're out communicating to our customers Yes! We've Got It in a way that we never have before. We believe we can do that because we're in a better position than we ever have been before. So, I would add a lot of the emphasis to just strictly the improvements that we have in inventory availability. And then as we've talked over the last year, another big part of what we're trying to do is significantly increase the engagement of our store managers and our district managers in this business. Many of us, myself included, grew up with the retail business. And so, for lack of a better term, it's kind of our comfort zone or our fast ball. We've got to force ourselves to get deeper and deeper into the commercial business and I think we're doing that over time and I think that will pay long-term significant dividends. Dan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thank you. William C. Rhodes, III - AutoZone, Inc.: Thank you, Dan. Operator : Thank you. The next question we have is coming from Steven Forbes from Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open. Steven Forbes - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Good morning, guys. William C. Rhodes, III - AutoZone, Inc.: Good morning. William T. Giles - AutoZone, Inc.: Good morning. Steven Forbes - Guggenheim Securities LLC : I wanted to focus on growth in the commercial segment, given the acceleration this quarter and maybe just high-level \u2013 some high-level commentary on how this business is progressing relative to your expectations in both segments, right, building existing customers and then also gaining new customers. William T. Giles - AutoZone, Inc.: I think on both sides we've been very pleased overall, even with the recent performance of the quarter. I mean, we had an acceleration in our commercial programs overall. We're clearly gaining share, growing significantly faster than the industry. The team has put in several new programs in order to help drive both existing customers as well as prospecting and attaining new customers as well. So, that business does seem to be healthier and it seems on a track to continue to grow. So, I think on both sides, it's been healthy, but it's really more the existing customers that have been really strong, and that's the one area that we're really focused on. Steven Forbes - Guggenheim Securities LLC : And then, maybe staying on that topic as a follow-up, I mean, is there anything to call out regionally? I mean, we talked about some of the regions so far this call from a performance standpoint within the commercial segment any one outstripping others? And then, do you know where you're gaining share from when you think about growing your existing customer base or is it really broad? William T. Giles - AutoZone, Inc.: It's very broad and in fairness we have a low market share, so we believe that there's enormous greenfield opportunities for us across the country. All the regions performed reasonably well. Clearly, the weather-affected regions in prior years had been more challenged, but they weren't this year. They continued to perform well. So, we see it pretty balanced across the country, so we feel pretty good about the commercial team as a whole and how they're performing. Steven Forbes - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll hand the call over back to Mr. Bill Rhodes. Thank you. William C. Rhodes, III - AutoZone, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Before we conclude the call, I would like it take a moment to reiterate that our business model continues to be very solid. We're excited about our growth prospects for the balance of the year. We'll not take anything for granted, as we understand our customers have alternatives. We have a solid plan to succeed this fiscal year, but I want to stress that this is a marathon and not a sprint. As we continue to focus on the basics and focus on optimizing long-term shareholder value, we are confident AutoZone will continue to be very successful. Thank you all for participating in today's call. Have a great day. Operator : That concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Bill Rhodes : Good morning and thank you for joining us today for AutoZone's 2017 third quarter conference call. With me today are Bill Giles, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and IT; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax. Regarding the third quarter, I hope you've had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not, the press release along with slides complementing our comments today, are available on our website, www.autozoneinc.com. Please click on Quarterly Earnings Calls to see them. To begin this morning, I want to thank all AutoZoners across the Company for their tremendous efforts during this past quarter. While our results for the quarter were below our expectations, the challenges seem to be broad-based across our industry and other sectors of the economy. The first few weeks of our 12-week quarter were very challenging. On our last conference call, we discussed the impact on the second quarter of the delay in income tax refunds, and that headwind continued for the first five weeks of our third quarter. Our expectations have been that much of those delayed refunds would lead to incremental store sales in Q3 but that never materialized. We don\u2019t have any empirical evidence of where those funds went but they seem to go to some other part of the economy this year. While our March sales did improve, we saw inconsistent week to week performance. It wasn\u2019t until April that we began to see stronger sales results. We can speak at length about delayed income tax refunds and the second consecutive mild winter but the more overarching thing for us was sluggish customer demand across virtually every category, resulting in disappointing sales performance during a specific eight-week period. As we exited the quarter, we felt our sales trends had normalized and were more consistent with our performance from September to mid January, rather than the challenging results we delivered in late January through March. Before getting into more detail about the quarter, I would like to address some of the trends and headwinds that our industry and specifically our business has recently been experiencing. Until our second quarter, we had consistently delivered exceptional performance marked by 41 consecutive quarters of double-digit earnings per share growth. However, there are certain factors present today that have made it more difficult to achieve similar earnings per share growth. We have made decisions to accelerate some investment in our business. We're investing at an increased rate in inventory, capital expenditures with two new domestic distribution centers under construction and we opened a second distribution center in Mexico in the fall and we've increased our operating expenses as part of our more frequent delivery and mega hub efforts. Unfortunately, as we intentionally increased our investment profile, our sales have been below our expectations each of the last two quarters. Simultaneously, we faced several other pressure points. Over the last year, we have experienced accelerated pressures on wages than we have in some time. Some of this is attributable to regulatory changes in certain space and municipalities while the balance and probably the larger portion is being driven by general market pressures with lower unemployment and some specific actions taken in recent years by other retailers. Additionally, after several years of substantially improved shrink performance, the last two years shrink expenses turned against us. We own it and we're working it diligently but as we're moving more inventory to more locations -- our inventory availability initiatives, it's not completely surprising that are shrink results are unfavorable. And there are few other macro trends that are working in our favor right now. After years of benefit to our EPS growth rate, interest expense has begun to turn from a driver to a detractor; the Mexican peso exchange rate has worked against us for the last couple of years also. Our management team has been in this business for a long time and over time we been through many different cycles. Sometimes we had tailwinds and we benefited from those and other times we had headwinds and we have fought against them. Ultimately, we will continue to manage this business for the long term to provide great service for our customers and great opportunities for AutoZoners owners, ultimately delivering strong shareholder value. Our current charge is to determine is some of the decisions that we've made need to be modified, specifically the frequency we deliver in our stores and the significant incremental costs that come with that decision. Our recent performance has been more challenging and some of those headwinds will remain for some period of time. We know that this business model has excelled over decades and we're confident with our AutoZoners leading the charge that that will continue.  Now, let me provide more detail on the quarter. For the quarter, our sales increased 1%; our domestic same-store sales were down 0.8%. It was the tail of two periods. In the first five weeks, our same stores sales were down more than 4% and the last seven weeks, our comps increased approximately 2%. We continue to see our Northeastern, Midwestern, and Mid-Atlantic markets underperform the balance of the chain as two consecutive mild weathers negatively impacted these regions. This quarter, there was less [ph] of a drag at approximately 100 basis points but on a two-year basis, this region of the country has materially underperformed the remainder. These regions represent roughly 25% of overall sales. In regards to our three primary merchandised category, those we classify as failure, performed the best while the maintenance category performed the worst. Maintenance challenges were created during the tax refund delay and only gradually improved as the quarter progressed. We do however expect this category to improve its performance during Q4. During the quarter, we opened another 35 new stores in the U.S. Year-to-date we have opened 84 stores and still expect to open approximately 70 more in the fourth quarter. Our commercial business expanded by 40.6%, while opening 56 net new programs. This trend slowed down from last quarter's 7.2% increase, much of which was experienced in the first five weeks of the quarter. We expect to open approximately 200 net new commercial programs for the fiscal year or approximately 95 additional programs in our last quarters. Currently 83% of our domestic stores have a commercial program. We continued to expand in Mexico, opening eight new stores. We didn't open any additional IMC branches or stores in Brazil this quarter. While the domestic business dominates our sales mix and continues to be our primary focus, we believe we have great growth opportunities outside the U.S. Regarding Internet, we experienced improving trends versus our first two quarters as our results improved sequentially as the quarter moved along. When I discuss online, I'm referencing business shipped directly to the customer and not buy online and pick up in-store. Our pick up in store business sales are recorded in store sales and are not in the All Other category. Our pickup in store business continues to grow pretty rapidly, up over 30% for the quarter and higher than the 20% increase we experienced in Q2. Under the Yes! We've Got It theme, we remained focused on improving our closure rates, meaning converting customer requests from pricing and availability into actual sales. In the spirit of satisfying our customers, we are making ongoing significant system investments and enhancements to capture data about our customers' shopping patterns across all our platforms, both domestically and internationally. We understand that we have to be able to share information and process seamlessly between our stores, commercial shops, phone and online experiences in order to meet all of our customers' needs. As our primary objective remains growing our domestic retail and commercial businesses, we continued with our inventory availability initiatives in order to respond to the ever-increasing challenge of parts demand in the industry. This past quarter, we opened one additional mega hub location and now have 14 in operation. We are working diligently on the development of future sites and we expect to open two more during the upcoming fourth quarter and have a handful or more that are currently under development. We continue to be very pleased with our mega hub performance. Additionally, we are continuing development on our two new domestic distribution centers based in Washington state and Florida, and we are expanding our distribution center in Illinois. Our current expectations are for the Washington state facility to come online in this Q4 while the Florida facility and our Illinois expansion will open six to nine months later. We continue to expect each of the two new distribution centers to cost approximately $60 million in capital and have some incremental operating expenses from preopening activities and maturation. Now, I'd like to take a moment to go into more detail on our two inventory availability initiatives. These are two very discrete and different strategies addressing different opportunities. Multiple frequency of delivery is solely focused on improving the in-stock levels for the SKUs that are stocked in our stores. Separately, the mega hubs are focused on adding additional coverage to the local markets, meaning adding SKUs that would not have been available locally in our market -- our network before. Regarding multiple frequency of deliveries, we had roughly 2,300 stores receiving more than one weekly delivery at the end of Q3. While we added 100 additional stores this past quarter, we continued to modify our modeling. As you remember, up until recently, we have serviced the vast majority of our stores once a week. All of our systems, processes and practices have been built and fine tuned for onetime a week delivery. As a result, transitioning stores to more frequent deliveries has resulted in some unintended consequences operationally within our distribution centers as well as our stores. Therefore, we are continuing to closely manage this initiative and continually make adjustments. As our overall performance in recent quarters has been challenging, it has been difficult for us to see the sales benefits from this initiative. We have been reassessing for some time whether or not our new frequency of delivery for higher volume stores of three times a week is providing us with sufficient benefit to justify the cost. While we continue to test, current indications are steering us to lower frequencies of delivery. With these ongoing results, we are in the process of moving a significant amount of these stores to twice a week delivery and some of the lower volume stores back to once a week delivery. We're committed to ongoing testing as we understand the sensitivities to different delivery schedules. Ultimately, we have to make the right investments to enhance our customers\u2019 experience but they have to be financially responsible as well. The second ongoing initiative is the mega hub store concept. We're currently operating 14 mega hubs. We continue to be quite pleased with what the mega hubs allow us to offer our customers. As a reminder, these super-sized AutoZone stores carry 80,000 to 100,000 unique SKUs, approximately twice what a hub store carries today. They provide coverage to both, surrounding stores and other hub stores, multiple times a day or on an overnight basis. Our sales results thus far in our open mega hubs continue to exceed our expectations. Currently, we have just over 4,000 stores with access to mega hub inventory. A majority or about two-thirds of these 4,000 stores receive their service on an overnight basis, but as we expand our mega hubs, more of them will receive this service same day and many will receive it multiple times a day. We expect to ultimately operate 25 to 40 mega hubs once the implementation is complete. The constraint on the speed with which we can open these is availability and location of real estate. While an average AutoZone location is just under 7,000 square feet, a mega hub is 20,000 to 30,000 square feet or more. Identifying and developing these locations in prime retail areas is challenging and takes time. While there are incremental costs to those rollouts, we continue to feel these investments will provide a better customer experience and increased market share. We\u2019ve not experienced meaningful noteworthy deleverage from this initiative during fiscal 2017. Along with improving our local parts availability and assortment, we continue to manage this organization to provide exceptional service for our customers, provide our AutoZoners with a great place to work with opportunities for advancement, and ensure we do it on a long-term profitable basis to provide strong returns for our shareholders. We will continue to stress the importance of going the extra mile to fill our customers' needs regardless of how difficult the request. And to this end in spite of a challenged near-term, we continued to be shared gainers this past quarter. Regarding Mexico, we opened eight new stores this quarter and ended the quarter with 499 stores. And just last week, I was down with our exceptional team in Mexico, celebrating the opening of our 500th stores in Mexico in just 18 years of operation. I'm so very impressed by and proud of the business, the team and most importantly, the culture our team in Mexico has built. In local currency, Mexico experienced a solid quarter. However, Mexico's profit in U.S. dollars declined, given the decrease in the value of the peso to the U.S. dollar. As our peso financial results are converted to U.S. dollars on an average rate over the quarter, we continued to experience headwinds to our net earnings as a result. Based on exchange rate differences this year to last, we experienced another significant headwind to earnings per share. Sales in our other businesses for the quarter were down 2.5% over last year's third quarter. So, it got sequential improvement each quarter since the start of the year. As a reminder, our ALLDATA and E-Commerce businesses which include AutoZone.com and AutoAnything, make up this segment of sales. This compares to being down 3% last quarter and reflects stronger performance in AutoZone.com's business for Q3. Also as I previously mentioned, we continue to see strong growth in our buy online pick up in store sales. This strength in pickup in store encourages us to continue investing in our in-store experience. Pick-up in store, while smaller than home delivery, continues to increase in sales volume. We recognize that the majority of our site traffic is providing information to our customers prior to purchase and our E-Commerce platform represents an important part of our omni-channel experience. We see customers doing lots of research to learn about the products and on how to do repairs. While these businesses are small for us and less than 5% of our total sales, the omni-channel experience is important and we will continue to invest in our E-Commerce platform. With the continued aging of the car population, we continue to be optimistic regarding trends for our industry in both DIY and DIFM. As new vehicle unit sales are reaching all-time highs and gas prices on average are quite low, miles driven continue to increase. The lower end consumer benefits the most from lower gas prices relative to income. This trend remains encouraging. Regarding our expectation for the remainder of 2017, we expect sales performance to improve in Q4 as trends began to improve in April and May. As we exit a disappointing performance from both our Q2 and Q3 results, we remain committed to focusing on the short and the long term. Let me review our highlights regarding execution of our operating theme for 2017 : Yes! We've Got It. The key priorities for the year are, one, great people providing great service; two, profitably growing our commercial business; three, leveraging the Internet; four, Yes! We've Got It; and five, leveraging IT. On the retail front, this past quarter, under the great people providing great service theme, we continued with our intense focus on improving execution. We are focusing on enhanced training to store-level AutoZoners and increasing the share of voice regarding availability with the Yes! We've Got It theme. We've been aggressive on our technology investments and believe these initiatives will help differentiate us on a go-forward basis. We realize as customers have become much more tech and mobile savvy, we have to have a sales proposition that touches all the ways they desire to interact with us. Our current and future technology investments will lead to sales growth across all our businesses. The focus is on making sure AutoZoners can see inventory availability across the entire organization, not just their store, swiftly and accurately. Many have the question how susceptible our industry is to online encroachment, and how bigger the role that is playing in this current industry soft spot. Currently every sector of retail has been and likely will continue to be impacted by this new rule. We have certainly studied the ramifications and continue to do so. While some portions that our industry has migrated in part to online we believe that the trustworthy advice elements combined with the sense of immediacy insulates us more than most sectors of retail and over time today that has certainly proven to be the case. As we assess this, we consider the needs of our customers. When their car loan start and they need to go to work, they can't wait hours or days. When they don\u2019t know what is wrong, they can't afford to purchase multiple products. They rely on us to help them isolate the problem. Our commercial customers have to immediately turn their base because time is money. We believe and are committed to leveraging the power of the digital world to further enhance our unique value proposition and we believe we will continue to succeed. We have seen the current industry sales challenges as being broad-based categorically and more pronounced in certain geographies. Why would that had happened quickly in the later part of January outside of the promotional holiday season and have subsided in April. Our sense is that industry weakness was due to tax reform delays and a second consecutive mild winter. In regards to commercial, we opened 56 net new programs during the quarter. Our expectation is we will continue to open new programs in the range of 95 programs in Q4 of 2017. As we continue to improve our product assortments and availability and as we make other refinements to our commercial offerings, we expect that the estimated sales potential from the market will grow. Our commercial sales performance for the quarter was below our expectations. As with retail, commercial sales improved the last seven weeks of the quarter and were weaker in the Northeast, Mid-West and Mid-Atlantic markets. Our sales growth has decelerated in the last several quarters. Some of the deceleration, as we have previously discussed, has been the result of slower growth in new programs and less maturation of stores opened in recent years. But, we haven't been pleased with our level of growth. So, we have recently embarked on a new strategic planning exercise focused solely on how we can profitably accelerate our market share growth in this very important sector of our industry. We are quite pleased with tripling our sales and more than tripling our profitability in this business in the last nine years. But, what got us to this level won\u2019t necessarily get us to the next level. So, we are going to take an objective look at our approach for the next several months. We will continue to push for current performance but simultaneously explore other possibilities. This continues to be the most significant mid-term growth opportunity as we currently have approximately 3% market share, and we are determined to substantially enhance that over time. We should also highlight another strong performance in return on invested capital, as we were able to finish our third quarter at 30.5%. We continue to be pleased with this metric as it is one of the best in all of hardlines retailing. However, our primary focus has been and continues to be that we ensure every incremental dollar of capital that we deploy in this business provides an acceptable return, well in excess of our cost of capital. It is important to reinforce that we will always maintain our diligence regarding capital stewardship as the capital we invest is our investors' capital. Before I pass the discussion over to Bill Giles to talk about our financial results, I'd like to thank and reinforce how appreciative we are of our entire team's efforts to continue to meet and exceed our customers' wants, needs and desires. We remain bullish on our future performance because we have a great business operated by exceptional AutoZoners. Now, I'll turn the call over to Bill Giles. Bill Giles : Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to talk more specifically about retail, commercial, and international results for the quarter. For the quarter, total auto parts sales, which includes our domestic, retail and commercial businesses, our Mexico and Brazil stores, and our 26 IMC branches, increased 1.1%. For the trailing 52 weeks ended, total sales for AutoZone store were $1,768,000. For the quarter, total commercial sales increased 3.6% and the third quarter commercial represented 19% of our total sales and grew $17 million over last year's third quarter. This past quarter, we opened 56 net new programs versus 46 programs opened in our third quarter of last fiscal year. We now have our commercial program in 4,493 stores, or 83% of our domestic stores, supported by 184 hub stores; approximately 900 of our programs are three years old or younger. In 2017, we expect to open approximately 200 new programs. While our trends slowed during third quarter, our April and May sales were in line with our results from earlier this year, which while not meeting our aspirations, is morning encouraging in our trends in February and March. We remain focused on having a great sales team, supplement with strong engagement of our store managers and district managers. We remain confident we will continue to gain market share with our commercial customers and we\u2019re encouraged by the initiatives that we have in place and feel we can further grow sales. And as Bill previously mentioned, while we think our strategy has worked very well over the last nine years, we want to take a first objective look over the next several months. Whether anything material change, we don\u2019t know, but we do know, we will likely implement some tests to continue to learn how best we service our customers and further penetrate this large sector of our industry. Our Mexico stores continued to perform well on local currency basis. We opened eight new stores during the third quarter. At the end of the quarter, we have 499 stores in Mexico. We expect to open approximately 40 new net stores this year and next. As Bill said earlier, we were challenged by difficult foreign exchange rate in regard to the peso. While sales and base currency were above plan this quarter, the devaluation in the peso was much greater than we assumed at the start of the year. This has created a headwind and our EPS was significantly impacted. We do believe the Mexico leadership team has done an exceptional job managing the peso-denominated business. Regarding Brazil, we opened no new stores and currently are operating nine stores. Our plans are to grow between 20 and 25 total stores over the next few years. And while sales growth has been very encouraging, we continue to refine our business model to make sure that it works for us financially. Gross margin for the quarter was 52.6% of sales, down 21 basis points. The decrease in gross margin was attributable to higher supply chain costs associated with the current year inventory initiatives and higher inventory shrink results, partially offset by lower acquisition costs. Compared to the prior year, we have incurred more costs related to our supply chain in support of inventory availability initiatives, along with rising shrink expense after several years of declining expenses. Our primary focus remains growing absolute gross profit dollars in our total auto parts segment. SG&A for the quarter was 32.4% of sales, higher by 25 basis points from last year's third quarter. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales were 32.4%, deleveraging by 25 basis points. As I mentioned, operating expenses as a percent of sales were higher than last year, primarily from fixed cost deleverage due to our comparable stores sales decline, higher sales insurance costs and increasing wage pressures, partially offset by favorability from last year's discrete legal charge and lower incentive compensation. EBIT for the quarter was $530 million, down 1.3% last year's third quarter and our EBIT margin was 20.2%. Interest expense for the quarter was $35.7 million compared with $34.1 million in Q3 a year ago. As we completed a $600 million 10-year bond deal this past quarter, we're planning interest of $51 million in the fourth quarter versus $45.8 million last year's fourth quarter. Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $5,153 million or approximately $200 million more than last year's balance of $4,954 million. Our adjusted debt level metric finished the quarter at 2.6 times EBITDAR. While in any given quarter, we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on management's opinion regarding debt and equity market conditions, we remain committed to both our investment-grade rating and our capital allocation strategy; and, share repurchases are an important element of that strategy. For the quarter, our tax rate was 32.8% versus last year's Q3 of 34.8%. I do want to take a moment and remind listeners of our first quarter adoption of a new accounting standard. The new standard requires us to recognize the tax benefit received from the gains employees have on stock auctions as a credit income tax expense on the P&L this past quarter, it lowered our tax rate 231 basis points. This accounting change also increases the diluted share count calculation. Net income for the quarter was $331 million, up 1.3% over last year. Our diluted share count of 29 million was down 4.6% from last year's third quarter. The combination of these factors drove earnings per share for the quarter to $11.44, up 6.2% over the prior year's third quarter. Excluding the impact of the previously mentioned change in accounting for stock option exercises, our EPS would have increased by 3.2% for the quarter. Relating to the cash flow statement, for the third fiscal quarter, we generated $445 million of operating cash flow. Net fixed assets were up 7.9% versus last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled about $142 million and reflected the additional expenditures required to open 45 new locations this quarter, capital expenditures on existing stores, hub and mega hub store remodels or openings, work on development of new stores for upcoming quarters, and initial investments in our new domestic DCs and information technology investments. With the new stores opened, we finished this past quarter with 5,381 stores in 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, 499 stores in Mexico, and nine in Brazil for a total AutoZone store count of 5,889. We also had 26 IMC branches open at fiscal year-end, taking our total locations to 5,915. Depreciation totaled $75,300,000 for the quarter versus last year's third quarter expense of $68,500,000. This is generally in line with the recent quarter growth rates. We repurchased $284 million of AutoZone stock in the third quarter and, at quarter-end, we had $1 billion remaining under our share buyback authorization, and our leverage metric was 2.6 times at quarter-end. Again, I want to stress we manage to appropriate credit ratings and not any one metric. The metric we report is meant as a guide only, as each rating firm has its own criteria. We continue to view our share repurchase program as an attractive capital deployment strategy. Next, I'd like to update you on our inventory levels in total and on a per store basis. Company's inventory increased 7% over the same period last year, driven primarily by new store openings, our ongoing inventory initiatives during the fiscal year and lower sales performance and plans. Inventory per location was $653,000 versus $629,000 last year, and $665,000 just this past quarter. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable on a per location basis was a negative $47,000 versus a negative $69,000 last year, and a negative $36,000 last quarter. As a result, accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 107.2%. Finally, as Bill previously mentioned, our continued disciplined capital management approach resulted in return on invested capital for the trailing four quarters of 30.5%. We have and will continue to make investments that we believe will generate returns that significantly exceed our cost of capital. Now, I'll turn it back to Bill Rhodes. Bill Rhodes : Thanks Bill. This quarter we reported our second consecutive quarter of challenged sales and profitability performance following 41 quarters of double-digit growth and EPS. Clearly, some of our recent challenges have been macro like timing of IRS refunds, rising wages and interest rates and peso weakness, but macro challenges and benefits come and go. We also have some areas where we need to improve our performance and that is where our attention is focused, determining the right frequency of delivery to our stores from a cost benefit perspective; figuring out why our shrink results deteriorated and correcting those efforts; reaccelerating our sales in both retail and in particular in commercials; finding new ways to leverage our most important asset, our AutoZoners in an accelerating wage environment where personal touch and trustworthy advice really matter and differentiate us. While we are disappointed our recent performance as a Company and as a team, we have been through both periods of difficulty and periods of tremendous success. Over any extended period, our Company successes have been remarkable. While we need to challenge ourselves, our decisions, processes and strategies, we also need to remember our tremendous record of success and reinforce some of our guiding principles; evolution over revolution and superior execution with consistent strategy is a winning formula. Simultaneously as we are faced with more difficult circumstances, we must step back and take a more objective view of what is working and what may not be. As we are in that stage, we see so many things that our team continues to do exceptionally well. But we also see some areas of opportunities, more areas from accelerated experimentation. After so many years of unprecedented performance, I am proud of our team for their steadfast commitment to our culture, strategy and approach and for their dissatisfaction with our current performance. Having exceptional that executes extremely well, our focus remains on being successful over the long run. That success will be attributable to our approach to levering our unique and powerful culture and focusing on the needs of our customers. To execute at a high level, we have to consistently adhere to living the pledge. We cannot and will not take our eye off of execution. We must stay committed to executing day in and day out on our game plan. Success will be achieved with an attention to detail and exceptional execution. Our customers have choices; we must exceed their expectations in what the way they choose to shop with us. We are fortunate to operate in one of the strongest retail segments and we continue to be excited about our industry's growth prospects for 2017 and beyond. As consumers continually look to save money while taking care of their cars, we are committed to providing the trustworthy advice that they expect. It truly is the value-add that differentiates us from any other faceless transactions. Customers have come to expect that advice from us. It is with this focus we will implement more enhancements on both our website and in-store experience to provide even more knowledgeable service. We don't ever expect an online experience to replace the advice our customers want, but today's customers do expect more information on repairing their vehicles. This aspect of service has always been our most important cultural cornerstone, and it will be long into the future. Our charge remains to optimize our performance regardless of market conditions and continue to ensure we are investing in the key initiatives that will drive our long-term performance. In the end, delivering strong EPS growth and ROIC each and every quarter is how we measure ourselves. This formula has been extremely successful over the last 38 years and we continue to be excited about our future. Now, I'd like to open up the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instruction] The first question comes from the line of Mr. Alan Rifkin from BTIG. Your line is now open, sir. Alan Rifkin : Question for Bill Rhodes, starting with respect to the comps, I appreciate all the color that you have described throughout the quarter but Bill, can you segregate the impact of the tax refund versus the weather on the quarter overall? And can you also talk about the comp performance of the stores that is supported by the mega hubs versus the stores that are not? Then I have a follow-up please. Bill Rhodes : Okay. Regarding separating the comps between the weather and the tax refund, it's really difficult to do that Alan. I wish I can give you more clarity. I would like to go on little more detail on the tax refund. As we mentioned on our last call, we fully expect that those refunds have been shifted later in the cycle and we would actually see a benefit from those in Q3. For whatever reason that we don\u2019t quite understand, those refund dollars never seem to show up. I don\u2019t know -- if I went to say things, [ph] you hear some of that; as I go to remittances to Mexico, did they show up in other sectors in retail or other sectors of economy, we don\u2019t know. But it does not appear that they came into our sector in any meaningful way. And we\u2019ve watched it very closely and we have monthly reporting on market share from two different sources and both of those sources continue to show that our market share gains were very similar throughout this period of time. We just had an eight-week period, three weeks in last quarter and five weeks in this quarter, we were just significantly impacted; it was kind of like when the calendar turned in April, things went back to normal like they were in the fall and early winter. Regarding the mega hubs, we continue to see that it provides a benefit when our store get turned on to it, very significant benefit, 1% to 1.5% range when they get fully turned on to full service out of mega hubs. Alan Rifkin : And my follow-up, if I may, your decision to increase your operating expense obviously is well documented. But certainly, when you started to do that, I don\u2019t believe you foresaw the difficulty in the environment. What is your ability and willingness going forward, if sales continue to be a little bit below your plan; what is your willingness to cut back on some of the discretionary spending and expenses [technical difficult]? Bill Rhodes : I think there are several things in that question, Alan. First of all, as we increase this investment profile, not only the sales get weaker but several of the things that have been industry tailwinds and our financials are macro tailwinds and our financials turned against this, so it was a little bit of a double whammy. As we look at it going forward, yes, we're going to change our cost structure where we can. The biggest question we\u2019re focused on right now is, we think there is some opportunities to decrease the multiple frequency of deliveries that we\u2019ve rolled out over the last couple of years. Unfortunately, we've not been able to quantifiably see that we're getting a sufficient benefit out of that. So, we're going to continue to test and take some of these stores down to two times a week, we can set a three times a week and hopefully make a final decision in the next six months or so on where we will be long-term. We will pull back some of those costs. What we won\u2019t do is pulling [ph] back cost at the point we're not providing great service to our customers. We're in this for the long-term and sometimes we're going to have periods of little bit weakness and sometimes going to have great periods of strength. We\u2019ve got to manage this business for the long-term. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Mr. Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Simeon Gutman : Bill, you mentioned that the last seven weeks were up 2%, can you share with us if that 2% run rate was relatively uniform during the period, or volatile? And then, related to that, is the run rate that you are seeing today, because you did mention May, does that -- do you feel like it resolved the debate, whether the industry is healthy, there was just a bunch of noise? I mean how do you know there is just some pent up demand that\u2019s being realized in the late part of last quarter and early part of this quarter? Bill Rhodes : Great questions, Simeon. When we talked about May, we were talking about May that we was still in the same part of our portal. As we think about the sales environment, what we noticed was there was a very distinct eight-week period of time where it acted very differently. Go back to the fall, September through mid-January, it was pretty consistent. Now, we have fluctuations week-to-week and you asked about in April that we see fluctuations. Of course, we do because the weather patterns in April are so different. But the expectations week to week based upon the weather that we were experiencing was more consistent with our expectations. That was not the case in that February to March period of time. Simeon Gutman : I guess looking back at the last, I don\u2019t know, a year, it feels like the industry has become a little less consistent, maybe a little less predictable. Looking back at it, do you feel like it\u2019s explainable by a bunch of these small things or relatively large things? And you mentioned, you are requisitioning a lot of things and some of it is strategic but on the industry as a macro, can you share with us what your requisitioning, what we should be thinking through just given some of the bumps that this industry, which is not normally used to it has experienced over the last year or so? Bill Rhodes : Yes, that\u2019s a great question. So, as I think about the industry sales environment and when I think about AutoZone\u2019s sales performance over the last year as compared to other years, we have come off to very, very mild winters. I have mentioned it in the prepared remarks, what we have experienced over of two year period of time in the Northeast, Midwest, and Mid-Atlantic is alarming. I don\u2019t think that has anything to be with what's going on in those markets. I think it has to do with what's going on with the weather pattern. We can see it in specific categories that are very related to snow, ice, salt potholes, mainly under car items. So, I think very strong as that has as impacted our industry's performance. And then, this whole tax refund thing, this year, it was just a tremendous anomaly. I can't explain it; I don\u2019t know where those dollars went but that has been such a big driver of our industry sales over the last five or six years and it just went away this year, it was non-existent. And the other thing on AutoZone\u2019s front is our commercial sales are decelerated. They decelerated because we were doing a lot of things on opening new programs and our sales were benefiting from that. As we\u2019ve gotten further down that maturation, we hadn\u2019t had [ph] the same benefit from those. But we continue to gain market share in both retail and commercial. We believe the sales environment is going to continue to be pretty strong. Operator : The next question comes from Mr. Steven Forbes with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now open. Steven Forbes : Given the dichotomy of the P&L impact, you mentioned right between the mega hub rollout and as compared to frequency delivery rollout both top and bottom line, if you decide to further slow down the rollout of the frequency initiative, does that free up resources to ramp in mega hub initiatives or is the bottleneck really finding real estate? Just give us some color on the urgency around that initiative, given the potential benefit and just the business restrains relating to rollout of it. Bill Rhodes : It has such a good blend, Steven. We feel really good about the mega hubs and the results that we have had. And you are spot on that there are some real estate constrains relative to our ability to open up more and more mega hubs. You will see us continue to open up mega hubs and the speed at which that we open them up will be somewhat contingent upon finding the right available real estate in order to do that from more frequent delivery standpoint. Look, we are an analytically driven company, and if we do not see the benefits from the investments that we are making, we are going to make adjustments to that. So from that perspective, yes, we believe that we will basically reduce expenses from that perspective in the future as we make adjustments to that. Steven Forbes : And then, maybe a follow-up on the frequency of delivery rates. Have you identified which stores will revert, if so, back to the two times or one time for weak delivery? And then, maybe just touch on what parameters are going to drive that decision? I would imagine it's not simply just sales, right, given the service aspect of the business; I would imagine competition may play a role in a decision. Just maybe you could touch on some of the parameters that are going to drive that decision process? Bill Rhodes : Yes, that\u2019s a host of those things but frankly you have hit on the right one, sales can be a big driver, distance, number of stores on a route et cetera. So there will be a number of factors there. But sales are going to be heavily weighted, because again we have adequate return on the investment dollars that we are putting forth and right now we don\u2019t believe that we are not going to make adjustments to it. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Mr. Matt Fassler from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Matt Fassler : My first question relates to your thought process on the economics of some the investments that you necessarily -- you might want to pull back. What's the ROI, the financial ROI calculation that you have done to determine whether it works for you? And if you do back away, where would we see some of the investment, would it be gross margin, SG&A, CapEx et cetera? Bill Giles : Yes. Matt, it's not as much an ROI calculation because the capital that we are deploying to do this is not that significant. We are opening these two distribution centers, not because of multiple frequency of delivery, but because we need an incremental distribution capacity. But this is more about how are we going to -- better than a breakeven on the sales environment for the operating expense increases that we have experienced. So, the vast majority of the difference will be seen in gross margins; there will be a little bit of it in the SG&A but most of it will be in gross margins. Matt Fassler : Is that a function of the frequency of truck runs diminishing and consequently the supply chain cost coming down? Bill Giles : Yes, it's predominantly supply chain; it's truck runs but it's also extra tours to the distribution centers, so labor in the DCs. Matt Fassler : And do you feel like there is any -- I mean obviously there is a trade off, do you feel like there has been some sales benefits to you from this that would dissipate or do you feel like it hasn\u2019t really moved the needle? Bill Rhodes : I think there has been some very minor improvements in sales which would go away, but it's not material, unfortunately. If it was, we continue to do it. And I want to be careful here. We have not made final decisions. This is a very complicated analysis to do. So, we are still doing some work over the next several months to figure out what the right frequency for us is. One of the things we are realizing is that many years ago in our hub stores, we started doing kind of feeder replenishment out of those stores to the outlined store that they service and so that\u2019s one of the reason we are not getting the same kind of benefits out of the multiple frequency of delivery. We were already [indiscernible] highest probability SKUs that we sell; so that benefit didn\u2019t exists for us. Matt Fassler : And then, my second question, speaking about what changed this quarter, if we look at sales per store or kind of back into comp, DIY didn\u2019t really decelerate, almost all of the deceleration related to commercial. How should we dimensionalize that as you think about both the macro factors you discussed related to taxes and whether -- and also to some of the changes in investment posture they have for that space? And do you agree with my read of the numbers by the way? Bill Rhodes : I agree with your read of the numbers versus last quarter but you remember, last quarter got killed at the end, particularly DIY. So, I think both businesses have been impacted during that eight-week period of time pretty significantly. And our commercial business has decelerated more than we would have expected. By the way that\u2019s why we're going back and taken another strategic look at commercial. I'm really excited about what we're going to be doing. It\u2019s going to take us some time but we're going to take a fresh look at what we\u2019re doing in commercial and what are our long-term strategies there. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Mr. Seth Sigman from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Seth Sigman : My first question is around the international performance; just wondering if you could quantify the impact from FX and also the impact from results in Mexico and how those may have underperformed.. And just as you think about the state of that business, are there adjustments that you're making or any signs of stabilization there? Bill Giles : I would say, the core base business continues to do well, if you just look at it on a local currency basis, the business continues to perform strong. We're very pleased with what the team has done down there et cetera; from a foreign currency exchange impact on our EPS growth rate, it is probably a little less than 1% of an impact from a growth rate prospective. So, it continues to be a bit of a headwind. So, for us, it\u2019s really about the exchange rate; there is not a lot of strategies that we're necessary going to change. We feel pretty good about the position of Mexico, we're excited about 500th store opening as Bill mentioned earlier. So that business continues to go well but hopefully the peso will turn around a little bit in future. Seth Sigman : And then regarding the gross margin, if you back out the supply chain impact and the shrink impact this quarter, it still says that the benefit from lower acquisition cost would be less than prior quarters. So, when you peel back to gross margin, can you just give us a sense of what some of the underlying drivers are there? Bill Giles : Yes. I would say actually we feel really good about what the merchandising organization has done relative to continuing to find opportunities to lower acquisition costs. We mentioned a couple of quarters ago about our activity around direct importing and we continue to increase that. So, the team has done a nice job there, continuing to increase that. So, I feel really good about the health of the gross margin rate today and going forward. It may be a little bit less but it\u2019s still very healthy and it\u2019s very well positioned. So, we have a couple of very identifiable expense items that are putting some headwind on gross margin, both of which we believe are just near-term headwinds and we will be able to work our way through those. But lowering acquisition costs is something that we think is there for a while. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Mr. Michael Lasser of UBS. Your line is now open. Michael Lasser : Bill Rhodes, what do you think the long run rate or the comp of this business is? Is it materially different than what has been in the past, especially you're going to come up against the much easier comparison you are running at 2% comp or so right now, shouldn\u2019t it be better than the 2% as you anniversary some of the easier trends that you saw last year? Bill Rhodes : I don\u2019t want to get into what's going to happen as we go into individual quarter comparisons but I'll go into what your original question is. What has changed with the macro outlook for sales in this industry over the long term? I would answer that absolutely nothing. We had an eight-week period of time, which we believe we can very easily attribute to the tax refund delays and two mild winters. But I don\u2019t see anything else in this industry that has changed really at all. Michael Lasser : Based on that comment, do you think a 2% run rate is still a realistic long-term expectation, reasonable expectation of business, if nothing changed? [Ph] Bill Rhodes : Again, I don\u2019t want to get into giving guidance. What I'll tell you is I think the industry performance over the long term has not changed by any significant level. And the one challenge that we have in our sales performance compared to what it's been over the last five years is that our commercial business is not growing at the same rate that it was growing before as we opened all those new programs. We have to take that on and we have to find ways to accelerate the market share gains that we are already getting in commercial. And that will be a critical element of our story over time. Michael Lasser : And my follow-up question is you are making a lot of tweaks of your delivery, availability and frequency, and replenishment, do you think if you were to lower prices, your sales would increase? Bill Rhodes : I have been in this business for 22 years. I can't add up five times without seeing lower prices lead to higher sales. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Seth Basham of Wedbush Securities. Your line is now open. Seth Basham : My first question is just on your long-term growth algorithm, Bill. You previously stated the mid single digit EBIT growth and double digit EPS growth, is that still how you see about the business? Bill Rhodes : I think over the long term, we would -- that would be -- continue to be our goal. I did highlight, in the short-term, we have a disproportionate amount of things, some of which are decisions we have made or things we have done to ourselves and some of them are kind of a disproportionate amount of macros things that are current and are headwinds for us. I think in the intermediate term, we have some more challenges to get to those numbers. Over the long-term, particularly if we are able to reaccelerate our commercial business, that will continue to be our goals and aspirations. Seth Basham : And then secondly, my follow-up question is drawing inventory per store. We have seen a rise in that mix for the last couple of quarters. Are you comfortable with the levels you are at; do you expect to see some declines going forward? How should we be thinking about that and the potential impact down the road on margins and sales? Bill Giles : I think as we move forward, we expect that number to hang where it is little bit, maybe come down a little. You saw that came down consecutively from last quarter on a per store basis. So, inventory levels are little bit higher than we would have desired; some of that was sales related; some of that also is some of the activities that have relative to opening up mega hubs, direct import activity et cetera. So, some of that is for good reasons. But, we expect it to moderate going forward. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ms. Kate McShane from Citi Research. Your line is now open. Kate McShane : With regards to the comps, there are other macro factors; it seems like less improvement in the unemployment rate and slightly higher gas prices year-over-year. Just wanted to see what your perspective was on those impacts to the overall comp? And I may have missed in prepared comments but just talk a little bit about traffics into your stores and how that\u2019s changed over the last couple of quarters? Bill Rhodes : Okay. Regarding those macro trends that you talked about, regarding unemployment and increased gas prices, the only time we\u2019ve really seen unemployment be a key driver of our performance is when it has been significant increases like during the great recession. And for whatever reason that seems to be a driver of our business rather detractor of our business. On gas prices, clearly, we want them to be as low as possible. But the only time we\u2019ve really seen -- or call them out as material contributors to our success or headwinds for us, have been when they really got up around $4 a gallon. So, I don\u2019t think we believe move from 2 to 250 is going to make any significant difference on our performance. Regarding traffic, clearly our traffic was down this quarter, particularly on the retail side of the business, it was one of the softer quarters that we have had. It has not performed any different than it has over the long term during this April period of time, in order it perform any differently in the fall. We do have an industry -- as an industry, our long term challenge was traffic going down but at the same time cost of products going up as the quality improves on the products that we sell, we have been doing that last 20 years. Kate McShane : Thank you. Bill Rhodes : All right. Thank you. Before we conclude the call, I just like to wish everyone a nice Memorial Day weekend and thank you everyone that have served in our process. [Ph] But we are excited about our growth prospects for the year. We will not take anything from granted as we understand our customers have alternatives. We have a solid plan to succeed this fiscal year. But I want to stress that this is a marathon and not a sprint. As we continue to focus on the basics and focus on optimizing long-term shareholder value, we are confident AutoZone will continue to be very successful. Thank you for participating in today's call. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes today's conference. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect.",

William Rhodes : Good morning and thank you for joining us today for AutoZone\u2019s 2017 fourth quarter conference call. With me today are Bill Giles, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax. Regarding the fourth quarter, I hope you\u2019ve had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter\u2019s results. If not, the press release along with slides complementing our comments today, are available on our website, www.autozoneinc.com. Please click on Quarterly Earnings Conference Calls to see them. To begin this morning, I want to thank all AutoZoners across the company for their tremendous efforts during this past quarter. Our results for the fiscal fourth quarter were in line with our expectations and demonstrated steady improvement compared to our fiscal third quarter performance. Sales results from month-to-month were relatively consistent. However, the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic and Midwestern markets remained challenged and underperformed the remaining parts of the country. As has been well documented following two consecutive mild winters, many of the categories that are influenced by harsh winter conditions continued to be pressured. Additionally, this summer\u2019s temperatures were generally mild and our category performance in many of the hot weather categories were softer than we expected. Overall, we were encouraged to see our same-store sales return to being positive despite these headwinds, and market share data indicates that our shared gains have been accelerating. We continue to make good progress on our initiatives that are aimed at improving our ability to say yes to our customers more frequently, drive traffic to our stores and accelerate our commercial business. Specifically, we saw improvement in our commercial business and in our supply chain. Total commercial sales increased 5.9% compared to 3.6% in Q3. While our supply chain expenses delevered versus last year, we began to make improvements in our network and are beginning to operate more efficiently again. During the quarter, we opened a new distribution center in Pasco, Washington and expect to open an additional D.C. in Ocala, Florida in mid-fiscal 2018. We also continue to be encouraged by the sales increases we experienced from our mega hubs, which typically service several hundred stores. The mega hubs act as distribution nodes for hard-to-find parts for their network stores. We opened two new mega hubs during the quarter and expect to open approximately 10 more in fiscal 2018. These mega hubs further our ability to say, yes, we\u2019ve got it to all of our customers. Before getting into more detail about the quarter, I want to share our perspective on some of the trends and headwinds that our industry and specifically our business has recently been experiencing. There are certain factors present today some macro and others that relate to actions we have taken as part of our long-term strategy that have created challenges to us delivering the same level of profitability growth that we have been delivering. We intentionally made the decision to invest in our business at an accelerated rate in inventory, capital expenditures and operating expenses. Unfortunately, as we increased our investment profile, our sales have been slower than we would have thought due to poor performance in several of our weather-sensitive categories and our multiple frequency of delivery initiative did not generate the benefits yet that we expected. Additionally, as our commercial program openings have slowed, our overall commercial sales growth has declined as well. Simultaneously, we faced several other pressure points. Over the last year, we\u2019ve experienced accelerated pressure on wages significantly more than I have experienced in my nearly 23 years of Autozone. Some of this is attributable to regulatory changes in certain states and municipalities, while the balance and probably the larger portion is being driven by general market pressures with lower unemployment and some specific actions taken in recent years by other retailers. The regulatory changes are going to continue as evidenced by the areas that have passed legislation to increase their wages substantially over the next few years. Additionally, we are experiencing increased levels of shrink in our interest expense after years of lower rates is beginning to increase. The collective combination of these factors have significantly hampered our earnings per share growth. Businesses, market trends and costs tend to run in cycles. This year, we unfortunately experienced a disproportionate amount of them working against us. At the same time, we\u2019ve made decisions to accelerate our investment profile. Our management team has been in this business for a long time, and we\u2019ve been through many different cycles. Sometimes we\u2019ve had tailwinds and we\u2019ve benefited from those. Other times, we\u2019ve had headwinds and we fought against them. Ultimately, we manage this business for the long-term to provide great service for our customers and great opportunities for our AutoZoners ultimately delivering strong shareholder value. While some of the current expense headwinds will remain for some period, we know that this business model has excelled over decades and we are confident with our AutoZoners leading the charge that will continue to be the case. We operate in a terrific industry with very good fundamentals, and we know our team can continue to deliver impressive long-term performance. Now let me provide more detail on the quarter. For the quarter, our sales increased 3.3% and our domestic same-store sales were up 1%. June was our weakest period, as it was much cooler than normal. We continue to see our Northeastern, Midwestern and Mid-Atlantic markets underperform the balance of the chain as two consecutive mild winters continued to negatively impact these areas and particularly their hard parts sales performance. This quarter, these areas\u2019 comp store sales were approximately 40 basis below the other markets. But on a two-year basis, at almost 500 basis points, this region of the country has materially underperformed the remainder. These regions represent roughly 25% of our overall sales. During the quarter, we opened 85 \u2013 84 new stores in the U.S. For the year, we opened 168 stores and expect to open approximately 150 stores in 2018. Our commercial business expanded by 5.9%, while opening 99 net new programs this quarter. Our commercial growth accelerated from last quarter\u2019s 3.6% increase, as we did not have the same headwinds in Q4 as Q3 from the income tax refund timing. We again expect to open approximately 150 net new commercial programs for this new fiscal year. Currently, 84% of our domestic stores have a commercial program. During the quarter, we continue to expand in Mexico opening 25 new stores, we opened five new stores in Brazil. This quarter marked the most openings we\u2019ve had in any one quarter in Brazil. We\u2019ve been doing business in Brazil since 2013, and we expect to open several more locations in 2018. We didn\u2019t open any additional IMC branches this quarter. While the domestic business dominates our sales mix and continues to be our primary focus, we believe we have great growth opportunities outside of the U.S. as well. Regarding the Internet, we experienced improving trends in web traffic, ship the home sales and commercial online orders. Additionally, our buy-online pickup-in-store continues to grow fairly rapidly. As we continue to make our online shopping experience better and better with ease of doing business improving, we would continue to expect these various channels to grow materially faster than in-store. Our goal is to create a seamless omni-channel experience for our customers meeting them where, when and how they want to interact with us. Under the Yes! We\u2019ve Got It theme, we remain focused on improving our closure rates, meaning, converting customer requests for pricing and availability into sales. In the spirit of satisfying our customers, we are making ongoing system investments and enhancements to capture data about our customer shopping patterns across all of our platforms, both domestically and internationally. We understand, we have to be able to share information and \u2013 seamlessly between our stores, commercial shops, phone and online experiences in order to meet all of our customer\u2019s needs. We expect our loyalty program and its vast membership to continue to help us mine customer shopping behaviors and grow sales materially in the future. This will be a big focus for us in 2018. As our primary objective remains growing our domestic retail and commercial businesses, we continued with our inventory availability initiatives in order to respond to the ever-increasing challenge of parts demand in the industry. This past quarter, we opened two additional mega hub locations and now have 16 in operation. We are working diligently on the development of future sites and we expect to open up to 10 more in 2018. We continue to be very pleased with our mega hub performance seeing them outperform our initial expectations. Additionally, this past quarter, we opened our ninth distribution center in Washington State and we expect to open a Florida DC by the middle of fiscal 2018. Both of these new DCs will reduce transportation radiuses and therefore lead times, while also providing much needed additional capacity to our distribution network. Each new distribution center cost us approximately $60 million in capital, and we incur some incremental operating expenses from preopening activities and maturation. Now I\u2019d like to take a moment to go into more detail on our two inventory availability initiatives. These are two very different strategies addressing different opportunities. Multiple frequency of delivery is solely focused on improving the in-stock levels for the SKUs that are stocked in our stores. While the mega hubs are focused on adding additional coverage to local markets, meaning, adding SKUs that would not have been available locally in our network before. Regarding multiple frequency of deliveries, we had roughly 2,300 stores receiving more than one weekly delivery at the end of Q3. However, as we haven\u2019t been satisfied with the benefits today, we made significant changes in the fourth quarter to test differing scenarios to determine the optimal approach. We moved some stores from three time a week deliveries to one or two time a week deliveries. We also made some significant changes to our replenishment algorithms. Many of these changes are made in the middle of the quarter and we don\u2019t have sufficient consistent results yet to make any long-term decisions, but there are indications that are very encouraging to us. Over the last two years, as we quickly ramped up this initiative, our costs substantially increased even beyond our expectations, as we put tremendous pressure on our supply chain. During the fourth quarter, some of the pressure began to subside and our cost increases began to abate. We have much continued work in front of us to determine the optimal approach and to regain the efficiencies we have historically enjoyed. The second ongoing initiative is a mega hub store concept. We\u2019re currently operating 16 mega hubs. We continue to be quite pleased with what the mega hub allow us to offer our customers. As a reminder, these supersized Autozone stores carry 80,000 to 10,000 unique SKUs, approximately twice what a hub store carries. They provide coverage to both surrounding stores and other hub stores multiple times a day or on an overnight basis. Our sales results thus far in our open mega hubs continue to exceed our expectations, both for retail and commercial. Currently, we have over 4,000 stores with access to mega hub inventory. A majority or about two-thirds of these 4,000 stores receive service on an overnight basis today. But as we expand our mega hubs, more of them will receive this service same day and many will receive it multiple times per day. We expect to ultimately operate 25 to 40 mega hubs once the implementation is complete. The constraint on the speed with which we can open these is availability and location of real estate. While an average AutoZone location is just under 7,000 square feet, a mega hub is 30,000 square feet or more. Identifying and developing these locations in prime retail areas is challenging and takes time. While there are incremental costs to these rollouts, we continue to feel these investments will provide a better customer experience and increased market share. We did not experience meaningful, noteworthy deleverage from this initiative during fiscal 2017. Along with improving our local parts availability and assortment, we continue to manage this organization to provide exceptional service for our customers, provide our AutoZoners with a great place to work with opportunities for advancement and ensure we do it on a long-term profitable basis to provide strong returns for our shareholders. We will continue to stress the importance of going the extra mile to fill our customers\u2019 needs regardless of how difficult the request. And to this end, in spite of a challenging fiscal 2017, we continued to be shared gainers over the course of the year. Regarding Mexico, we opened 25 new stores this quarter and ended the quarter with 524 stores. Mexico now represents just under 9% of our store base. I\u2019m so very impressed by and proud of the business, team and culture of our team in Mexico. In local currency, Mexico experienced a solid quarter as for the first time since the U.S. election last November, the value of the peso to the U.S. dollar strengthened. While we cannot guarantee anything when it comes to exchange rates, we certainly hope 2018\u2019s comparisons to 2017 are more favorable. Sales in our other businesses for the quarter were down 0.8% over last year\u2019s fourth quarter, showing sequential improvement each quarter since the start of the year. As a reminder, our ALLDATA and E-Commerce businesses, which includes AutoZone.com and AutoAnything, make up this segment of sales. This compares to being down 2.5% last quarter and reflects stronger performance in AutoZone.com\u2019s business in Q4. Also, as I previously mentioned, we continue to see strong growth in our buy-online pickup-in-store sales. This strength in pickup-in-store encourages us to continue investing in our in-store experience. We recognize that the majority of our site traffic is providing information to our customers prior to purchase and our E-Commerce platform represents an important part of our omni-channel experience. We see customers doing lots of research to learn about the products and how to do repairs. While these businesses are small for us and less than 5% of our total sales, the omni-channel experience is very important for the customer experience and we will continue to invest in our E-Commerce platform. With the continued aging of the car population, we continue to be optimistic regarding trends for our industry in both DIY and DIFM. As new vehicle sales are near all-time highs and gas prices on average are quite low, miles driven continue to increase. The lower-end consumer benefits the most from lower gas prices relative to income. This trend remains encouraging. Regarding our expectations for 2018, if we return to more normal weather patterns, we expect sales performance to improve as the year moves forward. As has been well documented, Hurricane Harvey and Irma have had a material impact on our large portion of our country. Our thoughts and prayers go out to our impacted our AutoZoners, customers and all of those who have had to deal with the tremendous effects from these storms. Lives have been affected and we are in those markets donating our time and resources to help everyone that needs us. We had more than 600 stores closed at some point as a result of these stores \u2013 storms. Through our team\u2019s heroic efforts, all of our stores were back open in the middle of last week. We did sustain damage to some stores and are still determining the ultimate cost that will be recorded in our first quarter. But at this time, we do not expect those costs to be material. Our efforts have now turned to Hurricane Maria, which appears headed directly to Puerto Rico tomorrow. Now let me review our highlights regarding the execution of our operating theme for 2017 : Yes! We\u2019ve Got It. The key priorities for the year are great people providing great service, profitably growing our commercial business, leveraging the Internet, Yes! We\u2019ve Got It and leveraging IT. On the retail front, this past quarter under the great people providing great service theme, we continued with our intense focus on improving execution. We are focusing on enhanced training to store-level AutoZoners and increasing the share of voice regarding ability to say Yes! We\u2019ve Got It.. We have been aggressive on our technology investments and believe these investments will help differentiate us on a go-forward basis. We realize as customers have become much more tech and mobile savvy, we have to have a sales proposition that touches all the ways they desire to interact with us. Our current and future technology investments will lead to sales growth across all our businesses. The focus is on making sure, AutoZoners can see inventory availability across the entire organization, not just their store, swiftly and accurately. Many question how susceptible our industry is to online encroachment, and how bigger the role that is playing in this current industry \u201csoft spot\u201d. Clearly, every sector of retail has been and likely will continue to be impacted by this new rule. We have certainly studied the ramifications and continue to do so. While some portions of our industry have migrated in small part to online, we believe that the trustworthy advice elements combined with the sense of immediacy insulates us much more than most sectors of retail and to-date that certainly has proven to be the case. Our real focus is how we substantially enhance our omni-channel efforts to increase our competitive position with online and brick-and-mortar competitors. I think, we should also try to put some definition around our industry and specifically our sales performance in this soft spot. There\u2019s been tremendous dialogue around our and our industry sales performance in recent months. Clearly, our sales growth while positive has been lower than the last three years, but our sales performance historically runs in cycles. We had one quarter in fiscal 2017 with a negative same-store sales. And the last time we had negative same-store sales for the year was 2005. Our same-store sales have averaged 1.9% over the last five years. This year, we ended the year with 0.5% growth, or 140 basis points below our recent average. In fiscal 2013, our same-store sales were flat. By the way that followed a very mild winter. So, yes, we see our sales softer than normal, but still within a normal band and we have several contributors to the 140 basis point departure from average, two consecutive mild winters followed by a cooler summer, tax refund delays that never materialized in our sales, also the slower growth in our commercial sales, primarily due to lower new program growth has slowed the overall comp increases. We believe these items have been the drivers of our sales soft spot and not a substantial online encroachment. In regards to commercial, we opened 99 net new programs during the quarter and 202 for the year. Our expectation is, we will continue to open new programs in the range of 150 in 2018, as we continue to improve our product assortments and availability and as we make other refinements to our commercial offerings. We expect that the estimated sales potential from the market will grow. As I\u2019ve said on last quarter\u2019s earnings call, we embarked on a new strategic planning exercise focused solely on how we can profitably accelerate our market share growth in this very important sector of our industry. While while were quite pleased that we have been able to in essence triple our sales and more than triple our profitability in commercial in the last nine years, we know we have to continue to involve our model to accelerate commercial sales to the next level. We are assessing how we can more effectively provide merchandise to our customers and reduce friction across all of our customer touch points. Commercial continues to be the most significant mid-term growth opportunity for the company, as we currently have approximately 3% market share and we are determined to substantially grow that over time. We should also highlight another strong performance on return on invested capital as we were able to finish our fourth quarter at 29.9%. We continue to be pleased with this metric and this is one of the best in all of hardline\u2019s retailing. However, our primary focus has been and continues to be that we ensure every incremental dollar of capital that we deploy in this business provides an acceptable return well in excess of our cost to capital. It is important to reinforce that we will always maintain our diligence regarding capital stewardship, as the capital we invest is our investors capital. Before I pass the discussion over to Bill Giles to talk about our financial results, I\u2019d like to thank and reinforce how appreciative we are of our entire team\u2019s efforts to continue to meet and exceed our customers\u2019 wants, needs and desires. We are bullish on 2018\u2019s sales potential, because we have a great business operated by exceptional AutoZoners. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Bill. William Giles : Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to talk more specifically about our retail, commercial and international results for the quarter. For the quarter, total auto parts sales, which includes our domestic, retail and commercial businesses, our Mexico and Brazil stores, and our 26 IMC branches, increased 3.5%. For the trailing 52 weeks ended, total sales for AutoZone store were $1,756,000. For the quarter, total commercial sales increased to 5.9%. Commercial represented 19% of our total sales and grew $37 million over last year\u2019s fourth quarter. This past quarter, we opened 99 net new programs versus 116 programs opened in our fourth quarter of last fiscal year. We now have our commercial program in 4,592 stores, or 84% of our domestic stores, supported by 186 hub stores; approximately 750 of our programs are three years old or younger. In 2018, we expect to open again approximately 150 new programs. As Bill mentioned just a moment ago, we remain focused on growing this business. We are committed to having a great sales team, supplemented with stronger engagement of our store managers and district managers. We remain confident we will continue to gain market share with our commercial customers and we are encouraged by the initiatives that we have in place and feel we can further grow sales. As previously mentioned, we\u2019re in the midst of a strategic review as we are supplementing our talented team\u2019s thoughts with those of a talented third-party, giving us the opportunity to look at our business through a new and more objective lens. While our teams have done tremendous work and have developed tremendous insights and hypothesis, we haven\u2019t determined where we go from here. And once we do determine our new strategies and tactics, they won\u2019t be rolled to the chain, that\u2019s not the Autozone way, we will put manageable test in place to determine if these are the right strategies. And we are highly confident that they will have to be tweaked and some will work and others won\u2019t. We expect to be testing and refining those tests for a year or so, and we will keep you informed as these progress. Our Mexico stores continue to perform well on a local currency basis. We opened 25 new stores during the fourth quarter. At the end of the quarter, we have 524 stores in Mexico. We again expect to open approximately 40 new stores in fiscal 2018. As Bill had said in the past, Mexico\u2019s business has been challenged throughout 2016 and 2017 by weakening peso foreign exchange rate relative to the U.S. dollar. Fortunately, this quarter, the peso strengthened again and finished close to where it started the year. This fluctuation can have a more meaningful impact on earnings, as our store base continues to grow. The Mexico leadership team has done a terrific job managing the peso-denominated business. Now regarding Brazil, we opened five new stores and currently are operating 14 stores. Our plans are to grow between 20 and 25 total stores over the next few years. While Brazil currently runs at an operating loss, we are encouraged by the sales per store being generated. We expect Brazil will grow its store base and even surpass Mexico store count over time if we can prove the operating model produces sufficient returns. Gross margin for the quarter was 52.8% of sales, down just 2 basis points. The slight decline in gross margin was attributable to higher supply chain costs, associated with current year inventory initiatives, partially offset by higher merchandise margins. While our supply chain and trick expense have been higher in support of our inventory availability initiatives, this past quarter showed tighter management of expenses. We continue to feel we can manage these expense categories throughout fiscal 2018, and our primary focus remains growing absolute gross profit dollars in our total Auto Parts segment. SG&A for the quarter was 32.6% of sales, higher by 53 basis points from last year\u2019s fourth quarter. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of sales are primarily due to deleveraging of occupancy cost and domestic store payroll, driven by a higher wage pressure. EBIT for the quarter was $708 million, a 0.6% over last year\u2019s fourth quarter. Our EBIT margin was 20.1%. Interest expense for the quarter was $51.4 million compared with $45.8 million in Q4 a year ago. As we completed the $600 million 10-year bond deal during the third quarter, we\u2019re planning interest of $39 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 versus $33 million last \u2013 in last year\u2019s Q1. The higher expense is due to tenor and size of the bond issued this past April. Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $5.081 billion, or approximately $160 million more than last year\u2019s balance of $4.924 billion. Our adjusted debt level metric finished the quarter at 2.6 times EBITDAR, while on any given quarter, we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on management\u2019s opinion regarding debt and equity market conditions. We remain committed to both our investment grade rating and our capital allocation strategy and share repurchases are an important element of that strategy. For the quarter, our tax rate was 33.9% versus last year\u2019s Q4 of 35.1%. I want to take a moment and remind listeners of our first quarter adoption of a new accounting standard, the new standard requires us to recognize the tax benefit received from the gains, from employees have on stock options exercised as a credit to income tax expense on the P&L. This past quarter, it lowered our tax rate 62 basis points. This accounting change also increases the diluted share count calculation. Net income for the quarter was $433.9 million, up 1.7% over last year. Our diluted share count of $28.4 million was down 4.8% from last year\u2019s fourth quarter. The combination of these factors drove earnings per share for the quarter to $15.27, up 6.8% over the prior year\u2019s fourth quarter. Excluding the impact of the previously mentioned change in accounting for stock option exercises, our EPS would have increased by 6.1% for the quarter. Relating to the cash flow statement, for the fourth quarter, we generated $561 million of operating cash flow. Net fixed assets were up 8% versus last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled about $196 million and reflected the additional expenditures required to open 115 new locations this quarter, capital expenditures on existing stores, hubs and mega hub store remodels or openings, work on development of new stores for upcoming quarters, investments in our new domestic DCs and information technology investments. With the new stores opened, we finished this past quarter with 5,465 stores in 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, 524 stores in Mexico, and 14 in Brazil for a total AutoZone store count of 6,003. We also had 26 IMC branches open at fiscal year-end, taking our total locations to 6,029. Depreciation totaled $103.1 million for the quarter versus last year\u2019s fourth quarter expense of $93.9 million. This is generally in line with recent quarter growth rates. We repurchased $227 million of AutoZone stock in the fourth quarter. At quarter-end, we had $824 million remaining under our share buyback authorization, and our leverage metric was 2.6 times at quarter-end. Again, I want to stress, we manage to appropriate credit ratings and not any one metric. The metric we report is meant as a guide only, as each rating firm has its own criteria. We continue to view our share repurchase program as an attractive capital deployment strategy. Next, I\u2019d like to update you on our inventory levels in total and on a per-store basis. The company\u2019s inventory increased 6.9% over the same period last year, driven primarily by new store openings. Inventory per location was $644,000 versus $625,000 last year, and $653,000 last quarter. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable on a per location basis was a negative $48,000 versus a negative $80,000 last year, and a negative $47,000 last quarter. As a result, our accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 107.4%. Finally, as Bill previously mentioned, our continued disciplined capital management approach resulted in return on invested capital for the trailing four quarters of 29.9%. We have and will continue to make investments that we believe will generate returns that significantly exceed our cost of capital. Now, I\u2019ll turn it back to Bill Rhodes. William Rhodes : Thank you, Bill. Before I conclude, I want to take this opportunity to reflect on fiscal 2017. The year was clearly more challenging than recent years, but our team continued to deliver some very impressive accomplishments and milestones. In recognition of the dedication, passion, innovation and commitment of our AutoZoners, I want to highlight that our sales grew to a record $10.9 billion this year, and we grew same-store sales at 0.5%. We opened our 6,000 store and had the incredible honor to do so in our hometown of Memphis, Tennessee. In May, we opened our 500 store in Mexico, a tremendous accomplishment by that talented team. We restarted our store development work, as we enter the next phase of testing in Brazil and we expanded to 14 stores in and around Sao Paulo. Our supply chain is undergoing tremendous expansion with the opening of our second distribution center in Mexico and the opening of our ninth domestic D.C. in the U.S. and Pasco, Washington. Additionally, our 10th domestic D.C. is currently being built, and we are significantly expanding one of our older DCs. We continue to expand our highly successful mega hub strategy opening five new mega hubs this year, ending the year with 16. and our AutoZone.com online efforts continue to gain significant traction, most importantly our customers are visiting our website at increasingly accelerated rates and using that research to inform their in-store visits. Unfortunately 2017 marked the year we broke out 10-year double-digit quarterly EPS earnings stream. And while that was disappointing, it is equally important to recognize the incredible accomplishment the Street represented. We\u2019ve done deep analyses to understand the key drivers of our profitability change, while some of them were sales related, the larger impact came from increasing costs. We made decisions to increase our investment profile and some of those investments haven\u2019t yet borne fruit, specifically the multiple frequency of deliveries. At the same time, we had a disproportionate amount of changes that were working against us, increased wages and shrink, interest expense and the like. Our focus is to deeply understand the key drivers of our business and manage those factors that we control. Over time macro factors will work for you and against you and fiscal 2017 was one of those times that they worked disproportionately against us. While we will continue to challenge ourselves, our decisions, processes and strategies, we will always invest to reinforce our guiding principles, leveraging our methodologies of evolution, over revolution and superior execution with consistent strategy is a formula for success. After so many years of unprecedented performance, I\u2019m proud of our team for their steadfast commitment to our culture, strategy and approach and from their passion to deliver a materially better 2018. We have an exceptional team that executes extremely well, our focus remains on being successful over the long run that success will be attributable to our approach to leveraging our unique and powerful culture and focusing on the needs of our customers. To execute at level, we have to consistently adhere to living the pledge. We cannot and will not take our eye off execution. We must stay committed to executing day in and day out on our game plan. Success will be achieved with an attention to detail and exceptional execution. Our customers have choices and we must exceed their expectations in whatever way they choose to shop with us. We are fortunate to operate in one of the strongest retail segments and we continue to be excited about our industry\u2019s growth prospects for 2018 and beyond. As consumers continually look to save money while taking care of their cars, we are committed to providing the trustworthy advice that they need and expect. It truly is the value-add that differentiates us from any faceless transaction. Customers have some to expect that advice from us. It is with this focus we will implement more enhancements on both our DIY and commercial websites and in-store experience to provide even more knowledgeable service. We don\u2019t ever expect an online experience to replace the advice our customers want, but today\u2019s customers do expect more information on repairing their vehicles. This aspect of service has always been our most important cultural cornerstone and it will be long into the future. Our charge remains to optimize our performance regardless of market conditions and continue to ensure we are investing in the key initiatives that will drive our long-term performance. In the end, delivering strong EPS growth and ROIC each of every quarter is how we measure ourselves. This formula has been extremely successful over the last 38 years and we continue to be excited about our future. Now I would like to open up the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instruction] Our first question is coming from Seth Sigman of Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Seth Sigman : Good morning. My question is around the commercial strategy, I know you are in the midst of the strategic review right now, but what do you think is the biggest driver of the gap today versus your competitors, is it availability? Is it service? Is it brands? Or is it really just awareness and developing those relationships? And then the second part of the question is, I guess I\u2019m just wondering what are some of the potential outcomes of the review and could it actually mean an acceleration in investments? Thank you. William Rhodes : Yes, thank you Seth for the question. Unfortunately, I think it\u2019s too early, it\u2019s premature for us to get into those specific details. We are looking at all those individual factors that you talked about whether it\u2019s availability and enhancing our service model, how do we work with them digitally and on and on and on, there is a lot of different \u2013 we\u2019re are looking at leaving no stones unturned, but at this point in time, it\u2019s premature for us to really talk about where we see those improvement opportunities. And as Bill Giles mentioned in our remarks, it\u2019s also once we decide what we\u2019re are going to do, we are going to have to go test it and put it in market and see what works and tweak things along that way, so I think it\u2019s going to be a year or so before we really have a solid game plan. We say here\u2019s what we\u2019re going to go do and what the cost of it will be. Will it have an increased investment? Potentially certainly, but I think it\u2019s too, too early for us to even put any kind of guard rails around that. Seth Sigman : And you did see an improvement in the commercial business this quarter relative to past quarters even while reducing your frequency and I think you also mentioned that you think your market share gains are accelerating, so can you just help us better understand what you think is driving that, where that market share maybe coming from and is it retail and commercial, or is it really just commercial? Thanks. William Rhodes : Boy, you have a lot of different things in that question, let me try to jump in. First of all, we grew our commercial business at 5.9% that is clearly substantially over what the market is growing, so that makes us happy. 5.9% also is not at our aspirations for how rapidly we want to grow this business. We have a 3% market share and we would like to grow at significantly more than 5.9%, which is why we are in the midst of this strategic review. You also mentioned something about the fact we grew \u2013 well, this quarter over last quarter, one of the reasons and I mentioned it in the prepared remarks was Q3 had a big dividend for the tax refunds that we thought we would get in Q3 that never materialized, so I think it was more of the anomaly than Q4 at 5.9%. You did mention that you felt like multiple frequency of delivery would be a headwind for us going to commercial business and that was something that a lot of people were concerned about after our last call and I look to addresses that for a second. Multiple frequency of delivery is replenishing the merchandise it in the stores today. One of the reasons why it has not been a successful as we had hoped is because particularly in the commercial business, our commercial drivers, they don\u2019t have that part available in this store, they run to the store closest to them and still service that demand. I don\u2019t think that slowing down our multiple frequency of delivery has been a meaningful headwind to our commercial business growth. Now, that said, we\u2019re still trying to refine it, so that we can find a way for multiple frequency of delivery to be a contributor to both DIY and commercial growth at accelerated rates. Seth Sigman : I think you hit it all, thanks so much. William Rhodes : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Michael Lasser of UBS. Your line is open Michael Lasser : Good morning, thanks a lot for taking my question. Bill you talked about cost going up, the pressure that you are feeling from investments and the focus you still have on generating earnings growth, do you think based on all of those factors that you are going to resume a double-digit EPS growth any time soon, even if your comps recurrent to normal? William Giles : Yes, I think a couple of things there, one of which is that, think about the model being broken down into two ways; one, EBIT growth and then share repurchase. We still have very strong cash flow generation and are able to generate EPS growth through share repurchase. On the other side of the equation, and you are right, we have made some investments and we have some cost headwinds in the immediate term, but on a long-term basis, we\u2019ll anniversary a lot of those which is held in our investments and we\u2019ll get a more normalized growth rate in cost and as we resume to more normalized growth rate in comp store sales, our expectation is is that our EPS growth rate would certainly increase over where it is today. Now whether or not it gets to a double-digit number we\u2019ll wait and see, we won\u2019t going to need support both from the commercial side of the business as well as just a good expense management and I think we can achieve both of those things over time. In the meantime we\u2019re making some nice investments and we\u2019re testing out the markets in order to continue to gain market share on both sides of the business, retail and commercial. So it remains an incredibly healthy industry with an incredibly healthy model and our expectation is it will continue to improve our earnings growth rate. Michael Lasser : Understood, and my follow-up question is, there is not a lack of auto part stores in the U.S. between you and your competitors is, well into the double-digit thousands, you are opening another 150 this year, at point is the market just saturated with too many auto parts stores and you need to consider reducing, substantially reducing your throughput of growth? Thank you. William Giles : Yes, thank you for that. We\u2019re opening new stores in markets that don\u2019t have the same competitive landscape as some of our more core markets. But if you look at many of the core markets, let\u2019s take Atlanta for example, it seems that the big four, AutoZone, O\u2019Reilly, Advance and NAPA, all have a tremendous amount of stores in that marketplace and we all seem to do just fine. Though our return characteristics are we\u2019re not going to open a store unless it does a 15% IRR or a 12% IRR in certain strategic markets and we continue to be able to find those stores, so that the cash flow characteristics of this business are tremendous and we\u2019re still able to open stores that far exceed those hurdle rates. Operator, we can take the next call please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Matthew Fassler of Goldman Sachs. Your like is open. Matthew Fassler : Thanks a lot, good morning guys, how are you? William Rhodes : Good, you Matt? Matthew Fassler : Good. My first question relates SG&A. So, you did have a bigger \u2013 a higher year-on-year growth rate than you\u2019d have over the first nine months of the year by about 250 basis points. At the same time, your growth rate, your SG&A growth rate in the fourth quarter was relatively subdued, so on a two-year basis there wasn\u2019t as much of a delta. As we think about the rate of SG&A growth and I guess, within the two year stacks and the SG&A growth is quite modest, was quite modest in the first nine months of this year, the first two quarters of this year, is the dollar growth rate that we saw in Q4 look like it\u2019s sufficient to do what you need to do for the business given that how low the SG&A growth was, particularly in the middle of the year when your shelves were quite soft? William Giles : Yes, I would say that the Q4 is probably a reasonably good target number for us as you kind of think about it going forward. And so just to jump to chase, occupancy was a little bit higher this quarter, some rent pressure is there on some of the new markets that we\u2019ve gotten into and some of the investments that we\u2019ve made in technology which typically have a shorter depreciation life have driven depreciation cost, but I think that the Q4 is probably a good metric to look out. Matthew Fassler : And then my second question Bill Giles, I assume mostly likely for you. So, it looks like definitely you disclosed on the buyback what we saw on the share count there are two kinds running on, one is that you must have bought back most of your stock quite early in the quarter to get that $622 mark? And secondly, even though the buyback was a bit smaller than we had modeled, the share count was lower presumably despite some of the stock price wasn\u2019t treasuring that, so can you just give us clarity on both of those items for the buyback? William Giles : And one of the thing to think about too, by the relative to buyback overall for the year is that, man, I think we came in around $1.070 billion or so for total share repurchases this year, but keep in mind also we\u2019re kind of measuring or we\u2019re kind of metric-ing back to that 2.5 times credit metrics for EBITDAR and we wind up at 2.57 or so, so we\u2019re a little bit ahead of what our typical target is, which is also to maintain investment grade rating which we believe is the right place for us to be, so there\u2019s no change in the capital allocation strategy. We may have bought back the stock a little bit earlier in the quarter overall, but more importantly from the capital allocation strategy, we\u2019re maintaining that 2.5 times EBITDAR credit metric, maintaining investment grade rating and we\u2019ll continue to deploy capital methods. Matthew Fassler : And did the treasury method kind of knock the share count down a little bit, in terms of options, valuations, and such? Was that part of the calculus for the share count being as subdued as it was? William Giles : Yes, maybe just a little bit relative to the share \u2013 to the option accounting, this is \u2013 definitely has a little bit of an impact on that. Matthew Fassler : Understood. Thank you so much. William Giles : Thanks Matt. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Alan Rifkin of BTIG. Your line is now open. Alan Rifkin : Thank you very much. First question is for Bill Rhodes. Bill you spoke about the expense headwinds and in particular higher wages, do you think that that\u2019s more just a 2017 phenomena or do you believe that that may continue going forward? And if so, would you contemplate maybe raising prices or is there inflation out there solely predicated on commodity prices and not other factors? William Rhodes : Yes, it\u2019s a great question, Alan. First of all, I think, there\u2019s two different elements of it that have happened. First of all, there were a series of retailers that moved wages up in 2015 and 2016, and the effects of those wage increases by large retailers have had a trickle down effect to the rest of the market. That you would think would presumably be getting over in the next year, 18 months, as the market adjust to those rates. The second element of it is the regulatory. And this is the smaller piece today, but it\u2019s going to get bigger and bigger over the next three or four years. There are municipalities like Los Angeles County that went to $12 minimum wage on July 1. The State of California is going to go to $12 minimum wage on January 1, and all these are going to be marching towards $15 an hour average wage, that will cause pressure on wages for an extended period of time. Will that reflect an increased retail prices? Well, at the end of the day, inflation gets into businesses. And this industry has shown over time that as inflation comes in, we are able to pass along many of those costs, if not all of them to the consumer in increased prices. So that\u2019s the way we\u2019re thinking about it today. But it really is unprecedented in my career to see the wages go up to the extent that they have this year. So my sense is, they will continue to be up for a year or so and then it will be muted from where it is today, but still at elevated levels. Alan Rifkin : Thank you. And then just a follow-up if I may. So, obviously, fiscal 2017 was a tough year. If that persists longer than what you anticipate, would you contemplate even slowing down your investment profile, or do you think that it\u2019s prudent in this environment to continue with building the mega hubs and the MSP program? William Rhodes : Yes, I think unrelated to our performance, our investment profile will slow down just a little bit, because we opened a new distribution center in Mexico, a new one in Pasco, Washington and we\u2019re in the process of building one in Ocala, Florida and expanding one in Danville, Illinois. That\u2019s kind of one-time effort. So that much of that CapEx is rolling in over a two to three-year fiscal cycle, and that will go back to normal. Based upon, I love the fact that, 2017 was a really tough year. We grew earnings per share by 6%. Now we would not change our investment profile based upon these kind of results. We believe in the long-term of this business, as I try to articulate earlier, this is not an unusual cycle for our industry to go through. We saw it back in 2013. We saw it in 2004 and 2005. We saw it in 1998 and 1999. So these things happen. And over the long term, this business is really, really strong and we expect it to continue to be so. Alan Rifkin : Thank you, Bill. William Rhodes : Thank you, Alan. I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Simeon Gutman of Morgan Stanley. Your line is still open. Simeon Gutman : Thanks. Good morning. My first question is clarification or a follow-up to some of the questions that have been asked. Maybe for Bill Giles, if for 2018 the comps return back to, let\u2019s say, 2.5% to 3%, just trying to ascertain the expense run rate and maybe margin for next year, will the EBIT growth look more normal on that basis, or there is still some elevated spending in the year? And as part of that question, if comps are 2.5% or so 3%, do \u2013 does that entice you to speed up some investments, such that you don\u2019t see the full flow through anyway? William Giles : I don\u2019t know if it would speed up the investments. Obviously, we\u2019re going to make the investments on the places for which we believe that we\u2019re getting the adequate returns on. And as Bill articulated earlier on MFD as an example, we haven\u2019t seen the full results of that, so we pulled back on that a little bit and you saw that show up on some of the margin. So I think that, if same-store sales were to get to 2.5% or 3%, that obviously would improve our EBIT performance, there\u2019s no question about that and we\u2019ll manage expenses accordingly. And we\u2019ll make sure that we continue to provide great customer service along the way and we\u2019ll make the investments where we believe that we\u2019re getting good adequate returns on them and make adjustments along the way. If we find opportunities where we\u2019re getting real benefits and it makes economic sense for us to accelerate investments, we\u2019ll do that. At the same time, we\u2019ve demonstrated that where it doesn\u2019t make sense, we\u2019ll pull back on those investments. So if we\u2019re getting hypothetical about the next year, but with the model still intact and it remains a relatively healthy industry and we feel good about our position out in 2018. Simeon Gutman : Okay. And then my follow-up for Bill Rhodes guarding the industry\u2019s top line, I don\u2019t know if what is sort of normal for this industry, whether it\u2019s two to three or three to four. So \u2013 but I\u2019m curious if the way you look at the last year is, if we\u2019re sort of on a glide path down to some new normal that maybe less than that three to four, or if the slowdown is cyclical and we should get back to the old normal run rate? William Rhodes : Yes, I mentioned in our prepared remarks that our last five-year average same-store sales have been 1.9%. So, from \u2013 and obviously, same-store sales is different than industry growth rates, because you\u2019ve got new stores that are driving the industry growth rates. That seems to be what we\u2019ve experienced as normal over the last five years. But with \u2013 in that number, we also had accelerated growth from commercial. We were growing during that period of time commercial in the low teens. We don\u2019t believe we\u2019re going to be running the low teens in the foreseeable future. And so, I think, we\u2019ll be challenged even to get back to that 1.9%, but I think, we\u2019ll get close to it. Simeon Gutman : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Bret Jordan of Jefferies. Your line is now open. Bret Jordan : Good morning, guys. William Rhodes : Good morning. William Giles : Good morning. Bret Jordan : A question on the quarter, I mean, I obviously heard a lot of negative feedback in the channel about temperature-related product sales in our air conditioning. Could you give us some color as to maybe what that AC and recharge product line would mean in your fourth quarter, and maybe how negative that category comp was year-over-year? William Rhodes : I don\u2019t want to get into that specific numbers, but that if you put all the AC-related, so radiators, the whole cooling system combined with the air conditioning system, combined of AC, chemicals, it\u2019s a pretty significant part of our business, particularly in the summertime. In the \u2013 it\u2019s in the double digits for sure, and it had a very tough period during this summer. We believe that \u2013 those things happen over time. We had a cooler summer, particularly June was really cool and that will normalize over time and it will come back. But we\u2019ve dealt with more weather impacts really this year and I hate to talk about them. But we can see them categorically in our business so easily. We\u2019ve seen the lack of winter weather coming through the maintenance cycle on brakes and chassis and the like, and then this summer with the cooler winter we saw it in those three businesses. Bret Jordan : Okay, thanks. And then on the online question, you were talking about sequential improvement in the online traffic, at least, with it driving a fair amount of pickup in store volume. Could you give us a feeling for how much pickup in store volume you\u2019re actually seeing there, because obviously you\u2019re not getting booked into the other category? And then within AutoAnything, is that performance improving as well, or is it lagging AutoZone.com? William Rhodes : Yes, I would say, it\u2019s on the pickup in store business. That that remains \u2013 it\u2019s a very small portion of our overall business, as you would imagine. But it is by far the fastest growing channel of distribution that we have and it has accelerated. And so we think we\u2019re doing a great job on that side of it. On the AutoAnything, it\u2019s had a little bit more of a challenging year. We\u2019ve made some management changes there and we are seeing trends improve there. So we see business getting a little bit better at AutoAnything. Bret Jordan : Okay. And you\u2019re not discounting the online transaction with the pickup in store, right, that\u2019s happening at the store price not the ship-to-home discount? William Rhodes : That is correct. Bret Jordan : Okay, thank you. William Rhodes : Thank you. All right. Before we conclude the call, I\u2019d like to take a moment to reiterate that our business model continues to be solid. We\u2019re excited about our growth prospects for the year. We will not take anything for granted as we understand our customers have alternatives. We have a solid plan to succeed this fiscal year, but I want to stress that this is a marathon and not a sprint. As we continue to focus on the basics and focus on optimizing long-term shareholder value, we are confident Autozone will continue to be very successful. We thank you for participating in today\u2019s call. Operator : And that concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

With me today are Bill Giles, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax. Regarding the first quarter, I hope you have had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not, the press release along with slides complementing our comments today, are available on our website, www.autozoneinc.com. Please click on Quarterly Earnings Conference Calls to see them. To begin this morning, I want to thank all AutoZoners across the company for their tremendous efforts this past quarter. The quarter started out with Hurricane Harvey and finished up with five more natural disasters across North America causing our AutoZoners and customers living in those regions tremendous disruptions in their lives. From hurricanes to earthquakes in Mexico, the wildfires out west, we incurred costs and property damage in each one. While we were able to get back on our feet quickly with Hurricane Harvey and Irma incurring minimal damage to our stores, Hurricane Maria hit our stores and customers hard in Puerto Rico. We have 43 stores in Puerto Rico and unfortunately we still have several that are unable to open due to damage incurred. Our thoughts and prayers continue to go out all the folks on the island for the horrible effects this storm has had on their lives. Our AutoZoners throughout the organization have responded incredibly well and swiftly so that we have been able to get the vast majority of our stores opened very quickly following these disasters. So our AutoZoners could service our customers when they needed us most. Our support for our AutoZoners and customers in Puerto Rico continues so we can aid them in their rebuilding efforts. Now for the business results. Our business strengthened during the quarter with improved same store sales results including an acceleration in our domestic commercial sales. As mentioned in our press release, the natural disasters impact both our sales and earnings for the quarter. Following the storms, our sales benefited by an estimated 50 to 60 basis points while we experienced costs and damages of $9 million resulting in a net negative estimated impact to EPS of $0.07. We were encouraged that our sales gained momentum from Q4 excluding the estimated disaster benefit and our sales strengthened in the later stages of the quarter. We continued executing our inventory availability initiatives during the quarter and we are pleased with our results. All with a focus on improving our ability to say yes to our customers' parts needs, we opened two additional mega hubs and further refined and tested the delivery frequency to our stores to determine the optimal service levels. Our supply chain team implemented various tactics to optimize activity and reduce costs and were able to deliver leverage in our warehouse delivery cost this past quarter. This marks the first quarter in many where cost increases have abated and we feel very good about the direction costs are headed over the remaining three quarters of fiscal 2018 in our supply chain. And with our new Pasco, Washington DC open, combined with our new Ocala, Florida DC and our expansion of our Dell Danville, Illinois DC coming online soon, we feel we are positioning our supply chain to improve efficiencies, enhance capacity and improve service. We are on the right path and on our plan with these initiatives. Additionally, we saw a nice improvement in our commercial business sales results in Q1. Total commercial sales increased 6.7% compared to 5.9% in Q4 and 5.7% for all of last year. We continue to grow our business faster than the overall industry by executing on our game plan. We continue to focus on growing business with existing customers. With fewer year-over-year program openings, more of our sales growth is coming from existing customers or new customers in older programs. We believe our inventory availability work is vital to these efforts and is enhancing our position in commercial and we will continue to improve. Before getting into more detail about the quarter, I want to share our perspective on the trajectory of our industry sales. In recent years, there have been macro headwinds, specifically two consecutive mild winters negatively impacting demand in the upper Midwest, Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern markets, along with delayed tax refunds last year that did not translate to an increase in business during that time period in a manner that was similar to previous year's. In addition, there has been a lot of discussion concerned around the effects of online sales negatively impacting the industry. While automotive parts and products have been sold online for more than a decade, we simply haven't seen a material shift in our business, past or present. Weather effects will even out over time but remains a negative as the effect of the mild winters has reduced demand for failure and maintenance related parts. This past quarter, we continued to see the impact as the Midwestern, Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern stores underperformed the remaining country by over 200 basis point in comps. Although these markets have underperformed for the last couple of years, we have begun to see improving trends in the Northeastern market, which encourages us heading into the new calendar year. As history has shown, when extreme cold and significant snowfall returns, those markets traditionally have seen a significant resurgence in sales. These markets are very good markets for us. They are just much more volatile. They underperform in mild weather years and excel in extreme weather years. If we experienced more normal weather in these parts of the country in 2018, we would expect stronger sales performance. Turning to our online efforts. We continue to invest in our strategy to enhance the customer shopping experience in an omnichannel world. We continue to see growth in our website traffic, particularly in mobile, ship-to-home sales and buy-online-pickup-in-store. But buy-online-pickup-in-store is growing much, much faster than ship-to-home as our customers value the convenience of immediate availability and trustworthy advice our AutoZoners provide them. This also further highlights the importance of inventory availability at the store level. We are also working to enhance our digital capabilities with our commercial customers and they continue to increase their interactions with us over autozonepro.com. We will continue to invest in our omnichannel strategy to ensure we can interact with our customers in the manner that best fits their needs and desires. On the cost front, I have highlighted on the last two quarters' conference calls the impacts we are experiencing from accelerated pressure on wages. Those pressures continue to exist and are more than our historical norms. The regulatory changes are going to continue as evidenced by the areas that have passed legislation to increase their wages substantially over the next few years. We are constantly working diligently to find new innovations to better manage our cost structure and those efforts will continue but we believe this particular area will have continued pressure in the current state regulatory and low unemployment environments. Our management team remains committed to managing this business for the long term to provide great service for our customers and great opportunities for our AutoZoners ultimately delivering strong shareholder value. We operate in an industry driven by inelastic demand. If the part breaks, our customers need to fix it to get to work and get on with their lives. Because of this predictability based on miles driven and an aging car population, we remain committed to continually improving our ability to aid customers in saying yes to their needs. Now let me provide more detail on the quarter. For the quarter, our sales increased 4.9% and our domestic same-store sales were up 2.3%. All three months of the quarter, September, October and November were positive with November being stronger on both a one and two year stacked basis. As I have previously said, our Northeastern, Midwestern and Mid-Atlantic markets representing roughly 25% of our state sales continue to underperform by approximately 200 basis points as a result of two consecutive mild winters. During the quarter we opened 15 net new stores in the U.S. and our commercial business expanded by 6.7% while opening 30 programs. Our commercial growth accelerated from last quarter's 5.9% increase as we continue to execute on our strategies to grow sales. We expect to open approximately 150 net new commercial programs this fiscal year. Currently 84% of our domestic stores have a commercial program. During the quarter, we continued to expand in Mexico opening five new stores and we did not open any new stores in Brazil or additional IMC branches consistent with our plans. Now I would like to provide an update on our learnings around our multiple frequency of delivery model. As a reminder, multiple frequency of delivery is solely focused on improving the in-stock levels for SKUs that are stocked in those stores, wile the mega hubs are focused on adding additional coverage to the local markets, meaning adding SKUs that would not have been available locally in our network before. We made some fairly significant changes to the number of stores on our multiple frequency of delivery test. We changed this frequency from three times a week to two times a week in a small set of stores and we improved our replenishment algorithms in Q4 of last year. We have seen improve sales results in the three time per week stores as a result of the replenishment changes that have encouraged us while the two time per week stores have underperformed. We are not yet prepared to conclude these tests and as we enter our most volatile selling season, Q2, it will likely be spring before we can make definitive conclusions. While we continue to learn from our frequency of delivery test, we remain committed to the rollout of our mega hub strategy. As a reminder, these supersized AutoZone stores carry 80,000 to 100,000 unique SKUs, approximately twice what a hub store carries today. They provide coverage to both surrounding stores and other hub stores multiple times a day or on an overnight basis. Our sales results thus far in our open mega hubs continue to exceed our expectations, both for retail and commercial. Currently, we have over 4,000 stores with access to mega hub inventory. A majority or about two-thirds of these 4,000 stores receive their service on an overnight basis today but as we expand our mega hubs more of them will receive this service the same day and many will receive it multiple times per day. We continue to expect to ultimately operate up to 40 mega hubs. The constraint on the speed with which we can open these is availability and location of real estate. While an average AutoZone location is just under 7,000 square feet, a mega hub is 30,000 square feet or more. Identifying and developing these locations in prime retail areas is challenging and it takes time. While there are incremental cost to these rollouts, we continue to feel these investments will provide a better customer experience and increased market share. Along with improving our local parts availability and assortment, we continue to manage this organization to provide exceptional service for our customers, provide our AutoZoners with a great place to work with opportunities for advancement and ensure we do it on a long term profitable basis and provide strong returns for our shareholders. We will continue to stress the importance of going the extra mile to fulfill our customer's needs regardless of how difficult the request. With our commitment to service intact, we continue to be share gainers over quarter. From the data we have available to us and in fact our share has continued to improve over the last several months. Regarding Mexico, we opened five new stores this quarter and ended the quarter with 529 stores. Mexico now represents just under 9% of our store base. Sales in our other businesses for the quarter were up 0.9% over last year's first quarter, showing continued improvement each of the last quarter. As a reminder, our ALLDATA and e-commerce businesses which include autozone.com and AutoAnything, make up this segment of sales. This compares to being down 0.8% last quarter and reflects stronger performance in AutoAnything's business for Q1. Also, as I previously mentioned, we continue to see strong growth in our buy-online-pickup-in-store sales. This strength in pickup-in-store encourages us to continue investing in our in-store experience. We recognize that the majority of our site traffic is providing information for our customers prior to purchase. And our e-commerce platform represents an important part of our omnichannel experience. We see customers doing lots of research to learn about the product and how to do repairs. While these businesses are small for us at less than 5% of our total sales, omnichannel experience is very important to the customer experience and we will continue to invest in our e-commerce platform. With the continued aging of the car population, we continue to be optimistic regarding trends for our industry in both DIY and DIFM. As new vehicle sales are near all-time highs and gas prices on average are quite low, miles driven continue to increase. The lower-end consumer benefits the most from lower gas prices relative to income. This trend remains encouraging. Regarding our expectations for the winter of 2018, if we return to more normal weather patterns, we expect sales performance to improve as the year moves forward. Now let me review our highlights regarding the execution of our ongoing operating theme from 2017 that we carried over into 2018, Yes! We have Got It. The key priorities for the year are great people providing great service, profitably growing our commercial business, leveraging the Internet, Yes! We have Got It and leveraging IT. On the retail front, this past quarter under the great people providing great service theme, we were committed to supporting our store AutoZoners helping get both the stores themselves and their customers up and running post the disasters. And this was no easy task. We are focused on enhanced training to store level AutoZoners and increasing the share of voice regarding availability with the Yes! We have Got It theme. We hosted our national sales meeting at the end of September and our communications were around training our AutoZoners to enhance the customer experience. We also remain aggressive with our technology investments and believe these investments will help differentiate us on a go-forward basis. We realize, as customers have become much more tech and mobile savvy, we have to have a sales proposition that touches all the ways they desire to interact with us. Our future and current technology investments will lead to sales growth across all of our businesses. Regarding commercial, we opened 30 net new programs during the quarter. Our expectation is we will continue to open new programs in the range of 150 in 2018. As we continue to improve our product assortments and availability and as we make other refinements to our commercial offerings, we expect the estimated sales potential to grow. We should also highlight another strong performance in return on invested capital as we were able to finish the quarter at 29.6%. We continue to be pleased with this metric as it is one of the best in all of hardlines retailing. However, our primary focus has been and continues to be that we ensure every incremental dollar of capital that we deploy in this business provides an acceptable return well in excess of our cost of capital. It is important to reinforce that we always maintain our diligence regarding capital stewardship as the capital we invest is our investors' capital. Before I pass the discussion over to Bill Giles to talk about our financial results, I would like to thank and reinforce how appreciative we are of our entire team's efforts to continue to meet and exceed our customers' wants, needs and desires. We are bullish on 2018 sales potential because we have a great business operated by exceptional AutoZoners. Now I will turn the call over to Bill Giles. Bill? Bill Giles : Thanks Bill and good morning everyone. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to talk more specifically about our retail, commercial and international results. For the quarter, total auto parts sales, which includes our domestic, retail and commercial businesses, our Mexico and Brazil stores and our 26 IMC branches, increased 5%. For the trailing 52 weeks ended, total sales per domestic AutoZone store were $1,770,000. Total commercial sales increased 6.7%. In the quarter, commercial represented 19% of our total sales and grew $31 million over last year's Q1. We opened 30 net new programs versus 35 programs opened in our first quarter last year. And we now have our commercial program in 4,622 stores or 84% of our domestic stores supported by 188 hub stores. Over 700 of our programs are three years old or younger. In 2018, we expect to open approximately 150 new programs. As Bill mentioned earlier, we remain focused on growing this business as we see this business as our most significant growth opportunity and we are treating it accordingly. We are committed to having a great sales team, supplemented with stronger engagement of our store managers and district managers. We remain confident we will continue to gain market share with our commercial customers. We are encouraged by the initiatives we have in place and feel we can further grow sales and market share While we have completed the majority of our commercial project and we have some new thoughts and concepts, they are just that, ideas. We will now move to implement and test these on a small-scale in order to refine and enhance them. For competitive reasons, we won't be sharing our detailed findings at this stage. Once we have proven concepts with concrete plans, we will share our plans but that will take some time. While we are working on these new ideas, we are continuing with our existing strategies to grow commercial sales and profits. Our Mexico stores continued to perform well. We opened five new stores during the first quarter ending the quarter with 529 stores. We expect to open approximately 40 new stores in fiscal 2018. Mexico's business was challenged throughout 2016 and 2017 by a weakening peso foreign exchange rate relative to the U.S. dollar. Our hope is 2018's exchange rate will settle down and will potentially be favorable. We have been quite pleased to the way our Mexico leadership team has managed this business through all of this volatility. Regarding Brazil, we continue to operate 14 stores. Our plans are to grow to approximately 25 total stores by the end of the fiscal year. Our performance continues to improve and gives us optimism about the long-term future of this market. If we can prove success, this market has the potential to be much larger than Mexico. So while challenging, the size of the prize is significant. Gross margin for the quarter was 52.8% of sales and was effectively flat for the quarter with higher merchandise margins being offset by higher inventory shrink results. While our shrink expense is higher in support of inventory availability initiatives, we were pleased with supply chain's ability to leverage cost on a percent of sales basis. We believe initiatives we have in place to manage shrink can reduce the deleverage over the remainder of the year. Our primary focus remains growing absolute gross profit dollars in our total auto parts segment. SG&A for the quarter was 34.6% of sales, higher by 50 basis points from last year's first quarter. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales were higher than last year, primarily due to storm-related expenses incurred during the quarter and deleverage on occupancy cost. EBIT for the quarter was $469 million, up 2.1% over last year's first quarter. Our EBIT margin was 18.1%. Interest expense for the quarter was $39 million compared with $33 million in Q1 a year ago. We are planning interest at $39.4 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 versus $34.2 million last year Q2. The higher expense is due to tenor and size of a bond completed this April of $600 million with a 3.75% coupon. Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $4,983 million or approximately $14 million below last year's balance of $4,997 million. Our adjusted debt level metric finished the quarter at 2.5 times EBITDAR. While in any given quarter, we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on management's opinion regarding debt and equity market conditions, we remain committed to both our investment-grade rating and our capital allocation strategy and share repurchases are an important element of that strategy. For the quarter, our tax rate was 34.6%, down slightly from last year's Q1 of 34.7%. I want to take a moment and remind listeners of our adoption of a new accounting standard. The new standard requires us to recognize the tax benefit received from the gains employees have on stock options as a credit to income tax expense on the P&L. This past quarter it lowered our tax rate 52 basis points. This compares to the benefit we had of 74 basis points to the tax rate in last year's Q1. This accounting change also increases the diluted share count calculation. While the impact on this adoption was minimal to the tax rate at 52 basis points this quarter, it is worth highlighting that it had a 358 basis point impact on our rate in Q2 of last year. Because it is impossible for us to predict when individuals will exercise options, we encourage folks to model us on a rate assuming those stock option impact roughly 35.5% and we will report both rates. Net income for the quarter was $281 million, up 1% over last year. Our diluted share count of 28.1 million was down 5.4% from last year's first quarter. The combination of these factors drove earnings per share for the quarter to $10, up 6.8% over the prior year's first quarter. Excluding the impact of the previously mentioned change in accounting for stock option exercises from both this year's Q1 and last year's Q1, our EPS would have increased at the same rate 6.8% for the quarter. Relating to the cash flow statement, for the first quarter we generated $565 million of operating cash flow. Net fixed assets were up 8.2% versus last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $110 million and reflected the additional expenditures required to open 22 new locations this quarter, capital expenditures on existing stores, hub and mega hub store remodels or openings, work on development of new stores for our upcoming quarter's investments in our new system domestic DCs and information technology investments. With the new stores open, we finished this past quarter with 5,480 stores in 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, 529 stores in Mexico and 14 in Brazil for a total AutoZone store count of 6,023. We also had 26 IMC branches open at the end of Q1, taking our total locations to 6,049. Depreciation totaled $78 million for the quarter versus last year's first quarter expense of $71.8 million. This is generally in line with recent quarter growth rates. We repurchased $353 million of AutoZone stock in the first quarter. And at quarter end we had $471 million remaining under our share buyback authorization and our leverage metric was 2.5 times at quarter-end. Again, I want to stress, we manage to appropriate credit ratings and not any one metric. The metric we report is meant as a guide only as each rating firm has its own criteria. We continue to view our share repurchase program as an attractive capital deployment strategy. Next, I would like to update you on our inventory levels in total and on a per store basis. The company's inventory increased 6.3% over the same period last year. Inventory per location was $663,000 versus $647,000 last year and $644,000 last quarter. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable, on a per location basis was a negative $52,000 versus a negative $67,000 last year and a negative $48,000 last quarter. As a result, accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 107.8%. Finally, as Bill previously mentioned, our continued disciplined capital management approach resulted in return on invested capital for the trailing four quarters of 29.6%. We have and will continue to make investments that we believe will generate returns that significantly exceed our cost of capital. Now I will turn it back to Bill Rhodes. Bill Rhodes : Thank you Bill. While we are encouraged with the start of our fiscal year, we are careful to not over-commit to any outcomes when it comes to our second fiscal quarter. The second quarter has perpetually been our most volatile quarter due to weather patterns, the holidays and timing of tax refunds. Last year, we were impacted negatively by the delay in income tax refund and the impact of a second consecutive mild winter. We did not foresee the impacts on sales these events would have on our business for the second and third quarters last year. While we are pleased with our progress and the acceleration in our business, we want to highlight some of the potential points of volatility, both positive and negative, in the upcoming quarter. One, if we experience a cold and high precipitation winter, our sales should be strong later in the quarter and into the balance of the year. Two, tax refund timing should be the same as last year. So it shouldn't have any bearing on our second quarter's results. As for Q3, we don't know if those sales will return. Three, as the holidays shift, we will loose two selling days in our DIFM business, which will negatively impact our sales growth in DIFM. It's important to note that this has an insignificant impact on our DIY business. Fourth and we encourage you to be mindful of the significant EPS benefit due to stock option exercises in the second quarter of last year and adjust for this non-operating unpredictable event. We are excited about our balanced model for growth around domestic, retail, commercial, international, online and pickup in store. We believe our hubs and mega hubs, Mexico, ALLDATA, e-commerce and our other businesses can all grow their toplines in 2018. To execute at a high level, we have to consistently adhere to living the pledge. We cannot and we will not take our eye off of execution. We must stay committed to executing day in and day out on our game plan. Success will be achieved with an attention to detail and exceptional execution. Our customers have choices and we must exceed their expectations in whatever way they choose to shop with us. We are fortunate to operate in one of the strongest retail segments. And we continue to be excited about our industry's growth prospects for 2018 and beyond. As consumers continually look to save money while taking care of their vehicles, we are committed to providing the trustworthy advice they expect. It truly is the value-add that differentiates us from other faceless transactions. Customers have come to expect that advice from us. It is with this focus we will implement more enhancements on both our DIY and commercial websites and in-store experiences to provide even more knowledgeable service. We don't ever expect an online experience to replace the advice our customers want. But today's customers do expect more information on repairing their vehicles. This aspect of service has been our most important cultural cornerstone and it will continue to be for a long time. Our charge remains to optimize our performance regardless of market conditions and continue to ensure we are investing in the key initiatives that will drive our long-term performance. In the end, delivering strong EPS growth and ROIC each and every quarter is how we measure ourselves. This formula has been extremely successful over the last 38 years and we continue to be excited about our future. Now I would like to open up the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is coming from Alan Rifkin of BTIG. Your line is now open. Alan Rifkin : Thank you. Congratulations on a nice quarter. Bill Rhodes, certainly you expressed your enthusiasm about the mega hub strategy. What's the revenue lift to your store base once they move to being supported by a mega hub? And then related to that, what is the average revenue per store on for these stores versus stores that are still not supported by mega hubs? Thank you very much. Bill Rhodes : Yes. Thank you for the comment, Alan. I would say that the mega hub service in and of itself can drive between 1% and 2% growth in the local store. As far as the volumes go, the volumes are all over the spectrum, because we are trying anybody that's within a reasonable service area, we are providing service to them from mega hub. So they may be on the low end of the scale or they may be on the high end of scale. But generally they will grow between 1% and 2%. Some of the factors within that depend on whether or not they are serviced multiple times a day or once a day or serviced on an overnight basis. A big part of our strategy now as we mentioned, about 4,000 of our domestic stores already have mega hub service. But many of those today are only getting it on an overnight basis. As we continue to expand our mega hubs, which by the way we couldn't be more pleased with, as we continue to expand it will have more and more that will get same-day service versus overnight service and some of those will even get multiple times per day service from that mega hub. So it's all part of our objective to enhance inventory availability across the local marketplace. Alan Rifkin : Okay. Understood. And a follow-up if I may, Bill. With respect to your vendor base, what, if anything, are you now seeing in terms of more vendors possibly taking Dorman's lead and implementing MAP pricing in terms of e-commerce? And what has its effectiveness been thus far? Bill Rhodes : Number one, we have had many vendors that have had MAP pricing or some form of MAP pricing for years, if not decades. Dorman recently, I believe they went in October, so I think it's a little bit too early to tell what happens. They are making those decisions on their own. We certainly support our vendors in a way of making sure that there is price transparency and we are all providing great values to our customers over time. But that's their decisions, not ours. Alan Rifkin : Thank you. Best of luck for your happy holiday season. Bill Rhodes : You too, Alan. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is coming from Christopher Horvers of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Christopher Horvers : Thanks. Good morning. So I wanted to follow-up on the mega hub commentary. What's the gating factors on service in the store, same day and multiple times per day? Is it cost? Is it systems? Is it that you just don't have the right facilities? Can you talk about that? And maybe sort of quantify as you move from an overnight to a same day and multiple times per day, how does the business respond? Bill Rhodes : Sure. Thanks for the opportunity to clarify that, Chris. It's an excellent point. So one of our mega hubs, for instance, is in Los Angeles. Today that store may be providing service to San Diego but it's doing it on an overnight basis. As we potentially build a mega hub in a San Diego type market, then all of a sudden those stores can move from overnight service to same-day service. It's simply the proximity of this location of the store to the mega hub. It's got to be, if they are within 100 miles, we might be able to service them three times a day. If they are 200 miles, we might be able to get there one time a day. If they are 400 miles, we got to get there overnight. Christopher Horvers : I understand. And so I think long-term you have talked about perhaps 40 to 50 mega hubs and, I think, you are around 18 right now. So how does that two-thirds of the stores being fulfilled -- sorry,. maybe one-third filled in the same day, how does that progress over time? And if you get to 45 to 50, what's the service look like to the stores on a same-day basis? Bill Rhodes : Yes. We haven't laid it out because part of it is, we are looking and learning about the economics of this as we go. As you mentioned, we have 18 today. We said in our prepared remarks, we are going to 25 this year, hopefully if we can get them all open. That's our plan. But when we originally rolled it out, we said 25 to 40 and we have made a small tweak in what we were saying, we don't talk about 25 anymore because we are going to be there by the end of the year. We say up to 40 and the more we learn about it someday that number could go up as well. It's been on of those initiatives that continues to outperform our expectations. And as it outperforms our expectation, it allows us to expand it further. But I also think it's important to understand we are also not competing in a stagnant environment. Our competitors are also, be them the public companies that you are accustomed to or the warehouse distributors, everybody's changing their operations and we are looking at ways to enhance our competitive position. Christopher Horvers : And then the last question I have, is there anything as you look at the tax bills that are in front of the House and the Senate, is there anything in there that could be either positive for you, I understand the corporate tax expense, the potential corporate tax benefit, but is there anything in those bill that concerns you from a financial or business operation perspective? Thanks very much. Bill Giles : Sure. Yes. I don't think there is anything in the tax bills that we are aware of today that would concern us per se. Obviously as you mentioned, the tax rates being lower on a corporate basis for most retailers will be very beneficial. And so we expect it to be a positive. We will wait and see what ultimately comes out of committee and what gets signed including the timing of the implementation and plan accordingly. But certainly from a capital allocation strategy, we expect our strategy to continue to remain intact and feel really good about it. Christopher Horvers : Thank you. Have a great holiday. Bill Rhodes : You too. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is coming from Matt Fassler of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Matt Fassler : Thanks so much and good morning. My first question relates to the sales outlook. I think on last quarter's call, you as a company offered a somewhat subdued perspective on the sales potential for the business. I am understanding that you have got a bit of a bump from the hurricane, the sales accelerated nicely. They recently exceeded Wall Street expectations and you are talking about the potential for the business to pickup, I am not sure if it's off current levels or from prior assumptions, if the weather turns seasonable in the fourth quarter rather in the calendar fourth quarter and into winter. Anything change in the backdrop or anywhere else to alter your read on your prognosis of the forward here? Or is it just that the business did pickup and showed its potential? Is there something else happening in the world that drove your incremental enthusiasm here? Bill Rhodes : Thanks Marr for that question. I think it's a great question. If you will recall on the last quarter, I talked about the fact that the perception of our industry's performance over the last two or three quarters was that we had reached a new all-time low in performance. And I was very careful to talk about that. But that truly wasn't the case. So if you looked at our industry's performance or AutoZone's performance over a five or 10 year period of time, that our performance last year was operating within the normal bands of what we have experienced. They were towards the lower end but it was not -- we weren't dealing with catastrophic performance. I cautioned everybody because with that notion of, oh, things are so bad, then all of a sudden they are going to, the pendulum is going to swing and they are going to be fantastic. We went and said, no. We believe they will get better and operate in this normal band. I think I talked about, we were like 140 basis points below our average for the last five years. And so we would translate, yes, we think that they will improve particularly when some of these factors, these macro factors that we can't do anything about, like two mild winters and the late tax refunds, once those normalize we should we believed and continue to believe we would go back to that normal band. Now in Q1, we outperformed our expectations. But part of that outperformance was the 50 or 60 basis points from the hurricane impacted markets. But we are pleased with the performance that we have seen in our store's sales, both on the retail and particularly on the commercial side in Q1. But I was also very intentional about making comments about Q2 only because Q2 is incredibly volatile. If the weather hits and hits at right time, our sales could be really strong. If we have a third consecutive mild winter, it will take some momentum out of it. We just have to be careful and part of what I am trying to say is, let's understand that Q2 the very low volume quarter. We are closed a few days during the quarter. It's our lowest one quarter of the year and I, for one, don't want to put too much focus on Q2. If we get a strong winter, we believe Q2 and the latter part of Q2 will be strong and more importantly we believe the balance of the year will be more positive. But we also continue to believe that we will operate in a normalized band that we have been in for five or 10 years. Matt Fassler : No, that's very helpful. Quick follow-ups to that. On the storm sales, was that kind of a one-time pop? Or is there any spillover into subsequent quarters in your view? Bill Rhodes : I think there will be a little bit of spillover into Q2 from it, Matt. What generally happens, when the storm hits, we are closed for days. And so we actually take a net negative for the first week or so. And then as the markets began to recover, we see increased economic activity and it lasts for three or four months. It depends on the order of magnitude of the store, but we would expect to see some benefit, probably not a benefit that we would be calling out on the next quarter, but some benefit early in the second quarter. Matt Fassler : Great. And then finally, while you are clearly testing and probing a lot with supply chain absent from the dialogue this quarter was the impact to gross margin of excess supply chain costs. So should we consider that chapter essentially closed and no longer look for much gross margin impact from that? Bill Giles : Yes. I wouldn't categorize it as closed, per se, Matt. But you are totally right. We have anniversaried a lot of the impact that we have had and so we expect to see more normalized going forward. And I think the supply chain team has done a terrific job of managing it in spite of opening two distribution centers over the last six months. Matt Fassler : Thank you very much guys. Bill Rhodes : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is coming from Simeon Gutman of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Joshua Siber : Good morning. It's Joshua Siber, on for Simeon. Can you talk about what's driving the commercial improvement? Whether you can parse it out between industry growth versus internal drivers? Bill Rhodes : Yes. I think I haven't seen enough and it is very hard to see the industry growth perspective on commercial on a short term period. Over the long term, we believe we have a pretty good handle and it's growing around 4.5%. In short terms, it's hard to see that. I think what is improving in our performance is our team's core blocking and tackling is getting better. We have been talking a lot about getting the store managers and the district managers more engaged in the business. And I think that that's helping over time. Our sales teams continue to get better and better. And inventory availability were the biggest reason we are doing the mega hubs and the MFD to try to spur on commercial growth. And I think those efforts are beginning to help us in commercial. I think it's also important to highlight, we grew almost 7%. So we are close to 2X the growth of the market. Joshua Siber : Okay. And my follow-up, you mentioned if we return to more normal weather. So I am curious how you would characterize the winter so far? Bill Rhodes : Well, I don't think you need to even try to characterize it. We are not running this business for a couple. We are 2.5 weeks into our quarter and who knows what's going to happen. So it will start getting cold this week. It's not about what happens between Thanksgiving and December 15, it's really what happens from December 15 to February 10. That will really be the deciding factor. Joshua Siber : Okay. Thanks a lot. Bill Rhodes : Yes. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is coming from Seth Sigman of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Seth Sigman : Thanks a lot and good morning. One question just on the cost side. So your expenses grew roughly 5.5%, excluding the hurricane. I know you talked about a number of future headwinds and you talked about that last quarter as well. I am just wondering, is this the run rate to think about? Does this 5.5% essentially capture those headwinds? Or is there a reason to believe there would be a further step up at some point? Bill Giles : No. We think that that 5% range captures those headwinds. And those headwinds are, as Bill talked about before, you have got a little bit of wage rate pressure that continues to exist although the team has done a terrific job of managing our way through that and we have a little bit of occupancy pressure as you are seeing that coming from mega hubs and hubs as well as we are seeing rising real estate tax costs across the country as well. So those are some of the things that are little bit of headwinds. We think we can manage our way through those. But I think that that's a pretty good run rate to look at. Seth Sigman : And do you start to lapse some of that in the second half of this fiscal year? You did see a pickup in expenses late in your last year. Bill Giles : I think late in the year, we will start to lapse some of that. Seth Sigman : Okay. Great. And then my follow-up is just around pricing. I am wondering, are you starting to see any signs of inflation? Did that impact the quarter at all? And just in general, a lot of talk about price transparency in the category and in retail in general. Do you feel like if you see inflation you will be able to push that through? Bill Rhodes : We have historically. To answer the first part of the question, we haven't seen a significant amount of inflation and frankly we haven't for probably a couple of years now. And so historically, we have had been able, as an industry, to push much of that cost along to the consumer. So today we don't see that changing necessarily but we will have to wait and see when it comes. Seth Sigman : Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is coming from Michael Lasser of UBS. Your line is now open. Michael Lasser : Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Bill Rhodes, you mentioned that Midwest and the Northeast continue to underperform. Yet the business accelerated in large part because of the commercial program. Should we take that to mean that your commercial business within those underperforming regions also underperformed? And why would that be the case? Bill Rhodes : So I think, number one, both parts of our business saw acceleration during Q1. Commercial is a little bit more visible to you because we call it out specifically. But both of them improved in Q1. As we look at what's going on with the industry, part of what's happened is those mild winters have put less strain on the under car components. So think about chassis and brake components and shocks and struts. That didn't go away when the summer went. That lack of wear and tear has continued and those jobs are done, by both DIYers and DIFMers. So that's why it impacts both markets in a similar fashion. Michael Lasser : My follow-up question is on the potential for a sharp reduction in your tax rate. If that happens, how would you think about the prospect of returning the benefits back to shareholders versus redeploying the savings back into the business? Bill Giles : Yes. I think that we kind of think about it as we feel good about our capital allocation strategy. That remains intact. It served as well over time. We will continue to invest in those initiatives that we believe will result in adequate returns to the corporation overall. We will continue to invest in our infrastructure and we will continue to execute our capital allocation strategy. Time will tell. I mean the bill hasn't yet. So we will have to wait and see what's in the final bill and the timing of it. Michael Lasser : I guess that was less referring to capital allocation and more so the margin structure of the business. If your earnings growth is going to sharply accelerate, would you look to the maybe slowdown that earnings growth acceleration? Bill Giles : Well, of course, the earnings growth will be below of EBIT. So the question really is, you are asking what's going to happen below the EBIT line. And obviously that's going to increase. But we don't see, from a tax perspective, something changing fundamental to the operating margin of the organization. Michael Lasser : Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is coming from Matt McClintock of Barclays. Your line is now open. Matt McClintock : Yes. Good morning everyone. Bill Rhodes : Good morning. Matt McClintock : Bill, I am just trying to conceptualize the volatility in the business due to weather. As we think about the potential for weather to finally cooperate this quarter and maybe going forward, is that something that would potentially drive a closing of the 200 basis point gap in those regions that you are experiencing this year? Or is that something that could actually drive a closing of the multiple years of gap that you have in those regions relative to the company average? Bill Rhodes : Yes. I think there is no question about it. And as I mentioned, those are really good markets for us and historically really good markets. But because the weather patterns can be so extremely different, they are more volatile. It's not as predictable as California, for instance, where the weather patterns are pretty predictable what you are going to get. You don't know what you are going to get in the Upper Midwest and therefore we just have to deal with it. There is nothing that we can do to plan our business any differently or anything like that. We just have to ride the storm, on both the good side and the bad side. Matt McClintock : Okay. And then I think you were pretty clear about online competition and there's nothing really to see there. But could you maybe talk about nontraditional competition in the brick-and-mortar channel, big-box competition or other non-specialty auto parts stores? Bill Rhodes : Yes. I guess I would say, it's very similar to what we said about online, the mass merchants, they have been competing in our industry for longer than I have been here. And so I haven't seen any significant change in how they are going to market or impacting our business one way or the other. Matt McClintock : Thank you very much for the color. Bill Rhodes : Yes. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is coming from Dan Wewer of Raymond James. Your line is now open. Dan Wewer : Yes. Thanks. Bill, since 2009 AutoZone's gross margin rate has increased about 260 basis points. Do you think there is a gross margin expansion thesis going forward? Or do you think that current gross margin rates, maybe give or take 10 basis points, is what the next, say, three or four years with look like? Bill Giles : Yes. I think as we think about it, Dan, we think of it more positively than that. And so we continue to believe that there are opportunities for us to expand gross margin. Certainly, as we continue to increase some of our direct import initiatives, that will help reduce some of our acquisition costs. And so we continue to believe that there are opportunities to lower acquisition cost. There will probably continue to be opportunities to optimize the expenses, both in supply chain and in shrink. But we will always continue to have some pressures from a competitive set and an industry set relative to promotions, et cetera. So I think overall we are somewhat bullish relative to gross margin going forward. And if you look over time, you are right, we have done a terrific job in spite of a lot of things going on of continuing to increase our gross margin. So it remains healthy and we feel positive about it going forward. Dan Wewer : And then just a follow-up question on the sales benefits from the mega hubs. I think in response to Alan's question, you talked about a one or two percentage point benefit. Is there a difference if the store is getting same day coverage from a mega hub compared to the next day example that you talked about with San Diego? Bill Rhodes : Yes. There certainly is a difference, Dan. It's probably not as big as you would expect, because you have got to remember, these SKUs that we are talking about are really on the tails of the bell curve and so having them available even for next day, they will be there first thing in the morning and when you talk about some rural markets or those kind of things, that's pretty amazing that we can get them there. So there is a difference, but it's not 50% or so. Dan Wewer : Okay. Great. Thank you. Bill Rhodes : Yes. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our last question is coming from Steve Forbes of Guggenheim. Your line is now open. Steve Forbes, your line is now open. Bill Rhodes : Let's go and take the next question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Mike Baker of Deutsche Bank. Mike Baker : Worked out well for me. I wanted to follow-up on Mr. Wewer's question and Bill Giles, your answer about gross margins continue to have some pressure from a competitive set and industry set relative to promotions. Is that changed at all with some online guys doing a little bit more in your business? Or is that sort of the outlook you have always had? Bill Giles : That's the outlook we have always had. I wouldn't say that we have seen any change necessarily from that perspective whatsoever. I was just trying to balance out the positive aspects of gross margin offset by some of the pressures that you might always consider. But overall, again, we continue to believe our margin remains seeing positive outlook. Mike Baker : Yes. Okay. Thanks. That makes sense. Two more quick follow-ups, if I could. One, you said, I think it was Bill Rhodes who said at one point that if the weather cooperates you would expect trends to get better in the back half of the quarter. Is that just simply a function of, you just have much more difficult compares, as I recall, from last year earlier in the quarter and the compares get much easier in the second half? Or is there some other reason why weather would only impact the back half of the quarter? Bill Giles : I think and I said the back of the quarter and also the balance of the year. So last year, we did get a cold snap and it was December 1 to Christmas. And so we had some real strong sales during that period of time and then it got warm. Also, so if the weather hits, it's going to hit a little bit later than it did last year and we should see the strength in the back half. The other part of it is, there is kind of the tale of two stories on what happens with this extreme winter weather. One is, when it gets really cold really fast, we get an immediate bounce on our business like in batteries. But what happens over time in the longer tail on the winter is, when the road conditions get bad, we will get a longer tail on under car parts, chassis, breaks, ride control, those kind of things. Those are things that you wake up that day and your car can't get you to work, those are things that they put more stress on the components and so the maintenance cycles accelerate. So that will put a tail not only for the back half of Q2 but on into Q3 and some into Q4. Mike Baker : Okay. That makes sense. If I could ask one more quick one here, but hopefully a quick answer. But with some of the pluses and minuses on the gross margin that's described in wages and other costs higher, what kind of sense for sales numbers do you need to get back to a double-digit earnings growth and let's assume that the tax rate stays similar to where it is now. Because obviously, if it goes to 20%, you are going to greater earnings 10% or higher. But let's assume that doesn't happen. Bill Giles : Yes. We are not really, we don't think about on a same-store sales basis like that, Mike. And everybody wants to be able to think through that way. I think we are just thinking about there is opportunities for us to improve gross margin. We talked about the operating expense growth rates. And so, just those are the ways you should be thinking through your model overall. But I mean, look, we feel great about the health of the industry. We feel good about the momentum that we have got. And so we are encouraged by the business. Mike Baker : Okay. I really appreciate the time. Thanks guys. Bill Rhodes : Thank you Mike. Bill Rhodes : All right. Before we conclude the call, I would like to take a moment to reiterate that our business model continues to be very solid. We are excited about our growth prospects for the year. We will not take anything for granted as we understand our customers have alternatives. We have a solid plan to succeed this fiscal year but I want to stress that this is a marathon and not a sprint. As we continue to focus on the basics and focus on optimizing long-term shareholder value, we are confident AutoZone will continue to be very successful. We thank you for participating in today's call. And we would like to wish everyone a very happy and healthy holiday season and a prosperous new year. Thank you for your time today. Operator : And that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

With me today are Bill Giles, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax. Regarding the second quarter, I hope you've had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not, the press release is available on our website, www.autozoneinc.com. To begin this morning, I want to thank all AutoZoners across the company for their efforts that led us to deliver solid top and bottom line results for this quarter. For the last couple of years, we've discussed that the moderate winters have negatively impacted our business. As this winter was more severe, our performance certainly improved. And it's important to, again, highlight that there are multiple implications from the cold and wet winter we experienced. In the short term, extreme cold results in immediate sales in categories like batteries, antifreeze, blower motors and the like, and ice and snow results in immediate sales of wipers, deicers, scrapers, et cetera. Additionally, we believe these conditions and the efforts to remedy them should have a lasting benefit in under-car categories like brakes, chassis and similar categories. We're optimistic that conditions could continue to be more favorable for the balance of our fiscal year. In this morning's press release, we introduced adjustments to our GAAP numbers that are very unusual for us. But due to their significance, we thought they warranted increased visibility for investors. These include adjustments to the tax reform, impact from stock-option accounting and impairment charges related to two business units. I will give more details on these and provide some context regarding ongoing impacts of some of these adjustments. Let's begin with the impairments. These charges were taken on both our AutoAnything and IMC businesses. As we stated in the press release, we determined these businesses were not core to our strategic priorities going forward and proceeded to begin a sale process. This process, along with our normal testing we do, led us to the conclusion it was appropriate to take a net of tax impairment charge of $147 million. Now, I'd like to provide a little background on our strategic rationale for exiting these two businesses. AutoAnything, an online-only retailer that sells performance and accessory products, was acquired in the winter of 2012. We acquired AutoAnything to better understand the internet-only environment and to leverage those learnings on AutoZone.com. AutoAnything has always been run separate and distinct from AutoZone and AutoZone.com. Both the AutoAnything and AutoZone.com teams have learned from each other, but over time, as omni-channel has emerged and increased in importance, we've decided that our focus and efforts would be better spent focusing on AutoZone.com and driving our core business. This morning, we announced an agreement with Kingswood Capital who has purchased this business. IMC, our import parts wholesale distributor business, was acquired in the fall of 2014, and our objective was to enhance our understanding of the WD model, while leveraging their focus on the import market. Our intention was to substantially expand their footprint, and we grew their branch count from 17 to 26. As we have grown this business, it has been increasingly challenging to grow quickly on a profitable basis. As our strategic perspective on the commercial marketplace has progressed, we have determined that our time, attention, focus and investments would be substantially more valuable centered on growing our core commercial business rather than focusing on a more narrow high-end import market. This morning, we announced an agreement with the Parts Authority for them to acquire this business. Before leaving this subject, I'd like to thank all of the employees of AutoAnything and IMC. They have been terrific AutoZoners and have always put the customer first in everything they do. We believe both of these enterprises will be better suited to a different ownership structure, where they will get the time, attention and investments necessary to optimize their business model. Next, we adopted the new stock option accounting standard in the beginning of fiscal 2017. This new standard can cause significant fluctuations in tax expense and diluted share count based on stock option exercise patterns. As this is inherently difficult to model and virtually impossible to forecast, we have elected to show the difference over the last year as an adjustment to GAAP earnings. This quarter, adjusting both years for the stock option accounting, the new standard increased our second quarter EPS by $0.72 a share. Now, let's turn to Tax Reform. The implementation of the new tax laws requires us to recognize some one-time benefits and charges and to adjust our ongoing tax rate. There were two one-time events that generated a net tax benefit in Q2 of approximately $ 112 million : the revaluation of deferred tax liabilities which were reduced due to the change in the corporate tax rate and a one-time charge related to the repatriation tax on the accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Our ongoing federal tax rate was lowered to approximately 26%, reflecting a blend of the old federal rate of 35% and the new federal rate of 21%. This blended rate reduced our tax expense by $59 million in the second quarter. For the balance of the year, we expect our global effective tax rate to be approximately 29% for both Q3 and Q4. Beginning in August 2018, the start of our fiscal 2019, we expect our ongoing global tax rate to be around 24.5%. We expect this lower rate in fiscal 2019 will benefit net income by over $200 million on an annual basis. As we consider this enhancement in the profitability of the enterprise, we are exploring opportunities to proactively invest some of these proceeds in an effort to improve our business for the long-term. Importantly, we have not yet finalized our plans, but our primary focus has been on ensuring our wages and benefits are market competitive. And as we've mentioned for the last several quarters, we have been experiencing increasing wage pressure and we are exploring expediting our investments in technology to improve our service levels in DIY and commercial, both with an enhanced omni-channel emphasis. Many of these investments are pull forwards of planned future investments. We currently estimate the investments to impact operating margin by 60 basis points to 90 basis points on an annualized basis once fully implemented. While some investments will begin in Q3, we expect these investments to really materialize over the next 18 to 24 months. Now, for the business results and specifically sales. The Northeastern and Midwestern market results were much stronger than the remainder of our markets. As you would expect, our weather-sensitive markets improved materially as the harsh winter conditions began near the end of December. In those weather-sensitive markets, our comp store sales improved by more than 200 basis points as a result of the storms. As noted above, certain categories experienced substantially improved sales. However, other categories, like maintenance categories, were challenged and other markets like the West Coast also underperformed. Net-net, our same-store sales improved to 2.2%. Our sales were strongest in the middle of the quarter when the first major winter storms arrived. As we get later in the winter, additional cold spells don't continue to benefit the business. As we have said for years, weather in this business matters over short periods of time. Over long periods of time, weather effects even themselves out. Aside from the weather, we should reiterate we continued to see positive growth in the industry for both retail and commercial and feel the underlying demographics of our customers' vehicle population and driving habits lead us to remain constructive for the future. Regarding our internal initiatives, and specifically continuing improving inventory availability at the market level, we continue to see a nice pickup in sales from the markets with mega hub capabilities. Mega hub stores are our stores with approximately 100,000 unique SKUs and provide delivery to surrounding stores and other hubs. As our plan dictated this quarter, we did not open any additional mega hubs. However, we continue on track to have 26 locations opened by the end of the fiscal year. Our supply chain team remained quite busy this past quarter as they were finishing construction on a new distribution center in Ocala, Florida, and a major expansion in Danville, Illinois. Ocala will begin shipping next month, and we're staging inventory in Danville's expansion now. Even while this activity was ongoing, our supply chain team was able to deliver leverage in our warehouse and delivery cost. This marked the second sequential quarter where we have leveraged our cost, and while we continue to be mindful of fuel cost increases year-over-year and labor shortages across several carrier lines, we remain encouraged with the direction of our business' cost are headed over the remainder of our fiscal 2018. Additionally, we saw solid performance in our commercial business sales results in Q2. Total commercial sales increased 5.7% for the quarter. While this quarter's rate grew slower than Q1 at 6.7%, these results were encouraging considering both Christmas and New Year's fell on Mondays this year versus Sunday last year. Our commercial customers are typically closed on holidays, so we lost two selling days in the quarter. We estimate that it impacted commercial growth by more than 150 basis points. We continue to grow our business faster than the overall industry by executing on our game plan. With fewer year-over-year program openings, more of our sales growth is coming from existing customers or new customers in older programs. We believe our inventory availability work is vital to these efforts and is enhancing our position in the market. I'll add a lot of credit here for our ongoing commercial performance goes to our store AutoZoners that are simply getting better at running our model. Commercial relationships take time to cultivate, and we are encouraged with their efforts. Turning to our online efforts, we continue to invest in our strategy to enhance the customer shopping experience in an omni-channel world. We continue to see growth in website traffic, particularly mobile, while it drives in-store traffic, ship-to-home sales and buy online, pick up in store. Our website has become one of our key marketing tools, and our first omni-channel objective is to leverage the website to drive in-store business. Buy online, pick up in store growth rates remain much, much faster than ship-to-home as our customers value the convenience of immediate availability and the trustworthy advice our AutoZoners provide them. This also further highlights the importance of inventory availability at the store level. We're also working to further enhance our digital capabilities with our commercial customers, and they continue to increase their interaction with us electronically. We will continue to invest in our omni-channel strategy to ensure we can conduct business with our customers in the manner that best fits their needs and desires. On the cost front, I've highlighted on the first \u2013 the last two quarters' conference calls the impacts we are experiencing from accelerated pressure on wages. Those pressures continue to exist and are much more than our historical norms. The regulatory changes are going to continue as evidenced by the areas that have passed legislation to increase their wages substantially over the next few years. And more importantly, the current market forces in retail as we all compete for talented employees in a very low unemployment environment. We are constantly working diligently to find new innovations to better manage our cost structure, and those efforts will continue. But we believe this particular area will have continued pressure for some extended period of time. Our management team remains committed to managing this business for the long-term to provide great service for our customers and great opportunities for our AutoZoners, ultimately delivering strong shareholder value. We operate in an industry driven by, in many cases, inelastic demand. If the parts break or wear out, our customers need to fix it now to get to work and get on with their lives. Because of this predictability based on miles driven and an aging car population, we remain committed to continually improving our ability to aid our customers in saying yes to their needs. Now, let me provide a little more detail on the quarter. For the quarter, our sales increased 5.4% and our domestic same-store sales were up 2.2%. During the quarter, we opened 34 net new stores in the U.S. and our commercial business opened 23 programs. Year-to-date, we've opened 49 net new stores and 53 commercial programs in the U.S., eight new stores in Mexico and two in Brazil. We expect to open approximately 150 new domestic stores, 40 in Mexico and approximately 10 in Brazil, for a total of roughly 200 new locations, and we expect to open about 150 net new U.S. commercial programs. Currently, 84% of our domestic stores have a commercial program. Now, I'd like to provide an update on our inventory availability initiatives. As a reminder, multiple frequency of delivery is solely focused on improving the in-stock levels for the SKUs that are stocked in our stores, while the mega hubs are focused on adding additional coverage to the local markets, meaning adding SKUs that would not have been available locally in our network before. We have completed our testing related to multiple frequency of delivery. We've determined that at certain volumes more frequent deliveries make economic sense, and at lower volumes, they don't. We will be implementing the new frequencies over the next several months. Once completed, approximately 25% of our stores, representing 40% of our sales volume and nearly 50% of our commercial sales, will receive distribution center deliveries three or more times per week. Implementing these changes will not have a meaningful impact on our current distribution cost structure. I want to congratulate and thank the team that did all of this important work. They left no stone unturned in determining the optimal delivery frequency and ultimately devised a solid strategy that we will now implement. Now, let's focus on our mega hubs. As a reminder, these super-sized AutoZone stores carry 80,000 to 100,000 unique SKUs, approximately twice what a hub store carries today. They provide coverage to both surrounding stores and other hub stores multiple times a day or on an overnight basis. Our sales results thus far in our open mega hubs continue to exceed our expectations both for retail and commercial. Currently, we have over 4,000 stores with access to mega hub inventory. A majority or about two-thirds of these 4,000 stores receive their service on an overnight basis today, but as we expand our mega hubs, more of them will receive this service same-day and many will receive it multiple times per day. We continue to expect to ultimately operate up to 40 mega hubs. The constraint on the speed with which we can open these is availability and location of real estate. While an average AutoZone location is just under 7,000 square feet, a mega hub is 20,000 square feet to 30,000 square feet or more. Identifying and developing these locations in prime retail areas is challenging and it takes time. While there are incremental cost to these rollouts, we continue to feel these investments will provide a better customer experience and increase market share. Along with improving our local parts availability and assortment, we continue to manage this organization to provide exceptional service for our customers, provide our AutoZoners with a great place to work, with opportunities for advancement and ensure we do it on a long-term profitable basis to provide strong returns for our shareholders. We will continue to stress the importance of going the extra mile to fulfill our customers' needs regardless of how difficult the request. With our commitments to service intact, we continued to be share gainers over the quarter according to the data we have available to us and in fact our share gains have accelerated over the last several months. Now, let me review our highlights regarding execution of our ongoing operating theme from 2017 that we carried over into 2018. Yes, we've got it. The key priorities for the year are great people providing great service, profitably growing our commercial business, leveraging the Internet, yes, we've got it and leveraging IT. On the retail front this past quarter under the great people providing great service theme, we were committed to supporting our store AutoZoners, we're focusing on enhanced training to store-level AutoZoners and increasing the share of voice regarding availability with the yes, we've got it theme. We remain aggressive with our technology investments and believe these initiatives will help differentiate us on a go-forward basis. We realize as customers have become much more tech and mobile savvy, we have to have a sales proposition that touches all the ways they desire to interact with us. Our current and future technology investments will lead to sales growth across all of our businesses. We should also highlight another strong performance in return on invested capital, as we were able to finish our second quarter at 30.2%. We continue to be pleased with this metric, as it is one of the best in all of hardlines retailing. However, our primary focus has been and continues to be that we ensure every incremental dollar of capital that we deploy in this business provides an acceptable return, well in excess of our cost to capital. It is important to reinforce that we always maintain our diligence regarding capital stewardship as the capital we invest is our investors' capital. Before I pass the discussion over to Bill Giles to talk about financial results, I'd like to thank our AutoZoners for their efforts to continue to meet and exceed our customers' wants, needs and desires. We are bullish on the remainder of 2018 sales potential because we have a great business operated by an exceptional team. Now, I'll turn it over to Bill. William T. Giles - AutoZone, Inc.: Good morning, everyone, and thanks, Bill. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to talk more specifically about our retail, commercial and international results. For the quarter, total auto parts sales which includes our domestic retail and commercial businesses, our Mexico and Brazil stores and our 26 IMC branches increased 5.7%. For the trailing 52 weeks ended, total sales per domestic AutoZone store were $1,780,000. Total commercial sales also increased 5.7% in the quarter, and commercial represented 19% of our total sales and grew $25 million over last year's Q2. We opened 23 net new programs versus 12 programs opened in our second quarter last year. We now have our commercial program in 4,645 stores or 84% of our domestic stores, supported by 188 hub stores. Over 700 of our programs are 3 years old or younger. For all of fiscal 2018, we expect to open approximately 150 new programs. While we continue to implement new tests in commercial, we are continuing with our existing strategies to grow commercial sales and profit. We are encouraged by the initiatives we have in place and feel we can further grow sales and market share. Our Mexico stores continued to perform well. We opened three new stores during the second quarter, and year-to-date opened eight. We ended the quarter with 532 stores, and we expect to open approximately 40 new stores in fiscal 2018. Mexico's business was challenged throughout 2016 and 2017 by a weakening peso foreign exchange rate relative to the U.S. dollar. While 2018's exchange rates have come down versus last year and will potentially be favorable, the currency volatility is significant. Moves of greater than 5% from one quarter to the next mean we have to be extremely watchful of what the volatility means to the U.S. dollar earnings. Regarding Brazil, we opened two new stores and now have 16 total stores open. Our plans are to add eight more locations over the remainder of the fiscal year. While still running with an operating loss, our performance continues to improve and gives us optimism about the long-term future of this market. With more economies of scales, this market has the potential to be much larger than Mexico. So, while challenging, it is worth our patience. Gross margin for the quarter was 52.9% of sales, up 26 basis points from last year's second quarter. The increase in gross margin was attributable to lower distribution cost and higher merchandise margins. While we continue to be optimistic on gross margin rate for the remainder of fiscal 2018, our primary focus remains growing absolute gross profit dollars in our business. SG&A for the quarter was 44.4% of sales. Now, excluding the impairment charge, SG&A deleveraged by about 53 basis points. Operating expenses before impairment charges as a percentage of sales were higher than last year, primarily due to higher incentive compensation, higher advertising and deleverage on occupancy costs. EBIT for the quarter was $205 million in the second quarter. Excluding the impairment charges, EBIT was up 3.7%. Interest expense for the quarter was $39 million compared with $34 million in Q2 a year ago. We are planning interest expense of approximately $40 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 versus $35.7 million last year. The higher expense is due to the tenure and size of the bonds completed last April of $600 million at 3.75% coupon. Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was approximately $5 billion. Our adjusted debt level metric finished the quarter at 2.5 times EBITDAR. While in any given quarter, we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on management's opinion regarding debt and equity market conditions, we remain committed to both our investment grade rating and our capital allocation strategy, and share repurchases are an important element of that strategy. For the quarter, our tax provision was a benefit due to the one-time Tax Reform items versus last year's Q2 tax rate of 32.2%. As Bill has already mentioned this morning, our taxes were impacted by four main components in Q2. The first one has been in effect for about a year now. The new standard on handling stock option expensing requires us to recognize the tax benefit received from the gains employees have on stock options as a credit to income tax expense in the P&L. This past quarter, it lowered our tax expense by $32 million. This compares to last year's Q1 benefit of $13 million. This accounting change also increases the diluted share count calculation. Because it is impossible for us to predict when individuals exercise options, we encourage folks to model us on a rate assuming no stock option impact and we will report both rates. Secondly, our rate was impacted by the tax benefit on the impairment charge taken. This was a benefit of $47 million in the quarter. We also had a benefit from the revaluation of our deferred tax liability and from the new, lower go-forward federal tax rate. Lastly, we incurred a one-time tax expense in Q2 for the repatriation tax on the accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. To try and parse through all of these pushes and pulls, I will simply say we expect our global tax rate to approximate 29% for Q3 and Q4, and we expect our fiscal 2019 global tax rate to be approximately 24.5% going forward. On a GAAP basis, net income for the quarter was $290 million, up 22% versus Q2 last year. Our diluted share count of 27.9 million was down 5% from last year's second quarter. The combination of these factors drove earnings per share for the quarter to $10.38, up 28% over the prior year's second quarter. Now, excluding the impact of the previously-mentioned adjustments, including impairment charges, Tax Reform and stock-option accounting to both this year and last year's numbers, our EPS would've increased at 9.3% for the quarter. Relating to the cash flow statement for the second quarter, we generated $187 million of operating cash flow. Net fixed assets were up 7.3% versus last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $104 million and reflected the additional expenditures required to open stores this quarter. Capital expenditures on existing stores, hub and mega hug store remodels or openings, work on the development of new stores for upcoming quarters, investments in our new domestic DCs and information technology investments. With the new stores opened, we finished this past quarter with 5,514 stores in 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, 532 stores in Mexico and 16 in Brazil for a total AutoZone store count of 6,062. We also had 26 IMC branches open at the end of Q2. Depreciation totaled $79.3 million for the quarter versus last year's second quarter expense of $72.8 million. This is generally in line with recent quarter growth rates. We repurchased $175 million of AutoZone stock in the second quarter. At quarter-end, we had $296 million remaining under our share buyback authorization and our leverage metric was 2.5 times at quarter-end. Again, I want to stress, we manage through appropriate credit ratings and not any one metric. The metric we report is meant as a guide only as each rating firm has its own criteria. We continue to view our share repurchase program as an attractive capital deployment strategy. Next, I'd like to update you on our inventory levels in total and on a per store basis. The company's inventory increased 4.7% over the same period last year. Inventory per location was $671,000 versus $665,000 last year and $663,000 last quarter. Net inventory, defined as merchandised inventories less accounts payable, on a per location basis was a negative $46,000 versus a negative $36,000 last year and a negative $52,000 last quarter. As a result, accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 106.9%. Finally, as Bill previously mentioned, our continued, disciplined capital management approach resulted in return on invested capital for the trailing four quarters of 30.2%. We have and will continue to make investments that we believe will generate returns that significantly exceed our cost of capital. Now, I'll turn it back to Bill Rhodes. William C. Rhodes - AutoZone, Inc.: Thank you, Bill. While we are encouraged for the remainder of the year by the favorable macro environment and the traction we are gaining with our internal sales initiatives, we understand we must continue to execute on our game plan. We are optimistic looking at the back half of the fiscal year. Last year, we were impacted negatively by the delay in income tax refunds and the impact of a second consecutive mild winter. Timing of this year's income tax refund season is expected to be similar to last year, and therefore, we do not expect a material impact on the third quarter. We're excited to intensify our focus on our core businesses because we see these core businesses as tremendously attractive and in strong markets. We will continue our domestic and international expansion efforts, growing roughly 200 locations annually. We will continue to focus on growing our commercial business at an accelerated rate to the market growth. We will accelerate our omni-channel efforts, and we will leverage ALLDATA as the premier tool our shops use in the automotive aftermarket. To execute at a high level, we have to consistently adhere to living the pledge. We cannot and will not take our eye off execution. We must stay committed to executing day in and day out on our game plan. Success will be achieved with an attention to detail and exceptional execution. Our customers have choices and we must exceed their expectations in whatever way they choose to shop with us. We are fortunate to operate in one of the strongest retail segment and we continue to be excited about our industry's growth prospects for 2018 and beyond. As consumers continually look to save money while taking care of their vehicles, we are committed to providing the trustworthy advice they expect. It is truly the value-add that differentiates us from any other faceless transaction. Customers have come to expect that advice from us. It is with this focus we will implement more enhancements on both our DIY and commercial websites and in-store experience to provide even more knowledgeable service. We don't ever expect an online experience to replace the advice our customers want, but today's customers do expect more information on repairing their vehicles. This aspect of service has always been our most important cultural cornerstone and it will be long into the future. Our charge remains to optimize our performance regardless of market conditions and ensure we are investing in the key initiatives that will drive our long-term performance. In the end, delivering strong EPS growth and ROIC each and every quarter is how we measure ourselves. This formula has been extremely successful over the last 38 years and we continue to be excited about our future. Now, we'd like to open up the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin a question-and-answer session. Our first question is coming from Alan Rifkin of BTIG. Your line is now open. William C. Rhodes - AutoZone, Inc.: Good morning, Alan. Alan Rifkin - BTIG LLC : Hello? William C. Rhodes - AutoZone, Inc.: Hey, Alan. Hello? Operator : One moment please. William C. Rhodes - AutoZone, Inc.: Then, can we move to the \u2013 I'm sorry. Operator : William C. Rhodes - AutoZone, Inc.: Operator, can we take the next call, please? Operator : Thank you. Once again, Alan Rifkin, your line is now open. Alan Rifkin - BTIG LLC : Thank you. Can you hear me? William C. Rhodes - AutoZone, Inc.: Yeah, we can. Sorry about that, Alan. I'm not sure what happened. Alan Rifkin - BTIG LLC : I'm very sorry about that also. Bill, a couple of questions for you, Bill Rhodes. So the disposition of IMC and AutoAnything is the first time that I can recall you disposing of an asset. Is that a sign that you're now taking a more targeted approach to growing your business? And why do you think you couldn't make AutoAnything work, yet you remain confident in the AutoZone.com business? And then I do have a follow-up, please. William C. Rhodes - AutoZone, Inc.: That's a great question, Alan. First of all, it's the second time we divested of a business. We did sell the TruckPro business, if you recall, back in 2001 or 2002. In each of these cases, the first thing I'll tell you is as we get into these other businesses that are maybe half a step away from our core business, the profitability dynamics are just very, very different than what we experience in our core business, and it really makes us further appreciate the strength of this core business on a long-term basis. Specifically on AutoAnything, we bought them to learn. Online-only retail at that time, this is 2012, was really emerging and we felt like it was important that we understood that business and understood it to see if we could grow it, but also to understand it and what its implications would be to the long-term of our business. As you can see from both of those businesses, they're not terribly profitable. In fact, we were operating both of them at a net loss. And the more we've learned about both the online-only area and AutoZone.com, we have become more confident that we need to leverage the strengths of our business, particularly the knowledgeable people that we have in our stores. And so our decision has been let's go and double down on the core business, both AutoZone.com and our retail operations, as well as commercial. And we feel really good about those decisions. We do want to say thanks again to the people with AutoAnything and IMC, great AutoZoners and did a wonderful job for us, just tougher markets. Alan Rifkin - BTIG LLC : Okay. Thank you, Bill. And a follow-up, if I may. What proportion of the Tax Reform savings do you expect to be reinvested into the business? And what areas, in particular, will be earmarked? And what would be a reasonable time to expect a return from these investments? Thank you so much. William C. Rhodes - AutoZone, Inc.: Thank you, Alan. Great questions, again. I've said this in our prepared remarks, and I want to emphasize it again. We have not made final decisions on that. And frankly, we haven't had a board meeting since the Tax Reform was passed. You know us to be very methodical in what we do. We're not going to go out and make quick decisions. We're going to evaluate what we think the right decisions are for the long term. I mentioned in our prepared remarks that we're looking at wages. We've been talking about the increased pressure on wages over the last year or so. And one implication of Tax Reform is that those pressures on wages are intensifying. You've heard other retailers and other businesses talk about raising their minimum wages and the like. So we are very focused on making sure that we are market competitive with our wages. Our people are our most important asset, and it is imperative that we have the best people and it's imperative that we pay them appropriately. So I think that will be a big part of what we focus on. As for when do those investments pay off, it's going to depend on when they come in. I've said in the prepared remarks, you know what, don't look for these all come in this quarter. They'll be feathered in overtime as we're prepared to execute them. Alan Rifkin - BTIG LLC : Okay. Thank you. And sorry for the mix-up on my end with the Q&A. William C. Rhodes - AutoZone, Inc.: I'm not sure what happened, Alan. Alan Rifkin - BTIG LLC : I too. William C. Rhodes - AutoZone, Inc.: Thank you. Alan Rifkin - BTIG LLC : Thank you. Thank you, gentlemen. Operator : Thank you, Alan. And our next question is coming from Matt Fassler of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks so much. Thanks so much, guys, and good morning to you. Can you hear me? William C. Rhodes - AutoZone, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks, Matt. Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Beautiful. First of all, I want to talk a bit about the rate of sales growth. You gave us some color about the cadence during the quarter, the strength in the middle. Obviously we're coming off two years where you kind of had a perfect storm against you. You seem rather optimistic about the rest of this year based on all those \u2013 many of those factors reversing. Is your sense that the run rate of this business kind of in a neutral state where things like car park and weather are one way or the other similar to where it's been in years past? Is the run rate you think lower than it's been in years past? Just thinking about the 2% comp in a quarter where it seems like you had more good guys than bad guys, how should we think about the run rate, not just here in the third fiscal quarter, but on a bigger picture go-forward basis? Any new insights would be great there. William C. Rhodes - AutoZone, Inc.: Sure. And I would say this is probably not new, Matt, but if you go back to our conference call in September, if you remember last year this time there was a lot of anxiety that the market, the industry fundamentals had been disrupted and were going to be changed over a long period of time. Back in September, I made a very intentional point to say that our five-year average growth in same-store sales was 1.9%. So this quarter, we ended at 2.2%. I don't think the industry fundamentals have changed significantly this year, last year, or over the last five years. I'm pretty pleased with the 2.2% comp that we had in the quarter. If you recall, we knew we were going to be up against a tough beginning of the quarter because the only weather we got last year was kind of between Thanksgiving and Christmas. So we were a little challenged in that period of time. When the first cold weather hit, our sales absolutely performed and did wonderfully. As we got later in the quarter, our sales softened. That to us was not a big surprise. It was cold and rainy, and as it gets \u2013 you get the sales pop when you get the first cold snap. You don't get continued failure of batteries and the like when you get continued cold spells. What we are optimistic about for the balance of the year, and one thing we talked about for the last two years is our maintenance businesses in Q3 and Q4 have been challenged. The road conditions, salt, potholes and the like, help brakes and chassis and shocks and struts, and so we anticipate as we go into the back half of the year that our conditions should be pretty favorable. One other thing that I want to make sure and reinforce is when you look at the two-year comp for Q2, I think some people were concerned about that, don't forget, last year, we lost the tax money in Q2. We did not pick that back up this year. So that was a fundamental shift in the business. Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got you. And then one quick follow-up. If you could \u2013 you guys talked about a $5 million operating loss essentially associated with the two businesses that you're divesting. What does that look like on an annual basis? And can you share or do you plan to publish with your filings the parameters of that so that as we model out the upcoming quarters and years, we can do so accurately without AutoAnything in the mix? William T. Giles - AutoZone, Inc.: Yeah, and that's a good point, Matt. And to be honest with you, we just want to be transparent and show you guys that they're not profitable, but they're very, very small businesses overall. But they're probably on an annualized basis combined single-digit, low-double digit EBIT loss, so, but we'll break that out as we go forward and you guys can model it in. Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: And then finally, how much money did you get in these transactions? Is it meaningful at all? William T. Giles - AutoZone, Inc.: No, it's an undisclosed number. But look, we feel pretty good about what we did with these two units. We're glad to move on and put them under different ownership and focus back on our core, because we're pretty excited about our core. Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thank you, guys. William C. Rhodes - AutoZone, Inc.: Thanks, Matt. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is coming from Christopher Horvers of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks. Good morning. Following up on Matt's thread there, you have had more good guys than bad guys, and I know you talked about a 2% average over the past five years. But with more good guys in hand, do we tick-up a little bit from the 2%? And how would you \u2013 and then, as you think about the third quarter, compared to look easier here, so is there something unique why we shouldn't see some modest acceleration in light of those two factors, more good guys than bad guys, and then a real dip here in the third quarter last year? William C. Rhodes - AutoZone, Inc.: Great question, Chris. On the third quarter, I do want you to remember also last year we didn't get the tax money that we thought we'd get in the third quarter of last year, so that was part of the challenge. What happens with that tax money this year, we really don't know. For the most part, it didn't start arriving until last Friday. That was the first time a significant amount of tax money arrived in the marketplace, so we'll see over time. As far as the forecast in the future, as you know, we don't give guidance. And we're talking about five years of 1.9% and this quarter at 2.2%. Those are very similar numbers. What happens on a go-forward basis? I think we've been pretty clear, we're optimistic about the second half, but I don't want to put a number on it. Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah. And then, within the quarter, last year, you provided some helpful context around, I think, December was down 6% and January, before the last three weeks, was \u2013 sorry, up 6% and then January before the last three weeks of the quarter, I think, was down 4%. So could you provide some incremental color in terms of sort of how we compare it against those? William T. Giles - AutoZone, Inc.: Yeah. I would think of it almost as a bell curve on the quarter to some extent. You're right. When we anniversaried some of that strong performance at the early part of the quarter given the weather that hit last year, business was a little bit more challenging. When we hit the heart of the quarter, business was really strong and a lot of that was weather related. As Bill mentioned in the prepared remarks, as we hit the tail end of the quarter, we had a lot of wet, chilly type of weather throughout the country, and that was a little bit softer, but we think we're pretty well positioned as we head into Q3. And as Bill said, the tax money is now arriving. We don't know what the impact of that will be, but we feel pretty good as we start to head into Q3. Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thanks, guys. Best of luck. William C. Rhodes - AutoZone, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is coming from Simeon Gutman of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Simeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Good morning. Guys, I realize that you don't give line item guidance. And my question is on operating income, which was fine this quarter. It grew nicely. I wanted to ask if the mid-single digits is the right run rate, and I heard a lot of commentary from Bill Rhodes about investment and potential reinvestment. And so I want to understand if the philosophy around that number has changed, meaning if comps do eclipse 3% in the next couple quarters, are you reinvesting faster or are you letting that flow through? William C. Rhodes - AutoZone, Inc.: I think to a large extent it'll be timing. When we talked about making some of the reinvestments, as we mentioned, some of those may take 18 to 24 months as we go through and evaluate where the best places are and what the dollar amounts will be, et cetera. But I think that our philosophy relative to our operating model remains intact with the exception that as we have this benefit from the Tax Reform Act that ultimately will put more pressure on wages in the marketplace in general. But we'll respond to that. We want to get out in front of that, and so we'll take an opportunity to take a portion of those Tax Reform dollars and be able to invest them back in the business to continue to drive EPS overall. But I don't think anything's changed in our operating model excluding that. Simeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then with regard to the current environment, are you seeing anything yet with regard to under-car repairs sort of bigger jobs or bigger part sales that relate to larger damage? And then, connected to it, anything yet as far as six to seven-year-old vehicles where this whole car part argument is starting to come through? William C. Rhodes - AutoZone, Inc.: Yeah. I'll start with the first one on are we seeing the maintenance items, the under-car items come up. Not yet, we aren't. But the weather has not been conducive to it and usually we see it at the time when the weather finally breaks and gets into the 50-degree, 60-degree range, when people can get outside and work on their vehicles and that really hasn't happened. So we're not surprised by any stretch of imagination that we haven't seen it materialize yet, and we're quite optimistic that it will materialize over time. On the six to seven-year-old car part, if you've listened to us, we haven't made that big of a deal out of it over time. Yeah, it was a minor headwind, but I don't think it was a \u2013 it was never one that we called out as a significant driver of our performance. So I don't think it'll be a significant driver this year either. Simeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks, Bill. Good luck. William C. Rhodes - AutoZone, Inc.: Yeah. Thank you, Simeon. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is coming from Scot Ciccarelli of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC : It's Scot Ciccarelli. Two questions. First, can you tell us the size of your AutoZone.com business today? Number one. Number two, looking for a clarification on the comments on the disposed businesses. Bill, when you said high-single-digit or low-double-digit loss, was that an annualized number in millions for the two businesses in aggregate? William T. Giles - AutoZone, Inc.: Yeah. It was an annualized number from an EBIT perspective. And, like I said, we'll disclose that as we move forward so that you guys will be able to see it. We don't really disclose the volume on AutoZone.com because what's really important to us is the eyeballs that we get to the site. So we get a significant amount of traffic on a weekly basis, much of which we believe transfers itself into sales inside of our store. Certainly our buy online, pickup in store business, which is not significant but clearly the fastest growing channel of growth that we have continues to do really well. So that's where we really fall back to this concept that we really believe with the assets that we have that investing in the omni-channel is really our core strategy, and that's how we're going to move forward. Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC : So maybe phrasing the question slightly differently, of your AutoZone.com orders, how much has picked up in the store versus sent to people's homes? William T. Giles - AutoZone, Inc.: I would say probably 50% of what comes through online is picked up in the store. Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Got it. All right. Thanks, guys. William T. Giles - AutoZone, Inc.: Sure. William C. Rhodes - AutoZone, Inc.: Thank you, Scot. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is coming from Brian Nagel of Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Brian Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Hi. Good morning. William C. Rhodes - AutoZone, Inc.: Good morning. William T. Giles - AutoZone, Inc.: Good morning. Brian Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: First off, I guess a bigger picture question just with respect to the sales backdrop. We talked a lot about weather so far. With some of the shifts in taxes, particularly on the personal side, are you seeing evidence yet that the overall health or buying power of your core consumer has been improving? William C. Rhodes - AutoZone, Inc.: We haven't seen that yet. This is a very volatile time of year for us. Every single year, the second quarter, the beginning of the third quarter is clearly the most volatile period of time. So to be able to pick up on those nuances would be pretty challenging. We've also done some work and are continuing to do some work on what does it actually mean to our customers? And if you look at it, it can be a meaningful dollar amount. Tax Reform can be a meaningful dollar amount over the year, but the change in their check on an every two-week basis is pretty small. And so we're kind of wondering how are we going to see that? It's really easy to see it when you get a tax refund. We can absolutely see that in our business. But if you're picking up $30 to $70 every two weeks in your check, I don't know how we're going to be able to ferret that out. Brian Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: That's helpful. And then the second question I have with respect to potential reinvestments of the corporate tax savings, so AutoZone's been aggressively buying its stock back for some time. I guess that's been a key source of investment. As you think about this, for lack of a better term, windfall of money coming in and how to allocate that, is the buyback still prioritized similarly, or... William C. Rhodes - AutoZone, Inc.: Yes. Brian Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay. William C. Rhodes - AutoZone, Inc.: Absolutely, the buyback is still a very important part of our structure. But our capital structure all along has been, number one, invest in the assets that we have today to make them perform at an optimum level. Secondly, invest in new assets. So think new stores in the United States, Mexico, Brazil, new commercial programs, and on and on. Thirdly, we repurchase shares with the balance of that excess cash flow. That will not change, has not changed. We are looking at are there some areas that we should invest at an accelerated rate, and that's what we called out this morning. But again I want to reiterate we have not made final decisions on any of that at this point in time. Brian Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thank you very much. William C. Rhodes - AutoZone, Inc.: All right. Thank you, Brian. Operator : Thank you, Brian. And our next question is coming from Kate McShane of Citi Research. Your line is now open. Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hello. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. William C. Rhodes - AutoZone, Inc.: Good morning. Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Given the conclusion on the amount of deliveries to your stores, I'm not sure if I missed it, but can you walk us through how you reached the conclusion of what the ultimate level of deliveries for the lower volume stores should be? And should costs, therefore, be alleviating for some of those stores you're delivering less often to? And can you dimensionalize how that can impact your costs over time? William C. Rhodes - AutoZone, Inc.: Yeah. I think the way to think about it is \u2013 and you're right on the track there. It's really an economic decision, so we're looking at the volume of those stores in determining what kind of lift that they can get in order to support the incremental cost, and that's how we bifurcated the overall chain and determined what stores would wind up getting that more frequent delivery. As we realign that versus what we are doing today, we actually think the costs will be relatively consistent with where it has been. So there'll be some pushes and pulls, but the cost would be relatively consistent. Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you. William C. Rhodes - AutoZone, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is coming from Greg Melich of MN Retail. Your line is now open. Gregory Scott Melich - MoffettNathanson LLC : Hi. Thanks, guys. I had two questions, one on the understanding numbers and reinvestments of the tax cuts and then second is on the imported parts strategy. So first on the tax cuts, I'm not sure I got this right; it's about $200 million of savings, but we should expect 60 bps to 90 bps of margin investment which would imply sort of a 35% to 50% reinvestment of that. Am I thinking about that the right way and then... William C. Rhodes - AutoZone, Inc.: Yes. Gregory Scott Melich - MoffettNathanson LLC : ...would CapEx be on top of that? Okay. William T. Giles - AutoZone, Inc.: Yes, that's right, that's ballpark-ish, and the CapEx would still be its own separate strategy, and we'll continue with what we've done in the past. But think about that as $200 million-plus in Tax Reform money and the majority of that will go back to shareholders, per se, and less than the majority will be invested back in the business. Gregory Scott Melich - MoffettNathanson LLC : Got it. And that 60 basis points to 90 basis points, from everything you said, it sounds like it's basically SG&A? William T. Giles - AutoZone, Inc.: Yes, to a large extent, it would be. I don't see us investing necessarily in the supply chain or margin \u2013 or gross margin, so it likely will show up in SG&A over time. But as Bill said, it will probably be over a longer period of time of 18 to 24 months, and it's worthy of stepping back for a second and just saying that we haven't made determinations as to exactly what that number is going to be or how it is going to be spent. We're just giving you an idea of what we're thinking about now. Gregory Scott Melich - MoffettNathanson LLC : Got it. And that starts in the third quarter of this fiscal year, but it should build to that range by next fiscal year. Would that be a fair way to think about it? William T. Giles - AutoZone, Inc.: Yes. Gregory Scott Melich - MoffettNathanson LLC : Got it. And with the divestiture of IMC, how are you guys thinking about addressing that part of the market? That was a growing area, imported car parts. Is there a change in terms of vendors or SKU counts, or how are you thinking about that? William C. Rhodes - AutoZone, Inc.: Terrific question, Greg. First of all, I think, if you recall, when first bought IMC, we talked about the incredibly small overlap of the customers that we had, and that hasn't changed. But over time, we have, in our core business, we have gotten deeper and deeper in import coverage, primarily through the Duralast brand, and we will continue to do that. So I don't see any major shift in how we go to market. I think all of us and we at AutoZone in particular have constantly been enhancing our coverage on import parts. When you think about the mega hubs and hubs, there's a lot of that there, but there's a lot of it in just those core satellite stores as well. So I think we'll continue to focus on the import market, but not a major shift. What we won't be doing is selling to high-end import market, which is where IMC is really good at. So think about BMWs and Mercedes in particular. And that's just a part of the market that we're not focused on. Gregory Scott Melich - MoffettNathanson LLC : Got it. Thanks a lot. Good luck, guys. William C. Rhodes - AutoZone, Inc.: All right. Thank you, Greg. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is coming from Steve Forbes of Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now open. Steven Forbes - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Good morning. William C. Rhodes - AutoZone, Inc.: Good morning. Steven Forbes - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Maybe a follow-up here on the multiple frequency of delivery initiatives. So can you expand on what percentage of those stores that you mentioned, right, the 25% of the store base that are going to be receiving three times a week delivery have that type of frequency in place today to just give us some perspective on the amount of change that has to transpire here? And then for the remaining 75% on a net-to-net basis is, do you plan on reducing the number of average deliveries per week for this cohort? And any color on kind of timing? I know you said you're still kind of working through it here, but any color on timing would be helpful. William C. Rhodes - AutoZone, Inc.: We're still working through the timing. We made a decision last Monday, so this is fresh. It's going to take us a little bit of time as we rewrite delivery schedules to get in. But I'd say it will be in place over the next several months. So the net change is not going to be significant. We've been testing low volume stores at three times a week, high volume stores at one time a week and the like for the last year, year and a half in particular. So the net change is not going to be significant. We're going to have lower volume stores that are getting three time a week delivery today that will go back to one time a week delivery. We're going to have high-volume stores that are getting once a week delivery to get three time a week delivery. We think it will have a marginal sales benefit and a neutral cost impact once it's implemented. Steven Forbes - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Thank you. And then just a quick, I guess, modeling question for a follow-up here regarding square footage growth within the quarter. If I'm doing this right, it looks like there was a step up in total footage, and it appears that it's really concentrated with international. Is that right? And then what would that be from? William T. Giles - AutoZone, Inc.: Yes. It's probably more timing than anything else, Steve, and I would say that on an annualized basis we should be pretty consistent with prior year. So there's probably a little bit of juggling in between quarters. That's all I would think about. Steven Forbes - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Thank you. William T. Giles - AutoZone, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And we will now turn the call over back to Bill Rhodes. William C. Rhodes - AutoZone, Inc.: Great, thank you. Before we conclude the call, I'd just like to take a moment to reiterate that our business model continues to be solid. We're excited about our growth prospects for the year. We will not take anything for granted as we understand our customers have alternatives. We continue to execute our game plans to succeed this fiscal year. But I want to stress that this is a marathon and not a sprint. As we continue to focus on the basics and focus on optimizing long-term shareholder value, we are confident AutoZone will continue to be very successful. We thank you for participating in today's call. Operator : And that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

With me today are Bill Giles, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax. Regarding the third quarter, hope you've had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not, the press release along with slide complementing our comments today, are available on our Website www.autozoneinc.com. Please click on quarterly earnings conference call to see this. To begin this morning, I want to thank all AutoZoners across the company for their efforts that allowed us to deliver solid financial results this quarter. And as we entered the third quarter, we were pretty optimistic about our sales prospects, since we were coming off the first reasonably severe winter in the last three years. We anticipated seeing a significant acceleration in the sales of maintenance products as the harsh winter was hard on them and as the weather improved our customers would get outside and get caught up on their maintenance work. Unfortunately, we had a very cold wet spring through March and much of April. And the anticipated acceleration in maintenance category sales for much of the quarter did not materialize. Instead two of our top performing categories were wiper blades and anti-freeze, not the categories you want leading the way in the spring. Additionally, the northeastern Mid-Atlantic and Midwestern geographies did not excel as expected after the harsher winter. However, at the end of the quarter, the last two weeks when most of the country entered a dry hot weather pattern, our sales improved materially and in the geographies and the categories that we expected. While we were disappointed with our sales for the quarter, they performed in line with our expectations from week-to-week based on the weather patterns we were experiencing. And we were encouraged when our sales responded when the weather turned more favorable. We continue to be optimistic about the balance of this selling season, because we know there is significant deferred maintenance outstanding. Despite the headline sales performance, we had some encouraging results to highlight. Our commercial business growth accelerated, increasing over 7% versus last year's third quarter and our revenue per program grew nicely. As we continue to enhance many elements of our commercial program, we are encouraged to see our business improve. We have substantially enhanced our inventory availability over the past three years, and those improvements continue to strengthen our competitive positioning in the marketplace. Additionally, our commercial customers perform their work in garages, so the negative weather doesn't impact them as much as it does the DIYer. This fiscal year-to-date, we have opened just over 90 new commercial programs and expect to end the year with approximately 150 new programs. International continued to perform well for us. We still expect to grow our international store base in both countries as we see years of opportunity ahead of us. And we continue to refine and experiment with our omni-channel efforts during the quarter. We standardized our pricing across the Internet and stores by discontinuing the aggressive promotional discount for ship-to-home items only. We've been concerned that offering different promotional offers to customers based on how they wanted their products fulfilled had the potential to create a channel conflict. As we look to the future, we see an environment where the distinction of online and offline gets very blurred. Our omni-channel efforts are focused on interacting with the customer through their preferred means, in store, online, over the telephone via their mobile device, and then fulfilling that order to meet the customers\u2019 desires and timeline in the most cost-effective manner. And as some of you have noticed, we've also begun to test improved delivery speeds to home customers in select market. Across all sectors of the economy, companies are testing new ways to enhance the customer experience. We too are working on a variety of fronts, some will work some won't. But in this age of innovation, it is imperative that we continue to find new ways to improve the customer experience and deepen our relationships with our customers. We will share more specifics about this test and others as we learn, adjust and then ultimately implement. Today, our online ship-to-home business is quite small relative to the sales of the enterprise, but seizing the discount we had a negative impact on our sales, which also negatively impacted our overall same-store sales. Look, our goal isn\u2019t to get this balance right today, but to learn how best to leverage all of our assets and capabilities over time to strengthen our overall value proposition. In last quarter\u2019s press release, we produced an adjustment to our GAAP numbers for the divestiture of two businesses. This quarter the sale of these two businesses had a nominal impact on our operating profit. But given the nature of the business, it did benefit our gross margins by approximately 40 basis points. Initially, our tax rate came in at 27.2%, below our previous expectations at the beginning of the quarter. We expect a rate in the range of 27% to 28% in Q4, and a lower rate next year as the full year lower federal tax rate is taken into account. Beginning at the start of our fiscal 2019, we will begin recognizing the full benefit of the changes and expect our ongoing global tax rate to be around 24.5%. Overall, we expect the Tax Reform Act will benefit net income by over $200 million on an annual basis, realized over fiscal 2018 and 2019. As we considered enhancement and profitability to the enterprise due to lower corporate tax rates, we discussed during our second quarter conference call, proactively investing some of these proceeds in an effort to improve our business for the long term. We highlighted investing in wages and benefits to maintain our competitiveness with other retailers and investments in technology to improve our service levels across DIY and commercial, both with an enhanced omni-channel emphasis. Some of these investments are pull forwards of what has been contemplated in our long-term strategic plan. We\u2019ve begun to accelerate some of our technological investments, but that will take some time. As for wages, we continue to monitor market conditions and plan on executing our changes in our first quarter of next year in conjunction with our normal annual evaluation process. Our enhancements will be focused on our more knowledgeable and tenured hourly AutoZoners. As this investment is unique, we want to add more clarity to you. We are modeling SG&A dollar growth to be in the 4% to 5% range over last year in our fourth quarter. We are in the later stages of developing our operating plan for fiscal 2019. But based on our latest thinking, our expectation is that SG&A would grow in the 6.5% to 7.5% range. And as the wage adjustments will not become effective until the second half of our first quarter 2019 that quarter will not bear the full burden of those changes. The wage changes are designed to ensure we can attract and retain terrific, knowledgeable AutoZoners, and to make sure our wages are competitive. The technology investments are designed to grow sales. Regarding our internal initiatives, and specifically continually improving inventory availability at the market level, we continue to see a nice pickup in sales from the markets with mega hub capabilities. Mega hub stores are our stores with approximately 100,000 unique SKUs and provide delivery to surrounding stores and other hubs. As our plan dictated this quarter, we opened three additional mega hubs, ending with 21 and are on track to have 25 locations opened by the end of the fiscal year. Additionally, I would like to recognize our supply chain team for leveraging our warehouse delivery cost yet again this quarter, while starting up a new distribution center in Ocala, Florida. This mark the third sequential quarter where we have leveraged our cost. And while we continue to be mindful of fuel cost increases and driver labor shortages across several carriers, we remain encouraged with the direction of our businesses costs are headed over the remainder of the calendar 2018. As noted earlier, we saw solid performance in our commercial business sales results in Q3. Total commercial sales increased 7.3% for the quarter. We continue to grow our business much faster than the overall industry by executing on our game plan. With fewer year-over-year program openings, more of our sales growth is coming from existing customers or new customers in older programs. We believe our inventory availability work is vital to these efforts and is enhancing our position in the market. I continue to give credit for our commercial performance to our store AutoZoners who are simply getting better at running our model. Commercial relationships take time to cultivate, and we are encouraged with their efforts. Turning to our online efforts, and specifically in regards to helping our commercial customers, we are making investments to further enhance our digital capabilities. Our investments in technology are expected to help our customers get the parts they need faster. We will continue to invest in our omni-channel strategies to ensure we can conduct business with our customers in the manner that best fits their needs and desires. On the cost front, I\u2019ve highlighted the past few quarters the impacts we are experiencing from accelerated pressure on wages. Those pressures continue to exist and are much more than historical norms. The regulatory changes are going to continue as evidenced by the areas that have already passed legislation to increase their wages substantially over the next few years. And more impactful are the current market forces in retail as we all compete for talented employees in a very low unemployment environment. We are constantly working diligently to find new innovations to better manage our cost structure and those efforts will continue. We believe this particular area will continue to pressure us for some extended period of time, which is why we are proactively leveraging a portion of the benefits derived from the recent tax law changes to invest in this incredibly important aspect of our business, our AutoZoners. Our management team remains committed to managing this business for the long term to provide great service for our customers and great opportunity for our AutoZoners; ultimately, delivering strong shareholder value. We operate in an industry driven by in many cases inelastic demand. If the part breaks or wares out, our customers need to fix it to get to work and get on with their lines. Because this predictability based on miles driven and an aging car population, we remain committed to continually improving our ability to aid customers in saying yes to their needs. Now, let me provide more detail on the quarter. For the quarter, our sales increased 1.6% and our domestic same-store sales were up 0.6%. During the quarter, we opened 26 net new stores in the U.S. and our commercial business opened 38 programs. Year-to-date, we opened 75 net new stores and 91 commercial programs in the United States, 12 new stores in Mexico and two stores in Brazil. We expect to open approximately 150 new domestic stores, 40 in Mexico and approximately 10 in Brazil for a total of 200. And we expect to open about 150 net new domestic commercial programs. Currently, 85% of our domestic stores have a commercial program. Along with improving our local parts availability and assortment, we continue to manage this organization to provide exceptional service for our customers, provide our AutoZoners with a great place to work with opportunities for advancement and ensure we do it on a long-term profitable basis to provide strong returns for our shareholders. We will continue to in stress the importance of going the extra mile to fulfill our customers\u2019 needs regardless of how difficult the request. With our commitments to service intact, we continued to be shared gainers over the quarter according to the data we have available to us. Now, let me review our highlights regarding execution of our ongoing operating theme from 2017 that we carried over into 2018. Yes, we\u2019ve got it; the key priorities for the year are, great people providing great service; profitably growing our commercial business; leveraging the Internet, yes, we\u2019ve got it; and leveraging IT. On the retail front this past quarter under the great people providing great service theme, we are committed to supporting our store AutoZoners. We\u2019re focusing on enhanced training to store level AutoZoners and increasing the share of voice regarding availability with the yes, we've got theme. We remain aggressive with our technology investments and believe these initiatives will help differentiate us on a go forward basis. We realize as customers have become much more tech and mobile savvy, we have to have a sales proposition that touches all the ways they desire to interact with us. Our current and future technology investments will lead to sales growth across all of our businesses. We should also highlight another strong performance in return on invested capital, as we were able to finish our third quarter at 30.8%. We continue to be pleased with this metric as it is one of the best, if not the best, in all of hard lines retailing. This metric is a key component of our pay-for-performance culture at AutoZone, and we demand our AutoZoners across the organization be accountable for our investment decisions. Great ideas look wonderful on paper, but it's our job to deliver results. We are always learning from both successes and failures in our investments. Our primary focus has been and continues to be that we ensure every incremental dollar of capital that we deploy in this business to provide an acceptable return well in excess of our cost of capital. It is important to reinforce that we will always maintain our diligence regarding capital stewardship as the capital we invest is our investors\u2019 capital. Before I pass the discussion over to Bill Giles to talk about our financial results, I\u2019d like to thank our AutoZoners for their efforts to continue to meet our customers\u2019 vehicle needs. This is not easy. I see everyday what customers expect from our AutoZoners, and they meet those needs with a smile on their face. Their efforts make our Company what it is today. We are bullish on our fourth quarter sales potential, because we have a great business operated by an exceptional team. Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Bill Giles. Bill Giles : Thanks, Bill and good morning everyone. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to talk more specifically about our retail, commercial and international results for the quarter, total auto part sales, which includes our domestic international stores, increased 3.2%. For the trailing 52 weeks ended, total sales per domestic AutoZone store were $1,785,000. Total commercial sales increased 7.3%. In the quarter, commercial represented 20% of our total sales and grew $37 million over last year's Q3. We opened 38 net new programs in the quarter, and we now have our commercial program in 4,683 stores or 85% of our domestic stores, supported by 192 hub stores. For all of fiscal 2018, we expect to open approximately 150 new commercial programs. As Bill mentioned earlier, we remain confident we will continue to gain market share with our commercial customers. We are encouraged by the initiatives we have in place and feel we can further grow sales and market share. Our Mexico stores continue to perform well. We opened four new stores during the third quarter and year-to-date opened 12. We ended the quarter with 536 stores and we expect to open approximately 40 new stores in fiscal 2018. And currency volatility remains significant and causes us to be deliberate with our pace of investment. Moves in foreign currency rate of greater than 5% from one quarter to the next are common. Regarding Brazil, we did not open any new stores and now have 16 total stores open. Our plans are to add eight more locations over the remainder of fiscal year. While still running with an operating loss, our performance has improved and gives us optimism about the long-term future of this market. As we further scale the business, we will improve operating performance. Long-term, we believe this market has the potential to be much larger than Mexico. Gross margin for the quarter was 53.5% of sales, up 86 basis points from last year's third quarter. The gross margin rate benefited from higher merchandise margins and the sale of the two business units. While we continue to be optimistic on gross margin rate for the remainder of fiscal 2018, our primary focus remains growing absolute gross profit dollars in our business. SG&A for the quarter was 33% of sales, deleveraging 56 basis points. Operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, were higher than last year, primarily due to deleverage on occupancy cost and increased store payroll. Earnings differentials and taxes for the quarter was $546 million in the third quarter. Interest expense for the quarter was $42 million compared to $36 million in Q3 a year ago. Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $4,955 million. Our adjusted debt level metric finished the quarter at 2.5 times EBITDAR, while in any given quarter, we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on management's opinion regarding debt and equity market conditions. We remain committed to both our investment-grade rating and our capital allocation strategy, and share repurchases are an important element that strategy. For the quarter, our tax rate was 27.2% and 27.3% excluding the slight benefit received from exercising of stock options. We expect our global tax rate to approximate 27% to 28% for Q4 and around 24.5% for fiscal 2019. I should mention the accounting for stock options this quarter benefitted our overall effective rate by a small degree, 8 basis points or $0.01 per share, but this is very hard to model for you and ourselves. Any credits we receive are derived by stock option exercises that are determined at the discretion of our AutoZoners, as it\u2019s impossible to predict and can cause unusual comparisons year-over-year. Net income for the quarter was $367 million, up 10.6% versus Q3 last year. Our diluted share count of $27.3 million was down 5.8% from last year's third quarter. The combination of these factors drove earnings per share for the quarter to $13.42, up 17.3% over the prior year's third quarter. Looking to the cash flow statement. For the third quarter, we generated $503 million of operating cash flow. Net fixed assets were up 5.6% versus last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $112 million and reflected the additional expenditures required to open stores this quarter. Capital expenditures on existing stores, southern mega hub store remodels or openings, work on development of new stores for upcoming quarters, investments in our new and expanded domestic DCs and information technology investments. With the new stores open we finished this past quarter with 5,540 stores in 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. 536 stores in Mexico and 16 in Brazil, for a total AutoZone store count of 6,092. Depreciation totaled $79.8 million for the quarter versus last year's third quarter expense of $75.3 million. This is generally in line with recent quarter growth rates. We repurchased $400 million of AutoZone stock in the third quarter. At quarter end, we had $897 million remaining under our share buyback authorization and our leverage metric was 2.5 times. Again, I want to stress we managed to appropriate credit ratings and not any one metric. The metric we report is meant as a guide only as each rating firm has its own criteria. We continue to view our share repurchase program as an attractive capital deployment strategy. As evidence of this commitment, we just recently surpassed $1 billion in annual share repurchases for the 10th consecutive year, bringing our life to date share repurchases to $19 billion. Next, I'd like to update you on our inventory levels in total and on a per store basis. The Company's inventory increased 3.7% over the same period last year. Inventory per location was $650,000 versus $653,000 last year, and $671,000 just this past quarter. Net inventory defined as merchandise inventory plus accounts payable on a per location basis was negative $48,000 versus negative $47,000 last year and a negative $46,000 this past quarter. As a result, accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory, finished the quarter at 107.3%. I also want to update you that we recently decided to terminate our pension plan. Our pension plan was frozen at the end of calendar 2002. We expect to finalize the termination of the plan, including the transfer of plan assets and related liabilities to a third party. In connection with the termination, we anticipate taking a one-time non-cash charge of somewhere in the range of $130 million to $140 million in our fourth quarter. Again, this is entirely non-cash accounting charge and we are excited to terminate this plan and eliminate the risks and volatility that it could produce. Finally, as Bill previously mentioned, our continued discipline capital management approach resulted in return on invested capital for the trailing four quarters of 30.8%. We have and will continue to make investments that we believe will generate returns that significantly exceed our cost of capital. Now, I'll turn it back to Bill Rhodes. Bill Rhodes : Thanks Bill. As we head into the fourth quarter; we are encouraged by the traction we are gaining with internal sales initiatives; the investments we are making to improve customer service and product availability, the strength of our industry and the favorable macro trends; we are optimistic looking forward for the remainder of the selling season. We are excited to intensify our focus on our core businesses, because we see these core businesses as tremendously attractive and in strong markets. We will continue our domestic and international expansion efforts growing roughly 200 locations annually. We will continue to focus on growing our commercial business at an accelerated rate to the market growth. We will intensify our omni-channel efforts and we will leverage ALLDATA as the premier tool shops use in the automotive aftermarket. To execute at a high level, we have to consistently adhere to living the pledge. We cannot and will not take our eye off of execution. We must stay committed to executing day in and day out on our game plan. Success will be achieved with an attention to detail and exceptional execution. Our customers have choices and we must exceed their expectations in whatever way they choose to shop with us. We are fortunate to operate in one of the strongest retail segments, and we continue to be excited about our industry's growth prospects for 2018 and beyond. As consumers continually look to save money while taking care of their vehicles, we are committed to providing the trustworthy advice they expect. It truly is the value-add that differentiates us from any other faceless transaction. Customers have come to expect that advice from us. It is with this focus we will implement more enhancements on both our DIY and commercial Web sites and in-store experience, to provide even more knowledgeable service. We don't ever expect an online experience to replace the advice our customers want, but today's customers do expect more information from a variety of sources on repairing their vehicles. This aspect of service has always been our most important cultural cornerstone, and it will be long into the future. Our charge remains to optimize our performance regardless of market conditions and continue to ensure we are investing in the key initiatives that will drive our long-term performance. In the end, delivering strong EPS growth and ROIC each and every quarter is how we measure ourselves. This formula has been extremely successful over the last nearly 39 years, and we continue to be excited about our future. Now, we\u2019d like to open up the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now open up the queue for the question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Michael Lasser of UBS. Your line is open. Michael Lasser : Bill, so you mentioned that the quarter turned out a little faster than you expected. So if we assume that you anticipated 2% to 3% comp coming into the quarter, and it finished maybe 150 basis points or so below that. In your experience would you expect that you\u2019ll recruit half of that or more from the weather being delayed from last quarter into this quarter? Bill Rhodes : Yes, your general expectations of what we\u2019re anticipating coming in this quarter are about right. And I\u2019d go back to what we talked about in September. This industry, our sales over the last five years have traded in a very tight band. This summer we were a little bit disappointed by them. As we move into the fourth quarter, I don't know whether we\u2019ll recoup half of them or most of them. But as we look forward, we know that there is extensive deferred maintenance, particularly on the maintenance related parts. And that maintenance work is going to have to be done at some point in time. You could see some of it was done in the commercial side with the way they were working in garages, but we just didn't see the rebound in those under car categories that we would\u2019ve anticipated. Michael Lasser : And my quick follow-up question is on the SG&A growth outlook or 6% to 7% for next year, that on a 52 to 52 week basis. And is that going to be just a one-time increase next year or should we think about that as the new run rate for the business? Bill Giles : No, I think of it is more of a -- and I appreciate the clarification. So when you think about FY19 on that increase in SG&A that\u2019s a 52 to 52 week year comparison, and it excludes obviously those one-time items like the impairment charge in the pension plan termination, I think that's more one-time investment for us. Obviously, we\u2019re going to continue to make investments here and there. But those investments on wage rates and the benefits really to ensure that we've got the right AutoZoners in place and we\u2019ve get a great tenured hourly AutoZoners out there, and we want to make sure that we continue to maintain that and be competitive in the marketplace. So we think of that as more of a one-time investment, and then we\u2019ll be more on a normalized run rate from that point forward. I think the investment in technology will continue to help drive sales -- those enhancements continue to get implemented throughout the year. Bill Rhodes : Michael, I\u2019d like to add on that front too. If you recall back in 2006, we had a similar investment cycle. We were running about 17.5% operating margin at the time, and we felt like there were some things that we need to do to improve our execution for the long-term. And we invested about 50 basis points of margin at that point in time, and our margin went down to about 17. Of course over the next 10 years that improved up to about 19.4%. We envision this the same way. These are some things that we have opportunities to enhance our performance over the long term and feel comfortable doing them, but they\u2019re one time in nature. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Fassler of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Matt Fassler : A little more clarity on the investing, obviously, you have to divestiture of the two businesses that took place I think respectively at the beginning the quarter, and then for IMC towards the middle of the quarter. And those would presumably take some SG&A out of next year. So are we talking the specific guidance that you gave net of the reduction of SG&A for the sale of those businesses? Bill Giles : No, just to be perfectly clear, those SG&As to get reallocated those have business units for the most part really were but not really contribute a lot of EBIT necessarily. So we\u2019ll redeploy the assets that we have there both from an inventory perspective, as well as from an SG&A perspective as well. Matt Fassler : So in other words, as you sell those businesses and presumably they generated some SG&A, the SG&A does not go down to reflect the disappearance to those sales? Bill Giles : Not in the numbers that I\u2019m giving you, that\u2019s correct. Matt Fassler : And then also, if you think about the impact on operating margin overall and the operating margin outlook overall. What\u2019s your early thinking on gross margin? If you think about this particular quarter, your gross margin was up 8 basis points to 36 basis points, 46 basis points, excluding the impact of that divestiture. So some of that momentum sustainable for the business going forward? Bill Giles : Yes, we feel really good about gross margin. I mean I think the merchandising organization has done a terrific job as far as improving the sourcing, reducing costs. The supply chain team has gotten through some assess the year on more frequent deliveries and we felt that stabilize. They\u2019ve done a terrific job of opening two distribution centers over the last year. So we feel pretty bullish about gross margin, both from a merchandising cost perspective, as well as supply chain as well. There is no question we\u2019re getting some headwinds on transportation costs on supply chain, but the team has done a terrific job of managing expenses and being able to actually leverage supply chain this past quarter. So outlook wise, we feel pretty confident. Matt Fassler : And then finally, do you have an IMC dollar sales number for this quarter just to clean it out of our models for that partial quarter contribution? Bill Giles : It was relatively small. I don't have it Matt off the top of my head. It\u2019s not a significant number. But we can -- we'll shoot that out at some point. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Christopher Horvers of J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open. Christopher Horvers : Also some follow-ups here on the prior questions. So in thinking about the recoup question, maybe you could give us a sense of what April look like for you relative to the total quarter. It looks like all the impact was pretty much seen on the DIY side of the business, which obviously is the preponderance of your business. But how did April look relative to the quarter? Bill Rhodes : The April looked -- it looked pretty tough in the first half of the week or first half of the month. The third week improved and then the fourth week was very, very strong. But the fourth week was the first time that we had really warm dry weather. And obviously, you can\u2019t straight-line warm dry weather all the way through the fourth quarter. But we were encouraged when the weather improved it met our expectations for what would happen in the business. Christopher Horvers : So is it fair to -- so likely I mean it would just mathematically turned negative in April. So for down like that last week of March to mid-April, if we\u2019re down one or two points, you would think that that's the upside potential or recapture potential as we think about the current quarter? Bill Giles : We\u2019ll wait and see as it turns out, there is no question. April was soft period and the weather wasn\u2019t in our favor. And I think you\u2019re hearing that from not just us but from others as well. And so what that means for the summer, we\u2019re bullish. We hope that that means more generation of sales from a lot of deferred maintenance that has transpired in the marketplace, but we\u2019ll have to wait and see and see how this shapes out. Christopher Horvers : And then two more follow-ups. So first, as you think about the benefit to gross margin from the divested business, is that state that 40 basis points pick around until we lapser it with? Bill Giles : That\u2019s roughly -- yes, that\u2019s about right. Christopher Horvers : And then a question for Bill Rhodes. So big picture for many years you did it to comp and you drove this low double-digit earnings growth algorithm with the half of that coming from share repurchases. Now with the lower tax rate, you just drove the high-teens earnings on a modestly positive comp. You talked about SG&A growth next year. But you get a big chunk of the tax savings next year as well. So I'm just trying to understand how you think about the return to the shareholder in terms of the earnings growth outlook balancing the tax benefit versus the acceleration of investment? Bill Rhodes : As you think about it, we\u2019ve said several times that we\u2019re going to recoup over $200 million net income on an annual basis. We\u2019re talking about investing less than half of that into the long-term aspects of our business. And we're very comfortable with where we\u2019re putting those dollars. We\u2019re really focused on two things wages of our hourly AutoZoners, the most tenured and most knowledgeable people that really help differentiate us in the marketplace. And we want to make sure that we are effectively compensating them in a environment. And then secondly, we\u2019re going to making some pretty significant investments in technology. Many of those are things we would have done, but we\u2019re accelerating our investments in technology somewhat because of this tax reform. And so we will have an expanded investment profile next fiscal year. But once we get beyond that, we feel like we\u2019ll be very good shaped. Christopher Horvers : And so do you feel comfortable with continuing to be able to drive a low double-digit type earnings growth algorithm? Bill Rhodes : I would anticipate, once we get on the other side of it that our EBIT growth would be in the 3% to 5% range, and it will depend somewhat on the cash flow that we\u2019re generating. And frankly, it depends a little bit on the multiples of stock as to how much the share repurchase program grants. There were periods of time we were generating $1.3 billion in share repurchases and that would mean 5% or 6%, and sometimes it\u2019s in 4%, 5%. So it somewhat depends on other factors as well. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Simeon Gutman of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Simeon Gutman : I want to focus on the commercial improvement. You mentioned, I think it was 7% and I think Bill Rhodes you implied that it was pretty steady throughout the quarter. Can you tell us if that 7% if there is a big range of growth rates during the quarter, or what that was? And you mentioned expanded inventory. I wonder if you can share more detail. Are you selling across newer categories, new customers? Is fulfillment making a difference, or is the fact that you\u2019re in stock the most important attribute? Bill Giles : You packed a lot of questions in there let me try to unpack them. Yes, 7.3% growth were commercial for the quarter, we felt pretty good about it. It was variable. It is also variable based upon week-to-week performance of the weather, but it is less variable than the DIY business. It too came out of the quarter pretty strong. As we think about the things that are driving that business, we\u2019ve made tremendous investments over the last three years in making sure that we have the right delivery frequency for our cost model and optimizing our cost model, and also expanding our mega hubs, we\u2019re up to 21 mega hubs now, looking it to be at 25 by the end of the year. Those mega hubs really give us enhanced access to hard-to-find inventory. And as we continue to roll them out, we see that the mega hub itself does very well. The local market that it serves is improved, and then even the other stores that are attached to other hubs see improvement. And then the other thing is our team, we\u2019ve spent a lot of time, particularly over the last two years, getting our in-store teams focused on the commercial business, store managers and district managers intensifying their focus on the commercial business. And I think all those things together are continuing to pay dividends, and will for an extended period of time. Simeon Gutman : My follow-up is just on the backdrop for the industry. And I am wondering, I guess the ultimate question is, if this summer will be the ultimate tail for this industry, whether demand is going to bounce back or it\u2019s not going to be as good as it was in the past. And I guess part of it, looking at the first quarter or this was your third, some months were good, some months were bad. I mean that just feels like it was par for the course, granted this -- the wet weather didn\u2019t help. But just curious, why should things get materially better from here? We think they will but want to get your thoughts, because the weather still seems to be the problem in what was a beginning of a cold quarter. So trying to think about the summer if this will be the ultimate tail for a better run rate? Bill Giles : I would hate to say one quarter is the ultimate tail for the run rate for our industry. This industry, as you very well know Simeon, it has been robust for 20 or 30 years. I did a presentation last week to our vendors at the Vendors Summit and talked about the 20-year run rate of this industry. And the fact that the DIY marketing total has grown about 4% a year for 20 years, the commercial markets drove about 4.5% a year for 20 years, and that\u2019s a total growth that not a same store basis. And I\u2019ve said time-and-time again, I\u2019m disappointed with a 0.6 comp, but it\u2019s not a minus 6 comp. I mean we\u2019re continuing to trade within a pretty tight band. Look back over the last five years of the quarterly performance in it trades 3 to minus 1 or so, minus 1.8 I think. So I just don\u2019t think that it\u2019s radically changing by stress of imagination. Operator : Our next question comes from Seth Basham with Wedbush. Your line is open. Seth Basham : Just thinking about the SG&A growth outlook, Bill, as you contemplated it when you spoke to us last year looking for 60 to 90 basis points of margin pressure from investments. Based on that that looks like you're expecting more pressure than. What\u2019s changed between then and now as you think about the outlook? Bill Rhodes : I would say not much. I would say that it\u2019s relatively consistent with the way we looked at it before. And in fact, most of the numbers are coming in pretty close to where we had originally expected them to. And we\u2019ve always looked at this wages, benefit technology. I think we\u2019re relatively consistent on talking about those items sustain to places for which we are investing. There\u2019s a handful of other ones that are less significant. But I would say for the most part the investments that we have lined up for next year are pretty consistent with the way we had thought about it. And now the timing is a little bit different. We probably will implement more of them as Bill talked about in the middle of the first quarter, our fiscal first quarter to coincide with merit increases. But other than that, I would say it\u2019s been relatively consistent. Seth Basham : As you think about the break down between benefits, wages and tech, what is that approximately? Bill Rhodes : I would say that wages and benefits are the lion share. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Seth Sigman of Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Seth Sigman : A couple of follow-ups here, first in terms of the DIY comp. I guess it was down roughly 70 bps on our math at least. Obviously, you had a weather impact but also cited negative impact from the online promotional changes. Can you just give us a sense of how meaningful that may have been? Bill Giles : It\u2019s not terribly meaningful. It could be in the 20, 30 basis points range overall. Our online ship-to-home business is not a very big business for us. And so we wanted to make sure that we were incentivizing our customers to interact with us regardless of the channels that they wanted. And so we make some changes and it negatively impacted the ship-to-home business, but it's not a big part of our overall business. Seth Sigman : And then on the SG&A, if I\u2019m specifically looking at the fourth quarter. Can you just help us bridge that 4% to 5% growth versus the 3% this past quarter? I guess, just what are the incremental drivers in the fourth quarter? Bill Giles : I think we\u2019ll probably continue to see a little bit of wage pressure from the market overall. We do have some of the technology investments that are coming in during the fourth quarter as well. So those are some of the pressure points. Seth Sigman : Just finally as I think about next year, given your positive comments around gross margin. Do you think that operating margin can actually be flat or even up with the investments you\u2019re making excluding the extra week? Bill Giles : I think excluding the extra week, we\u2019ll have to wait and see. We don't really want to give guidance on that relative to what our EBIT is going to be or even our operating margin. As I\u2019ve mentioned before, we feel good about gross margin. The organization has done a good job from a sourcing perspective from merchandising and reducing cost, team has done a good job. Obviously, we have some investments that we're going to undertake in SG&A, and we think that'll create momentum in the business. Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from Elizabeth Suzuki from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Elizabeth Suzuki : Can you just talk about what you're seeing in inflation, and whether that benefit is starting to come through in the top line or in gross margins at all? Bill Rhodes : I don't think we're seeing any significant impacts from inflation at this point in time. Obviously, oil prices have started to move up of late, and we're mindful of that. But so far, we haven't seen any material impacts of that. As you know, we dealt with inflationary impacts over long periods of time and our industry and particularly our AutoZoners have been able to handle it pretty well. Elizabeth Suzuki : So even inflation in terms of the product itself and price inflation, you're not seeing any of that yet? Bill Rhodes : It's not terribly material. We see pushes and pulls. As you know, we have a significant effort going on to direct source, and that also helping lower our acquisition cost. Elizabeth Suzuki : And then a longer-term question, I mean what do you see as the most important drivers going forward in 2019 and 2020 that really gives you confidence that the domestic sales rate can get back to those mid-single digit rates you talked about, or just that average over the last 20 years. Because if things aren't radically changing, what do you think are the catalysts that get things going again from the 1% range back up into mid single digits? Bill Rhodes : I think, number one, we control our own destiny. And I have a high degree of confidence in our team to continue to deliver. We've got some really exciting initiatives that we're working on. I think the biggest driver of our performance over the long term is going to be how do we perform in commercial. It is the single biggest growth opportunity that we have in front of us today, we got about 3% market share. We're still pretty immature in that business and we got a lot of things that we're working on to improve that business. And they're showing that we're gaining traction. So I continue to be very bullish about this business over the long period of time. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt McClintock from Barclays. Your line is open. Matt McClintock : I'd actually like to focus on the comment about strengthening the overall value proposition, and really focusing online. Clearly, you don't believe price or those promotions were part of that value proposition and you're talking about investments to strengthen that, and I'm just trying to understand the disconnect between that. What can you do now that you couldn't do before online to strengthen that value proposition that allows you to wean yourself off of price and/or promotions? And number two, why is all this coming through right now, what was the driver behind this change? Thanks. Bill Rhodes : The driver to us is -- if you think about over the long term, where is this headed. How are you going to determine whether a transaction is online or offline? It's not going to be online or offline. It could be over the phone, it\u2019d be over the mobile device or your desktop, it's how are we going to be interacting with customers. And we want to make sure that we don't create channel conflicts. We feel like our value proposition is incredible, and we feel like a big part of that is the knowledge and trustworthy advice that our AutoZoners deliver to their customers, and be that over the phone, be that over chat, be that in the store. And we want to make sure that we're incentivizing our customers to engage with us. And we don't want to create channel conflicts. So that\u2019s what drove our decision. Operator : Our next question comes from Kate McShane of Citi. Your line is open. Kate McShane : My first question was just with regards to what you\u2019re seeing with the competitive response when you open a mega hub, or maybe more specifically. Have you seen any change in the competitive response as you open more? Bill Rhodes : I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen any competitive changes as a result of opening individual mega hubs. And all of us in the industry are taking different tactics. If one of our competitors opens a new distribution center, we don\u2019t change our operating model in that market, and I haven\u2019t seen any material changes across any of the markets where we\u2019ve opened these mega hubs. Kate McShane : And then my second question is about wages. I just wondered if you had any more detail about where the planned increase just like new and productive among other retailers. And just how are you finding the stable market for us those that you want to hire? Bill Rhodes : I think the labor market is continues to get tighter, so we\u2019ve gotten further into the economic cycle. We\u2019re at very, very low historical unemployment rate and we make no mistake about -- we\u2019re continuing to hire great people every day. Our turnover rate is down slightly, so it's not like we\u2019re dealing with a catastrophic situation. We\u2019re just trying to make sure that we continue to stay up in front of this situation. If you look at the regulatory environments, California and certain parts of the Northeast, you can clearly see what's in front of us from what those regulatory environment changes are going to be. The bigger question is, and you read all the retailer announcements of what they\u2019re doing with wages this year or over the last two years, or what they\u2019re going to be doing over the next couple of years. It is imperative that our AutoZoners be such an important part of our value proposition that we make sure that we\u2019ve got the best people, and we\u2019re going to make sure we continue to compensate them comparatively. Operator : Our next question comes from Zack Fadem of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Zack Fadem : I wanted to follow-up on your comment on oil prices. And just given your perspective, is there a high watermark for fuel price in which miles driven and that sales start to see negative impact? And with $72 oil today, I am curious where do you think we are on that demand elasticity curve? Bill Rhodes : What we\u2019ve seen over the long period of time, we talked about it publicly, is there seems to be a real tipping point around $4 a gallon, and we\u2019re long-long way from $4 a gallon today. But we\u2019ve had periods of time when we got there. And clearly, we saw impacts in miles driven during those periods of time. But we\u2019re a long way from $4 a gallon. Zack Fadem : And when you think about the work you\u2019ve done on inventory availability. Could you talk us through some of the incremental benefits that you typically see when you open a new mega hub? And also with the new DCs coming on as well, could you walk us through just general expectations for sales lift given the better anticipated availability? Bill Rhodes : I wouldn\u2019t say that the distribution centers are designed to really drive, they\u2019re designed to drive improvements in cost, because they\u2019re going to be servicing closer areas, so you\u2019re reducing the stem miles. But they\u2019ll have slight improvements in service but those will be a little bit -- orders will get there a little bit quicker, so it\u2019s really a more of a cost efficiency play. When you think about expanded coverage, our strategy on that is our mega hubs, and our mega hubs would carry close to 100,000 SKUs. As we open those, we significantly improve the yes percentage, our ability to say yes to our customers in those stores. And we always, always see a significant improvement in both retail and commercial in that store sales. And those stores generally are leveraging that 100,000 SKUs over 20 to 30 other stores that are in their hub network, if you will. And they\u2019re delivering those parts for those stores three times a day, and we see significant growth in those stores. Then those mega hubs are also going to service -- some them don\u2019t service any more hubs and several of them service four to six to eight additional hubs, and those can be on a same day or overnight basis. But we see improvements in sales by every store that\u2019s touched by the mega hubs. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bret Jordan of Jefferies. Your line is now open. Bret Jordan : On your test of free next day delivery, did you get anything from that? Is that something you're going to expand, and did it meaningfully drive the online sales in those markets? Bill Rhodes : As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we\u2019re testing a variety of different things. And I appreciate the fact that you guys are so observant that you caught on to this test. But I don\u2019t want to make a big deal out of it yet, because it\u2019s early in our test and we\u2019re trying to watch the different things to make sure that we can service our customers. The one thing that we know is speed of delivery matters. And so we\u2019re working on ways that we can deliver to our customers as quickly as possible, and that\u2019s one of the elements that we\u2019re testing. Let us get a little bit along in the test and then we\u2019ll give you more clarity about where it is and what our plans are. Bret Jordan : Did you get a commercial customer by end of that program, I mean given the fact that it\u2019s quicker than your average online transaction. Did you see that it shifted beyond DIY at all? And then just as a follow up question on that commercial. In the commercial growth that you saw, which is pretty strong. Could you just talk whether there was a bias of smaller shop or national account focus there? Bill Rhodes : I would say, we\u2019ll continue to perform very well both what we call the up and down the street and the national accounts, so we feel very good about both of them. As far as whether or not the commercial customers taking advantage of the next day delivery program, I am sure some of them are, that\u2019s not what it\u2019s designed to do. And you got to remember, we\u2019re delivering to these commercial customers usually in 30 minutes, next day would be a significant deterioration in service, so that\u2019s really designed for the DIY customers. Bret Jordan : Just wondering whether hard-to-find parts mix might on a next day delivery be something you could ship to commercial customers? Obviously, you\u2019re not going to stock everything in your store about 30 minutes. Bill Rhodes : That\u2019s a great point, Bret. But let's go back to what we were just talking about on the mega hubs. So the mega hubs have that extensive parts covered. So it\u2019s not hard-to-find part, it\u2019s generally to come out of that mega hub and they can get there sooner than next day in most cases. Operator : Our next question from Gregory Melich from MoffettNathanson. Your line is open. Mike Montani : This is Mike Montani on for Greg, just quickly. Can you clarify for the quarter, was transaction count positive or negative? Bill Giles : Transaction count was down for the quarter little bit, but we continue to have good performance in our average transaction value. Mike Montani : And then just in terms of the reinvestment from the tax savings. We were initially thinking like 35% to 50% reinvestment so obviously, majority retention. And just quickly doing some math here, I am getting the inverse of that now. Can you just help me understand did anything actually change there from your perspective on retention versus reinvestment, or is that just kind of a mix\u2026 Bill Giles : That\u2019s just really consistent, I think on that one. I think that the dollar amounts are pretty consistent. As we said, we\u2019ve got about $200 million worth of benefit from the tax reform act, and that probably a little less than half of that would be reinvested back in the business, and a little more than half of that would go back to shareholders. Operator : Thank you. As of this time, there are no further questions. So I want to turn the call back to the speakers. Please proceed. Bill Rhodes : Thank you. Before we conclude the call, I would like to wish everyone a nice Memorial Day weekend and thank everyone that has served in our Armed Forces. We\u2019re excited about our growth prospects for this year. We will not take anything for granted as we understand our customers have alternatives with a solid plan for future success. But I want to stress that this is a marathon and not a sprint. As we continue to focus on the basics and focus on optimizing long-term shareholder value, we are confident AutoZone will continue to be successful. Thank you for participating in today's call. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you. And that conclude today's conference. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",

Bill Rhodes : Good morning and thank you for joining us today for AutoZone\u2019s 2018 fourth quarter conference call. With me today are Bill Giles, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax. Regarding the fourth quarter, I hope you had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter\u2019s results. If not, the press release along with slides complementing our comments today, are available on our website www.autozoneinc.com. Please click on quarterly earnings conference calls to see them. To begin this morning, I want to thank all AutoZoners across the company for their hard work, dedication and commitment this past quarter and year. Our sales results for the fiscal fourth quarter improved from last quarter with May and August outperforming June and July and all months experienced positive comp store sales in both retail and commercial. Sales results as many of you would expect were stronger in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic and Midwestern markets and our harsh winter created parts failures in these markets. Our sales results, however, were noticeably below our expectations in several Western markets. We attribute this sluggishness out west to comparatively mild and rainy weather for much of the summer versus last year. Our sales performance improved, we have certainly felt we had opportunities to do even better. We executed a significant amount of changes in the second half of fiscal 2018 including product category changeovers, supply chain changes and we stopped our digital ship-to-home promotions. In hindsight, this was a tremendous amount of simultaneous change and our execution while terrific in many areas didn\u2019t meet our standard of flawless and negatively impacted our business. As we enter the new fiscal year most of these are behind us, we are improving quickly. While we continued to gain share, the more robust market share gains we experienced in the first half of the fiscal year subsided in the second half and we are committed to regaining that momentum very quickly. We remain encouraged by the health of the consumer and the health of our business. We are bullish on our business for the New Year. We continued to make good progress on our initiatives that are aimed at improving our ability to say yes to our customers more frequently, drive traffic to our stores and accelerate our commercial business. To remind everyone those initiatives for the past year included improving local market inventory availability, growing our U.S. commercial business, leveraging the Internet and investing in IT at accelerated rates across the entire enterprise.  Regarding enhancing parts coverage in the United States, we continued expanding our supply chain network in the quarter adding three new mega hub stores and 78 new stores. In addition to opening two new domestic distribution centers over the last five quarters and expanding another, we are extensively leveraging our hub network to provide expanded parts coverage at the local level where the customer demands are immediate. As you would expect we study our sales results in markets that receive additional parts coverage with hubs and we see noticeable increases in comp store sales when we open these locations. We rely on our mega hubs to act as distribution nodes for hard-to-find parts for their network stores. We ended the year with 24 mega hubs, have been very pleased with their performance and expect to open many more in fiscal 2019. In our commercial business, we saw our best quarterly sales performance since Q1 2016 improving nearly 9% while having opened fewer than 150 net commercial programs for the year. Our productivity for commercial program was very strong year-over-year. We were encouraged that this growth was from both winning more business with existing customers and gaining new customers. We are gaining momentum driving more sales through existing programs and customers, while still adding new customers all along the way. And our accelerated investments in technological enhancements to improve our service and grow all of our businesses continues at a strong clip. We are investing at the highest levels ever for our company to deliver on some pretty aggressive internally established goals. One of those goals that we have been focusing on is next-day delivery. At quarter end customers in 83 major metropolitan markets can place in order as late as 10 PM and have their orders delivered by early afternoon the next day. Our expectation is the majority of our shipped home orders will be fulfilled this way in the future. Although this is not a significant part of our sales mix today, it is growing rapidly and we believe it\u2019s another example of providing wow customer service and enhancing our value proposition to our customers. As we gain confidence in our ability to execute we will begin more aggressively advertising this unique and differentiated service offering. Before getting into more detail about the quarter I want to share our perspective on some of the trends and tailwinds that our industry and specifically our business have seen. First, the customer appears to be getting healthier and the rebound in our industry sales this summer illustrated that improvement. Some of this stems from the cold winter in a large part of the country that in turn increased demand of failure and maintenance related parts. Our business in cold weather markets easily outperformed the remainder of the country with the spread in comp sales between 200 basis points and 300 basis points throughout the quarter. Surprisingly, we did not do as well out west, with comp sales noticeably weaker than other parts of the United States. We can attribute some of this weakness to a milder summer than last year, but we also believe we have some considerable opportunities for improvement. As I had said earlier, our quarter began very well in May. However, it softened in June and July only to reaccelerate again in August. While our overall sales improved for the quarter, we believe they should have been more robust. We had some significant vendor transitions in the second half of our fiscal year and several of those transitions did not go as planned, resulting in unacceptable in-stock positions and sales shortfalls in those particular categories. We have addressed those challenges and feel we are better positioned heading into the new fiscal year. We also believe once these transitions are successfully completed we will be in improved competitive positions. And as we opened our Ocala distribution center, re-optimized our supply chain and implemented our final multiple frequency of delivery schedule changes that too was a significant amount of change for the organization to absorb and we decided back in February, at the end of our second fiscal quarter, to eliminate online promotions for ship-to-home sales. We were concerned about the potential channel conflict. After several months of being dark in promos, while competitors continued to promote, we became concerned that we potentially were or could negatively impact our customers\u2019 value proposition of us. As a result of eliminating promotions, those direct sales went from adding about 10 basis points to our comp to becoming a headwind in the quarter of roughly 30 basis points or approximately 40 basis points lower comp in the second half of the year. While we were intentional with our removal of the promotions and believe long-term it may create more channel conflict, we recently reinstituted promotions to better assess their overall impact on traffic both online and in-store and overall sales. Combined, all these various issues negatively impacted our sales performance in the quarter. While we will never flawlessly execute in every aspect of our business, this quarter we believe we had a disproportionate amount of opportunities and believe we have resolved most of them as we begin the new year. Over the last year, we have been highlighting accelerated wage pressures and the impact those pressures have on our operating expenses in the upcoming year. We plan on investing in wages for targeted positions across our hourly store teams this fall with specific emphasis on the most critical positions and our most tenured AutoZoners. It is important to note, those wages changes will go into effect midway through this, our first quarter of fiscal 2019. It is also important to note that means the first full quarter with the incremental expense will be our second quarter, which is always our most challenging profitability quarter. In addition, we accelerated our investments in employee benefits and information technology. These investments will cause operating expenses as a percent of sales to increase. However, we do expect these investments over the long-term to improve our performance. In fiscal 2018, our results included many moving pieces, the sale of two businesses and related impairments, the new tax law and this quarter, the termination of our pension plan and related settlement charge. Our expectation for 2019 is it will include far fewer unusual items or moving pieces. However, it will include two significant items. In fiscal 2018, we enjoyed only a portion of the lower effective tax rates as our fiscal year straddled the tax reform changes. Next year, we will receive the full benefit and our blended tax rate will decline from roughly 30% to closer to 24.5%. Additionally, we will have a 53rd week and our fourth quarter will include 17 weeks instead of the typical 16 weeks. To model the extra week, I encourage you to review fiscal 2013 and specifically the fourth quarter. We broke out the financials for that week in our earnings release showing how the extra week contributed to the quarter. To conclude my comments on the macro economy, I would say the consumer is healthy and we think 2019 can be a solid year for us and our industry. Now, let me provide more detail on the quarter. For the quarter, our sales increased 1.3% and our domestic same-store sales were up 2.2%. During the quarter, we opened 78 net new stores in the United States. For the year, we opened 153 net new stores and expect to open approximately 150 domestic stores in 2019. Our commercial business expanded by 8.8%, while opening 149 net new programs this year. Our commercial growth accelerated from last quarter\u2019s 7.3%. We again expect to open approximately 150 net new commercial programs for this fiscal year. Currently, 85% of our domestic stores have a commercial program. During the quarter, we continued to expand in Mexico, opening 28 new stores and we opened 4 new stores in Brazil. While we would hope to have up to 25 Brazil locations open by the end of the year, we expect these stores to open in fiscal 2019. We have been doing business in Brazil since 2013 and we expect to accelerate our location expansions in 2019. Regarding the internet, we will continue to invest in our capabilities and customer experience. Our goal is to create a seamless omni-channel experience for our customers, meeting them where, when and how they want to interact with us. We remain focused on improving our closure rates meaning converting customer requests for pricing and availability into sales. In the spirit of satisfying our customers, we are making ongoing system investments and enhancements to capture data about our customers\u2019 shopping patterns across all of our platforms both domestically and internationally. We understand we must be able to share information and process seamlessly between our stores, commercial shops, phone and online experiences to meet all of our customers\u2019 needs. We expect our loyalty program and its vast membership to continue to help us mine customer shopping behaviors and grow sales materially in the future. This remains a significant focus for us in 2019. As our primary objective remains growing our domestic retail and commercial businesses, we continued with our inventory availability initiatives to respond to the ever increasing challenge of parts proliferation in this industry. This past quarter, we opened 3 additional mega hub locations and now have 24 in operation. We are working diligently on the development of future sites and we expect to open approximately 10 more in 2019. We now expect to ultimately operate a larger number of hubs and mega hubs than we previously planned. This number will evolve over time. However, we feel a hub network for us is the most efficient way to provide enhanced local market availability. Along with improving our local parts availability and assortment, we continue to manage this organization to provide exceptional service for our customers, provide our AutoZoners with a great place to work, with opportunities for investment and ensure we do it on a long-term profitable basis to provide strong returns for our shareholders. We will continue to stress the importance of going the extra mile to fulfill our customers\u2019 needs regardless of how difficult the request. Regarding Mexico, we opened 28 new stores this quarter and ended the year with 564 stores. We are planning to open another 40 stores next year. In the local currency, Mexico experienced a solid quarter, while the exchange rate was a headwind to the reported U.S. dollar sales. The peso exchange rate was 7.3% higher than last year\u2019s Q4 ending rate. Sales in our other businesses for the quarter were down 48% over last year\u2019s fourth quarter due to the divestiture of our AutoAnything business and lower e-commerce ship-to-home sales. As a reminder, our ALLDATA and e-commerce businesses make up this segment of sales. We recognized that most of our site traffic is providing information to our customers prior to purchase. And our e-commerce platform represents an important part of our omni-channel experience. We see customers doing lots of research to learn about the products and how to do repairs. While these businesses are small for us, the omni-channel experience is very important for our customer experience and we will continue to invest in this platform. With continued aging of the car population, we continue to be optimistic regarding trends for the industry both in DIY and DIFM. As new vehicle sales are near all-time highs and gas prices while higher than last year remain range sound in the $2.80 a gallon area, miles driven continue to increase. We not surprisingly desire lower gas prices as the lower end consumer benefits the most from lower gas prices relative to income. There have also been many questions about the impact tariffs could have on our business in 2019. Up to this point, we have not experienced material cost increases from tariffs. As for those SKUs impacted, we have successfully passed the cost along in higher retails. However, a larger number of tariffs are slated to be imposed in the next couple of weeks. These tariffs should be more significant. In the short-term, we expect to be able to manage our way through any changes and we continue to expect to ultimately pass these costs along as the entire industry would be affected similarly. Regarding commercial, we opened 58 net new programs during the quarter for 149 for the year. This was down from last year\u2019s 202 open programs. Our expectation is we will continue to open new programs in the range of 150 in 2019. As we continue to improve our product assortments and availability and as we make other refinements to our commercial offerings, we expect that our sales potential from this market will grow. Commercial continues to be the most significant mid-term growth opportunity for the company as we currently have approximately 3% market share and we are determined to substantially grow that over time. We should also highlight another strong performance in return on invested capital as we were able to finish our fourth quarter at 32.1%. We continue to be pleased with this metric as it is one of the best in all of hard lines retail. However, our primary focus has been and continues to be, that we ensure every incremental dollar of capital that we deploy in this business provides an acceptable return well in excess of our cost to capital. It is important to reinforce that we will always maintain our diligence regarding capital stewardship as the capital we invest is our investors\u2019 capital. Before I pass the discussion over to Bill Giles to talk about our financial results, I would like to thank and reinforce how appreciative we are to our entire team\u2019s efforts to continue to meet and exceed our customers\u2019 wants, needs and desires. All credit goes to our AutoZoners as we could not achieve our goals without their exceptional efforts they give each and every day. We are bullish about 2019 sales potential, because we have a great business operated by exceptional AutoZoners. Now, I will turn the call over to Bill Giles. Bill Giles : Thanks, Bill and good morning everyone. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to talk more specifically about our retail, commercial and international results for the quarter. For the quarter, total auto parts sales, which include our domestic retail and commercial business and our Mexico and Brazil stores, increased 3%. For the trailing 52 weeks ended, total sales per AutoZone store were $1,778,000. For the quarter, total commercial sales increased 8.8%. In the fourth quarter, commercial represented 21% of our total sales versus 20% last year and grew $59 million over last year\u2019s fourth quarter. This past quarter, we opened 58 net new programs versus 99 new programs opened in our fourth quarter of last fiscal year. We now have commercial program in 4,741 stores or 84% of our domestic stores supported by 198 hub stores. In 2019, we expect to open again approximately 150 new programs. As Bill mentioned a moment ago, we remain focused on growing this business. We are committed to having a great sales team supplemented with a stronger engagement of our store managers and district managers. We remain confident with the initiatives that we have and will have in place and we expect we will continue to gain market share in this sector. Our Mexico stores continued to perform well on a local currency basis. We opened 28 new stores during the fourth quarter. At the end of the quarter, we had 564 stores in Mexico. We again expect to open approximately 40 new stores in fiscal 2019. While the exchange rate worked against us this past quarter, the Mexico leadership team continues to do a fine job managing the base peso denominated business. Regarding Brazil, we opened 4 new stores and currently are operating 20 stores. Our plans are to grow an additional 19 stores over the next year. While Brazil is run at an operating loss, we are encouraged by the sales per store being generated. We expect Brazil will grow its store base and may even surpass Mexico\u2019s store count over time as we prove the operating model produces sufficient returns. For the quarter, gross profit as a percentage of sales was 53.6% versus 52.8% the same period last year. The increase in gross margin was attributable to the impact of the sale of two business units completed during the year and higher merchandise margins partially offset by higher supply chain cost. Our supply chain expense de-leverage was mainly due to diesel fuel costs being higher. However, there was some de-leverage from the opening of the new DC in Ocala, Florida. We continue to feel we can manage these expense categories throughout fiscal 2019. Our primary focus remains growing absolute gross profit dollars in our total auto parts segment. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales were 37% versus 32.6% same period last year. The increase was primarily due to the pension settlement charge of $130.3 million and domestic store payroll. While we incurred significant charges related to the termination of the pension plans in the quarter, we are pleased to have terminated our qualified and nonqualified pension plans, eliminated any future expenses related to those plans and most importantly eliminated all risk associated with the plan\u2019s asset performance. Our team worked at this very hard and did a terrific job on this endeavor. While our reported EBIT for Q4 is $591 million, our adjusted EBIT calculated by removing the charges related to termination of the pension plans for the quarter was $722 million, up 2% over last year\u2019s fourth quarter. Our adjusted EBIT margin was 20.3%. Interest expense for the quarter was $54.3 million compared with $51.4 million in Q4 a year ago. The higher expense was due to higher rates we are seeing on our variable rate debt. Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $5 billion or approximately $75 million less than last year\u2019s balance. Our adjusted debt level metrics finished the quarter at 2.5x EBITDAR, while in any given quarter we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on management\u2019s opinion regarding debt and equity market conditions. We remain committed to both our investment grade rating and our capital allocation strategy and share repurchases are an important element of that strategy. For the quarter our tax rate was 25.4% versus last year\u2019s Q4 of 33.9% and as Bill said earlier on the call we expect the tax rate of approximately 24.5% in 2019. Net income for the quarter decreased 7.7% over the same period last year to $400 million while diluted earnings per share decreased 1.6% to $15.02 per share from $15.27 per share in the year ago quarter. As previously disclosed during the quarter we terminated our qualified and nonqualified pension plans that have been frozen since fiscal 2003. Adjusted for the charges related to the termination of the pension plans of $93.7 million net of tax, adjusted net income for the quarter increased 13.8% over the same period last year to $494 million while adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 21.4% to $18.54 per share from $15.27 per share in the year ago quarter. Our diluted share count of 26.6 million was down 6.2% from last year\u2019s fourth quarter. Relating to the cash flow statement for the fourth quarter we generated $824 million of operating cash flow. Net fixed assets were up 4.6% versus last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $195 million and reflected the additional expenditures required to open 114 new locations. This quarter capital expenditures on existing stores, hub and mega hub store remodels or openings, work on the development of new stores for upcoming quarters and information technology investments. With the new stores opened we finished this quarter with 5,618 stores in 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. 564 stores in Mexico and 20 in Brazil for a total AutoZone store count of 6,202. Depreciation totaled $108 million for the quarter versus last year\u2019s fourth quarter expense of $103.1 million. This was generally in line with the recent quarter growth rate. We repurchased $665 million of AutoZone stock in the fourth quarter. At quarter end we had $232 million remaining under our share buyback authorization and our leverage metric was 2.5x. Again, I want to stress we managed to appropriate credit ratings and not anyone metric. The metric we report is meant as a guide only as each rating firm has its own criteria. We continue to view our share repurchase program as an attractive capital deployment strategy. Next I would like to update you on our inventory levels in total and on a per store basis. The company\u2019s inventory increased 1.6% over the same period last year, driven primarily by new store openings. Inventory per location was $636,000 versus $644,000 last year and $658,000 last quarter. Net inventory defined as merchandise inventory less accounts payable on a per location basis was a negative $75,000 versus the negative $48,000 last year ear and a negative $48,000 just last quarter. As a result, accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 111.8%. What I would like to call out is that last year\u2019s first quarter experienced several natural disasters that impacted our sales and operating profit results. We called out 50 basis points to 60 basis points of comp tailwinds we received from the storms and $9 million of cost in last year\u2019s first quarter. Finally, as Bill previously mentioned our continued disciplined capital management approach resulted in return on invested capital for the trailing four quarters of 32.1%. We have and we will continue to make investments that we believe will generate returns that significantly exceed our cost of capital. Now, I will turn it back to Bill Rhodes. Bill Rhodes : Thank you, Bill. Before I conclude I want to take this opportunity to reflect on fiscal 2018. The year certainly was an improvement from 2017, but also didn\u2019t completely meet our expectations. However, our team continued to deliver some very impressive accomplishments and milestones. In recognition of the dedication, passion, innovation, and commitment of our AutoZoners, I want to highlight that first our sales grew to a record $11.2 billion this past year. We grew same-store sales at 1.8%. We opened 150 domestic new stores and now have over 5,600 locations across the United States. We opened 40 stores in Mexico, a tremendous accomplishment by that talented team. We are starting to ramp up our Brazilian operations as we expanded to 20 stores in and around Sao Paulo. Our supply chain after some significant changes is only getting stronger and is poised to leverage those improvements. Between the distribution centers and mega hub locations we are beginning to see real sales traction of being able to say yes more than ever before. We expanded our highly successful mega hub strategy opening eight new mega hubs this year ending with 24. And our team has done a wonderful job of introducing new out-of-the-box ideas like our market leading next day delivery option up to 10 :00 PM. Most importantly, our customers are visiting our website at accelerated rates and using that research to inform their in-store visits. And lastly we sold two businesses in AutoAnything and IMC to focus our resources on our core business, but we will continue to challenge ourselves our decisions, processes and strategies, we will always invest to reinforce our guiding principles, leveraging our methodologies of evolution over revolution and superior execution with consistent strategy is a formula for success. We have an exceptional team that executes extremely well. Our focus remains on being successful over the long run. That success will be attributable to our approach to leveraging our unique and powerful culture and focusing on the needs of our customers. To execute at a high level we must consistently adhere to living the pledge, we cannot and will not take our eye off of execution, but we must continually challenge ourselves to think differently and move more swiftly once conclusions are reached. Success will be achieved with an attention to detail and exceptional execution. Our customers have choices and we must exceed their expectations in whatever way they choose to shop with us. We are fortunate to operate in one of the strongest retail segments and we continue to be excited about our industry\u2019s growth prospects for 2019 and beyond. Our charge remains to optimize our performance regardless of market conditions and continue to ensure we are investing in the key initiatives that will drive our long-term performance. In the end delivering strong EPS growth and RIOC each quarter is how we measure ourselves. This formula has been extremely successful over the last 39 years and we continue to be excited about our future. Now we would like to open up the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Matt Fassler from Goldman Sachs. One moment please Matt Fassler : [Technical Difficulty] will have disruptions at any point in time puts and takes in any given quarter, can you frame the magnitude of what you were trying to get done in this past fiscal year particularly the second half you spoke about the vendor changeover, etcetera, just to get a sense as to whether the ask you made on yourselves was that much greater than it had been in prior quarters, that would be question number one? Bill Rhodes : Yes. It\u2019s a terrific question, but I knew you didn\u2019t come through that first, but I think I understand it, if I didn\u2019t get it or don\u2019t address it please clarify it for me. I think you got to look at two different things. First and foremost we made a strategic decisions on discontinuing the e-commerce promotions that didn\u2019t have anything to do with execution or transition that was a strategic decision that we made and that cost us about 40 basis point of comp. We want to make that clear, we turned them back on. We will see where we go from here. We did not want to be in a competitive disadvantage position. On the transitions we just in hindsight I think we would look back on and say we took on a disproportion amount and too much in the second half of the year. We always have vendor transitions going on and we always have distribution changes going on and hub stores and mega hubs opening we just had a little too much. And frankly several of these didn\u2019t go as planned. And they were challenging during the implementation. As we get finished with the implementation we are very excited we will be in a better competitive position and in most cases we already are. But it hurts a little bit in that six months period of time. Matt Fassler : Thanks. And then my second question relates to the next day delivery effort, can you talk about how you are going to fulfill these orders and what is this about what you are doing that would suggest that next day delivery should be proprietary as to you or to your channel and perhaps tougher for pure play e-commerce firms to execute if you think that that\u2019s the case? Bill Rhodes : I think I have to let you answer the latter portion of that. I will tell you that we have a world class logistics organization that we are working with. We have been working with \u2013 on this for some time. And we are really excited to be in a position to have this differentiated offering out there. How long will it be differentiated, I think that\u2019s yet to be determined, certainly we don\u2019t know, but we are taking advantage of it. I am amazed that our organization from the time we had our first conversation about doing this. We were up and running in a store in six months, that is remarkable and a great sign of the innovation that our team can drive. And now here we are a year later than that and we have it in 83 markets and 80% of the United States population can order as late as 10 PM and get a product on their doorstep tomorrow. I think it just shows Matt that innovation doesn\u2019t only rest on the West Coast, but there is a lot of people that are doing a lot of different innovations and leveraging technologies to improve customer service. Matt Fassler : Thank you so much. I appreciate it. Bill Rhodes : Yes. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Michael Lasser from UBS. Your line is now open. Michael Lasser : Good evening. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. At the risk of asking an obvious question, you mentioned Bill that you are bullish on your sales in the industry environment in the upcoming year, does that mean it\u2019s reasonable to expect that you will see an acceleration in both your DIY and your DIFM same-store sales results in the upcoming year? Bill Rhodes : I think as you know Michael we don\u2019t give guidance, so we don\u2019t leave that you to guys, the experts. We are trying to tell you what we think is going on in the industry. I think Bill was very clear that in the first quarter we have something that we have to lap as pretty significant and that was the hurricanes last year. Unfortunately, we got a large part of Carolinas that are going through that issue right now as well and we are certainly sympathetic towards all the people that are dealing with that. And I congratulate our team out there for doing a remarkable job, taking care of our business and our customers more importantly. But as far as whether or not we are not going up or down from here, think there is a lot of moving pieces and we are not in the projection business. Michael Lasser : With that being said, what do you anticipate inflation is going to contribute to the industry for the upcoming year both from underlying raw material and cost of doing business going up and then the potential for tariffs as well? Bill Rhodes : Tell me what the tariffs are going to be, are they going to be 10% or 25%. They are 25% or if things stay for a long period of time that\u2019s going to drive some significant inflation in our industry. And I will tell you over the long periods of time marginal inflation in our business is good. And by the way, we are seeing inflation at accelerated rates in wages. So, we are not scared of marginal inflation, what we don\u2019t want to see is shocks that shock the consumer. Michael Lasser : Are you seeing inflation pickup as it stands today? Bill Rhodes : Not materially. The categories that were impacted back in July with the tariffs, certainly those categories have seen inflation. On a broader level, we are not seeing it, but you are seeing it in various parts of the economy. So, fuel prices are up. Wages are up. So we are later in the economic cycle and by the way things that normally happen later in the economic cycle seem to be showing up. Michael Lasser : Okay, thank you so much and good luck. Bill Rhodes : Yes, thank you. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. Simeon Gutman : Thanks. Good morning. First for Bill Rhodes, I want to talk about the online promotion and the next day delivery. So, you made the strategic decision to drop it and then in the not-so-long-after period it looks like its back with one of the better shipping or next day delivery programs in the industry. Can you just talk about what caused that abruptness? Was it either the mass more tolerable or is there something that you are anticipating in the industry? Bill Rhodes : I think it\u2019s we have been out there for 5 to 6 months by ourselves. It\u2019s not lost on us that our competitive sales position that we are not growing share at the robust rate that we were for about 8 to 10 months before that decline and we want to make sure and prove to ourselves if it was only the 40 basis points of what was happening with online promotions, I don\u2019t think we would have changed it, but we have got to make sure that it\u2019s not changing the value perception of our consumer as they are beginning the shopping experience. The vast majority of our customers begin their shopping journey whether they buy in-store or online. And so if that was changing the value perception, we have got to make sure that that\u2019s not the case. Simeon Gutman : Right. And now your offer in theory leapfrogs what\u2019s out there in the marketplace. I mean is that fair or you were expecting this at some point from your competitors anyway, so you just might as well get there? Bill Rhodes : I think we have a very differentiated offering right now, very different. Simeon Gutman : Fair enough. Okay. And my second question for Bill Giles, to the extent we can talk about it on a 52-week basis, because you have I think the extra week, can we talk about just EBIT dollar growth? Are you planning for that for next year? I think you reiterated some of the comments around expense growing, but I just want to talk about EBIT dollars in totality? Bill Giles : Yes, I think that to be honest with you I am just going to come back to the SG&A growth, I think that we had articulated that a couple of quarters ago and it seems as though the Street has digested that in the numbers that that they have got out there today and so no change from that perspective. And I think you guys have to figure out what you believe comp is going to be etcetera and go from there, but I would say that to reiterate some of the things Bill had talked about before is that we do expect to make some of those investments. Some of those are going to be in wage rates and some investment in technology and that will ramp during the year. And a big chunk of that was the wage rates and that will come in play towards the middle to end of Q1 and then in full force in Q2. So think about it that way as you are ramping your SG&A. Simeon Gutman : Okay, thanks for that and good luck next year. Bill Rhodes : Thanks, Simeon. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Kate McShane from Citi. Your line is now open. Kate McShane : I was curious I think it was mentioned in the comments about the composition of comp growth and wondered if you could you maybe differentiate how DIY versus DIFM did during the quarter, how much was from new customer acquisition or a bigger basket or both? Bill Rhodes : I would say in the call, number one, we said both retail and commercial were positive every period throughout the quarter or every month throughout the quarter. We gave clarity that commercial grew at 8.8% and we got that growth from new customers as well as existing customers and that\u2019s accelerated from 7.3% last quarter. We are quite pleased the productivity on per program basis was the highest we have seen in some time, the growth in productivity. Kate McShane : Okay, thank you. And just to nail down the vendor transition piece, can you tell us what the timing was with regards to when it started to get a little bit more aggressive with the transition and when that will end? Bill Rhodes : Yes. I mean first of all it\u2019s one thing within, there were six or seven of these kinds eventually all happened in different times. But they really culminated over the course of the fourth quarter, had a little bit of the impact in the third quarter, most of the impact in the fourth quarter. We still have a little bit going on now as we are finishing some of those transitions, but for the most part that\u2019s behind us. Kate McShane : Okay. Thank you. Bill Rhodes : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Mike Baker from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Mike Baker : Thanks. A couple of follow-ups, one the online promotions that you got \u2013 that you did well how \u2013 did that positively impacted your gross margins and so now as you put those back into play should we expect less gross margin gains ahead? Bill Rhodes : Michael they definitely favorably impacted them slightly. But keep in mind these are relatively low volume in general, so not enough to really move the needle per se. Mike Baker : Okay. And then the vendor transitions, so you \u2013 thank you for quantifying the impact of the online change to your comps, could you quantify the impact of the vendor transitions? Bill Rhodes : Michael, we really can\u2019t because it happened in different categories, different weeks, it\u2019s just very, very difficult. We think it certainly had an impact, a negative impact on us in the quarter. We also think it\u2019s pretty much behind us at this point in time, but calling out a specific, it\u2019s very easy on the online promotions we can put back behind that one, this one is more difficult. Mike Baker : Okay. And then to sort of put these questions together, so presumably they were some one the 56 basis point maybe 70 basis point impact when you consider what you quantified for online plus the vendor issue, that seems to then offset the hurricanes, so is that a fair way to think about it, do you have some positives coming because those disruptions and changes are behind you offsetting the tougher comparison from last year\u2019s hurricanes? Bill Rhodes : Yes, I have no idea if they are going to perfectly offset, but you are absolutely right, we have some things in the quarter that we believe that we are going to execute better on going forward. We\u2019ve made a change in the promotional activity online and we think that\u2019ll be a benefit. Obviously, we have some headwinds from Q1 last year and then TBD on what the impacts of the current year hurricanes will be. Mike Baker : Understood. Alright. Thank you for the color. I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Christopher Horvers from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Christopher Horvers : Thanks. First a question on the gross margin outlook going forward, you have had some very nice sourcing benefits over the past few quarters, it looks like the supply chain, the fuel aspect turned sort of negative in this quarter and that offset that, but at the same time the benefit from the divested businesses accelerated, so could you piece those apart? How do you think about that 70 basis points going forward on the divested businesses? How do you balance out, is the sourcing benefit still going to outweigh the fuel supply chain headwind? How should we think about that? Bill Giles : That\u2019s a good question. I think that basically you are right, we had about a 70 basis point impact this quarter I think it was about 40 basis points, last quarter with just kind of a transition in third quarter. We had 40 basis points. So when you go forward on Q1 and Q2 you would probably have something similar to what you had in Q4 and maybe little bit less. But you are right we did have some headwinds on supply chain specifically diesel fuel, so I suspect that that will continue to be a headwind for the next quarter or so. We continue to make benefits from sourcing, merchandise and organization continues to do a good job of lowering acquisition costs, etcetera. But I think that will probably be a little muted versus what it had been particularly given some of the tariffs that might be coming on place etcetera. So that\u2019s on how I think about it going forward, I think up 70 basis points or so of benefit by not having the two business units and then some headwinds in the supply chain. Christopher Horvers : Got it. And then in terms of the next day delivery, I think right now it\u2019s free if you spend over a certain amount, how do you think about the cost of that to the consumer going forward, what you are going to charge versus if you had a standard 2-day delivery free over 35 or something like that? And also in terms of the \u2013 is this being sourced from stores and hubs or distribution centers, just curious how it\u2019s being pushed out to the consumer? Bill Rhodes : So, on the first part on whether or not we will charge for it, we don\u2019t know the answer to that yet. We have charged for it in the past, a marginal amount, $1.99 and free next day delivery. Right now, it\u2019s on there at zero. Right now, we have promotions out there on certain amounts. We were going to work on modifying those over time to find the right sweet spot for our customer and for our business. As for where it\u2019s being sourced, it\u2019s being sourced from the local markets. That\u2019s the only way that you can get it there for the next day. So it\u2019s coming out of those hubs and mega hubs, which is really a great opportunity for us to activate that inventory even better. If you think about it, 3 or 4 years ago we didn\u2019t have any mega hubs. Today, we have got 24, if I might add 10 more next year and that really gives us, it puts us in a very different competitive position going forward. Christopher Horvers : Understood. Best of luck. Bill Rhodes : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Seth Sigman from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Bill Rhodes : Operator, shall we go to the next person please? Operator : One moment please. Bill Rhodes : Operator, is there another question in the queue that we can go to? Operator : Excuse me. Seth Sigman\u2019s line is now open. Seth Sigman : Can you guys hear me? Bill Rhodes : I am sorry about that. Seth Sigman : My question was around market share, so you guys had talked about market share gains subsiding in the second half of the year. I am just curious was that more about specific challenges that AutoZone was grappling with or did you actually see something different from some of your competitors? And then the other question would be just around the improvement in August as you started to address some of the issues you had earlier in the quarter, did you actually start to see market share gains reverse, start to accelerate again? Bill Rhodes : Yes. For the latter part of that question, we have not seen August market share data completely yet, although I wouldn\u2019t expect to see it in August. I think we are really improving, I think one of the questions we got earlier was did your market share change from May to June and July. The answer is no. And I want to make this real clear. We continued to gain market share all throughout this, but we had more robust market share gains for 8 to 10 months before the safe February time period. What happened in February? We changed our cadence on online promotions. That clearly impacted us 40 basis points. Did this customer value perception change and did that slow us down too, maybe, maybe not. That\u2019s what we are testing to learn today. And then that\u2019s also when we started hitting these vendor transitions. Our competitors are always great competitors, whether or not they improve themselves or not, I don\u2019t know the answer to that, but I know that we weren\u2019t at our finest during that period of time. And I know we are in the process of correcting that. Seth Sigman : And Bill, we are talking mostly about the DIY business, because the commercial business has continued to perform pretty well? Bill Rhodes : No, I think the underlying trends in the commercial business are better. The vast majority of the vendor transitions would have impacted commercial just as much as they impacted DIY if not more, because it\u2019s more of a hard parts business and several of these were major hard part changeovers, which are very complex and very challenging and they just didn\u2019t go flawlessly. Seth Sigman : Okay. And my follow-up question is on the commercial business specifically, I think there was a period last year where you were using a third-party to help assess the strategy and there was a little bit of uncertainty at that point. Obviously since then, the business has continued to improve. Can you discuss the changes that have been made that you think are helping drive that improvement? And then as you think about 2019, I think you have talked about getting to double-digit growth for the commercial business at some point, what will it take to get there? Bill Rhodes : Yes, I wish I knew the answer to the last question. We can do it tomorrow if we knew what it would take. I think yes, we did a commercial study, a strategic review of our commercial business and we concluded it about a year ago. It came with some new concepts and we are trying some of those new concepts. And we don\u2019t know if they are going to work yet or not. We are very complicated and we are doing great things and I am proud of our team. But that\u2019s not what\u2019s driving our business today, what\u2019s driving our business today is our inventory assortment changes that we have made over the last 3 years with hubs and mega hubs and improved assortments in the satellite stores. We have also got our store management teams both the district managers and the store managers much more involved in the commercial business so that they are not thinking about DIY first and commercial second that they are coming to work every day thinking, I am the store manager of both the retail and the commercial business. And I think those things are just the blocking and tackling of what\u2019s making the improvements in our commercial business today. I certainly hope to return to 10%. I am very encouraged by going from 7.3% to 8.8%. I am also encouraged by some of the strategic changes that we are looking at but it\u2019s way too early for us to talk about any of those. Seth Sigman : Okay. Thanks, Bill. Bill Rhodes : Yes, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Seth Basham from Wedbush Securities. Seth Basham : Good morning. My first question is around inflation, sorry if I missed this, but did you try to quantify what the impact on your comps for this quarter from inflation? Bill Giles : We didn\u2019t necessarily quantify the impact from inflation. We think inflation \u2013 there is a little bit of inflation in certain categories, but it hasn\u2019t been significant. Obviously, marginal inflation as Bill talked is helpful for the industry and for us specifically, but we have seen moderate inflation. Seth Basham : Moderate inflation, okay. And if we assume that the tariffs that are proposed to go through later this month, would you expect that the inflation environment will still be moderate and manageable or do you anticipate some transitional headwinds? Bill Giles : Well, we think it\u2019s manageable. I mean, one of the things in this industry is that we are very slow churn inventory business. So, whatever tariffs do arrive, we will have an opportunity to see what the impact is going to be on each of the categories, etcetera. And historically, the industry has been very successful in being able to pass those cost on to consumers. So, that\u2019s how we see it playing out. Seth Basham : Thanks. And my follow-up question is just around the overnight delivery offer that you have now, initially when you put this out you were leveraging FedEx to deliver these packages overnight. Are you no longer using FedEx for this purpose? Bill Rhodes : I think you can see that we are using a world class logistic operator in FedEx if you look at our website and they have done a wonderful job of helping us innovate on this front-end. Seth Basham : Okay. Thank you, guys. Bill Rhodes : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Matt McClintock from Barclays. Your line is now open. Matt McClintock : Hi. Yes, good morning everyone. Just real quick follow-up on the tariffs or more broader inflation, can you help me understand the elasticity of price increases for the DIY side versus the commercial side, how to think through that? I would assume DIY would be more impacted, but from a volume perspective, but I would just love to get your perspective? Thanks. Bill Giles : Historically, we haven\u2019t seen that necessarily. The elasticity is not as great as you might imagine on many of the parts. Also consider that a big chunk of our business is failure related parts. So, those are required parts to operate your vehicle. But, I would say historically, when you look back over time, the elasticity, even on maintenance side and even to some extent discretionary is not as great as you would think. Matt McClintock : Thank you. That\u2019s helpful. And then just another follow-up on the overnight delivery, is this the missing piece to being able to have a real inflection and broader consumer acceptance of purchasing these products online? Bill Rhodes : I don\u2019t think there is any silver bullets that are out there. I think this is a normal part of the evolution of leveraging new technologies and new innovations. As we said in the call, this is a very small part of our business and we anticipate it remaining relatively small. It\u2019s growing fast right now and we are going to accelerate it as best we can, but at the end of the day, we believe the omni-channel experience is the most important. We believe coming into our stores and engaging with our incredibly knowledgeable AutoZoners and having them help our DIY customers figure out how to maintain or repair their vehicles, is the most important part. This is just another avenue for us to meet those customers where, when, and how it\u2019s most convenient for them. So, I wouldn\u2019t overdo it, but it is a great new innovation. Matt McClintock : Thank you very much. Best of luck. Bill Rhodes : Yes, thank you. Operator : Thank you. I will now hand the call back to Mr. Bill Rhodes. Bill Rhodes : Alright. Thank you. Before we conclude the call, I\u2019d like to take a moment to reiterate that our business model continues to be solid. We are excited about our growth prospects for the year. We will not take anything for granted as we understand our customers have alternatives. We have a solid plan to succeed this fiscal year, but I want to stress that this is a marathon and not a sprint. As we continue to focus on the basics and focus on optimizing long-term shareholder value, we are confident AutoZone will continue to be very, very successful. We thank you for participating in today\u2019s call. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect.",

Bill Rhodes : Good morning and thank you for joining us today for AutoZone\u2019s 2019 first quarter conference call. With me today are Bill Giles, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax. Regarding the first quarter, I hope you\u2019ve had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter\u2019s results. If not, the press release along with slides complementing our comments today, are available on our website, www.autozoneinc.com. Please click on quarterly earnings calls to see them. To begin this morning, I want to thank all AutoZoners across the company for their tremendous efforts during our first fiscal quarter. Their dedication and commitment to superior service resulted in a strong start to our new year. As we entered the quarter, we knew we had a difficult sales comparison due to the sales favorability we experienced last year from three significant widespread hurricanes. Last year, we highlighted that our sales increased an additional 50 to 60 basis points from the effects of those hurricanes. Unfortunately, this fall, many people were also impacted by the two hurricanes that struck our shores and the terrible wildfires out west. While certain areas experienced significant damage, the effects of the storms weren't as widespread as last year and the impact on our business this year was negligible. Unfortunately, we have AutoZoners and customers who were severely impacted and we've worked diligently to help them where possible. Ultimately, considering the more challenging comparisons to last year, we were pleased with our same store sales growth of 2.7%.  Regarding the cadence during the quarter, results were generally consistent, except in the weeks and markets that we were lapping the hurricane events from last year and the last week of our quarter was particularly strong as much of the country experienced the first major cold weather, which accelerated our sales. Overtime, weather effects normalized, but in certain weeks, it can have a meaningful impact on our sales.  We previously mentioned that our DIY market share gains were strong in the first half of last fiscal year and that growth materially subsided in the second half. Recently, our market share has continued to grow and improved slightly, which we consider encouraging as we are lapping the large gains we\u2019ve made this time last year. As for regional performance, we continue to see strong results in the Northeast Mid-Atlantic and Midwestern markets while results were improving, but still a bit subdued out west.  Our stronger results in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic and Midwest don\u2019t surprise us as the very cold winter and seasonal summer we experienced continued to generate benefits for us throughout this summer and fall. We were especially pleased to report that our commercial sales growth eclipsed double-digits for the quarter, ending up 11.3%, marking our strongest growth quarter since fiscal 2015. We strive to show continued profitable growth in our commercial business and we've intensified our focus on achieving much of that growth in existing programs.  We've enhanced our inventory availability significantly in recent years. We have high quality parts and products, many under the Duralast name with a seasoned sales force and now we are increasing the engagement of our local store team, particularly the store manager and we're pleased with the results and the sequential improvement we have experienced over each of the last three quarters. We feel well positioned to continue strong growth for the balance of the year. Overall, our business strengthened in Q1 and we were encouraged as we head into our second fiscal quarter. Every year, our second quarter is significantly more \u2013 has significantly more volatility due to sales, widely varying weather patterns and in February, March, due to the timing of income tax refunds. Additionally, it is the lowest volume quarter of the year as we have closings and elevated expenses around the holidays. The second quarter is always our most challenging quarter.  During the first quarter, we launched our theme for the new fiscal year at our annual sales meeting here in Memphis in October. Our annual operating theme for 2019 will be focused on our drive for excellence, a relentless focus on what matters to our customers, exceptional service, fast deliveries, high quality parts and products, flawless executions of changes in product assortments, in-store merchandising and on and on.  We're focused on reducing non-selling task in our stores in order to reallocate that time, talent and attention to sales activities. We continued executing our inventory availability initiatives during the quarter and opened two additional mega hubs. We now have 26 mega hubs in operations. Many investors are quite interested in our perspective on industry fundamentals heading into 2019. We've spent considerable time over the last few years, discussing the weather, something I'm quite reluctant to do as there is nothing that we can do about it. And over the long term, weather impacts normalize and are not material drivers of the long term success of this business or industry.  And I'd like to remind everyone of the long term solid growth trends our industry has experienced in DIY and commercial over the last three plus decades. But at specific times in markets or region, weather matters. Extreme heat and cold causes premature failure of parts and also accelerates the deterioration of maintenance parts. And in the spring and fall when temperatures are milder, most deferred maintenance gets done, if the weather is favorable. Fiscal 2016 and \u201817 had very mild winters and our industry sales were softer than the couple of years before or last year. We don't know if this year's weather will be more or less conducive to our business, but we do know that our current industry fundamentals, including declining gas prices are favorable.  And as our economy enters the later stages of an extended growth cycle, we know when economic times get difficult, our customers turn to us more frequently out of economic necessity to help them stretch their resources. We don't know what the next year will hold. We have a high degree of confidence built off of nearly 40 years of experience that this is a very reliable, predictable industry over reasonable planning horizons and we continue to be optimistic about our industry's prospects and particularly our company's prospects. Another key topic of latest tariffs, the initial tariffs on raw materials weren\u2019t significant to us. The 10% tariffs were expanded to broader and broader categories. We did not see a material cost increase from these tariffs in fiscal 2018 or in our first quarter, because we were able to negotiate and offset some of the tariffs away based on the strength of the US dollar. Looking forward, the US has agreed to postpone plans to increase tariffs from 10% to 25%. We will continue to monitor developments closely and working with our industry associations to share our concerns about the potential negative ramifications of ongoing and increased tariffs to our customers and the broader economy. That said, our industry has much lower elasticity of demand than most other retailer distribution sectors. If your car won't start and you have to go to work, you or someone else has to fix it, period. This phenomenon has historically allowed our industry to pass on product inflation in higher [indiscernible]. Turning to our online efforts, we continue to invest in our strategy to enhance the customer shopping experience in an omni-channel world. We have initiatives in place to improve our in-store systems and websites, autozone.com, AutoZonePro, mobile and all that. In fact, we are investing more capital than ever before this fiscal year in improving these systems. We continue to see growth in website traffic as well as ship to home and buy online, pick up in store sales.  While representing a very small percentage of our business, we are pleased with the acceleration of growth that leverages our online platforms in both retail and commercial and for retail through our ship to home, buy online, pick up in-store and now through our industry leading next day delivery program that allows customers and 85% of US markets to order as late as 10 PM and receive their products at their home the very next day. We are also working diligently to further enhance our digital capabilities with our commercial customers to ensure that they have a great seamless, intuitive, no hassle way to interact with us digitally. In summary, we are pleased with our recent performance and encouraged about our industry's prospects for 2019 and beyond. Macro factors are currently in our favor and we remain committed to not only maintaining, but growing our market share in both our DIY and commercial businesses. Now, let me provide a little more detail on the quarter. For the quarter, total auto parts sales increased 3.3% and our domestic same store sales were up 2.7%. As a reminder, we sold two businesses in the middle of fiscal 2018, including one IMC that was included in the total auto parts sector. Therefore, our total domestic sales comparisons include sales from that business in the total number, but those sales have no bearing on the same store sales results in Q1. All three months are of course September, October and November were positive with October being our strongest month.  On a two year basis, the first two weeks of November was our strong. During the quarter, we opened 13 new stores in the US and our commercial business grew by 11.3%, while opening 25 net new programs. Our commercial growth accelerated from last quarter\u2019s 8.8% increase, as we continued to execute on our strategies to grow sales. We expect to open approximately 150 net new commercial programs this fiscal year. Currently, 85% of our domestic stores have a commercial program. During the quarter, we have continued to expand in Mexico, opening three new stores. We did not open any new stores in Brazil this quarter.  Regarding our inventory initiatives, in the spirit of, YES! We've Got It initiative, we continued our efforts around expanding our hub store network. We opened two additional mega hubs this past quarter and now have 170 hub stores and additional 26 mega hubs, totaling 196 stores with significantly expanded parts assortments. As we have seen, both our DIY and commercial sales expand in markets where hub and megas are added. We will continue to grow the number of hubs we have this year.  We expect to open as many as 10 hubs for the full year, with most being mega hubs. As a reminder, both our hubs and our mega hubs are focused on making available additional coverage to the local markets, meeting adding SKUs that would not have been available locally in our network before. Previously, we relied on shipping these harder to find or slower turning SKUs into the market when demand arose. Both of these efforts are designed to enhance our ability to meet our customer's needs for coverage and immediacy.  Along with improving our local parts availability and assortment, we continue to manage this organization to provide exceptional service for our customers, provide our AutoZoners with a great place to work with opportunities for advancement and ensure we do it on a long term profitable basis to provide strong returns for our shareholders. We will continue to stress the importance of going the extra mile to fulfill our customer's needs, regardless of how difficult the requests. Regarding inventory, on our last call, we highlighted that over the last six months, we had executed a significant amount of changes, including product category changeovers that we felt were disruptive to our company and negatively impacted sales during that time. We are happy to report that the majority of those challenges have been addressed and rectified and those issues are predominantly behind us. As importantly, we've studied our opportunities for improvement in the future and have improved our planning and processes accordingly.  Now, adding more color to our international operations, our three store openings in Mexico this quarter pushed our total store count to 567 stores. Mexico now represents 9% of our total store base and this month marks the 20th anniversary of our first Mexican store opening in Loreto. I'd like to congratulate the original AutoZoners who laid the groundwork and began this journey 20 years ago as well as those who have built it into one of the premier retailers, distributors in all of Mexico. For everyone past present and future who has or will have something to do with the great service we provide to our Mexican customers, congratulations on 20 years of success and thank you for all you have done.  Sales in our other businesses for the quarter were down 38.9% versus last year\u2019s first quarter, but I wanted to remind everyone last year's numbers had a business that was sold later in fiscal 2018, AutoAnything. We will not anniversary those lost sales entirely until this year's fourth quarter. We will continue to make our omnichannel selling efforts a key focus for 2019. At the end of fiscal 2018, we reinstituted promotions online as we have removed them at the start of calendar 2018. Thinking with the promotions, we launched our next day delivery in 80 plus markets across the country. About 100,000 SKUs were made available for next day. In this quarter, we expanded that availability to over 95 markets. While ship to home, ship to home next day, buy online, pick up in store and commercial customer ordering are all showing growth and more traffic to our online sites, we continue to see customers primarily doing lots of research online and then coming into the store in order to receive trustworthy advice, [indiscernible] and a host of other services that simply cannot be duplicated online prior to making the sale.  Our efforts in 2019 are to make sure our AutoZoners are freed up in stores, provide Wow customer service for every customer. While our online sales are small, substantially less than 5% of our total sales, the omni-channel experience is very important for the customer experience. So, we will continue to invest in our digital platform.  With the aging of the car population and recently lower gas prices at the pump, these are contributing to our optimism regarding 2019 for both DIY and commercial. Trends remain encouraging. Along with our operating theme for 2019, drive for excellence, we create key priorities each year. For 2019, these priorities for the year are customers first, commercial acceleration omni-channel, leveraging technology and YES? We've Got It inventory initiatives. We're spending a significant amount of time across the organization, but especially in stores, identifying areas where task can be simplified, streamlined or eliminated in order to free up time for our AutoZoners to focus intensely on customers and their needs.  We hosted our national sales meeting in October and our messages were simple, intensely focus on customer service. That's what has made this organization legendary. And we will focus on simplifying things in stores to help free up time. We're making further technology investments to improve our electronic catalog and point of sale systems with the goal of putting the customer first. We believe our current and future technology investments will lead to sales growth across all of our businesses. Regarding commercial acceleration, along with opening 25 net new programs, during the quarter, we've been investing in systems to help AutoZoners sell more efficiently and customers conduct business with us easier. While most of these initiatives won't be rolled out until late in calendar 2019, our focus on increasing the engagement of the broader store team and focusing on existing customers is really paying off. We have solid momentum heading into the new calendar year. Along with our usual program openings, we continue to improve our product assortments and availability and as we make other refinements to our commercial offerings, we expect further sales growth, which is once again highlight another strong performance in return on invested capital as we were able to finish our first quarter at 33.7%. We continue to be pleased with this metric, as is one of the best in all of hard lines retail. However, our primary focus has been and continues to be that we ensure every incremental dollar of capital that we deploy in this business provides an acceptable return, well in excess of our cost of capital. It is important to reinforce that we will always maintain our diligence regarding capital stewardship, as the capital we invest is our investors\u2019 capital. Before I pass the discussion over to Bill Giles to talk about our financial results, I'd like to again thank and reinforce how appreciative we are of our entire team\u2019s efforts to continue to meet and exceed our customers\u2019 expectations. We're excited about all the initiatives we're working on throughout 2019 but everything starts with the efforts of our exceptional AutoZoners and we thank them for that. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Bill Giles. Bill Giles : Thanks, Bill and good morning, everyone. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to talk more specifically about our domestic, retail, commercial and international results. For the quarter, total auto parts sales, which includes our domestic, retail and commercial businesses along with our Mexico and Brazil stores increased 3.3%. For the trailing 52 weeks ended, total sales for AutoZone store were $1,792,000.  Total commercial sales increased 11.3%. In the quarter, commercial represented 21% of our total sales and grew $56 million over last year's Q1. We opened 25 net new programs versus 30 programs opened in our first quarter last year. We now have our commercial program in 4,766 stores or 85% of our domestic stores, supported by 196 hub stores. In 2019, we expect to open approximately 150 new programs. As Bill mentioned earlier, we remain committed to gain market share with our commercial customers and we're encouraged by the initiatives we have in place and feel we can further grow sales and market share.  Our Mexico stores continue to perform well. We opened three new stores during the first quarter, ending the quarter with 567 stores. We expect to open approximately 40 new stores in fiscal 2019. Mexico business remains challenged by peso foreign exchange rate movements relative to the US dollar. While our hope is 2019\u2019s exchange rate will settle down and will strengthen relative to the dollar, we are pleased with the Mexico leadership team's ability to manage this business through foreign exchange volatility. Regarding Brazil, we continue to operate 20 stores. We have aggressive plans to open between 15 and 20 additional stores by the end of the fiscal 2019. Our performance continues to improve and we remain optimistic about the long term future of this market. If we can prove success, this market has the potential to be much larger than Mexico. So while challenging, the size of the prize is significant. Gross margin for the quarter was 53.7% of sales, up 90 basis points from last year's first quarter. The increase in gross margin was primarily attributable to the impact of the sale of the two business units completed last fiscal year and higher merchandise margins.  While we\u2019re asked about gross margin assumptions and the direction they will be headed, our primary focus has always been growing absolute gross profit dollars in our total auto parts segment. SG&A expense for the quarter was 35.2% of sales, higher by 54 basis points from last year's fiscal quarter. Operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, were higher than last year, primarily due to the planned increase in domestic store payroll. On the cost front, we highlighted on the last few quarters conference calls the investments that we would be making, specifically, wage rates and technology for this fiscal year. As we discussed, the majority of the wage rates would be implemented during the latter part of the first quarter.  Although consensus may have had these investments starting sooner than they actually did in Q1, we feel the consensus numbers for SG&A for the remainder of the year are more in line with our expectations. Also, I would remind everyone that fiscal 2019 includes a 53rd week. I bring this up to make sure analysts model that last quarter accordingly. We encourage folks to look at the last time we had a 53rd week, Q4 of 2013, as a litmus test for modeling. I\u2019ll add here regarding inflation and pressures on wage, we feel we have been good at getting out in front of the local market pressures modeled accordingly and managed higher expenses well. From a regulatory standpoint, around wage, there was nothing new we saw happening there in Q1. EBIT for the quarter was $488 million, up 4.1% over last year's first quarter. Our EBIT margin was 18.5%. Interest expense for the quarter was $39 million and in line with Q1 a year ago. We are planning interest around $42 million to $43 million range in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 versus 39.3 million last year Q2. The higher expense is due to assumptions on variable rate interest being impacted by planned fed funds rate moves in December. Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $5.156 billion or approximately $173 million above last year's Q1 ending balance of $4.983 billion. Our adjusted debt level metric finished the quarter at 2.5 times EBITDAR, while in any given quarter, we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on management's opinion regarding debt and equity market conditions. We remain committed to both our investment grade rating and our capital allocation strategy and share repurchases are an important element of that strategy. For the quarter, our tax rate was 21.7%, down from last year's Q1 of 34.6%. Along with tax reform this past year, we benefited 250 basis points in our rate from stock options exercised during the quarter. Excluding this benefit, our rate was 24.2%. Because it is impossible for us to predict when individuals will exercise options, we encourage folks to model us on a rate assuming the stock option impact, roughly 24.2% and we will report both rates. Net income of the quarter was $351.4 million, up 25.1% over last year. Our diluted share count of 26.1 million was down 7.1% from last year's first quarter. The combination of these factors drove earnings per share for the quarter to $13.47, up 34.7% over the prior year\u2019s first quarter. Related to the cash flow statement, for the first quarter, we generated $449 million of operating cash flow. Net fixed assets were up 4.1% versus last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $98 million and reflected the additional expenditures required to open 16 net new stores this quarter. Capital expenditures on existing stores, hub and mega hub remodels or openings work on the development of new stores for upcoming quarters and information technology investments. With the new stores opened, we finished this past quarter with 5,631 stores in 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, 567 stores in Mexico and 20 in Brazil for a total AutoZone store count of 6,218. Depreciation totaled $82.5 million for the quarter versus last year's first quarter expense of 78 million. This is generally in line with the recent quarter growth rates. We repurchased $497 million of AutoZone\u2019s stock in the first quarter. At quarter end, we had $985 million remaining under our share buyback authorization and our leverage metric was 2.5 times at quarter end. Again, I want to stress we managed to appropriate credit ratings and not any one metric, metric we report is meant as a guide only as each rating firm has its own criteria. We continue to view our share repurchase program as an attractive deploy -- capital deployment strategy. Next, I'd love to update you on our inventory levels in total and on a per store basis. The company's inventory increased 2% over the same period last year. Inventory per location was $658,000 versus $663,000 last year and $636,000 just this last quarter. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories, less accounts payable, on a per location basis, was a negative $59,000 versus negative $52,000 last year and a negative $75,000 last quarter. As a result, accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 108.9%.  Finally, as Bill previously mentioned, our continued disciplined capital management approach resulted in a return on invested capital for the trailing four quarters of 33.7%. We have and we will continue to make investments that we believe will generate returns that significantly exceed our cost of capital. Now, I'll turn it back to Bill Rhodes. Bill Rhodes : Thank you, Bill. While we had a strong start to our fiscal year, we are careful to not over commit to any outcomes when it comes to our second fiscal quarter. The second quarter has perpetually been our most volatile quarter due to many things I\u2018ve already highlighted. We believe our industry\u2019s fundamentals remain very strong and are likely improving with the price at the pump decreasing. We've seen predictions that it will be a relatively harsh winter, but I'm not sure our insights into upcoming winters have traditionally been very strong. I know we will adjust and optimize our performance regardless of conditions and we remain very bullish on the long term fundamentals of our industry, both in retail and commercial. We are excited about our balanced model for growth around domestic, retail commercial, international, online and pick up in-store. We believe our hubs and mega hubs, Mexico, all data and e-commerce can all grow their top lines in 2019. To execute at a high level, we have to consistently adhere to living the pledge. We cannot and will not take our eye off of execution. We must stay committed to executing day in and day out on our game plan. Success will be achieved with an attention to detail and exceptional execution. Our customers have choices and we must exceed their expectations in whatever way they choose to shop with us.  We are fortunate to operate in one of the strongest retail segments and as we continue to be excited about our industry's growth prospects for 2019 and beyond. As customers continue to look to save money while taking care of their vehicles, we are committed to providing the trustworthy advice that they have come to expect. It truly is the value add that differentiates us from any other faceless transaction. Customers have come to expect that advice from us. It is with this focus we will implement more enhancements on both our DIY and commercial websites and in-store experience to provide even more knowledgeable service.  Service has always been our most important cultural cornerstone and it will be long into the future. Our job remains to optimize our performance regardless of market conditions and continue to ensure we are investing in the key initiatives that will drive our long term performance. In the end, delivering strong EPS growth and ROIC each and every quarter is how we measure ourselves. This formula has been extremely successful over the last 40 years and we continue to be excited about our future. Now, we'd like to open up the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] First in queue is from Simeon Gutman of Morgan Stanley. Simeon Gutman : Good morning, guys and good start to the year. So, Bill Rhodes, two-part question. You talked a lot about this in the prepared remarks. Can you talk about what's been driving this steady improvement in the commercial the past few quarters and now the jump to double digits? And just a second part is, if there's any extent, there's a difference in your answer, how do you narrow the gap over time versus your competitors. Bill Rhodes : Yeah. I'm not sure that there's a difference. I think it's about blocking and tackling more than anything else, Simeon. As we mentioned in the last call, in the second half of the last year, our execution wasn't up to our standard across the enterprise and we, as a senior management team and across the organization, really re-dedicated ourselves to customer service across the organization and on the commercial side, the biggest thing that we've done is we've enhanced the engagement of the local store team and particularly the store manager. They own that business. They have to own that business. Many of them grew up with retail only as their strength. And so, as we've matured in this business, they're getting more and more involved and I think that's leading to our success. Simeon Gutman : And if we drill down, if you look at sales per account or the number of accounts that you're selling to from a commercial standpoint, if you look at geography, if you look at stores that are benefiting more from mega hubs, is there anything that distinguishes how the step up is occurring or where it's occurring? Bill Rhodes : Well, I think there certainly are geographies that are outperforming others and that's always the case based upon weather patterns or what happened last year. Probably, the biggest difference over the last couple of years with our commercial business is for -- from -- for 5, 6, 7 years, we were really focused on opening new programs and that's where our sales growth was coming from. As those new program openings slowed down, we had to figure out ways to grow our business in the -- with existing stores and with existing customers and I think that that's where we've been successful.  I would also say that our traditional up and down the street business has been very strong and that speaks to the same thing, just focused on the customer relationship day in and day out, providing fast deliveries. I think the other thing is more and more the Duralast brand is becoming stronger and stronger in the automotive aftermarket, if you looked at it 10 years ago, a lot of people thought it was a weakness. I don't think there's anybody out there that thinks it's a weakness anymore. Operator : Next is Michael Lasser of UBS. Michael Goldsmith : It\u2019s Michael Goldsmith on from Michael Lasser. Thanks a lot for taking my question. So, was there a pickup from the impact of inflation during the quarter until the vehicle parts and equipment CPI accelerated in October and are you starting to see prices go up as a result of tariffs? And then just also, has there been any rising prices in the goods you purchased from vendors, as they experienced some of the cost pressures out there like wages? Bill Giles : That's a great question. I would say that we have seen very moderate inflation overall, but we are seeing a little bit. And so, I would say some of our margin benefit this year continues to be the great work that our merchandising organization is doing at lowering acquisition costs across the board and our ability to continue to pass on retail pricing where appropriate for products that do experience some cost inflation. From a tariff respective, we haven't seen a significant impact on this first round of tariffs. And obviously, the Chinese currency was devalued, so there was some opportunity for us to mitigate some of those tariff increases, but I think our merchandising organization has done a great job of mitigating that. So overall, I\u2019d say, a little bit of inflation, which we think long term will be helpful and continued ability to pass on some retail pricing. Michael Goldsmith : And then recognizing that weather can have an influence, how does your outlook for industry growth next year compare to a normal year and maybe what would a normal year look like at this point? Bill Rhodes : I would just -- we don't give guidance. I want to be very careful on that. I would just encourage you to go back and look at what's happened over the last 6 or 7 years. I\u2019ve spent some time about a little over a year ago talking about how tight demand is of our industry's performance and our performance. It just doesn't fluctuate significantly and I just turn you back to look at what's happened since 2013 for instance. 2013 was a bad year with weather and our sales were softer. \u201914, \u201915, \u201816 were stronger, so we'll see what happens. Operator : Next question is from Seth Sigman of Credit Suisse. Seth Sigman : Bill Rhodes, following up on one of your points, thinking about some of the challenges that you highlighted in the fourth quarter and I'm talking about the product changeovers, the impact from pulling away from that online promotion, I'm just curious if you can elaborate a little bit more on the changes you made in the first quarter and if the issues that you were facing, were those fully addressed in the quarter? In other words, there was no drag on this quarter at all from some of those issues lingering? Bill Rhodes : Well, we obviously corrected the online promotions about a week and a half before the beginning of our first quarter. So that was up and running the entire quarter and oh, by the way, it was enhanced by our next day delivery program that was in 80 plus markets at the beginning of the quarter and ended in 95 plus markets. So, we had some benefit of rolling next day, but that's not a material driver. As far as the product category changeovers, most of them had recovered by the beginning of the quarter, but some of them still hadn't and frankly there's still a couple of them that we still have some lingering effects, but the vast majority of it was behind us, as we came into the quarter. Seth Sigman : And then my question, my follow-up is on the DIY business. One of your competitors had talked about weaker traffic and consumers maybe deferring some maintenance due to higher gas prices and product inflation and obviously that was as of September, but I'm just curious is that something that you guys have seen also and if so, are there any signs that that's starting to reverse, particularly in light of your commentary and optimism for the lower gas prices that you're now starting to see? Bill Rhodes : Seth, I would say that that commentary is inconsistent with our experience. And I would also say, I'd add an exclamation point to it and we're talking about a different period of time. This quarter started at the beginning of September, ran through mid-November. That is inconsistent with what we experienced and in fact we spent a lot of time coming into this quarter, talking about the fact that we had those massive hurricanes last year. If you remember, they were significant in all of Southeast Texas, in particular, Houston.  And then you had the whole South Texas and central or sorry, South Florida and Central Florida were impacted and then Puerto Rico where we have a significant presence, those were all impacted. But we were expecting to have a pretty tough compare coming into this quarter and the performance that we had was certainly an acceleration of the performance that we had in the summer. Operator : Next question is from Mike Baker of Deutsche Bank. Mike Baker : First, I wanted to ask you about the commercial business and I was intrigued by something you said that you were just implementing new systems for that business, but they won't really even kick in until the end of the year. So just to be clear, you're seeing an acceleration without even the benefit of those and if that's the case, when do you expect commercial to go over time, as you put in those systems, as you have to sort of target percent of sales or anything along those lines. Bill Giles : I would say that relative to the systems, I mean, we're always working on some things in order to enhance our ability to be able to do business with our customers on an easier basis, whether that be billings, looking at activity, et cetera. There's a host of things that we're working on today and will likely launch later in the calendar year of 2019. We feel great about the commercial business growth rate that we achieved in this quarter, being up double digits. We still said it's one of the strongest performances we've had in a few years and so we feel good about the momentum and I think a lot of it is really gets back to the blocking and tackling. So the systems will be a benefit, but there's a whole host of other things that we're doing every single day in order to help drive commercial. So we feel good about where we are. Mike Baker : One more question, just the \u2013 can you tell us your buy online, pick up in store percent of e-commerce where I guess customers are coming in -- for going at 20% discount to come into the stores, what percent of your online sales is that? Bill Rhodes : We haven\u2019t given a lot of clarity on that. So think about it as three different buckets. Ship to home, our next day delivery program and buy online, pick up in store. Buy online, pick up in store is the largest of those three segments by a pretty significant margin. So yes, it says that the customer needs that trustworthy advice. They need to figure out what do they need to fix, how do they fix it, do they need the tools, do they need to fix finders, all those things, that's what drives them into the store and that's why this is the perfect channel in my opinion for an omnichannel experience, not just an online experience. Operator : Next we have Chris Horvers of JPMorgan. Jerry Sullivan : This is Jerry Sullivan on for Chris. Your peers reported seeing some pressure from rising fuel costs. What was your experience with fuel this quarter and if fuel was a headwind to margins, were there any offsets on your delivery? Bill Giles : Fuel was a little bit of a headwind, it wasn't significant, but obviously, as you see it as we do as well, we're encouraged by fuel prices coming down as of recent. So I think it was a little bit of a headwind in Q1, not significant, not worth calling out, but we hope that moderates going forward. Operator : Next is Matt McClintock of Barclays. Matt McClintock : So, two questions. The first one is just the next day delivery, follow up on that. I think you were 80% of cities or the country last quarter. Now, you're 85%. Can you give us a sense of the uptake in terms of consumer interest in that offering that you've seen and is that accelerating and how should we think about that in year 2, year 3. Is this something that will build with brand awareness? Bill Rhodes : That's a great question and frankly one that I'm not sure we have wonderful answers to, because we're new on this journey as well. Yes, we went from 80% of the US population to 85% of the US population, including Puerto Rico. I would not expect us to get to 100% and I would think that our growth from here would be fairly limited, because you're talking about less dense areas of the United States. Is it continuing to grow? Absolutely. It's also, I would say, a minuscule part of our business today.  So I don't want to get pumped as up as some massive change in our offering. It is a really good offering for a customer who needs that service and we are certainly the only ones in our sector and frankly probably leading all of retail for a customer to be able to order something as late as 10 PM and have it on their doorstep the next day. But it is again a very small part of our business. I hope it grows and I hope that it satisfies customers and meet some of their needs that couldn't be met yesterday. Matt McClintock : And then just as a follow up, you did a good job of outlining all the improving macro drivers of the business and optimism as we progress through the year, can you talk a little bit about tax refunds? There's a lot of noise out there about that potentially being a pretty strong positive as we get to that season in the spring? Bill Giles : I think we're still trying to learn what's going to happen with tax refunds and frankly every year, we are. What's the timing? That seems to be more certain this year than it was a couple of years ago. The real question is, what are people's withholding rates going to be versus the tax credits that they're getting and this is all a brand new world for everybody. So I don't think we have very good visibility into what that's going to mean. At the end of the day, I can't do anything about it except market into it. We will be marketing into tax season, regardless of whether it's bigger or smaller. So that's where we are at this point. Operator : Next, we have Seth Basham of Wedbush Securities. Seth Basham : My first question is on SG&A guidance. Previously, you guys had talked about 6.5% to 7% SG&A growth for this fiscal year, excluding the impact of the 53rd week, is that time -- is that guidance still intact? Bill Rhodes : Yeah. I would say that guidance is still intact and that would be a little bit towards the lower end of that range, but I would say that that guidance is still intact. Seth Basham : And then my follow up is around the commercial programs. You talked about the engagement of store managers helping drive improvement in commercial sales, can you talk about what you've done to engage them and when you\u2019ve made such changes, including any changes to the incentive compensation structure? Bill Rhodes : We haven't made any changes to the incentive compensation structure. What we have done and again, you have to remember, we did grow up as a retailer. We were a retailer long before we ever got in the wholesale business and most of our management team grew up as retail first, I call it, when they think, they're fastball, it's retail. So one of the things we don't over the last, I guess, starting in the fourth quarter is, we started getting our store managers to make sales calls directly to the customers.  So leave the store and go in the shop and make sales calls. In doing so, they certainly get a better understanding of the commercial business, they also have the opportunity to hear from their customers face to face what's going well and where there are opportunities for improvement and that has just driven their engagement at a very different level than it was before. I applaud our team for coming up with this approach and I think it's working at this point in time. Operator : Thank you. Next line is from Greg Melich of MoffettNathanson. Greg Melich : I had a couple of questions. One is \u2013 and congrats on the quarter, guys. You mentioned, I think, last quarter that the removal of promotions online had hurt comps by 40 bps. Is it fair to assume that putting them back on sort of gave you that -- part of that reacceleration or does it take time for that to kind of come back? And then I had a follow up? Bill Giles : Greg, it definitely was 40 basis points. That was the direct portion and I would say it absolutely came right back. So yes, that was a difference. The question that we had that really is very difficult to answer is there's a lot of customers that are going to our website and our competitors\u2019 websites to look for pricing and availability. If we're out there, without a promotion and others are out there with a promotion, does a customer dig deeper into the website, because of a price perception and therefore even though they're doing in-store purchases, do they -- do we get at a disadvantage about not being that promotional effort? I don't know what the answer to that is. So it's definitely at least 40 basis points. It could be more than that. Greg Melich : And you mentioned tariffs before, could you help us frame that a little bit? It sounds like it's being mitigated really well. What percentage of your cost of goods sold or sales, however you want to cut it, are on the current section 301 list? In other words, if in 60 days or 90 days, if we end up going to 25%, just help us frame what's on the list and what isn't as of today? Bill Giles : I don\u2019t have a number off the top of my head, Greg, to give you exactly what percentage of our CGS is impacted by the current tariffs that are going. Obviously, you\u2019re right. The next round is going to be broader, if it does happen, and obviously, at a higher rate. So there will be some impact from that. Traditionally, the industry's had a very good track record of being able to pass on increased prices to consumers. So we currently expect that to continue, but we'll wait and see. Greg Melich : Was the 2.7 comp this quarter, was that all basket or was there some traffic or transaction count growth? Bill Giles : It's all -- it's predominantly basket. It's not really driven by traffic. Operator : Next is Scot Ciccarelli of RBC. Unidentified Analyst : This is actually [indiscernible] on for Scot Ciccarelli this morning and really nice quarter everybody. A quick question on the commercial side and you talked a lot about it already this morning, but given the industry trends, I guess, how would you think about or how would you attribute the success particularly in this quarter to longer term factors such as the cyclical recovery versus maybe shorter term factors such as the better weather. Bill Giles : I wouldn't really chalk it up to either of those. You have to remember, our market share is only 3% in the commercial business and I think what we do dwarfs anything that's going on in the macro environment. And if you look at the succession of our growth the last three quarters, we've accelerated the growth and basically doubled where we were about a year ago. I don't think there's anything in the macro that would be contributing to that. And I also think, I don't want to overstate that it was what we did in the fourth quarter with sales calls or anything else.  This has been a long standing program to improve our commercial business. If we look at the work that we've done over the last three years on inventory availability, our ability to say yes to our commercial customers needs is vastly different than it was a few years ago. And as I mentioned earlier, the Duralast brand is becoming a really strong brand in the commercial side of the aftermarket. That was not the case years ago, but I think it's more about what we're doing and less about the macro factors. Operator : And our next question in queue is from Bret Jordan of Jefferies. Bret Jordan : Just about a follow up question on the commercial. It sounded as if a lot of what you're picking up is sort of up and down the street independent, commercial customers as demand here is going out, could you talk about what your mix of that independent versus national account is in commercial. Bill Giles : Yeah. I would say it's certainly way over 50%. It's the core of our program and we're spending a lot of time and energy building that side of the businesses as the national accounts as well, but that is a healthy part of the business and continues to grow. Bret Jordan : Any feeling for where you\u2019re taking that share from? Is that mostly the independent distributors that are giving up the smaller commercial customer? Bill Giles : Let me back to what Bill said before, we have such a very small market share today. We view everything as very green field and with significant opportunities. I'm sure we're taking a little bit from everyone. Bret Jordan : And Bill, just a question I guess on inflation for next year, obviously, we don't know what the tariffs will amount to, but when you think about just material costs and higher rates on factoring expense, what do you think is sort of a base case for inflation in 2019? Bill Rhodes : I think it's probably, I don't know for sure, so I hate to get pinned down on a number, but it's probably in the 1% to 2% range. Operator : Thank you. And that was our last question. Back to you, Bill. Bill Rhodes : Okay. Before we conclude the call, I'd like to take a moment to reiterate that our business model continues to be solid. We are excited about our growth prospects for the year. We do not take anything for granted, as we understand our customers have alternatives. We have a solid plan to succeed this fiscal year, but I want to stress that this is a marathon and not a sprint. As we continue to focus on the basics and focus on optimizing long term shareholder value, we're confident AutoZone will continue to be successful. We thank you for participating in today's call and we'd like to wish everyone a very happy and healthy holiday season and a prosperous New Year. Thanks for your time. Operator : That concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

And thank you for joining us today for AutoZone's 2019 Second Quarter Conference Call. With me today are Bill Giles, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax. Regarding the second quarter, I hope you've had an opportunity to read our press release and learned about the quarter's results. If not the press release, along with slides complementing our comments today are available on our website www.autozoneinc.com. Please click on Quarterly Earnings Conference Calls to see them. To begin this morning, I want to thank all AutoZoners across our organization for their dedication, hard work and for putting our customers first in everything they do again this quarter. Their efforts directly correlate to our success. On the last earnings call, we were optimistic about our second quarter, but cautioned everyone about the inherent volatility the second quarter presents to us every single year. It is our lowest sales quarter. It has a couple of holidays that shift year-to-year and different weather patterns make our week-to-week sales quite volatile. As we entered this winter, we knew we had a more normalized winter last year than the two years before. We also knew that the middle of the quarter last year was very strong due to harsh winter conditions. This year, our sales were generally on plan for the first few weeks. Then they were materially softer in the middle of the quarter on both the one and two year basis. Then when the polar vortex arrived sales rebounded nicely to finish the quarter. We wish we didn't have to focus so much on 'the weather' but in the second quarter in particular it really matters. Just to add an exclamation point, our weekly sales during the quarter had a variance of more than $40 million between the highest and lowest weeks. When it gets cold, certain products fail, like batteries. When cold is forecast, any freeze [ph] sales spike. When there's snow and ice plows tear off the roads and create potholes, which lead to other failures, and when the weather is mild, people do maintenance work like crate jobs. While the cold temperatures didn't come until the latter half of January, they came and our business responded. Was the cold enough to have lingering benefits? Yes to some extent, and the lingering effects usually come more from the maintenance side like brake systems, chassis and the like. As spring begins to arrive, so do tax refunds. We've begun to see some customers using their refunds in our stores in the last few weeks. But there is a significant speculation in the media and market on whether or not the total refund dollars will be similar to last year or not. We've seen conflicting reports, but regardless, we are ready to help our customers leverage those refunds to ensure their vehicles are performing well. Now let's focus on the two different customer bases we serve, DIY and DIFM. We previously mentioned that our DIY market share gains were strong in the first half of last fiscal year and that growth materially subsided in the second half. During the first half of this year, our market share has continued to grow and improved slightly, which we consider encouraging as we are lapping the large gains we made this time last year. While DIY same store sales were slightly positive for the second quarter and for the year-to-date, we are optimistic that business can continue to grow for the remainder of the year. Our optimism comes from the parts and staffing initiatives we have in place. If you recall this time last year, we had several major product category conversions underway and several of them did not go as planned. This year we are in much better shape as we enter the selling season. And we have intensified our focus on enhancing the customer service experience. As part of our effort, we made meaningful pay adjustments to our most tenured hourly AutoZoners to ensure that they are compensated appropriately. We feel we are well positioned as we enter our peak selling period. Regarding commercial, our sales growth eclipsed last quarter's double-digit gains ending up 12.9%, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of accelerating growth. We are excited about, but not surprised by this growth acceleration. We have been steadily building a stronger foundation and our customers are continuing to notice, recognize and reward those improvements. Over the last several years, we have substantially improved our inventory availability. We have worked diligently to enhance the quality of the parts and products we sell. Many under the Duralast name. Our sales force is becoming more tenured and effective and most notably recently we have been increasing the engagement of the local store teams, particularly the store manager and district manager, and we feel well-positioned to continue strong growth for the balance of the year. Overall, we are encouraged as we head into the back half of the year. We are focused on flawlessly executing on the initiatives we have in place. While we have invested more on our AutoZoners and more in our systems, we have done so with the objective of improving customer facing activities. Our execution is improving as we intensify our focus on the customer. As I mentioned the last quarter's earnings call, our annual operating theme for 2019 is focused on drive for excellence. A relentless focus on what matters to our customers, exceptional service, fast deliveries, high quality parts and products, flawless execution, changes in product assortments and store merchandising and on and on. We are focused on reducing non-selling tasks in our stores in order to reallocate that time, talent and attention to sales activities. Tariffs have been a hot topic of late, so we'd like to address their impact on us. The initial tariffs on raw materials weren't significant. The 10% tariffs were expanded to broader and broader categories. We did not see a material cost increase from these tariffs in fiscal 2018, because we were able to negotiate and offset some of the tariffs based on the strength of the U.S. dollar. Looking forward, the U.S. has agreed to postpone plans to increase tariffs from 10% to 25% until later. At this point, we are waiting like you are. We will continue to monitor developments closely and working with our industry associations to share our concerns about the potential negative ramifications of ongoing and increased tariffs to our customers and the broader economy. That said, our industry has much lower elasticity of demand than most other retail distribution sectors. If your car won't start and you have to go to work, you or someone else has to fix it. This phenomenon has historically allowed our industry to pass on product inflation in higher retails. To date, the tariffs has not resulted in meaningful incremental inflation in retail pricing and unless the tariffs increase to 25% or added to other products we sell, we don't anticipate this being materially different in the second half of the year. Turning to our omnichannel efforts. We continue to invest in our strategy to enhance the customer shopping experience by meeting them when, where and how they want to shop. We have initiatives in place to improve our in-store systems and websites autozone.com AutoZonePro, mobile and ALLDATA. In fact, we are investing more than ever before this fiscal year in improving these systems. We continued to see rapid growth in website traffic, as well as Ship-To-Home and Buy Online Pick Up In Store sales. While representing a very small percentage of our business, we are pleased with the acceleration of growth in our online platforms in both retail and commercial. And for retail through Ship To Home Buy Online Pick Up In Store and through our industry leading next-day delivery program that allows customers in over 85% of U.S. markets to order as late as 10 :00 P.M. and oh by the way, we're testing midnight in a couple of markets and receive their products at their home the very next day. We are also working diligently to further enhance our digital capabilities with our commercial customers to ensure that they have a great seamless intuitive no hassle way to interact with us digitally. In summary, we're pleased with our recent performance and encouraged about our industry and our prospects for the remainder of fiscal 2019 and beyond. Macro factors are currently in our favor and we remain committed to not only maintaining, but growing our market share in both DIY and commercial. Now, let me provide more detail on the quarter. For the quarter, total auto parts sales increased 3.1% and domestic same-store sales were up 2.6%. As a reminder, we sold IMC in the middle of fiscal 2018, so our total domestic sales comparisons include sales from that business in the total number, but those sales have no bearing on the same-store sales results in Q2. Regionally, our Northeastern Midwestern and mid-Atlantic markets representing roughly 28% of our sales performed 13 basis points better than the remaining markets. During the quarter, we opened 20 new stores in the United States and our commercial business opened 22 net new programs. We expect to open approximately 150 net new commercial programs this fiscal year. Currently 85% of our domestic stores have a commercial program. During the quarter, we continue to expand in Mexico opening one new store. We also opened two new stores in Brazil this quarter finishing with 22. Regarding our inventory initiatives in the spirit of our YES! We've Got It initiative, we continued our efforts around expanding our hub store network. We opened two additional hubs this past quarter and now have 171 hub stores and an additional 27 mega-hubs totaling 198 stores with significantly expanded parts assortments. As we have seen both our DIY and commercial sales expand in markets where hub, mega hubs are added we will continue to grow the number of hubs we have this year. Having opened four already, we expect to open as many as 16 hubs for the full year with most being mega hubs. As a reminder, both our hubs and mega-hubs are focused on making available additional coverage to the local markets, meaning, adding SKUs that would not have been available locally in our network before. Previously, we relied on shipping these hard to find or slower turning SKUs into a market when the demand arose. Both of these efforts are designed to enhance our ability to meet our customer's needs for coverage and immediacy. Along with improving our local parts availability and assortment, we continue to manage this organization to provide exceptional service for our customers, provide our AutoZoners with a great place to work with opportunities for advancement and ensure we do it in a long term profitable basis to provide strong returns for our shareholders. We remain focused on the importance of going the extra mile to fulfill our customers' needs regardless of how difficult the request. Sales in our other businesses for the quarter were down 41.4% versus last year's second quarter which reflect the sale of AutoAnythinng during fiscal 2018. We will continue to make our omnichannel selling efforts a key focus for 2019. While Ship-To-Home - Ship-To-Home next day, Buy Online Pick Up In Store and commercial customer order - ordering are all showing growth and more traffic to our online sites, we continue to see customers primarily doing lots of research online and then coming into the store in order to receive trustworthy advice, Fix Finder, Loan-A-Tool and a host of services that simply cannot be duplicated online prior to making the sale. Our efforts in 2019 are to make sure our AutoZoners are freed up in stores to provide WOW! Customer Service to every single customer. While, our online sales are small substantially less than 5% of our total sales, the omnichannel experience is very important for the customer experience. So we will continue to invest in our digital platforms. With the continued aging of the car population and recently lower gas prices at the pump, these are contributing to our optimism regarding 2018 for both DIY and commercial. These trends remain encouraging. Along with our operating theme for 2019 Drive for Excellence, we create key priorities each year. For 2019, these priorities are, customer's first, commercial acceleration, omnichannel, leveraging technology and YES! We've Got It inventory initiatives. We are spending a significant amount of time across the organization, but especially in stores identifying areas where tasks can be simplified, streamlined or eliminated in order to free up time for our AutoZoners to focus intensely on customers and their needs. We are also making further technology investments to improve our electronic catalog and point-of-sale systems to ensure we are putting customers first. We believe our current and future technology investments will improve our competitive position and lead to sales growth across all of our businesses. While these investments are adding to both operating expense and capital expense, we feel this is - will meaningfully improve the customer shopping experience. Regarding commercial acceleration. We've been investing in systems to help AutoZoners sell more efficiently and customers conduct business with us easier. While most of these initiatives won't be rolled out until late calendar 2019 or even later, our focus on increasing the engagement of the broader store team and focusing on existing customers is paying off today. We are quite pleased with our momentum heading into the new calendar year. We should once again highlight another strong performance to return on invested capital as we were able to finish our second quarter at 33.5%. We continue to be pleased with this metric as it is one of the best in all of hardlines retailing. However, our primary focus has been and continues to be that we ensure every incremental dollar of capital that we deploy in this business provides an acceptable return well in excess of our cost of capital. It is important to reinforce that we will always maintain our diligence regarding capital stewardship, as the capital we invest is our investor's capital. Before I pass the discussion over to Bill Giles to talk about our financial results, I'd like to again thank and reinforce how appreciative we are about our AutoZoners efforts to continue to meet and exceed our customer's expectations. We are excited about all the initiatives we are working on throughout 2019, but everything must start with the efforts of our exceptional AutoZoners. Now I'll turn the call over to Bill Giles? Bill? Bill Giles : Thanks Bill. Good morning, everyone. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to talk more specifically about our domestic retail, commercial and international results. For the quarter, total auto parts sales which include our domestic retail and commercial businesses, our Mexico and Brazil stores increased 3.1% and for the trailing 52-weeks ended total sales per AutoZone stores were $1.8 million. Total commercial sales increased 12.9% in the quarter commercial represented 21% of our total sales and grew $59 million over last year's Q2. We are now averaging just under $10,000 a week and commercial sales per program. On a trailing four quarters, we are now selling over $2.3 billion commercially. We now have our commercial program in 4,788 stores or 85% of our domestic stores. And as Bill mentioned earlier, we remain committed to gaining market share with our commercial customers. We are encouraged by the initiatives we have in place and feel we can further grow sales and market share. Our Mexico stores continued to perform well. We opened one new store during the second quarter ending the quarter with 568 stores. We expect to open approximately 40 new stores in fiscal 2019. Regarding Brazil, we now operate 22 stores. We have aggressive plans of approximately 17 additional stores by the end of the fiscal 2019. Our performance continues to improve and we remain optimistic about the long term future of this market. If we can prove success, this market has the potential to be much larger than Mexico, so while challenging the potential side of this market is significant. Gross margin for the quarter was 54.1% of sales, up 115 basis points from last year's second quarter. The increase in gross margin was primarily attributable to the impact of the sale of the two businesses completed last fiscal year and higher merchandise margins. While we're asked about gross margin assumptions and direction they will be headed, our primary focus has always been growing absolute gross profit dollars in our total auto parts segment. SG&A for the quarter was 37.7% of sales, lower by approximately 667 basis points from last year's second quarter. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales benefited 800 basis points versus last year's Q2, due to the impairment charge related to the sale of the two businesses, partially offset by the planned increase in store payroll, primarily domestic and investments in technology. On the cost front, we highlighted on last few quarters conference calls the investments we will be making, specifically wage rates and technology for this fiscal year. For the remainder of the year, we feel that consensus numbers for SG&A generally reflect those investments. However, I'd also want to remind everyone that fiscal 2019 includes a 53rd week, I bring this up to make sure analysts model that last quarter accordingly, and we encourage everyone to look to the last time we had a 53rd week which is Q4, 2013 as litmus test for modeling. EBIT for the quarter was $400 million. Our EBIT margin was 16.3%. Interest expense for the quarter was $41 million, up slightly from Q2 a year ago. We are planning interest in the $44 million to $45 million range in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 versus $42 million last year. Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $5.1 billion or approximately $70 million above last year's Q2 ending balance of $5 billion. Our adjusted debt level metric finished the quarter at 2.5 times EBITDAR. While in any given quarter we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on management's opinion regarding debt and equity market positions, we remain committed to both our investment grade rating and our capital allocation strategy and share repurchases are an important element of that strategy. For the quarter our tax rate was 17.9%. Along with tax reform, we benefited 386 basis points in our rates from stock options exercised during the quarter. Excluding this benefit, our rate was 21.7%. Because it is impossible to predict when individuals will exercise options, we encourage everyone to model up on a rate assuming no stock option impact and roughly around 24% and we will report both rates. Net income for the quarter was $295 million, up 1.8% over last year. Our diluted share count of 25.7 million was down 8% from last year's second quarter. The combination of these factors drove earnings per share for the quarter to $11.49, up 10.7% over the prior year's second quarter. Relating to the cash flow statement for the second quarter, we generated $368 million of operating cash flow and net fixed assets were up 4.6% versus last year, capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $97.7 million and reflected the additional expenditures required to open 23 net new stores this quarter. Capital expenditures on existing stores, hub and mega hub remodels or openings, work on the development of new stores for upcoming quarters and information technology investments. With the new stores opened, we finished this past quarter with 5,651 stores in 50 states in the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. 568 stores in Mexico and 22 in Brazil for a total AutoZone store count of 6,241. Depreciation totaled $83.8 million for the quarter versus last year's second quarter expense of $79.4 million. This is generally in line with recent quarter growth rates. We repurchased $350 million of AutoZone stock in the second quarter. At quarter end, we had $635 million remaining under our share buyback authorization, and our leverage metric was 2.5 times at quarter end. Again, I want to stress we managed to appropriate credit ratings and not any one metric. The metric we report is meant as a guide only, as each rating firm has its own criteria. We continue to view our share repurchase program as an attractive capital deployment strategy. Next, I'd like to update you on our inventory levels in total and on a per store basis. The company's inventory increased 5.4% over the same period last year, driven by new stores and increased product placement. Inventory per location was $690,000 versus $671,000 last year and $658,000 this past quarter. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable on a per location basis was a negative $58,000 versus negative $46,000 last year and a negative $59,000 last quarter. As a result, the accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 108.5%. Finally, as Bill previously mentioned, our continued disciplined capital management approach resulted in a return on invested capital for the trailing four quarters of 33.5%. We have and will continue to make investments that we believe will generate returns that significantly exceed our cost of capital. Now, I'll turn it back to Bill Rhodes. Bill Rhodes : Thank you, Bill. While we had a strong start to our fiscal year, we know we have much work to do to finish this year strong. Our spring and summer periods generate a majority of our annual sales, and we'll be opening up a majority of our new stores and new commercial programs during this time period. What keeps us incurs [ph] is the relentless focus we have on servicing our customers better and simplifying our AutoZoners work especially at the store level to reduce clutter and unnecessary tasks that get in the way of making the customer experience better for both our do-it-yourself customer and our professional customer. We believe our industry's fundamentals remain very strong and are likely improving with the price of gas at the pump down versus last year. This upcoming quarter, we are focused on both macro and internally driven initiatives. We are certainly monitoring the pace and amount of tax returns as this could either a significant benefit or a detractor based on the total refund dollars that are processed. And we are most excited with the sales tracks that we have been gaining especially in our commercial business. We are excited about our balanced model for growth around domestic retail and commercial, international, online and Pickup In Store. We believe our hubs and mega-hubs Mexico, Brazil, ALLDATA and e-commerce can all grow their top lines in 2019. To execute at a high level, we have consistently - we have to consistently adhere to Living the Pledge. We cannot and will not take our eye off of execution. We must stay committed to executing day in and day out on our game plan. Success will be achieved with an attention to detail and exceptional execution. Service has always been our most important cultural cornerstone and it will be long into the future. Our charge remains to optimize our performance regardless of market conditions and continue to ensure that we are investing in the key initiatives that will drive our long-term performance. In the end, delivering strong EPS growth and ROIC each and every quarter is how we measure ourselves. This formula has been extremely successful over now nearly 40 years and we continue to be excited about our future. Now, I would like to open up the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question comes from Christopher Horvers from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Christopher Horvers : Thanks. Good morning, guys. First question is on the gross margin outlook. Bill, you mentioned that you are focusing more on gross profit dollars. I think in the past you talked about - you saw some opportunities in terms of some gross market rate expansion going forward. So how are you thinking about the merchandise margin going forward? And related to that, did this quarter include any benefit from - through the early timing, or early receipts related to tariffs or anything with managing the tariff through? Bill Giles : I would say probably not. I mean, as we mentioned we had about 70 basis point impact, positive impact from the sale of the two business units, so far it be, a little less than half of that in next quarter. Excluding that our margin remains relatively healthy. So we are up about 44 basis points this quarter. I think the merchandising organization has done a terrific job. They are sourcing the opportunities that they've done and managing inventory. So overall, we've been pretty sharp on our margin. We are going to continue to have pressure on margin as our commercial business continues to grow at significantly faster rate than our DIY business. So we continue to expect to see that margin benefit that you will see [ph] come down a little bit over time, but we'll continue to be driving gross margin dollars. Christopher Horvers : Understood. And then a follow up on your comment around 4Q, including the 53rd week. As you looked at the consensus numbers, where do you think people aren't picking it up? Is it a sales question, is it expenses, is it earnings? Where do you think the consensus isn't picking up that 53rd week? Bill Giles : Yeah, I'm not calling out that they are not picking it up necessarily. I just wanted to make sure that others - that we highlighted it for anyone who isn't just so that when we get to the fourth quarter there will be no mystery about it and I would encourage you to just go back to 2013 to see how that's kind of laid out. But I'm not calling out anything specifically about the consensus estimates for the 53rd week. Christopher Horvers : Understood. And then last question, you know, the commercial growth is really impressive as was the acceleration, especially in light of the weather issues in the middle of the quarter. Can you talk about what the primary drivers are, do you think it's the mega hubs that's driving the improvement, is it the sales effort and any delineation there? And then related to that on the mega hubs, are you starting to transition to more same base fulfillment out of the mega hubs? Or is it still primarily an overnight fulfillment stores? Thank you. Bill Rhodes : Yeah, terrific question Chris. First of all, I think the growth in our commercial business and the acceleration in that growth which we are quite pleased with as well is coming because of a long list of issues that we've been - or initiatives we've been embarking on for the last several years. We really started this inventory availability efforts probably four years ago now. They were first focused on in-store, placements and improvements in inventory there that were more focused on the commercial business. They then evolved to our hub stores and now our mega hub stores. I think the other big thing that we are doing this year is we have really put a lot of focus on getting our in-store teams very focused on customer service in the commercial business. So our store managers are now making sales calls and they are making sales calls, but the biggest thing they are doing is they are making customer service calls. And they are understanding where we're doing really well and their understanding where we have opportunities for improvement. And then they are going back and doing what they do. They are managing the store operations, but focused much more today than a year or two ago on the commercial operations as well. As we look at the mega hubs, one other big element and I want to talk about in commercial, is the Duralast brand. If we had this call 10 years ago, I think most of the people listening to it would have thought that the Duralast brand was a net negative. Make no mistake about it, the Duralast brand is a big positive for our commercial business. And as we've improved the product quality and as we improved the assortments, we are really excited about what it means to our long-term growth potential. As far as your question specifically on the mega hubs and are we increasing the same-day service? Yes, every time we open one, we increase the amount of stores that get same day or even three time a day service. So, whatever stores are attached directly to that mega hub will immediately get three time a day access to that inventory. If there are other hubs that are in the local market that they can get to, those hubs will also get service between one and three times a day on a same day basis. So absolutely as we open more and more mega hubs, we are increasing the same day service. Christopher Horvers : Thanks, guys. Bill Rhodes : All right. Thank you. Christopher Horvers : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Michael Lasser from UBS. Your line is now open. Michael Lasser : Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Bill, your comments around the late tax refund, should we interpret that to mean that the business has slowed given that tax refund are down materially year-over-year in the last few week? Bill Rhodes : Yeah, It's a fantastic question, Michael. And frankly one that I don't want to spend too much time on. As you well know, we have a - we released our earning so soon after the end of the quarter. So our quarter ended 17 days ago or so. And so I don't like to spend any time on what's going on in such a short period of time, I just don't think it's productive and I know you all are looking at the long-term anyway. But to your point, so far in the tax refund season, through last Friday, which we've all seen the numbers, we're down about 40%. I think it's $100 million through last Friday this time last year and it's $60 billion - $100 billion and $60 billion this year. Clearly that is impactful to our business. We talked every single year over the last decade about the importance of tax refund season. I think that it's going to be really interesting to see what transpires over the next couple of weeks. The child income tax credit and earned income - child tax credit and earned income tax credit both have been delayed. We haven see those dollars. I think the expectation is they will begin to flow this week. We are anxiously awaiting them and we are going to make sure we are in very good shape and prepared to take advantage of whatever tax monies flow. At the end of the day, there is nothing we can do about it. We are ready for them and look forward to seeing those dollars, but nothing else we can do beyond that. Michael Lasser : I understood. That's helpful commentary. My follow-up question is your tone around price increases and the impact from tariffs related inflation on your business in the contrast a bit with what the others in the industry are saying. They are calling out clearly a benefit to the comp - their comps from some inflation that pushed through if only because of from a tariff. Why you think what you're seeing is different than them? Bill Rhodes : Yeah, I think it's a great question. We're asking ourselves the same question, because frankly we're not seeing additional inflation over what we historically have seen. So I'm not sure what they are seeing in their numbers. As I mentioned in our prepared remarks even with the tariffs that we saw at the same times that those tariffs happened the currency fluctuations where tariffs were up and the currencies was up 8%, so we were able to negotiate a significant amount of those increases away. So we haven't seen material changes one way or the other. Michael Lasser : Understood. Good luck with the rest of the year. Bill Rhodes : Thank you, Michael. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Simeon Gutman [Morgan Stanley]. Your line is now open. Simeon Gutman : I apologize I missed a couple of the first questions. So hopefully this isn't repetitive. My first question is on the gross margin theme, and I assume it's being helped to some degree by private brand. I wanted to ask you how contentious your internal debate is around investing more into price versus letting gross margin go up. Because as you know the bogyman of the space has been online and pricing and we get intrigued by that question a lot. So you are allowing the gross to grow up. How big of a debate is it internally to push pricing down? Bill Giles : Yeah. I would say it's not necessarily debate per se. I mean, we're going to be priced right and within the marketplace, and we're going to remain competitive. And our value of proposition obviously is well beyond just pricing. As Bill actually mentioned in his prepared remarks, there's an awful lot of service that take place for both our DIY customers and our commercial customers both, as far as delivering products to our commercial customers or servicing the customer inside the DIY store with either Fix Finder, testing batteries, testing starters. So there is all sorts of service that takes place inside of store. So it's really beyond just pricing, but we're going to remain competitive in pricing and we're going to just continue to be aggressive about sourcing and finding opportunities to lower acquisition cost that will keep up our margin healthy. We obviously have had good improvement in margin over the last quarter - over the last several quarters. We expect our margin to remain healthy, but we also recognize that as our commercial business grows at an accelerated rate over DIY that will continue to put pressure on margin. So you may not see as big as increases in the future. Simeon Gutman : Okay. Thanks. And then my follow-up is on the commercial sales, the composition of the 13% gain this quarter. Can you tell us what was a bigger driver, sales for commercial account or the number of accounts that you're picking up? Bill Rhodes : I would say it's across the board. It was customer account increases, it was average ticket increases, it was new customers, it was up and down the street customers, it was national account customers. We're seeing it, Simeon, across the board. We've seen that momentum continue to grow over about that last year and I think it's because we're working on the foundational elements that are important to the customer. Simeon Gutman : And can I just follow-up to that, are there certain product categories where your share gains are outsized or are you seeing like breadth across all of your product categories? Bill Rhodes : Yeah. There is one category in particular where our gains are high, but it's not driving our overall performance and that's because there are some supply disruptions in the marketplace. Those things are always happening. As we talked last year, we had several high disruptions on our behalf last year. But it's really across the board from - but mainly focused on our hard points. There is not a lot of commodity sales growth. It's maintenance and failure of parts is where we're growing our business. Simeon Gutman : Okay. Thank you both. Good quarter. Bill Rhodes : Thank you. Bill Giles : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Dan Wewer from Raymond James. Your line is now open. Dan Wewer : Yeah. Thanks. Bill you talked a lot about the big growth in Mexico and Brazil. Can you remind us how the economics of the stores compared to the U.S. perhaps talk about sales per store and operating margin rate? And then also curious as to why you're more upbeat long term about Brazil and Mexico, is it just the size of the population or there other benefits? Bill Rhodes : Yeah, terrific questions. We haven't gone into a lot of specifics of our business in either one. Mexico, we've been there for 20 years now and we have a really nice robust business, and the team down there has done a fantastic job and they really leveraged the AutoZone culture. The proudest thing that I have every time I'm down there is just to look and see how much they've replicated what has made AutoZone special in the United States. As for Brazil, I was actually there last week. We had to talk a whole lot about that business except we mention that we're losing a sizable amount of money down there today. We have 22 stores. We've been there for six years, 6.5 years now. It's slow going because we're trying to make sure that we figure it out. The one thing that we have solved for sure is that it works for the Brazilian customer. The customer traffic flow that we have down there is really terrific. It's exciting to see every time I go down there, I get inspired and encouraged about what could be. The economics don't work for us yet. That's because we have 22 stores. We've got a big overhead structure in place and warehouse structure in place. We're still developing the vendor relationships that we need and we're optimistic about the future, but we haven't passed that final test phase yet. What makes us excited and the reason we're there is it can be a really, really sizable market. So the size of the prize could be significant. One of the things we talked about last year when we sold IMC and AutoAnything is that they just couldn't ever be material drivers of the performance of AutoZone. Well Brazil is the exact opposite of that. We could easily have 1000 stores in Brazil if we can make it work for us financially, but we have not finished checking that box yet. Dan Wewer : Okay. And then just second question on the accelerated SG&A spend in 2019. Do you expect the SG&A growth to increase at the same rate in fiscal year '20? Or does that moderate closer to historic levels? Bill Giles : It should moderate to more historical levels. I mean, we made some significant investments this year both on wages where we really invested in our most tenured and talented AutoZoners that are facing our customers every day. That investment was made at the tail end of Q1. And so when we - we will continue to have an accelerated SG&A growth rate until the point in time in which we anniversary that. And we also have been making some technology investments throughout the year as well. But Dan, I think if you look past FY '20 or fiscal year '20 when you get past the first quarter of fiscal year '20 then you should begin to see some more historical growth rates on our SG&A spend. Dan Wewer : Okay. Great. Thank you. Bill Rhodes : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Speakers, the next question comes from Seth Basham from Wedbush Securities. Your line is now open. Seth Basham : Thanks a lot and good morning. Bill Rhodes : Good morning. Seth Basham : My question for you is around mega-hubs build and you talked about increasing your mega-hub count and success [ph] best strategy. Can you give us some perspective for the mega-hubs that have been open for more than a year and markets that they serve, do they continue to outcome the company average? Bill Rhodes : Yeah, I would say particularly the mega-hub itself will significantly outcome because it's got a significant inventory assortment. But the stores attached to it will generally grow certainly in the first year more and then it will moderate, but they will continue to outcome a little bit. Seth Basham : That's helpful perspective. So when you think about the improvement in commercial sales trends in the last few quarters, how would you attribute the breakdown between increased availability through your mega hub and hub strategy relative to your increased engagement in the store teams? Bill Rhodes : You know, I think the bigger thing that we've changed year-over-year is the engagement of the store teams. This mega hub and inventory availability work, as I mentioned a few minutes ago, that's been going on for four years. We continue to get better and better at it and I think the customer continues to appreciate it more and more, just like they are continuing to appreciate the Duralast brand more and more. But I think the big - the biggest change that we made is the store manager into district manager engagement and it really makes a difference. Seth Basham : Thank you very much and good luck. Bill Rhodes : All right. Thanks, Seth. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Bret Jordan from Jeffries. Your line is now open. Unidentified Analyst : This is Mark Jordan on for Bret. Good morning. Bill Rhodes : Good morning. Unidentified Analyst : Just looking at the commercial growth here again, digging a little deeper, it sounds like you're taking share here and just thinking about the growth, are we taking maybe some national accounts or signing a more independent garages, just trying to think where it's going from here? Bill Rhodes : Yeah, as I mentioned in a minute ago, we're re seeing really good growth on both the up and down the street accounts, the national accounts, the specific sectors of the national accounts from the tire stores to the - buy here, pay here folks. We're really picking it up across the board. There's not really a standout difference. And as I mentioned, we're also seeing it in maintenance and failure parts primarily. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Great. And then just one more on mega hubs and hubs here, it looks like maybe 12 more in the back half of the year, mostly mega hubs. How should we think about the cadence of those openings? Are they more maybe - Q3, Q4 weighted? Bill Giles : Yeah, I think we'll probably just be ratably open throughout the remainder of the year. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Thank you for taking my questions. Thank you. Bill Rhodes : Thank you. Have a good day. Operator : Thank you. Speakers, the next question comes from Brian Nagel from Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Brian Nagel : Hi. Good morning. Bill Rhodes : Good morning. Brian Nagel : Nice quarter. Bill Rhodes : Thanks. Brian Nagel : I too wanted to discuss a bit the commercial growth, I know there's a number of questions on it already. But if you look into your business you know, clearly the rate of sales growth in commercial has pick up very nicely, however, you're taking market share, you know, this comes on the hills now of several years of significant investment in the business. So with regard to the investment, how much opportunity remains to so to say continue to build out the infrastructure of your commercial operation from here or is it more a function of continue - just continue to gain share? Bill Rhodes : I think it's a fantastic question and one that frankly we can't answer for you today. When you think about it, our retail business has 15% market share. Even with all this excitement that we have around how well we're going, we still have 3% share in commercial. We got a long way to go. What do we do to crack that code to get it to 5% share, 10% share, 15% share over time, I think we're still trying to figure that out. What I am excited about is while we're trying to figure out some bigger potential possibilities, we are doing the day-to-day blocking and tackling which is leading to our accelerated growth and it feels like it's more sustainable when you do it that way. Brian Nagel : Got it. And then within that as a follow-up to that, are there markets and I understand there is competitive dynamic. But are there other markets within your system that you have - you do enjoy outsized market share in the commercial side that could sort of say serve as a roadmap for the business in general? Bill Rhodes : There is clearly markets that - you know, maybe the market share might be double what it is in some markets. But we don't have 10% or 15% share in any markets. We're going to. We just haven't figured it out yet. Brian Nagel : Got it. And then there's one final question. With regard to wage inflation, I think you may have address this in prepared comments, and we talked a lot about higher wages is a somewhat of a negative headwind to earnings growth. Where are we on that front? Bill Rhodes : Well, we've been talking about higher wages and higher wage growth at AutoZone for over a couple of years now. We did take that significant step as Bill mentioned in the latter part of the first quarter and we significantly increased the compensation of our most tenured and talented and knowledgeable AutoZoners at the hourly level. The ones that are closest to the customer. That will anniversary itself as he mentioned in the latter part of this first quarter. That said, I do think that you have two parts of the wage story that's been going on. One is the regulatory fees, where in places like California they are on a path to $15 an hour and that's going to happen every year or every six months depending on if you are in a municipality or at the state level. So those increases are going to continue. It still feels like to us that there is even outside of the regulated areas that there is more wage pressure than there has historically been. I think that has a lot to do with where we are in the economic cycle right now. Will that continue? I think it depends on what happens with the economic cycle. Brian Nagel : Thank you very much. Bill Rhodes : All right. Thank you. Have a great day. Bill Rhodes : All right. Well, thank you all for joining us today. Before we conclude the call, I'd like to take a moment to reiterate that our business model continues to be solid. We are excited about our growth process for the year. We do not take anything for granted as we understand our customers have alternatives. We will continue to execute on our game plan to succeed this fiscal year. But I want to stress that this is a marathon and not a sprint. As we continue to focus on the basics and focus on optimizing long-term shareholder value, we are confident AutoZone will continue to be successful. We thank you for participating in today's call. Have a great day. Operator : That concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Bill Rhodes : Good morning and thank you for joining us today for AutoZone\u2019s 2019 third quarter conference call. With me today are Bill Giles, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax. Regarding the third quarter, I hope you have had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter\u2019s results. If not the press release along with slides complementing our comments today is available on our website www.autozoneinc.com. Please click on quarterly earnings conference calls to see them. To begin this morning, I want to thank all AutoZoners across the organization for their commitment to our company\u2019s pledge especially putting our customers first in everything that they do. Their passion for living our culture and surprising and delighting customers is our greatest strength. Overall, we were pleased with our performance for the third quarter. Our commercial sales again accelerated from the previous quarter and we posted the highest sales increase in DIFM since the fourth quarter of 2012. Our DIY business also remained solid. The quarter began very soft as tax refunds were delayed and as late February saw milder weather with significant precipitation. Once tax refunds began in earnest in early March, our sales rebounded nicely and remained pretty consistent for the remainder of the quarter. Yes, heavy precipitation in certain weeks slowed trends in both DIY and commercial, but that\u2019s normal in the spring. Ultimately, we were pleased with our sales performance in both retail and commercial for Q3 ending the quarter with same-store sales growth of 3.9%. Now, let\u2019s focus on the two different customer bases we serve, DIY and DIFM. We previously mentioned that our DIY market share gains were strong in the first half of last fiscal year and that growth materially subsided in the second half. This year, based upon the data available to us, our share gains are accelerating. While our retail business is far more mature than our commercial business, we were pleased with our performance in Q3 and remain optimistic about the fourth quarter and beyond. Our optimism comes from the inventory availability and staffing initiatives that we have in place. Our constant focus on enhancing the customer service experience is making a difference. As a reminder, last fall we made meaningful wage adjustments to our most tenured hourly AutoZoners to ensure they were being compensated appropriately and consistent with market trends. We believe these adjustments have and will continue to help us attract and retain high quality talent that is providing WOW! Customer Service! It\u2019s imperative to remember the high touch nature of this business and the vital role our highly knowledgeable AutoZoners play to help our customers maintain and enhance their vehicles. Regarding commercial, our sales growth eclipsed last quarter\u2019s double-digit gains, increasing 14.9% marking another great quarter of growth. We are encouraged by this acceleration and it has been a focused effort from us for quite some time. We have been steadily building a stronger foundation and our customers are continuing to notice, recognize and reward those improvements. Over the last several years, we have improved our product coverage and we worked diligently to enhance the quality of the parts and products we sell many under the Duralast name. Our buying team has done an excellent job in identifying opportunities where our coverage could be improved, where we could improve on the already high quality parts we have and do it all at a good cost, so we can provide our customers a good value. And our sales force continues to do an ever improving job of communicating our offerings. As I have said on our last conference call, we have been increasing the engagement of the store teams particularly the store managers and district managers with our customers. Yes, they are making sales calls, but they are really making customer service calls where they can find where we are at selling and do more other. And also here are areas for improvement, rest assured, these women and men they will have to drive our customer service. And now they have improved visibility on our opportunities. We estimate our market share is roughly 3% of the industry and we are excited about the significant opportunity to further capture market share. Overall, we are encouraged with our ongoing initiatives. While we have invested more in our a AutoZoners inventory and systems, we have done so with the objective of improving customer facing activities, while we are never perfect, we believe our execution is improving as we intensify our focus on the customer. I would also like to remind everyone that last year we highlighted that in Q3 and Q4 we had an abnormal level of category changeovers, a few of which that had not gone as planned and we are undergoing substantial changes to our supply chain. While we always have some level of disruption occurring as we make changes to our offerings, this year\u2019s level of activity is more normal and substantially below last year. As I mentioned on last quarter\u2019s earnings call, our annual operating theme for 2019, is focused on drive for excellence, a relentless focus on what matters to our customers, exceptional service, fast deliveries, high quality parts and products, flawless execution of changes in product assortments, in-store merchandising and on and on. As part of this initiative, we have challenged our store leadership teams to reduce the time committed to redundant our non-customer facing activities. Although early, we have identified opportunities to improve the effectiveness of our AutoZoners in performing store tests, ultimately allowing them to increase customer facing time. Over the course of last year or so, there has been significant focus on tariffs and inflation. After months of being in a steady state the United States increased tariffs with China recently. When the first tariffs were active in September, we said we were able to negotiate many of the increases away due to the change in the Chinese currency. As the additional tariffs were just added, it is too early for us to know the implications. That said, if we do in fact experience higher costs, it will be our intention to pass those higher costs on to our customers as it has been our practice and our industry\u2019s practice for some time. As a result of the tariffs there has been an elevated discussion of what is happening in our sectors regarding inflation. Over many, many years our average unit retails have grown at a mid single-digit level as the parts and products we are selling have more technology or higher cost materials in them and that makes them last longer. But average unit retail is different than inflation, because the former includes new products while inflation is a same SKU comparison. Historically, as evidenced by our substantial unrecorded negative LIFO reserve, we generally have experienced deflation in same SKU product costs. This often occurs because as new products are introduced, they are being made in small quantities. As volumes increase, so do efficiencies and costs come down. This year, we have experienced a small amount of inflation, while our average unit retails have increased slightly faster than normal. Turning to our omni-channel efforts, we continue to invest in our strategy to enhance the customer shopping experience by meeting them when, where and how they want to shop. We have initiatives in place to improve our in-store systems and websites autozone.com, autozonepro.com mobile and ALLDATA. We are investing heavily in systems to support these shopping patterns. We continue to see rapid growth in website traffic, as well as ship-to-home and buy online pick-up in-store sales, while representing a very small percentage of our business, substantially below 5%, we are pleased with how the customer is embracing all our offerings. Last quarter, we discussed our next day delivery program that allows customers in over 85% of the US markets to order as late as 10 :00 p.m. and receive their products at their home the very next day we are even testing midnight cut offs in a couple of markets. We continue to expand to more markets, and I would be remiss if I didn\u2019t say, we are working diligently to further enhance our digital capabilities with our commercial customers. The improvements with the online commercial offering will be ongoing, as we know, we have ample opportunities for improvement, which once addressed will allow us to make inroads with certain customers that have not bought from us in the past and will allow us to further grow our business with existing customers, many of which are the more sophisticated shops. While ship-to-home next day, buy online pick-up in-store and commercial customer ordering are all showing growth and traffic to our online sites has continued \u2013 continuing to increase at rapid rates. In our retail business, we continue to see customers primarily doing lots of research online and then coming into the store in order to receive trustworthy advice, Fix Finder, Loan-A-Tool and a host of other services that simply cannot be duplicated online prior to making the sale. Our efforts in 2019 are to make sure our AutoZoners are freed up in stores to provide WOW! Customer Service! to every one of those customers. In summary, we are pleased with our performance and remain encouraged with our industry strength in both DIY and DIFM and our prospects for the remainder of 2019. Macro factors have largely been in our favor, and we remain committed to growing our market share in both our DIY and commercial businesses. Now, let me provide more detail on the quarter. For the quarter, total sales increased 4.6% and our domestic same-store sales were up 3.9%. Regionally, our Northeastern, Midwestern and Mid-Atlantic markets representing roughly 28% of our store base performed better than the remaining markets. For our fiscal year, we expect to open approximately 200 new stores, including international and a 150 net new domestic commercial programs. During the quarter, we opened 35 new stores in the United States and our commercial business opened 43 net new programs. Currently 85% of our domestic stores have a commercial program and the vast majority of our international stores have a commercial program. During the quarter, we continue to expand in Mexico opening eight new stores. We also opened three new stores in Brazil this quarter, finishing with 25. Regarding our inventory initiatives, in the spirit of our YES! We\u2019ve Got It initiative, we continued expanding our hub store network. We opened four additional hubs this quarter and now have 174 hub stores and an additional 28 mega hubs totaling 202 stores with significantly expanded parts assortments. As we have seen both our DIY and commercial sales expand in markets where hub, mega hubs are added, we will continue to grow this number of hubs we have this year. Having opened eight hubs already, this fiscal year, we expect to open as many as 11 in total for the full year with most being mega hubs. As a reminder, both our hubs and mega hubs are focused on making available additional coverage to the local markets, meaning adding SKUs that would not have been available locally in the network before. Both the inventory and hub store initiatives are designed to enhance our ability to meet our customers\u2019 needs for coverage and immediacy. When we originally launched our mega hub initiative, we said, we felt we could open 25 to 40 mega hubs domestically and as we have said every time we have discussed their performance, they have outperformed our expectations. Today, as a result, we are expanding our expectations for long-term mega hubs to 70 to 90 in the United States. Along with improving our local parts availability and assortment, we continue to manage this organization to provide exceptional service for our customers, provide our AutoZoners with a great place to work with opportunities for advancement and ensure we do it on a long-term profitable basis to provide strong returns for our shareholders. We remain focused on the importance of going the extra mile to fulfill our customers\u2019 needs regardless of how difficult the request. Along with our operating theme for 2019 Drive for Excellence, we create key priorities each year. For 2019, these priorities are customers first, commercial acceleration, omni-channel, leveraging technology and finally, YES! We\u2019ve Got It inventory initiatives. Adding a little more color to our customers first initiative, we\u2019re also making further technology investments to improve our electronic catalog, end point of sale systems to ensure we are putting the customer first. We believe our current and future technology investments will improve our competitive position, will make our AutoZoners more knowledgeable and efficient and lead to sales growth across all of our businesses. While these investments are adding to both operating expense and capital expenditures, we feel this will meaningfully improve the customer shopping experience. Our expectation is our business will experience ongoing acceleration in technology investments for the mid to long-term. Regarding commercial acceleration, we have been investing in systems to help AutoZoners sell more efficiently and customers conduct business with us easier. While most of these initiatives won\u2019t be rolled out until late in calendar 2019 or even later, our focus on increasing the engagement of the broader store team and focusing on existing customers is paying off today. We are quite pleased with our momentum heading into the fourth quarter. We should once again highlight another strong performance and return on invested capital as we were able to finish our third quarter at 34.5%. We continue to be pleased with this metric as it is one of the best in all of hardlines retailing. However, our primary focus has been and continues to be that we ensure every incremental dollar of capital that we deploy in this business provides an acceptable return well in excess of our cost of capital. It is important to reinforce that we will always maintain our diligence regarding capital stewardship as the capital we invest is our investors\u2019 capital. Before I pass the discussion over to Bill Giles to talk about our financial results, I\u2019d like to again thank and reinforce how appreciative we are of our AutoZoners efforts each and every day. We are excited about all the initiatives we are working on throughout 2019. But everything must start with the effort of our AutoZoners and especially our field AutoZoners. We only have one shot to make that first impression with our customers and our team is taking advantage of that opportunity. Now, I will turn it over to Bill. Bill Giles : Thanks, Bill and good morning everyone. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to talk more specifically about our domestic retail, commercial and international results. For the quarter, total auto part sales, which includes our domestic retail and commercial businesses, our Mexico and Brazil stores increased 4.7% for the trailing 52 weeks ended total sales for AutoZone store were $1,814,000. This is up from an average of $1,785,000 at Q3 ending last year. Total commercial sales increased 14.9% in the quarter. Commercial represented 22% of our total sales and grew approximately $80 million over last year\u2019s Q3. We are excited to highlight our domestic commercial sales surpassed $10,000 in average weekly sales per program for the first time in history. On a trailing four quarters, we are now selling over $2.4 billion commercially. One metric worth highlighting is the growth rate for commercial sales since 2010. We sold $880 million of goods to professional installers back then and today, we are over $2.4 billion. Our compound annual growth rate has been 30% over this time period, a great accomplishment for our AutoZoners. We now have our commercial program in 4,831 stores or 85% of our domestic stores. As Bill mentioned earlier, we remain committed to gaining market share with our commercial customers. We are encouraged by the initiatives we have in place and feel we can further grow sales and market share. Our Mexico stores continued to perform well. We opened eight new stores during the third quarter, ending the quarter with 576 stores. We expect to open approximately 40 new stores for the full fiscal 2019. Regarding Brazil, we now operate 25 stores. We have aggressive plans to open approximately 13 additional stores by the end of fiscal 2019. Our performance continues to improve and we remain optimistic about long-term future of this market. If we can prove success, this market has the potential to be much larger than Mexico, so while challenging the potential size of the market is significant. Gross margin for the quarter was 53.6% of sales, up 12 basis points from last year\u2019s third quarter. The increase in gross margin was primarily attributable to the impact of the sale of the two businesses completed last fiscal year, partially offset by lower margin of goods sold primarily from the shift in mix during the quarter. Although gross margin excluding the impact from the two business units was slightly below our expectations for the quarter, we continue to see opportunities to lower our costs of direct sourcing albeit mix of goods sold can affect margin in any one quarter and we do want to point out that promising and ever increasing gross margin is just not possible. For example, as we have ongoing pressure from the acceleration on the growth of our commercial business, which is the good problem to have, we must continually look for ways to show margin improvement, but this is not a new phenomenon. We are committed to taking costs out of our business where appropriate. While we were asked about gross margin assumptions and the direction they will be headed, our primary focus has always been growing absolute gross profit dollars in our total auto parts segment. SG&A for the quarter was 33.9% of sales, higher by approximately 96 basis points from last year\u2019s third quarter. On the cost front, we have highlighted on the last few quarters conference calls the investments we would be making specifically wage rates and technology for this fiscal year. The de-leverage for this quarter was primarily driven by our planned domestic store payroll which negatively impacted operating expenses by 69 basis points. For the fourth quarter, we feel the consensus numbers for SG&A generally reflect those investments. For those folks that haven\u2019t begun to model the upcoming quarter, we have an additional week of results. We encourage everyone to look to the last time we had a 53rd week which was Q4 of 2013 as the litmus test for modeling. EBIT for the quarter was$547.5 million. Our EBIT margin was 19.7%. Interest expense for the quarter was $43 million, up slightly from Q3 a year ago. With the new bonds we sold this past quarter, we are planning interest in the $62 million to $64 million range in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 versus $54.3 million last Q4. Our higher forecast from last year includes our assumptions for the extra week of interest. Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $5.152 billion or approximately $200 million above last year\u2019s Q3 ending balance of $4.955 billion. Our adjusted debt level metrics finished the quarter at 2.5x EBITDAR. While in any given quarter we make increased or decreased leverage metric based on management\u2019s opinion regarding debt and equity market conditions, we remain committed to both our investment grade rating and our capital allocation strategy. And share repurchases are an important element of that strategy. For the quarter, our tax rate was 19.5%. Along with tax reform, we benefited approximately 260 basis points in our rate from stock options exercised during the quarter. Excluding this benefit, our rate was 22.1%. For the fourth quarter, we are modeling 23.5% before any assumptions on credits due to stock option exercises, because we can not effectively predict this activity, we remain committed to reporting the benefit of any stock options mean to the cumulative tax rate. Net income for the quarter was $405.9 million, up 10.7% over last year. Our diluted share count of 25.4 million was down 7.1% from last year\u2019s third quarter. The combination of these factors drove earnings per share for the quarter to $15.99 up 19.2% over the prior year\u2019s third quarter. Relating to the cash flow statement, for the third quarter, we generated $470 million of operating cash flow. Net fixed assets were up 5% versus last year, capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $118 million and reflected the additional expenditures required to open 46 net new stores this quarter. Capital expenditures on existing stores, hub and mega hub remodels or openings, work on the development of new stores for upcoming quarters and information technology investments. With the new stores opened, we finished this past quarter with 5,686 stores in 50 states in the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. 576 stores in Mexico and 25 in Brazil for a total AutoZone count of 6,287. Depreciation totaled $86.7 million for the quarter versus last year\u2019s third quarter expense of $79.8 million. This is generally in line with recent quarter growth rates. We repurchased $466 million of AutoZone stock in the third quarter. At quarter end, we had $1.169 billion remaining under our share buyback authorization and our leverage metric was 2.5 times. Again, I want to stress, we managed to appropriate credit ratings and not any one metric, the metric we report is meant as a guide to only as each rating firm has its own criteria. We continue to view our share repurchase program as an attractive capital deployment strategy. Next, I\u2019d like to update you on our inventory levels in total, and on a per store basis. The Company\u2019s inventory increased 8% over the same period last year, driven by new stores and increased product placement. Inventory per location was $688,000 versus $658,000 last year and $690,000 last quarter. Net inventory defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable, on a per location basis was a negative $58,000 versus a negative $48,000 last year and a negative $58,000 last quarter. As a result, accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at a 108.5%. Finally, as Bill previously mentioned, our continued disciplined capital management approach resulted in return on invested capital for the trailing four quarters up 34.5%. We have and will continue to make investments that we believe will generate returns that significantly exceed our cost of capital. Now, I\u2019ll turn it back to Bill Rhodes. Bill Rhodes : Thank you, Bill. While we had a strong sales quarter, we know we have much work to do to finish this year strong. The summer months generate a large percentage of our annual sales and we\u2019ll be opening up a substantial portion of our new stores, commercial programs and mega hubs during the fourth quarter. We also have a lot of deliverables from our IT initiatives this upcoming quarter. We also have we remain focused on simplifying our store AutoZoners workloads to reduce clutter and unnecessary task that get in the way of making the customer experience better for both the do-it-yourself customer and the professional customer. We believe our industry\u2019s fundamentals will remain strong as miles driven are expected to increase over the remainder of the year. This upcoming quarter, we are laser focused on executing our game plan. We are excited about our balanced model for growth around domestic retail and commercial, international, online and Pick-Up In-Store. We believe our hubs and mega hubs, Mexico, ALLDATA and digital can all grow their top lines for the remainder of 2019. To execute at a high level, we must adhere to living the pledge. We cannot and will not take our eye off of execution. Success will be achieved with an attention to detail and thoughtful execution. Services always been our most important cultural cornerstone and it will be long into the future. Our charge remains to optimize our performance regardless of market conditions and to continue to ensure we are investing in the key initiatives that will drive our long-term performance. In the end, delivering strong EPS growth and ROIC, each and every quarter is how we measure ourselves. This formula has been extremely successful over the last 40 years and we continue to be excited about our future. Now, we would like to open up the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. And we have our first question is from Christopher Horvers of JPMorgan. Chris, your line is open. Christopher Horvers : Thanks, good morning, everybody. Bill Rhodes : Good morning. Christopher Horvers : Can you talk about the mega hub expansion you\u2019re roughly doubling the target. So couple of questions there, is the list that you\u2019re seeing better than what you saw prior and any quantification. And then just structurally, is this a market expansion i.e. you were targeting 40 markets, now you are going to 80 or you are actually building and density that cuts drive time to replenish then \u2013 satellite stores and directly fulfill more customer orders. Bill Rhodes : Yes, terrific question, Chris. It\u2019s both, frankly. We will be adding mega hubs in smaller markets than we envisioned originally and will also be adding to density in some of the largest markets. As we said all along, since we\u2019ve introduced these mega hubs, they continually have outperformed our expectations. So frankly, the analysis that we did four years or five years ago when we started them, said, we can only do 25 to 40 as they \u2013 as their performance has improved, they\u2019ve allowed us to go to these other markets. Christopher Horvers : Understood. And then in terms of the commercial business, Bill, you mentioned that you are quite pleased with the momentum heading into the fourth quarter. Sorry to parse this out. But is that a comment on April on the strong finish to 3Q or is that a comment on May because arguably April was \u2013 I think the \u2013 one of the easiest comparison to the year and May, flips up to be the one of the hardest. Bill Rhodes : Yes, and I don\u2019t really want to get into too much on week to week comparisons. As you know in this business, weather matters, especially on a weekly or geographic area \u2013 certain geographies. I don\u2019t want to spend too much time on it. We feel confident that we\u2019re continuing to build momentum in the commercial business. Now, when you talk about comps, we are up against tougher commercial growth in the fourth quarter of last year. That\u2019s not lost on us, but this is not about a quarter or two. This is about a long-term growth model. Christopher Horvers : Understood and one quick last one. On the gross margin, was there a benefit from lower product acquisition costs that offset some of the mix headwinds, the past two quarters, I think it was about 40 basis points of lower product acquisition costs. Bill Giles : A little bit, but I mean, we still had some inflation as Bill mentioned overall. I think, probably the one thing that impacted gross margin as we highlighted was just the increased penetration of the commercial business, overall. But we continue to believe there are opportunities within gross margin to lower acquisition costs as we continue to increase our direct importing activity. Christopher Horvers : Understood. Best of luck, guys. Bill Rhodes : Thanks, Chris. Bill Giles : Thank you, Chris. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Simeon Gutman of Morgan Stanley. Simeon, your line is open. Simeon Gutman : Thank you. Good morning, one follow-up to the prior question, on the expansion of the 70 to 90 mega hubs. Because you have momentum in the business, in the commercial business and you\u2019re densing up these markets. Can you talk about the cost and I guess the presumption is \u2013 it feels like the incremental cost here, could be a little bit less, because these are more fold out as you dense up market, is that a fair assumption? And can you just talk about the cost in general? Bill Rhodes : Yes, first of all, I think, as we\u2019ve rolled out the ones that we have to-date, we haven\u2019t called out the mega hub cost is a significant contributor to our cost structure. Clearly, it\u2019s more expensive. The first ones that we did, we were able to go into \u2013 in many cases existing excess space that we already had. As we go to the next ones, we\u2019ll be having to take down a little bit more real estate or additional lease space next to a store that we already have. So there will be costs, but I don\u2019t think, it\u2019ll be meaningful costs that we\u2019re calling out as a key contributor to our performance. Simeon Gutman : Okay. And then my follow-up is on gross margin, Bill, you just mentioned that you should still benefit somewhat from lower acquisition costs. But does the mix of commercial over \u2013 offset that, such that the gross margin should now decline. And then in general, is there a relationship between some rate of the commercial sales growth to GM that sort of proportional as we think about as the commercial business continues to grow rapidly. Bill Giles : Yes, that\u2019s a good question. I think that it will be a function of how fast commercial continues to grow. So that will continue to put a little bit of pressure on us. Look the way we think about it is our margin overall is relatively healthy across our businesses. We continue to have opportunities to improve it, but we recognize that the \u2013 one of our lower margin business is growing significantly faster and we\u2019re thrilled with that. That\u2019s exactly our objective and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re trying to accomplish. Simeon Gutman : Okay, thanks. And nice results. Bill Rhodes : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Seth Sigman of Credit Suisse. Seth, your line is open. Seth Sigman : Hi guys, good morning and congrats on the quarter. Two follow-up questions, one on the hub strategy, what just remind us, what held back the rollout previously and what\u2019s changed. I mean, you talked about strong results, but we would just love some more color on whether there were some real estate constraints or just how you were thinking about that and what percent of the store base today is being affected by the hub strategy and what will that look like when you hit the 90 mega hubs? Bill Rhodes : Yes, as we expand from 25 to 40 to 70 to 90 mega hubs, it\u2019s not going to add a substantial amount, of additional stores to have access to that inventory. Over 90% of our stores today have access to the mega hub inventory. What it will do is it will shorten the lead time, many of those stores today will get it on 3 time a day basis, some of them will get it once a day basis and others will get it overnight. As we expand this, we will go to more stores that have access 3 times a day and fewer stores that have access overnight. But there will always be stores that have access overnight, because they are simply too far from the mega hub. I think what held us back. Frankly, we would love to be farther along the mega hubs today that the big challenge with this is, these are big boxes and they take time to get them to find the right real estate and to develop that real estate. We will have the same experience as we go from our 28 today up to 70 to 90 mega hubs. It will take us some time. I would say what changed was the economics changed. We are getting more productivity out of the existing box of the mega hub itself and we\u2019re getting more productivity out of the stores that are adjacent and feeding off of that box, particularly the stores that have access 3 times a day or in the local market. So just the economies \u2013 the economics changed and made it more beneficial for us to do it. Seth Sigman : That\u2019s great. Thank you. My follow-up question is on the SG&A front. You talked about this year being an investment year, seems to have played out largely as you expected and talked about earlier in the year and it\u2019s nice to see how that\u2019s translating into topline gains. Do you think that this year is the peak for investments and that we should be thinking about SG&A growth next year being less than this past year? Bill Giles : Yes, I think that this year is the peak. I think, we\u2019ll staff some overlay next year. Keep in mind that many of the investments that we\u2019ve put in place last year really kicked in at the very end of Q1 of this year. So, we will wrap that around a little bit in Q1, but yes, I think that the investments will peak out a little bit this year and we\u2019ll continue to moderate as we move forward. Bill Rhodes : I do think if I can add on the I do think, and I\u2019ve commented earlier, we are going to have increased technology spending for the foreseeable future. And today, I think we are also continuing to see that the wage market is probably different than it was five to seven years ago because you have the regulated markets that are continuing to march toward $15 an hour and then you have other markets that there are market pressures from other retailers that are moving those wages up. So, I think, we will continue to have not at the level that we experienced this year, but I believe, we will continue to have wage pressures and information technology accelerated spending. Seth Sigman : Okay, understood. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Michael Lasser of UBS. Michael, your line is open. Michael Lasser : Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. As you make these investments in your stores to better position the Company for commercial growth, are you equipping the stores with any tools to allow them to engage better with the commercial customers such as allowing them to do things like introductory pricing? So that the commercial customers can try AutoZone and help you supplant some of the existing relationships? Bill Giles : Yes, I would say that probably one of the primary things that we\u2019re focused on is making sure that we are easy to do business with and so, whether that be returning products, paying bills, looking at account information, making sure they have all the product information that they need, their history, etcetera. That\u2019s probably the first place we\u2019re starting. We always have opportunities to be able to introduce new customers to pricing depending on their spending level and so a new customer may be able to get better pricing, if they have a commitment on certain spending level not unlike existing customers as well. So, there\u2019s opportunities for those, but the bigger play is really our ability to connect with the customer, have a more personal relationship with them, both electronically as well as having our field people out talking to the commercial customers every day and being able to be an easier place to do business with. Michael Lasser : And Bill Giles, if you look 5, 10 years from now and your commercial business represents 30% of your mix rather than 20%, what would the operating margin of the business look like? Bill Giles : Well, depending on what happens and a lot of other factors then you would have to assume it will be slightly lower than it is today just from a math perspective. The commercial business does operate at a lower margin, but if we can grow that at that rate, that would be outstanding because we would really be driving operating profit dollars. Michael Lasser : Okay, thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Brian Nagel of Oppenheimer. Brian, your line is open. Brian Nagel : Hi, good morning. Bill Rhodes : Good morning. Brian Nagel : Congrats on nice quarter. Bill Rhodes : Thank you. Brian Nagel : I just had couple of questions. I know we\u2019ve already discussed quite a bit the commercial sales growth. But maybe to drill down a little bit further, here in this quarter, we had year-on-year growth nearly mid-teens and that\u2019s been it represent an acceleration from high-single digits not that long ago. Is there a way to of all the initiatives you have in place that you can look at that and say, what factors in particular have helped to drive that further acceleration in sales growth from an already decent level and how should we think about the sustainability of that growth rate in the coming quarters? Bill Rhodes : Terrific question, Brian. I would tell you that it\u2019s the culmination of about four years worth of very focused work. If you recall, we reupped our strategy in 2008 and had a nice run with that and then about four years ago, we knew we had to come up with the next leg of what our strategy looks like. We did a tremendous amount of work, most focused on improving our product assortments, leaning into the commercial business. We did things like multiple frequency of delivery we expanded and improved the assortment that we have in our satellite stores and in our hub stores. We added mega hubs which we didn\u2019t have four, five years ago and on and on. We\u2019ve really improved the product assortments, focused very much on commercial. Then over the last year and we\u2019re beginning to annualize that right now, we really ramped up the engagement of our store operating teams. I will put our operating teams up against anybody out there, they can execute like nobody\u2019s business and we really take that execution focus and dialed it into commercial, where before for the most part, the Commercial Sales Manager and the TSM were the direct contact with the customers, now we\u2019ve enhanced that, by adding the Store Manager and the District Managers. And our Store Managers are phenomenal customer service people and when they\u2019re going out making these sales calls, they\u2019re finding out what are we doing right and where do we have opportunities for improvement, and they\u2019re coming back and leading the store team in that direction. So that\u2019s to us what is enhanced our performance. Brian Nagel : That\u2019s very helpful. The second question I have, the follow-up question, different topic, with regard to tariffs. You mentioned in your prepared comments that you basically reiterated that with the pricing power you have, and given your history and given the nature of the business that makes a lot of sense. But the question I have is, I guess two-fold, one, just remind us how much exposure from a sourcing perspective AutoZone does have to China or to tariff-affected categories. And then second, having been with the business for a while now, have there been instances where for one reason or another, AutoZone was not able to effectively pass along cost to consumers? Bill Rhodes : I\u2019ll start with the latter question, not that I can think of off the top of my head and we have dealt with over many, many years significant increases because so many of the products we sell are significant commodity-based products. So, we\u2019ve dealt with oil shocks, we\u2019ve dealt with lead price increases, we\u2019ve dealt with steel price increases. Many times, those have come pretty quick and we have been able to pass those cost along to our consumers. But let me be the first to say, we are not pleased about the tariffs. We are concerned about what that will do not so much to AutoZone or our business, but more to what it would mean to the U.S. economy. But we have a strong history of being able to say, OK, we can pass those on to our customers. It\u2019s one of the beauties of being in a relatively inelastic demand business. Brian Nagel : And as far as the exposure to China source China-sourced products? Bill Rhodes : Yes, that\u2019s a very difficult question to say. We have a significant amount, of products that come out of China. We don\u2019t direct import a ton, less than 10%, but we have a lot of importers that bring it in from China and then we also have a lot of our products where the components are being manufactured in China and the products are being assembled here. So, we have significant exposure to products that are sourced from China whether we do it or somebody else does it. Brian Nagel : Thank you very much. Congrats again. Bill Rhodes : Alright, thank you. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you. Next question is from Bret Jordan of Jefferies. Bret, your line is open. Bret Jordan : Hi, good morning, guys. Bill Giles : Good morning, Bret. Bret Jordan : Just a question on the regional performance, you talked about the Northeast, Midwest, Mid-Atlantic being the strongest, could you give us sort of a feeling for what the spread was to the weaker regions? Bill Giles : It wasn\u2019t significant as it has been in quarters, where we\u2019ve had a lot of divergence, but it was probably in the 100 to 150 basis point range. Bret Jordan : Okay. What might have been the softest region in the country? Bill Giles : I would say, probably, to be honest with you, it was really pretty even across the country. I thought it is 100 to 150 basis points between those ones that we highlighted and the ones that we didn\u2019t. But otherwise, I would say, for the most part, take the big geographic areas of the country, it was pretty healthy across most of the country. So it was pretty encouraging. Bill Rhodes : The one places where it wasn\u2019t healthy were the markets that were impacted by hurricanes the previous year and we\u2019re lapping those significant growth. So that\u2019s Puerto Rico, Houston, South Florida all those areas, that was where we were the weakest. Bret Jordan : Okay, great. And then a follow-up on the commercial business, I guess $2.4 billion, how would you categorize that mix sort of national versus one off commercial customers? Bill Rhodes : We really haven\u2019t got into specifics on the mix of what it is but the growth of both of them was very encouraging. Our up and down the street business is growing very well and our national account business is growing well also. Bret Jordan : Okay, great. Thank you. Bill Rhodes : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Gregory Melich of Evercore ISI. Greg, your line is open. Gregory Melich : Hi, thanks guys, great quarter. I guess, so I\u2019d love to know is little bit more detail on traffic versus ticket in total and if you give us a breakdown on do-it-for-me versus DIY that\u2019d be great. Bill Rhodes : Yes, we really focus the most on traffic and ticket than the DIY business. Obviously, we\u2019re growing both in the commercial side of the business. Our DIY traffic and ticket trends were not significantly different than they have been. We have a long-standing challenge with transaction count and that\u2019s being made up with a long-standing growth in average ticket. Those trends were not meaningfully different this quarter than they have been. Gregory Melich : And maybe if I missed it before, I just want to last year, you\u2019d turned off some of the promotions and online and then you brought them back. Remind me when you cycle, when you turn that off and sort of any incremental color on the online pickup with especially with the FedEx next-day delivery. Bill Rhodes : Yes. We turned them off, I think around February 1st, and we turned it back on in the latter part of August. And there still stay on today. The FedEx next-day delivery program has really been a great addition to us. It\u2019s not the biggest program, I said in our prepared remarks, that our total digital business is less than 5%, substantially less, but it\u2019s been a nice addition and it\u2019s been a great way for us to surprise and delight customers. So, we\u2019ve been very pleased with that. Gregory Melich : That\u2019s great. Good luck, guys. Bill Rhodes : Alright, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Daniel Imbro of Stephens Inc. Dan, your line is open. Daniel Imbro : Thanks for taking my question. Wanted to start on the market share comment both in the press release and in your remarks, obviously, your growth is accelerating and outpacing the industry. Bill, it sounded like in your prepared remarks, it was more on the DIY side, but wondering if you could provide some more color on where you think you\u2019re winning that share from both on the DIY and the commercial side. Is it still the smaller independents and is that a trend you see continuing over the next 12 months? Bill Rhodes : Terrific question. Yes. First on the commercial side, it\u2019s pretty clear that we\u2019re taking substantial market share. The market has grown 4%, 4.5% and we are growing close to 15% and that\u2019s a pretty significant change. And a lot of focus on the commercial side comes, what\u2019s happening with us and our close end competitors. I would change the dialog, if you added the big three together, we only have about 10% market share. There is 90% of other market share out there and to me, that\u2019s where our focus needs to be is how do we enhance our position so that we can grab more and more of that market share over time. And I think the mega hubs play perfectly into that as we are substantially changing our product assortment in the local market, that\u2019s taking away an advantage that was typically held by the warehouse distributors. On the retail side, we are continuing to see that our share gains are accelerating, they are not massive, but they are accelerating. Clearly, the entire industry has taken share away from the mom and pops over a long period of time. If you look at the number of outlets that sell parts in the United States, it\u2019s been around 35,000 outlets since I got in this business almost 25 years ago, that doesn\u2019t change \u2013 what doesn\u2019t change even though us and our competitors are opening more and more programs, there is a natural consolidation that happens on the independent side. Will it continue for the future? We certainly hope so. Daniel Imbro : That\u2019s helpful. And then as a quick follow-up to an earlier answer, you guys sound confident in the ability to pass along procurement cost pressures, but if wage pressures continue to accelerate in the coming years, like it sounds like you expect them to and everyone in the industry is facing that headwind. How is the industry\u2019s ability changing to maybe pass along those cost pressures to the consumer and offset some of that margin pressure with... Bill Giles : Yes, I think it all goes into the same bucket. I mean, it\u2019s an input cost to overall costs and it will probably contribute to general inflation if we see a lot of wage pressure, it won\u2019t be just about AutoZone, but probably be general inflation across the U.S. industries. So again, history would imply that we have some successful both individually as an industry and passing along increased cost to the consumers. So, that\u2019s how we will continue to focus on, but yes, there will continue to be cost pressures whether it would be wage rates, interest rates, utility cost or whatever. Daniel Imbro : Great. Thanks so much guys. Best of luck. Bill Giles : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Mike Baker of Deutsche Bank. Mike, your line is open. Mike Baker : Hi, thanks. I wanted to ask about the gross margin. So you said it was below plan. So is it that \u2013 was that on the mix and does that mix \u2013 the commercial business or are there other products within the DIY or commercial that are causing that negative mix and I guess to add to that, we get that commercial would hurt the margins, but your commercial business has been up double-digits each of the last two quarters, yet your gross margins were up, I think 90 and 115 basis points or something like that. So what was different this quarter? Thanks. Bill Giles : Yes. Keep in mind, when it was 90 and 115 basis points, you had probably about a 70 basis point plus impact from AutoAnything and IMC, but I hear the question. So I would say that yes, some of it was product mix as well and some of it as customer mix as well within commercial. But I would say overall that our margin was probably a little below of what we expected, but not significantly. So we would expect it to be a little bit of pressure as the commercial business continues to grow and we expect to find opportunities to try to offset that with improvements through our merchandising organization. Mike Baker : Okay, that makes sense. And if I could ask one more follow-up and maybe this isn\u2019t something that you are willing to answer, but if for the past three quarters, your 2-year stack comps have been in a really tight range of about 4.5% to 5% which is a lot better than it had been in 2017 and \u201818. So, do we think about that as sort of the new normal, is that how we should think about your business going forward, in other words, comping in the mid to high 2% range depending on the comparison. Bill Rhodes : Well, I would say first of all that in the 2017 and 2018 time period, there was a lot of focus on the fact that our sales trajectory had changed radically and I have spent a lot of time talking about how tight the band of our sales performance has been since 2013. It\u2019s really within a couple of 100 basis points. We are going to have really good quarters and we are going to have more challenging quarters, but they are still going to be within a pretty tight band. The one difference that we have today and we will see if it\u2019s sustainable or not is we are growing our commercial business at a much accelerated rate. You talk about 2017 and \u201818 we went down into single-digit growth there. Now that we have had it in double-digits and this time close to 15%, that\u2019s making a meaningful difference. We will have to see if we can sustain that level or even continue to grow it from here. That will be the question. Mike Baker : Okay, thanks for the color. Appreciate it. Bill Rhodes : Alright, thank you. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you. And I would like to hand the call over back to Mr. Bill Rhodes. Bill Rhodes : Thank you. Before we conclude the call, I would like to take a moment and call out that we will celebrate AutoZone\u2019s 40th anniversary on July 4. The old adage rings true, that we have come a long way since back then. But in the spirit of our Founders\u2019 vision, we remain focused on providing exceptional service and going the extra mile. Our business model continues to be solid and we are excited about the rest of the year. We do not take anything for granted as we understand our customers have alternatives. We will continue to execute on our game plan, but I want to stress that this is a marathon, and not a sprint. As we continue to focus on the basics and focus on optimizing long-term shareholder value, we are confident AutoZone will continue to be successful. We thank you for your interest in our company and for participating on today\u2019s call. And in recognition of the upcoming Memorial Day holiday, we want to recognize and say thank you to those who have served our country past and present. We are grateful for the freedoms your service has ensured. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

Rhodes: Good morning and thank you for joining us today for AutoZone's 2019 fourth quarter conference call. With me today are Bill Giles, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax. Regarding the fourth quarter, I hope you have had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not the press release along with slides complementing our comments today is available on our website www.autozone.com and clicking on Investor Relations link. Please click on Quarterly Earnings Conference Calls to see them.  To begin this morning, I want to thank all AutoZoners across the organization for their amazing efforts to deliver on our pledge. Most organizations have a vision and/or mission statement, we don't. We're unique, we have a pledge, a pledge to ourselves and more importantly to our customers where we are committed to delivering exceptional customer service where our AutoZoners\u2019 passion and willingness to go the extra mile allows us to deliver the kind of numbers we reported this morning. All credit goes to our dedicated AutoZoners.  Overall, we were pleased with our performance in Q4. This morning, we will review the major themes for the quarter, specifically we'll talk about our continued success with our commercial business, our monthly sales cadence, and regional performance, the impact tariffs had on this quarter's results both on retails and margins, and lastly we'll report on the success we had on our stated initiatives; customers first, commercial acceleration, omnichannel, leveraging [indiscernible] technology, and yes, we've got it inventory initiatives. Our commercial sales grew 21.1% year-over-year and 14.1% on a 16-week basis, and this was no easy task as we were up against a tougher Q4 comparison last year. It has been encouraging to see our two-year commercial comps build every quarter this year.  For the quarter we grew 15.7% and 13.4% on a comparable 52 week basis. This growth represented roughly $350 million more in sales versus last year. Our team did a great job on our commitment to growing this business during 2019. While we remain smaller than many of our peers in absolute sales volume, our growth rate has been very robust growing more than three times the industry growth rate. This growth has come from a combination of many initiatives that have been in development for years including inventory assortment improvements, hub and mega hub expansions, the ever strengthening reputation of the Duralast brand across our professional customer base, technology enhancements, increased engagement of our very strong store operating teams, and tremendous efforts on the part of our entire selling organization to artfully and effectively convey our value proposition.  We also grew our sales per store at a higher clip than we have in the past. Although we are averaging fewer program openings now as approximately 85% of our stores have a program, their productivity has increased steadily. For the quarter, we averaged our highest weekly sales productivity ever at $10,700 per program. And we grew our sales with mature customers at a substantially improved growth rate this year versus previous years indicating our offerings, products, coverage, service, and beyond are improved and have been recognized and rewarded by our customers. Additionally, we grew our up and down the street business faster for the quarter and the year than the overall growth of our commercial business indicating these improvements are being rewarded across all different types of customers. And with more hub stores, improved salesmanship, and product assortment, we have a very solid foundation that we can continue to build on into the future. Congratulations again to our entire organization for their efforts on delivering a great performance in commercial for 2019. Their intense focus on growing this business is absolutely working. Regarding our domestic DIY business, while generating positive same-store sales for the quarter, our performance was clearly impacted by slower month of May and a slower first half of the quarter on a two-year basis followed by nice acceleration in the second half. Retail remains a very solid predictable story for us as it is definitely a more mature customer segment than commercial but a steady revenue stream and substantial cash flow generator. In addition to May's weaker performance we saw underperformance out West and across the Southwest. Additionally, we didn't experience the same level of heat, particularly in the first half of our quarter as normal and our heat-related categories\u2019 performance was certainly softer this quarter.  Finally, we saw some weakness in certain strong Hispanic markets. While it is very difficult to objectively quantify, we have seen this at certain times in the past in select markets when immigration issues are front and center. With the data we have available to us, our DIY share was flat this quarter while commercial grew very nicely. For the fiscal year, we gained share. While our retail business is far more mature than our commercial business, we were pleased with our performance in Q4 and remain optimistic about the New Year and beyond. Our optimism comes from the inventory availability and staffing initiatives that we have in place. Our constant focus on enhancing the customer service experience is making a difference. We believe the wage adjustments we made last October will continue to help us attract and retain high quality talent that can continue to provide WOW! Customer Service. It is important to remember the high touch nature of this business and the vital role our highly knowledgeable AutoZoners play to help our customers maintain and enhance their vehicles.  Regarding tariffs, on last quarter's call, we went into extensive detail on the lack of SKU to SKU inflation we have experienced historically because products are introduced into our assortments at very low scale; and as they scale, per unit cost decreased due to efficiencies. This is quite visibly evident by our unrecorded substantial LIFO negative reserve. We also noted last quarter that because of the earlier tariffs, we had experienced a small amount of inflation, a departure from the norm due to tariffs. As the new tariffs have been introduced, we have begun to pass those costs on to our customers. As these costs can be significant up to 25% currently on a product and since we use weighted average costing and the costs roll in over time, we have been implementing many of these retail increases in waves attempting to make it less burdensome on our customers. This has resulted in SKu-to-SKU inflation increases higher than last quarter, but still quite manageable. We have not experienced material changes in our gross margins as a result of tariffs, but our prices to our customers have and will continue to increase. Turning to our omnichannel efforts, we continue to invest in our strategy to enhance the customer shopping experience by meeting them when, where, and how they want to shop. We have initiatives in place to improve our in-store systems and websites autozone.com, autozonepro, mobile, and ALLDATA. We're investing heavily in the system to support these shopping patterns. We continue to see growth in website traffic and rapid growth in ship to home, next day delivery, and buy online and pick up in store. While representing a very small percentage of our business substantially below 5%, we are pleased with how the customer is embracing all of our offerings. Last quarter, we discussed our next day delivery program that allows customers in over 85% of U.S. markets to order as late as midnight in some markets and receive their products at their home the very next day. We continue to expand to more markets, and I would be remiss if I didn't say we are working diligently to further enhance our digital capabilities with our commercial customers as well. The improvements with the online commercial offering will be ongoing as we know we have ample opportunities which once addressed will allow us to make deeper inroads with certain customers that have not bought from us in the past and will allow us to further grow our business with existing customers, many of which are the more sophisticated shops.  While ship to home, ship to home next day, buy online and pick up in store, and commercial customer ordering are all showing growth and traffic to our online sites is continuing to increase, for our retail business, we continue to see customers primarily doing lots of research online and then coming into the store to receive that trustworthy advice, to have help with the Fix Finder or Loan-A-Tool and host of other services that simply cannot be duplicated online prior to making the sale. Regarding our initiatives, we have invested more on our AutoZoners, inventories, and systems with the objective of improving customer-facing interactions. We believe our execution is improving as we intensify our focus on the customer. Regarding our annual operating theme for 2019, Drive for Excellence, we push for a relentless focus on what matters to our customers; exceptional service, fast deliveries, high quality parts and products, flawless execution of changes in product assortments, in-store merchandising, and on and on, some of the areas that we didn't execute so well on in 2008. As part of this initiative, we have challenged our store leadership teams to reduce redundant or non-customer facing activities. While we have identified opportunities to improve the effectiveness of our AutoZoners, we have much additional work to do in 2020. By removing these tasks, we know we can improve our levels of service. This will continue to be a major focus for us next year. Regarding our inventory initiatives in the spirit of our Yes, We've Got It initiative we continue expanding our hub store network. At the end of the quarter we had 35 mega hub stores and 100 hubs -- 170 hub stores for a total of 205 locations with significantly expanded parts assortments. For the year we opened an incremental 11 mega hubs. We have consistently seen both our DIY and commercial sales expanding markets where hub or mega hubs are added and we will continue to grow the number of hubs. Last quarter we announced that our ultimate target is to have between 70 to 90 mega hubs open across the United States. We have some ways to go and it'll take us a few years to build this out. As a reminder, both our hubs and mega hubs are focused on making available additional coverage to the local markets meaning adding skews that would not have been available locally in our network before. Both the inventory and the hub store initiatives are designed to enhance our ability to meet our customer's needs for coverage and immediacy. Along with improving our local parts availability and assortment we continue to manage this organization to provide exceptional service for our customers, provide our AutoZoners with a great place to work with opportunities for advancement, and ensure we do it on a long-term profitable basis to provide strong returns for our shareholders. We remain focused on the importance of going the extra mile to fulfill our customer's needs regardless of how difficult the request. In regard to our initiatives for 2019 in customers first we have been making technology investments to improve our electronic catalog and point of sale systems to ensure the customer has an efficient and seamless, frictionless transaction. We believe our current and future technology investments will improve our competitive position. We will make our AutoZoners more knowledgeable and more efficient and ultimately will lead to sales growth across all of our businesses. While these investments are adding to both operating expense and capital expenditures, we are committed to further investments in 2020 to improve the customer shopping experience. Our expectation is our business will experience ongoing acceleration in technology investments for the mid to long-term. We spent more on development in 2019 than ever before by a wide margin and we remain committed to improving the technology around helping customers in 2020. Regarding commercial acceleration, we have been investing in systems to help AutoZoners sell more efficiently and customers conduct business with us easier. While we said on last quarter's call most of these initiatives won't be rolled out until late calendar 2019 or even later. Our focus on increasing the engagement of the broader store team and focusing on existing customers is absolutely paying off today. In summary we are pleased with our performance and remain encouraged with our industry strength in both DIY and DIFM and our prospects for the new fiscal year. We believe macro factors such as relatively low gas prices and increasing miles driven remain largely in our favor and we remain committed to growing our market share in both our DIY and commercial businesses.  Now let me provide a little more detail on the quarter. For the quarter total auto parts sales increased 11.9% in total and we're up 5.2% excluding the additional week of sales, and our domestic same store sales were up 3%. Regionally our Northeastern, Midwestern, and Mid Atlantic markets representing roughly 28% of our store base performed better than the remaining markets. For our fiscal year we opened 209 new stores including 55 internationally and a 152 net new domestic commercial programs. We closed no stores for the year. During the quarter we opened 86 new stores in the U.S. and our commercial business opened 62 net new programs. Currently 85% of our domestic stores have a commercial program and the vast majority of our international stores have a commercial program.  During the quarter we continue to expand in Mexico opening 28 new stores and surpassing the 600 store mark in Mexico, an amazing accomplishment for our team in Mexico. We also opened 10 new stores in Brazil this quarter finishing with 35. We should once again highlight another strong performance and return on invested capital as we were able to finish our fourth quarter at 35.7%. We continue to be pleased with this metric as it is one of the best in all of hard lines retailing. However our primary focus has been and continues to be that we ensure every incremental dollar of capital that we deploy in this business provides an acceptable return well in excess of our cost of capital. It is important to reinforce that we will always maintain our diligence regarding capital stewardship as the capital we invest is our investors capital.  Before I pass the discussion over to Bill Giles to talk about our financial results I'd like to again thank and reinforce how appreciative we are of our AutoZoners efforts to again deliver solid results for fiscal 2019. Now I will turn it over to Bill Giles. Bill. William T. Giles: Thanks Bill and good morning everyone. To start this morning let me take a few moments to talk more specifically about our domestic retail, commercial, and international results. For the quarter total auto parts sales which includes our domestic retail and commercial businesses, our Mexico and Brazil stores increased 11.9%. However, excluding the extra week of sales total auto parts was up 5.2%. For the trailing 52 weeks ended, total sales for AutoZone store was $1,809,000 this is up from an average of $1, 778,000 at Q4 ending last year. Total commercial sales increased 21.1% but increased 14.1% on a 16 week basis. In the quarter commercial represented 22% of our total sales and grew approximately $103 million over last year's Q4 on a 16 week basis.  We are excited to highlight for the quarter our domestic commercial sales averaged $10,700 in average weekly sales per program, the highest quarterly average weekly sales in our history. This was an increase of 10.6% from last year's $9,700 and average weekly sales per program for our fourth quarter, a very strong acceleration. For the quarter sales were $2.5 billion, a great result. We now have our commercial program in 4,893 stores or 85% of our domestic stores. As Bill mentioned earlier we remain committed to gaining market share with our commercial customers and we are encouraged by the initiatives we have in place and feel we can further growth sales and market share. Our Mexico stores continued to perform well. We opened 28 new stores during the fourth quarter ending the quarter with 604 stores. Whenever I visit our stores in Mexico I'm always impressed by our talented team and how well they have executed our model and in particular embraced our culture. It's always an inspiring visit. Regarding Brazil we now operate 35 stores. Our team in Brazil opened an impressive 15 stores in fiscal 2019 off a base of only 20 stores at the beginning of the year. This took tremendous efforts especially on hiring, training, and developing our newest AutoZoners. Our performance continues to improve and we remain optimistic about the long-term future of this market. While we cannot claim success yet as we are incurring an annual operating loss, this market has the potential to be much larger than Mexico. So while challenging, the potential size of the market is significant.  Gross margin for the quarter was 53.4% of sales down 20 basis points from last year's fourth quarter. The decrease in gross margin was primarily attributable to the lower margin of goods sold primarily from the shift in mix of two more commercial business during the quarter. While our accelerated pace of commercial growth is weighed on our overall gross margin rate we continue to see opportunities to lower our costs through direct sourcing. While we see opportunities to increase our gross margin rate, we should encourage folks to buy similar to recent trends with the pressure from the mix shift to commercial. I do want to stress we remain committed to taking cost out of our business where appropriate and feel we can make improvements from here. Our primary focus has always been growing absolute gross profit dollars in our total auto parts segment and we've been pleased with our growth driven by the acceleration we've experienced in commercial. SG&A for the quarter was 33.8% of sales lower by 316 basis points from last year's fourth quarter. Last year however we had a large expense for termination of our pension plan. Excluding this $130 million charge from last year's numbers our operating expenses this year were higher than last year but in line with our expectations at the beginning of the quarter. Operating expenses for the quarter were up 7.6% on an adjusted basis up -- 0.7%.  On the cost front we highlighted on the last few quarters conference calls the investments we have made specifically wage rates and technology for this fiscal year. The deleverage for this quarter was primarily driven by our planned domestic store payroll investments and continuing IT investments which negatively impacted operating expenses. For the quarter we want to remind financial milers that SG&A dollars will be up similarly as a growth percentage to this past quarter as we began the wage rate investments in the later part of Q1 last year. EBIT for the quarter was $780 million. Our EBIT margin was 19.6%. Interest expense for the quarter was $61.2 million up from Q4 a year ago with the main difference the extra week. We are planning interest in the $44 million range in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 versus $39 million last year Q1. Our higher forecasts in last year includes our costs associated with the bond issuance we had this past April. Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $5.2 billion or approximately $200 million above last year's Q4 ending balance of 5 billion. Our adjusted debt level metric finished the quarter at 2.5 times EBITDAR while in any given quarter we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on management's opinion regarding debt and equity market conditions. We remain committed to both our investment grade rating and our capital allocation strategy and share repurchases are an important element of that strategy. For the quarter our tax rate was 21.45% and benefited approximately 105 basis points in our rate from stock options exercised during the quarter. Excluding this benefit our rate was 22.5%. For the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 we are modeling 23.5% before any assumption on credits due to stock option exercises. Because we cannot effectively predict this activity we remain committed to reporting what the stock option benefits mean to the cumulative tax rate.  Net income for the quarter was $565.2 million up 41.2% over last year. Our diluted share count of 25 million was down 6.1% from last year's fourth quarter. The combination of these factors drove earnings per share for the quarter to $22.59 up 50.4% over the prior year's fourth quarter. Now adjusting for the extra week this year and the pension expense taken in the fourth quarter of last year earnings per share grew 13%. Relating to the cash flow statement for the fourth quarter we generated $842 million of operating cash flow. Net fixed assets were up 4.3% versus last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $182 million and reflected the additional expenditures required to open 124 net new stores this quarter. Capital expenditures on existing stores, hub, and mega hub remodels or openings work on development of new stores for upcoming quarters and information technology investments. With the new stores open we finished this past quarter with 5,772 stores in 50 states and this is Columbia and Puerto Rico and St. Thomas. 604 stores in Mexico and 35 in Brazil for a total AutoZone store count of 6,411. Depreciation totaled $118.8 million for the quarter versus last year's fourth quarter expense of $108 million. This is generally in line with the recent quarter growth rates. We repurchased $692 million of AutoZone stock in the fourth quarter versus $665 million in last year's quarter. At quarter end we had $477 million remaining under our share buyback authorization and our leverage metric was 2.5 times. Again I want to stress we managed through appropriate credit ratings and not any one metric. The metric we report is meant as a guide only as each trading firm has its own criteria. We continue to view our share repurchase program as an attractive capital deployment strategy. Next I'd like to update you on our inventory levels in total and on a per store basis. The company's inventory increased 9.5% over the same period last year driven by new stores and increased product placement. Inventory per location was 674,000 versus 636,000 last year and 688,000 last quarter. Net inventory defined as merchandise inventories of accounts payable on a per location basis was a negative $85,000 versus a negative $75,000 last year and a negative $58,000 last quarter. As a result accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 112.6%.  Finally as Bill previously mentioned our continued disciplined capital management approach resulted in return on invested capital for the trailing four quarters of 35.7%. We have and will continue to make investments that we believe will generate returns that significantly exceed our cost of capital. Now I'll turn it back to Bill Rhodes. William C. Rhodes: Thank you Bill. We are pleased to report a solid fourth quarter and fiscal year. At 3% same store sales our fiscal 2019 was our best comping year since 2015. For the New Year we must continue to focus on executing at a high level which we believe can and has been a competitive advantage. To execute at a high level we have to consistently adhere to living the pledge. We cannot and will not take our eye off execution. While we study the external environment and react where appropriate we must stay committed to executing day in and day out on our game plan. Success will be achieved with an attention to detail and exceptional execution.  For 2020 we have a lot of deliverables from our IT initiatives and we will remain focused on simplifying our store AutoZoners workloads, to reduce clutter and unnecessary tests that get in the way of making the customer experience better for both the Do It Yourself customer and the professional customer. We believe our industry's fundamentals will remain strong as miles driven are expected to increase over the remainder of the year and while there's been many forecast otherwise the vehicle part has continued to age and the internal combustion engine remains the dominant vehicle of choice. Before I conclude the call I want to take this opportunity to reflect on fiscal 2019. We were able to build on past accomplishments and deliver some impressive results. In recognition of the dedication, passion, and commitment of our AutoZoners I want to highlight what they as one very strong team delivered in 2019. Both retail and commercial experienced positive same store sales in every quarter. Our total sales grew by 5.7% on a 52 week basis and set an all time sales record at 11.9 billion. Our commercial sales aggressively accelerated from 7.3% growth last year to 13.4% this year on a 52 week basis with growth in mature customer sales and productivity per program, the highest in our history. We made significant and meaningful investments in our tenured store hourly AutoZoners and it has improved our performance. Research confirms impressively that \"more technicians choose Duralast parts\" and we continue to leverage the power of the Duralast brand expanding into new categories or product types. On the back of a stellar performance of our mega hubs we expanded our vision of the future more than doubling the ultimate plans to 70 to 90 mega hubs. We opened our 600th store in Mexico and we opened 15 new locations in Brazil off of a base at the beginning of the year of only 20. We continued to accelerate our investments in technology, leveraging technological enhancements in every facet of our business. Leveraging our very strong and predictable cash flow we repurchased a record $2 billion in AutoZone stock in fiscal 2019. Since inception in 1998 we have now repurchased a cumulative 21.4 billion and we have reduced our share count from a 152.1 million to 24 million. Most importantly our team has continued to live our pledge and leverage our unique and powerful culture to deliver exceptional service to our customers who rewarded us with incremental business.  I'd like to take this opportunity to again recognize and thank our team of talented, dedicated, passionate AutoZoners for what they do each and every day for our customers which expands opportunities for AutoZoners, allows us to support the communities we serve, and ultimately rewards our shareholders. We're excited about our balanced model for growth around domestic retail and commercial, international, online, and pick up in-store. We believe our hubs and mega hubs, Mexico, Brazil, ALLDATA and digital can all grow their top line this upcoming year. To execute at a high level we must adhere to living the pledge, we cannot and we will not take our eye off of execution. Success will be achieved with an attention to detail and thoughtful execution. Service has always been our most important cultural cornerstone and it will be long into the future. Now we would like to open up the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Seth Sigman from Credit Suisse. Seth, your line is open. Seth Sigman : Hey guys, good morning. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the progress this quarter and for the year. I wanted to just follow-up on the point on the cadence in the quarter. You talked about some challenges earlier in the quarter, and then obviously an improvement later in the quarter. Can you just clarify was that specific to DIY or did you also see that trend in commercial? And then as we think about that trend in the second half of the quarter, is that more representative of the run rate of the business and how we should be thinking about the first quarter here, thanks? William C. Rhodes: Yeah, fantastic question, thank you. A couple of things; one, weather effects are always more exaggerated in the retail business at least for us at this stage in our development than they are in the commercial business. So commercial will see weather implications, but not nearly to the same extent that retail will see them. So, the ones that we were talking about specifically were more retail oriented. Part of what happened was we had a very late spring, and so May was particularly soft and then June was soft too not on a comp store basis because we had a really strong June the year before. We think July and August were much more normalized, and we hope that they are indicative of what we're going to experience in the first quarter. But we don't know what's going to happen with weather or other effects, but we feel very good about our performance in Q4. Seth Sigman : Of course, okay. And then you did mention that prices have started to increase, can you guys give us a sense of the impact it may have had on comps this quarter. And in general, how is the consumer responding in your view. I know you talked about raising prices in waves, but if you could talk about how you're seeing the consumer respond initially, that would be helpful? Thank you. William T. Giles: Yes, so far, I would say that we're seeing a good response from the consumers, and I think that the merchandising organization is doing a great job of kind of measuring these increases in as they roll through our weighted average cost. And so, it's still early days, and so I would say that we haven't seen a significant impact from a sales perspective or from a margin perspective necessarily from the tariffs, but we'll continue to monitor and continue to manage it that way going forward. Seth Sigman : Okay, great. Thanks guys. William C. Rhodes: Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Seth. And our next question is from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. Simeon Gutman your line is open. Simeon Gutman : Thanks, good morning. So, I wanted to ask first on gross margin. I have two related questions. So, Bill Giles, I think you mentioned that our gross margins should be similar going forward I think to recent trends, and I think you also said you want to make improvement. So, can you reconcile those two and then in terms of the time frame that we should extrapolate that, is that for Q1 or is that for the whole year? And then as tariffs roll in, does it make it harder to show improvement in that trend line or it all depends on the elasticity? William T. Giles: Well, that's a good question. Let me try to unpack that a little bit. We always believe that we have opportunity to improve our gross margin. We're always looking for opportunities to improve sourcing so that we can lower our cost. And then as Bill mentioned before, we recognize that the Duralast brand is an incredibly strong brand and there are further opportunities for us to continue to roll that across other categories as we continue to evolve that brand. Secondly, I would say that I'm thinking more on a shorter-term basis and not trying to extrapolate out the entire year, but as we continue to accelerate our commercial business at a double-digit rate, that's going to continue to apply pressure on gross margin. So that's kind of the way we're thinking about it, and the impact this quarter was around 20 basis points or so. So, we're all about growing the business, we're all about gross margin dollars and EBIT growth, and that's our primary focus, and we'll let the margin -- we will continue to manage the margin hard and we'll continue to look for opportunities to reduce cost. But as our commercial business grows, that will continue to put a little pressure on our absolute gross margin rate. Simeon Gutman : Got it, okay, that's helpful. My follow-up is on SG&A and I guess trading profit for growth maybe. So you stepped up a lot in fiscal 2019 and you seem to be getting a pretty good return. And you've invested on a steady pace over time. Are you debating whether it makes sense to spend even at a higher rate and trade a little more profit for growth? William T. Giles: I would say that the investments that we've made have been very specific and very targeted. So, our investments to this point have been on wage adjustments that we believe were appropriate and we believe we're getting benefit from those wage adjustments. As we move forward, we recognize that we will continue to have some wage pressure mostly from regulatory activity that is taking place across the country. So, we recognize that wages will continue to be a little bit of a pressure point, maybe not as high as it was when we proactively invested in wages. And then technology and that's a smaller component, but it's still an investment. And so, those are the specific areas and we will continue to invest in technology, and as Bill mentioned in our prepared remarks, last year was probably one of the highest years we've spent on technology, and we expect to continue to invest even more in technology as we move forward. So those are the two areas, and yes, you're right, we will play in the environment that we are in and sales have been strong and we've been able to manage our way through that and continue to generate earnings results. Simeon Gutman : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you and our next question is from Zach Fadem from Wells Fargo. Zach, your line is open. Zachary Fadem : Hey, good morning. First one on the commercial growth, curious if you could speak a little more about the makeup of the growth in the quarter, what would you attribute to new commercial programs and then on the comp component to what extent would you categorize the growth as independent mom and pop versus national or regional accounts and maybe could speak to some of the puts and takes here around the various customer categories? William C. Rhodes: Yeah, terrific question. First of all we were very excited about the growth that we had in the commercial business across all different customer segments. I did say in our prepared remarks that the up and down the street customer which are those small mom and pops grew at a faster rate than the rest of the commercial business. And we want to make that point clear to make sure you know that this is a widespread growth. Our growth in mature customer sales I also said was at an all time high level. So we were very excited about how it came across different markets, different customer segments just across the board which tells us that all the different things that we're working on from getting our store managers and district managers more engaged to the hub initiatives that we've had, to the inventory initiatives that they're all working in tandem which is exactly what we were hopeful of. Zachary Fadem : Got it, and on the investments you called out for 2020 curious if you could speak a little more about what you're doing differently versus the investments in 2019? And Bill on your SG&A comment I just want to confirm that that we should think about SG&A growth up in the seven and halfish range similar to what we saw this quarter on a 52 week basis. And if there's any extra commentary that you would add on cadence or duration of that spending in 2020? William T. Giles: Yeah, I would say that the 7.5% is the right number to think about and give you more update as we move along through the year. But certainly for the next quarter that's the way I would be thinking about it. Relative to what we did last year and how we're thinking about it moving forward and as I said I think we'll continue to invest in wages much of it will be in response to regulatory pressures. And then we will continue to escalate some of our technology investments and they will occur both on the commercial side of the business and the retail side of the business. We have made some good investments on commercial in order to be able to be an easier place to do business with through our commercial customers and provide better service there. And we recognize that there are opportunities on the retail side as well to improve customer service through technology. And then obviously like any mature company we're also changing our legacy systems as we move along and we've had a big effort on that over the last couple of years. Zachary Fadem : Got it, makes sense. Appreciate the time guys. William C. Rhodes: Alright, thank you. Operator : Thank you and our next question is from Michael Lasser from UBS. Michael, your line is open. Michael Lasser : Good morning, thanks a lot for taking my questions. Bill Rhodes historically AutoZone has been mid single-digit operating income grower and buying back enough stock to get double-digit. Now your operating margin has been down [indiscernible] it sounds like between faster commercial growth and domestic investments we should have guarded expectations around the operating margin, were these the near-term. So is this still reasonable to expect that AutoZone can achieve this type of growth algorithm\u2026? William C. Rhodes: Yeah thanks, another great question Michael. If you look at it over time we had a remarkable streak I believe of 41 straight quarters where we grew at double-digit EPS growth. A lot of things have changed since that point in time while lot of things haven\u2019t changed. We still want to grow our EBIT in the low to mid single digits and with our share repurchase program we hope to push our growth close to if not over 10%. But I don't think we'll have another streak like we had, we had 41 straight quarters. But that's within the reasons of the model. As we grow commercial we will have without a doubt pressure on our gross margins and pressure on our EBIT margins and we are not focused on what is the overall operating model -- margin for the company, we're focused on what are we going to do to grow operating profit dollars at a reasonable growth rate and get very good returns on the capital that we deployed to get that growth rate. Michael Lasser : And just a follow up to that, you mentioned that things have changed, when you're alluding to that you mean that the business is now being driven by commercial -- transparency if needed or it is both push up your gross margin, what exactly were you alluding about change? William C. Rhodes: I would say that the changes are really the acceleration of our commercial business and so as we've seen that grow from a mid single-digit to high single-digits to low double-digit that's a significant component of the change certainly that we've seen in the past and that's what we expect in the future. So, from that perspective and back to your margin question is that that continues to put a little bit of pressure on margin but we're all about taking market share and growing the business and growing dollars. And so that's really where our primary focus is and so far we've executed on that on both fronts but particularly in commercial. Michael Lasser : And Bill Giles can you clarify something for the investment community, there's been a lot of debate about the impact of price increases and inflation in response to tariffs with the skeptics being look the industry is growing fast as it has but it has been pushing forward to completion and more price increases, so the units aren\u2019t growing as fast or the consumer is not responding nearly as positive as it has been, so perhaps within that can you maybe quantify what impact your comp was from inflation and how do you respond to that point? William T. Giles: Yeah, it is hard to tell a little bit on the inflation part of it. I mean there's absolutely a component of inflation that\u2019s baked into our comp store sales improvement whether or not that inflation resulted any pressure points from a demand perspective, it's hard to tell. So it's kind of two dimensional there. But look I would say that there is definitely a component of the same store sales that is somewhat driven by inflation but overall it was a healthy growth overall. And keep in mind also that our inventory return is a 1.3 so the costs are coming through at a relatively slow rate. And so we're increasing our retails as we're seeing that cost go through. So, it is a double edged sword. We wish inventory return was faster but in this particular case it's been a little bit of a benefit for us. So we've been able to kind of measurably improve our retail prices in order to offset those costs as we move along and we will continue to do that going forward. So it won't be as lumpy as increasing our retail prices all at once. Michael Lasser : Thank you and good luck. William T. Giles: Thank you. Operator : Thank you and our next question is from Chris Horvers from JP Morgan. Chris, your line is open. Chris Horvers : Thanks, good morning guys. Couple of follow-up questions here as you think about the commercial business and the strength that you saw in July and August would you classify this past summer at the end of the day to July and August period as normal and so there's no sort of headwind nor tailwinds as you think about what could happen over the this fall period? And more on the weather as you think about the fall, if we have sort of like a warmer September and October is that just -- does that really have any impact to the business given that it is sort of temperate or could that create a headwind to the business? William C. Rhodes: I will start with the second part of it. The weather effects in our business are generally very muted in the fall. There's not a lot of rainfall that happens in the fall generally. The temperatures are maybe warmer than last year but they're not extreme temperatures that would put excess stress on our vehicle parts. So I don't think if we called out weather as a major initiative outside of hurricanes in the past. So if we get a hurricane like we did in Houston or in South Florida then that can be a bigger issue. And what was the first part of your question Chris. Chris Horvers : How would you classify the weather this past summer, July-August, June, July? William C. Rhodes: I don't think it had a big effect on our commercial business. As we went into and you were asking is there something coming headwind or tailwind, as we went into the fourth quarter the real question for us was how could we lap the accelerated growth that we had last year in Q4. That's really when our growth started to begin to grow or build and we will have the same impact in Q1, Q2, and Q3 where we will be up against stronger and stronger comps. But our momentum has been pretty consistent. Chris Horvers : So that's my follow up. So obviously May and June did have some moderating impact on your commercial comps but yet you did accelerate the stack. So how are you thinking about modeling that business going forward and your ability to sustain comp stacks against those harder comparisons or even potentially accelerate them, continue to accelerate them? William C. Rhodes: I'll go back to one thing that I said earlier in the call and that is that the effects of weather in the commercial business are very small in comparison to the retail business. So I don't want you to think that May and June were very soft because they weren't in the commercial business, they were softer in the retail business but the commercial business has been strong every period of 2019. And what's in front of us we don't know. We don't give guidance but we feel very good about the level of execution that we have, we feel very good about the initiatives that we have in place. So far they worked really well. Chris Horvers : Understood, best of luck. William C. Rhodes: Alright, thank you. Operator : Thank you and our next question is from Bret Jordan. Bret, your line is open. Bret Jordan : Hey, good morning guys. I got a question on the tariff side as well but kind of a reversal. I guess we've seen some exclusions granted on one and two and do you have anything for sort of what that might be as far as alleviating some of the tariff pressures and how you might experience some rebating from suppliers who have taken price increases but we'll see those reversed? William T. Giles: You know Bret to give you an honest answer I don't know the answer to that as far as I don't think it's significant necessarily. It certainly hasn't been something that we've talked about a lot. We have spent a lot of time here so I don't think it's a material number to us. Bret Jordan : Okay and then a question on your accounts payable. Obviously we're getting north of a 110% on inventory. What's the upper bound on that, how high can you take that as you build the inventory balances? William T. Giles: As we've talked about this in the last several quarters maybe year or so I think at some point in time we're trying to maintain that number at around that level. And so as we make investments in inventory and you heard Bill talk about it on hubs and mega hubs that we continue to open and that really helps drive a little bit of our overall inventory balance. But it does get inventory closer to the customer and it benefits both the retail and the commercial side of the business. So that's what puts pressure a little bit on the inventory and you've seen our inventory return go down slightly over time from 1.5, 1.4, 1.3 [ph]. And so our goal is really to kind of maintain that accounts payable to inventory balance at around that level. And we'll be able to -- may be able to improve it slightly but our objective is really to maintain it around that level. Bret Jordan : Right, thank you. Operator : Thank you and our next question is from Scot Ciccarelli from RBC Capital Markets. Scot, your line is open. Scot Ciccarelli : Hey guys, Scot Ciccarelli. I know you have made a lot of changes to the commercial business over the last few years especially on the product availability side. I also know you got your store managers much more involved really over the last year in trying to cultivate some of those relationships. So operationally can you help us understand specifically how the store managers have become more involved on the commercial front and is that something that starts to slow now that you're kind of reaching the anniversary point of that or do you think you can maintain that double-digit growth rate in commercial because that's something that builds over time? Thanks. William C. Rhodes: Thank you Scot. We believe that our store managers and our district managers are much more involved in the commercial business today than ever before. We started with our store managers beginning to make sales calls in the fourth quarter of last year and they're out making sales calls. But the real thing that they're doing is they're learning from the customer what's important to them and they're learning how we are executing it. When they get back to the store with their teams they can do what they do like nobody else. They can enhance our service for our customers. Before because they didn't have a direct connection to those commercial customers they really didn't know where our service advantages were and they didn't know where our service shortcomings were coming from. Now they have direct line of sight to that. I think we had a significant benefit out of that last year. I think we will continue to benefit from that for the next few years as some of them got very quickly -- got up to speed very quickly, others not so quickly. And they're all in different places on their understanding of the commercial business and their comfort with the commercial business. Scot Ciccarelli : So, there should be a pretty long tail to it sounds like. I appreciate it, thanks. William C. Rhodes: I would think so. It is the first time we've done it so we don't have empirical evidence that said that it has a three tail on it. But as I'm out in the stores and I'm talking to the commercial or to the store managers their level of knowledge is vastly different than it was 18 months ago. And that's what gets me excited. Scot Ciccarelli : Got it, thanks Bill. William C. Rhodes: Alright, thank you. Operator : Thank you. There is no more time for the question-and-answer. I will turn the call over back to Mr. Bill Rhodes. William C. Rhodes: Before we conclude the call I want to take a moment and call out that we are hosting our National Sales Meeting here in Memphis this week. This week we will be recognizing our company's very best performers and announce our new operating theme for the year. We will celebrate this past year's successes and focus on where we didn't meet our objectives. This week is for our field AutoZoners and we enthusiastically welcome them to our hometown of Memphis, Tennessee. As our business model continues to be solid and we're excited about the New Year we don't take anything for granted as we understand our customers have alternatives. We will continue to execute on our game plan but I want to stress that this is a marathon and not a sprint. As we continue to focus on the basics and focus on optimizing long-term shareholder value, we're confident AutoZone will continue to be successful. Thank you all very much for your interest in our company and for participating on today's call. Have a great day. Operator : And that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for AutoZone\u2019s 2020 first quarter conference call. With me today are Bill Giles, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax. Regarding the first quarter, I hope you have had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter\u2019s results. If not, the press release, along with slides complementing our comments today, is available on our website www.autozone.com under the Investor Relations link. Please click on Quarterly Earnings Conference Calls to see them. To begin this morning, I want to thank all AutoZoners across the entire organization for their dedicated, passionate service to our customers. I\u2019m routinely reminded of the tremendous links AutoZoners go to meet and exceed the needs of our customers, whether that\u2019s helping a retail customer, determine the cause of their problem, finding an extremely hard to find part for a commercial customer, or an ALLDATA ASE Master Tech walking the customer through an incredibly complicated repair, our AutoZoners across the Americas serve our customers with compassion, care and confidence. Our AutoZoners intense focus on the customer is the reason that I believe we have momentum and while we were able to deliver solid results this quarter. Overall, we were pleased with our performance in Q1. This morning, we will review our major themes for the quarter. Specifically, we\u2019ll talk about same-store sales performance across months, regions and customer segments. Secondly, we\u2019ll update you on the initiatives we have in place to drive sales in both retail and commercial, including our ongoing investments in technology and inventory assortments that we believe continue to be a core reason for our sales growth. We\u2019ll also touch on the subject of tariffs and the impact of those on our business. Our total sales grew 5.7% this quarter versus last year. This was faster than Q4\u2019s growth of 5.4% adjusted for the 53rd week. This growth was in line with our expectations and was encouraging considering we knew we were up against accelerating commercial growth this same time last year. We gained traction in our retail business, as our DIY sales comp was just shy of 1%. Because of a shift in the timing of our quarter versus last year\u2019s first quarter, we knew this would cause a headwind in the results for our overall comp. But even with the shift, we were quite pleased with our results. Also, the data we have on market share indicated, we were growing nicely versus the remainder of the market included in this competitive set. We feel we are well-positioned for our DIY business to deliver strong performance for the remainder of the year. Regarding our domestic DIFM business. Our sales grew 13.6% year-over-year. We were very pleased with this result considering we were up against growth of 11.3% in the first quarter last year. Considering this was the first quarter with a DIFM business had the lap double-digit sales growth, we knew this would not be an easy task. It has been encouraging to see our two-year commercial comps continue to build our team across the organization, from our sales team to our operators, merchants, technologists, marketers credit team to ALLDATA and on and on, have really bought into providing a compelling, differentiated, comprehensive experience for our customers. And with that approach, we are being rewarded with incremental business in the marketplace by our customers. While we remain smaller than many of our peers in absolute sales volume, our growth rate has been very robust, growing about three times the industry growth rate. This growth has come from a combination of many initiatives that have been in development for years, including inventory management, our inventory assortment improvements, hub and megahub store expansions, the ever-strengthening reputation of the Duralast brand across our professional customer base, technology enhancements, increased engagement of our very strong store operating teams and tremendous efforts on the part of our entire sales organization to effectively convey our value proposition. We also grew our commercial sales per store at a higher clip than we did in last year\u2019s first quarter. Although we are averaging fewer annual program openings, as approximately 85% of our stores already have a program, the programs we have opened continue to produce for us. The first quarter marked our third consecutive quarter of averaging more than $10,000 in weekly commercial sales per program. And we continue to grow our sales with mature customers in mature programs at a substantially improved growth rate, the last two years versus previous years, indicating our offerings, products, coverage, customer service and the ability to enhance the customers\u2019 overall shopping experience are improved and have been recognized and rewarded by our customers. Finally, our up and down the street business, otherwise known as the independent repair shops, grew faster than our overall commercial business, indicating that the improvements we are making are broad-based across different geographies and customer types. Our AutoZoners have taken ownership of our success and are adding value to our commercial customers, which has and will continue to have a very positive impact on the business. That said, we believe there\u2019s still considerable growth opportunities for us in commercial, as our market share remains small. Regarding our domestic DIY business. We generated another positive same-store sales result for the quarter and an improvement in percentage growth year-over-year versus last quarter. Retail remains a very consistent, predictable story for us, as it is definitely a more mature customer segment than commercial, but a predictable revenue stream and substantial profit and cash flow generator. All months of our quarter showed positive DIY same-store sales and we saw our best performance versus the previous year in November. On a two-year basis, our performance was very consistent each month. Last quarter, we mentioned the sales impact we were seeing with our Hispanic customer base. This quarter, we do not believe this impacted results, either across the country or specifically out in the Western and Southwestern U.S. markets. Regionally, we did better out West and we\u2019re a little softer in the Northeast. We believe the sales results in the Northeast were being impacted by weather and weather comparisons to last year. Overall, we were pleased with the performance and consistency in our retail business in Q1 and feel good about the remainder of the year. With that said, as is our historical practice, as we enter our second quarter, we believe it is prudent to remind everyone that weather patterns in this quarter can change significantly from year-to-year and, in particular, week-to-week. The second quarter is always our most volatile quarter from a sales perspective, both positively and negatively. But over time, weather effects normalized, as does our sales performance. In our discussions with investors, there seems to be heightened questions regarding the stability of our retail business and its trajectory. While we cannot predict the future, we certainly can learn from the past. We have routinely said that our same-store sales generally trade in a pretty tight band and that remains true. To add a touch more specificity to that discussion, we\u2019ve had periods of underperformance and overperformance in our retail same-store sales. But over the last 25 quarters, our retail same-store sales have been positive for 21 of those 25 quarters. While many casual observers of our industry believe retail is contracting and commercial is accelerating, the facts according to Auto Care, our industry association do not support that notion. Their data has shown both sectors of the industry with very long-term consistent growth in the low to mid single-digit range, with commercial growing slightly faster. For us, we believe in the health of both our retail and commercial business. So if we sound upbeat about our sales opportunities for the remainder of 2020, we are, and I\u2019ll explain some of the reasons for our optimism. We have a number of initiatives we\u2019ve been executing. One major ongoing one is availability. Once again, we learned that adding inventory and additional parts coverage matters in local markets. This quarter, we set records for the highest in-stock position in our company\u2019s history. Congratulations to our supply chain team, merchant and operators. Great work. Additionally, we opened 11 new hub stores this quarter and now have 216 hub locations, 37 of which are megahubs. We continue to see sales ramping in markets where hub stores are added. We see it, of course, in the hubs themselves, but also in the surrounding market service by the hub. We are seeing these larger stores paying for themselves faster and faster in the maturation curve. And we\u2019re seeing them growing well past the first or second-year open. Our first couple of megahub locations opened in 2013, and they are still comping above the overall chain comp. We\u2019ll continue to open hubs for the foreseeable future, as we are utilizing them as distribution nodes for hard to find parts, adding to our local market inventory availability. Hub stores are also helping us with our online orders for next day delivery. It is an efficient way to have and leverage all the product in the local market and improves our ability to meet customer demand, regardless of channel in a very cost-effective manner. Next, we have been spending a significant amount of time, effort and resources to leverage technology to enhance the customer experience. We\u2019ve invested a great deal in both operating and capital expense to benefit our DIY and DIFM businesses. Our IT spend has comfortably increased by double digits for the last few years. At the end of the quarter, we began to roll out after a considerable amount of time, due diligence and testing a new point-of-sale system to our stores. This system leverages new architectures and technologies that will expedite the transaction by making the workflow more succinct and logical, with touchscreen capabilities, and will allow us to make future changes much quicker as we replace very old legacy code, all to enhance the customer experience. We\u2019ve also done some important work behind the scenes that should help our agility by updating our store operating system, expanding the number of available skews our systems can handle and updating our human capital system. We\u2019re also investing a great deal in our commercial systems as we continue to test these new technology. We remain confident that allowing our customers easier means of doing business with us will help commercial continue to grow at an accelerated pace for the future. On last quarter\u2019s call, we highlighted what we were seeing with tariffs. We noted that as the result of the tariffs, we had experienced a small amount of inflation, a departure from the norm. As the tariffs were introduced, we began to pass those costs on to our customers. We were successful in negotiating with certain vendors, reducing the impact of the tariffs. However, we did have to raise some prices. As some of the tariff increases are considerable, in particular, select product lines, we\u2019ve been intentionally passing those costs along in tranches, as we absorb those costs through our weighted average cost accounting method. If the tariffs remain, we intend to pass additional cost increases on through increased retails. The tariffs has \u2013 have resulted in SKU-to-SKU inflation, which differs from our historical experience. To date, tariffs and their impact on our cost and retail has been manageable and not a significant driver of our business results one way or the other. Turning to our omni-channel efforts. We continue to invest in our strategy to enhance the customer shopping experience by meeting customers when, where and how they want to shop. We have initiatives in place to improve our in-store systems and websites, autozone.com, autozonepro, mobile, the new duralastparts website and alldata. We continue to see growth in website traffic and rapid growth in our shift to home next day delivery and buy online pick up in store sales. But omni-channel will \u2013 still represents a very small percentage of our business substantially below 5%. Last quarter, we discussed our next day delivery program that allows customers in over 85% of the U.S. markets to order as late as midnight in some markets and received their products at their home the very next day. We continue to see buy online pick up in store is our largest omni-channel business by a pretty wide margin. This BOPIS model is also growing faster than our ship to home businesses highlighting the importance of our high-touch operating model, where customers place a high value on the trustworthy advice our AutoZoners deliver to them. Regarding our annual operating theme for 2020 40 years of wow customer service, we continue to push for a relentless focus on what matters to our customers, exceptional service, fast deliveries, high-quality parts and products, trustworthy advice, and flawless execution across the enterprise. In 2020, we continue to challenge our leadership teams to reduce the time of redundant or non-customer-facing activities for our store AutoZoners. By removing or streamlining these tasks, we know we can improve our levels of customer service. This will continue to be a major focus for us in 2020. Along with improving our local parts availability and assortment, we continue to manage this organization to provide exceptional service for our customers, provide our AutoZoners with a great place to work with substantial opportunities for advancement and work to ensure we are providing strong returns for our shareholders. In summary, we were pleased with our performance and remain encouraged with our industry stream in both DIY and DIFM and our prospects for the remainder of the fiscal year. We believe macro factors, such as a relatively low gas prices and increasing miles-driven remain largely in our favor and we remain committed to growing our market share in both our DIY and commercial businesses. For the quarter, total sales increased 5.7% and our domestic same-store sales were up 3.4%. This performance was generally in line with our expectations, but we did have an unfavorable comparison in sales due to a calendar shift resulting from our 53rd week this past year. Our same-store sales would have been 68 basis points higher if we were comparing to the same weeks last year. Regionally, the markets West of the Mississippi outperformed the Eastern half of the U.S. The Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic markets were our lowest performance, but we see in our underperforming markets consistent performance on the two-year stack basis. During the quarter, we opened 18 new stores in the U.S. and our commercial business opened 24 net new programs. Currently, 85% of our domestic stores have a commercial program and the vast majority of our international stores have a commercial program. During the quarter, we continue to expand our international footprint opening two new stores in Mexico and two in Brazil. We should once again highlight another strong performance in return on invested capital, as we were able to finish our first quarter at 35.5%. We continue to be pleased with this metric, as it is one of the best in all of hard lines retailing. However, our primary focus has been and continues to be that we ensure every incremental dollar of capital that we deploy in this business provides an acceptable return well in excess of our cost of capital. It is important to reinforce that we will always maintain our diligence regarding capital stewardship, as the capital we invest is our investors\u2019 capital. Before I pass the discussion over to Bill Giles to talk about our financial results, I\u2019d like to again thank and reinforce how appreciative we are of our AutoZoners\u2019 efforts to again deliver solid results for our first fiscal quarter of 2020. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Bill Giles. Bill? William Giles : Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everyone. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to talk more specifically about our domestic retail, commercial and international results. For the quarter, total auto parts sales, which includes our domestic retail and commercial businesses, our Mexico and Brazil stores increased 5.8%. For the trailing four quarters ended, total sales for AutoZone store were $1,864,000. This is up from an average of $1,792,000 at Q1 ending last year. Total commercial sales increased 13.6% in the quarter. Commercial represented 22% of our total sales and grew approximately $75 million over last year\u2019s Q1. We are encouraged to highlight for the quarter, our domestic commercial weekly sales averaged approximately $10,600 per program, the third quarter in a row of sales above $10,000. This was an increase of 10.2% from last year\u2019s $9,600 in average weekly sales per program for our first quarter. And that $9,600 was up 8% over the year before, a very strong acceleration. We now have our commercial program in 4,917 stores, or 85% of our domestic stores. As Bill mentioned earlier, we remain committed to gaining market share with our commercial customers. We are encouraged by the initiatives we have in place and feel we can further grow sales and market share. Our Mexico stores continue to perform well. We opened two new stores during the first quarter ending the quarter with 606 stores. We remain committed to open stores for many years to come. Regarding Brazil. We now operate 37 stores. Our performance continues to improve and we remain optimistic about the long-term future of this market. While we cannot claim success yet as we are incurring a substantial per store annual operating loss, this market has the potential to be much larger than Mexico. So while challenging, the potential size of the market is significant. Gross margin for the quarter was 53.7% of sales, up 8 basis points versus last year\u2019s first quarter. The slight increase in gross margin was attributable to higher merchandise margins. While our accelerated pace of commercial growth is weighed on our overall gross margin, we continue to see opportunities to lower our costs through direct sourcing. I do want to stress to remain, we remain committed to taking costs out of our business where appropriate and feel we can save on costs from here. Our primary focus has always been growing absolute gross profit dollars in our total Auto Parts segment. And we\u2019ve been pleased with our growth, driven by the acceleration we\u2019ve experienced in commercial. SG&A for the quarter was 35.8% of sales, deleveraging 65 basis points to last year\u2019s first quarter. This was in line with our expectations at the beginning of the quarter. On the cost front, we highlighted on last few quarters\u2019 conference calls, the investments we have made, specifically wage rates and technology for this fiscal year. The deleverage for this quarter was primarily driven by our planned domestic store payroll investments and continuing IT investments, which negatively impacted operating expenses. EBIT for the quarter was $500 million. Our EBIT margin was 17.9%. Interest expense for the quarter was $43.7 million, up 12.1% from Q1 a year ago, but in line with our expectations. We are planning interest in the $44 million range in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 versus $41.4 million last year Q2. Our higher forecast than last year includes our costs associated with the bond issuance we had this past April. Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $5,287,000 million, or approximately $130 million above last year\u2019s Q1 ending balance of $5,156,000. Our adjusted debt level metric finished the quarter at 2.5 times EBITDAR, while in any given quarter, we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on management\u2019s opinion regarding debt and equity market conditions, we remain committed to both our investment-grade rating and our capital allocation strategy, and share repurchases are an important element of that strategy. For the quarter, our tax rate was 23.2% versus 21.7% in last year\u2019s first quarter. This quarter\u2019s rate only benefited 33 basis points from stock options exercised, while last year it benefited 250 basis points. Unfortunately, stock option exercises aren\u2019t predictable and they can come in waves driving substantial fluctuations positive and negative in our tax rate and ultimately in our net income and EPS. For the second quarter of FY 2020, we suggest investors model us at 23% before any assumption on credits due to stock option exercises, because we cannot effectively predict this activity we remain committed to reporting the stock option impact on the tax rate. Net income for the quarter was $350 million relatively flat to last year\u2019s first quarter because it was depressed by previously discussed higher tax rate due to the reduced stock option exercises. Our diluted share count of $24.5 million was down 6.1% from last year\u2019s first quarter. The combination of these factors drove earnings per share for the quarter to $14.30, up 6.2% over the prior year\u2019s first quarter. Assuming a consistent tax rate in both periods, EPS would have increased 8.3%. Relating to the cash flow statement. For the first quarter, we generated $447 million of operating cash flow. Net fixed assets were up 5.2% versus last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $101 million and reflected the additional expenditures required to open 22 net new stores this quarter, capital expenditures on existing stores, hub and megahub remodels or openings, work on development of new stores for upcoming quarters and information technology investments. With the new stores opened, we finished this past quarter with 5,790 stores in the U.S., 606 stores in Mexico and 37 in Brazil for a total store count of $6,433. Depreciation totaled $89.8 million for the quarter versus last year\u2019s first quarter expense of $82.5 million. This is generally in line with recent quarter growth rates. Effective the first day of this fiscal year September 1, we adopted the new lease accounting standard that required the company to recognize operating assets and liabilities on the balance sheet. You will see that we have recorded just under a $2.6 billion in operating lease right-of-use assets to the balance sheet, as displayed in our highlights pages attached to our press release. We do not expect this to have an impact on our leverage. We repurchased $450 million of AutoZone stock in the quarter versus $497 million in last year. At quarter-end, we had $1,277 million remaining under our share buyback authorization and our leverage metric was 2.5 times. Again I want to stress, we managed the appropriate credit ratings and not any one metric. The metric we report is meant as a guide only, as each rating agency has its own criteria. We continue to view our share repurchase program as an attractive capital deployment strategy. Next, I\u2019d like to update you on our inventory levels in total. The company\u2019s inventory increased 9.1% over the same period last year, driven by new stores and increased product placement. Inventory per location was $694,000 versus $658,000 last year and $674,000 last quarter. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable, on a per location basis was a negative $71,000 versus a negative $59,000 last year and a negative $85,000 last quarter. As a result, accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at a 110.3% versus last year\u2019s Q1 of 108.9%, a solid improvement. Finally, as Bill previously mentioned, our continued disciplined capital management approach resulted in return on invested capital. For the trailing four quarters of 35.5%, we have and will continue to make investments that we believe will generate returns that significantly exceed our cost of capital. Now I\u2019ll turn it back to Bill Rhodes. William Rhodes : Thank you, Bill. We are pleased to report a solid first quarter, delivering 3.4% same-store sales growth, while strong was in line with our expectations. Over the last five quarters or so, we have made incremental operating expense investments in our business with an expectation that we would improve our competitive position and therefore, increase market share in both sectors accelerating our sales growth. We\u2019ve been pleased with those investments, which were primarily in labor and technology. Our labor investments have resulted in reduced turnover of our most tenured knowledgeable customer-facing AutoZoners. And as we begin to deploy these new technologies, we expect them to enhance the customer and AutoZoners experience. In fiscal 2019, we shared well in advance that we would have accelerating SG&A expenses, which would lead to reduced EBIT growth for the fiscal year. We delivered on that commitment and slightly overperformed our expectations regarding EBIT in 2019. As we embark on fiscal 2020, we still have elements of our expense structure that are growing faster than historical rates. But our expectation is to have higher than historical sales growth like we have experienced in the last several quarters. For fiscal 2020, our expectation is the higher expected sales growth, will lead to EBIT growth rates above the last four quarters and approaching our more typical low to single \u2013 mid single-digit levels. For the New Year, we must continue to execute consistently at a high level, which we believe is in our line of sight. We understand we must adhere to living the pledge and doing what is right for customers. We cannot take our eye off of execution. While we study the external environment and react where appropriate, we must keep managing to our game plan. Success will be achieved with an attention to detail and exceptional execution. For the remainder of the year, we have a lot of deliverables from our IT initiatives and we will remain focused on simplifying our store AutoZoners workloads to reduce clutter and unnecessary task that get in the way of making the customer experience better, both for do-it-yourself customer and the professional customers. We believe our industry\u2019s fundamentals will remain solid as we see positive year-over-year miles-driven statistics and the aging vehicle characteristics in our markets continued to encourage us about the New Year. We remain focused on growing our DIY business and continuing to grow our commercial business well in excess of industry growth rates. We believe our balanced earnings and cash-generating model allows us to deliver steady growth as our history suggests. We promised to remain committed to both executing our strategies and getting better every single day. I would like to take this opportunity to again recognize and thank our team of talented, dedicated, passionate AutoZoners for what they do each and every day for our customers, which expands opportunities for AutoZoners, allows us to support the communities we serve and ultimately rewards our shareholders. Now we\u2019d like to open up the call for questions. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from Seth Sigman from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Seth Sigman : Hey, guys, good morning. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the quarter. I wanted to talk about commercial a little bit. I mean, obviously a lot of progress over the last 12 months. When you look at the growth of commercial, how do we think about growth coming from existing customers versus progress winning new customers? And then as you look out over the next 12 months, maybe you just talk about some of the incremental drivers that give you confidence that you can sustain the momentum in that channel? Thanks. William Rhodes : Yes. Thank you. Well, regarding the \u2013 where the growth is coming from, I\u2019m even mentioned in our prepared remarks that we\u2019re seeing significant growth from mature customers who happen to be in mature programs. So most of the growth that we\u2019re seeing and most of the change in the growth that we\u2019re seeing is coming from existing customers that we\u2019ve had, whether they were up and down the street or national account customers. We\u2019re just penetrating those customers much deeper than we were before. Regarding where we go from here. Obviously, we don\u2019t have a crystal ball. But I will tell you when we look back over this acceleration over the last five quarters, it has not been one thing. It has been due to several different initiatives that we\u2019ve had in place and frankly, been in the works for several years, whether that\u2019s inventory assortment improvements, where that\u2019s getting our store managers and district managers involved, whether it\u2019s they building the reputation and the brand of the Duralast products that we sell, there has been a whole host of different things that we believe have contributed to this growth. We don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen in the future, but we do know that we have several other initiatives in front of us on the commercial front, particularly technology initiatives that we have not rolled out yet and we\u2019re excited about what the prospects of those initiatives will mean in the future. Seth Sigman : Okay. Thanks for that Bill. And then just a follow-up question on pricing trends. I think you had talked about raising prices this year in phases or tranches. I assume there\u2019s more starting to come through now. Can you just talk about the consumer reaction, any signs of elasticity? And it sounds like your tone on the consumer overall is very healthy. Just curious what you\u2019re seeing in terms of elasticity? Thanks. William Rhodes : Yes. It\u2019s really hard to see it. Certainly, in certain product categories, we\u2019ve seen the tariffs come in and they\u2019ve been meaningful. But we have not taken the full cost impact because of our weighted average cost accounting model. So those costs come in over time as the inventory turns. So we have moved our retails up, as I said, in tranches. And when we\u2019ve seen them go up, we have seen some elasticity of demand in certain categories, not a ton. At the end of the day, when we look at the impact of the inflation in the retails and the elasticity, we don\u2019t think net-net, it\u2019s having a significant impact on our business yet. But again, we still have a long way to go, because we haven\u2019t absorbed all those costs and then who knows where the tariffs go from here. Seth Sigman : Great. Thanks, Bill. I appreciate it. William Rhodes : Yes. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Lasser from UBS. Your line is now open. Michael Lasser : Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Bill Rhodes, in your prepared remarks, you expressed a lot of optimism about the outlook for the DIY business. Is that A, what factors are driving that enthusiasm? And B, do you think that\u2019s more of an AutoZone specific story, or a broader industry story? Because some of your competitors are either seeing decelerating DIY traffic and/or more volatility in the results of their DIY business? William Rhodes : Yes. Michael, I would say, I had the same optimism I have had for about 25 years. I believe in the retail business. There \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of people, as I mentioned, that think that the retail business is going away that it\u2019s declining and the commercial business is rapidly growing. If you go back to our 1991 Annual Report, we are trying to dispute the myth that the retail business is declining. I\u2019m trying to continue to dispel that myth. And the easiest way for me to do is talk about what has transpired over the last 25 quarters. 25 quarters, 21 of them have had positive same-store sales for AutoZone. Now I don\u2019t know what other people are experiencing. But I also mentioned enough, continued to mention that our retail business, in particular, it does not fluctuate that much quarter-to-quarter. It- our performance is in a pretty tight band. Now this quarter, we did particularly well, especially if you consider the shift, the calendar shift that impacted us, that would have been one of our stellar quarters. We\u2019re also going to have quarters that aren\u2019t as strong. That\u2019s just the nature of the business, but it trades from slightly down to up one or two points. And it\u2019s been doing that for as long as I\u2019ve been in this business. Michael Lasser : Over that last 25 years, there has been a market share shift from smaller independent and regional players to the larger players. Over time, should we see more share being shifted between and amongst the larger players just because there\u2019s less consolidation and fragmentation within the market? William Rhodes : I think you\u2019re going to continue to see it come from those smaller folks, it\u2019s what\u2019s happened overall. When I got in this business, there were about 35,000 auto parts outlets. Today, there\u2019s about 35,000 auto parts outlets. Now a lot more of them are in the hands of us and our close-in competitors. But there\u2019s still a whole lot out there that aren\u2019t by us. Michael Lasser : Okay. And then my second question is, you\u2019ve deployed a lot of investment, a lot of technology. And I think you\u2019re seeing good returns on that and that\u2019s what\u2019s driving some of the very healthy growth within your DIFM segment. How much more opportunity and you mentioned further technology investments you are going to be rolling out? How much more opportunity is there to deploy investments to generate these types of returns? And should \u2013 how should we think about the growth rate of SG&A dollars, specifically in the next couple of quarters as a result of that? William Rhodes : As I\u2019ve said in the prepared remarks, we\u2019re going to continue to have elevated SG&A expenses. We\u2019ve spent a lot of time working on some substantial new technology-oriented initiatives that frankly you haven\u2019t seen yet. And therefore, we haven\u2019t begun to expense them yet. They\u2019re showing up through the capital expense line. But because we haven\u2019t deployed them, we\u2019re not depreciating them. Those are coming. There\u2019s some on the DIY side, like I mentioned, the new POS system. We also have several on the commercial side that will be coming over the next six months or so. Michael Lasser : Okay. Good luck and have a good holiday. William Rhodes : Thank you, too, Michael. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Simeon Gutman : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Just want to follow-up on Michael\u2019s question. I think the first one on the DIY business. Bill, I think you said, we expect the strength or strong results to continue specifically around DIY. I know you don\u2019t really give guidance, especially by segment. But does that suggest that the run rate of DIY should improve going forward, or that the consistent healthy trends continue going forward? William Rhodes : Yes. What I\u2019m trying to say is, remember, DIY does \u2013 it trades in a very tight band. We had a strong quarter this quarter. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen next quarter or the quarter after that. But overall, we believe in the long-term health of the DIY business. That\u2019s the message that I\u2019m trying to make sure that we convey. I also want to put an exclamation point of something else that I said in the script. And that is that the second quarter is always very volatile. And part of it has to do with when the quarter ends, it ends right around Valentine\u2019s Day, which is when the season shift, when tax refunds begin to hit the marketplace. So I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen in the second quarter. It\u2019s always volatile and we just want to make sure everybody realizes that. Simeon Gutman : Got it. Okay. My follow-up is, you also made a comment towards the ending of the call about how EBIT growth should approach some of that \u2013 your historic rates over time. If you look at the balance right now, where your comps are growing nicely, you seem to be taking share in the industry. You are investing, but your implication that it\u2019s going to approach it over time means that these investments can subside and the top line momentum should continue. In another way of asking it is why not maintain the current algorithm in which EBIT growth continues to grow steadily maybe at a lower rate and \u2013 but you continue to take market share, which seems like you\u2019re able to do and there\u2019s lots of it. So I guess, how much debate is there? Why not continue a higher level of investment to continue growing at an appropriate rate and as long as the market is giving you credit for it? William Giles : Yes. I think overall, I mean, our objective, as Bill said, is over the long-term to grow our EBIT at a low to mid single-digit rate. We\u2019ve got a fair number of investments that were current that we\u2019ve made and that we\u2019re currently working on, as Bill highlighted, many in technology. And many, for example, in the hubs and megahubs, which we\u2019ve had terrific results on and we\u2019ll continue to invest in hubs and megahubs, which will also elevate some of our inventory levels as well. So we\u2019re going to continue to invest in the business as we gained momentum. I think, we have a fairly long track record of being able to manage, both margin and expenses in light of this kind of sales performance that we\u2019re producing and we continue to expect to do that over the long haul. Simeon Gutman : Okay, thanks. Happy holidays. William Rhodes : Yes. You too. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Matt McClintock from Raymond James. Your line is now open. Matthew McClintock : Yes. Good morning, everyone, and congrats on the quarter as well. I was wondering if we could just follow-up on Seth\u2019s question just about commercial \u2013 the commercial business in general. I think, you said that\u2019s the bulk of the gains have been coming from mature markets, mature customers. I was wondering is the growth rate from new customers or the contribution from new customers accelerating as well? That\u2019s my first question. William Rhodes : I think it\u2019s accelerating as the entire business accelerates. The point that we\u2019re trying to make sure is that the biggest change that we\u2019ve seen over the last six quarters or so has been our mature customer growth has changed significantly. Matthew McClintock : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then, as you look today now that you\u2019ve actually comped the comp or compared against more difficult growth rates within that business. Taking a step back a year ago versus today, would you say that you\u2019re more optimistic about the growth potential for that business than you were a year ago? And meaning, longer-term, do you think that your comp algorithm could actually accelerate from here simply from that confidence that you just sold this quarter? William Rhodes : Well, our confidence isn\u2019t going to determine whether we\u2019re successful or not unfortunately. I think, we certainly have a higher level of confidence, because we\u2019ve done it for five quarters. I would say more importantly than that, we are encouraged by the initiatives that we have in front of us. Now you said something I want to make sure that I\u2019m not saying. I\u2019m not saying our sales are going to accelerate from here in commercial, I don\u2019t know. But I feel like we will continue to outperform the industry by hopefully a substantial margin. That\u2019s 10% or 15%, I don\u2019t know, but I\u2019m really excited about the initiatives that we have in front of us. And the \u2013 basically, the momentum that we\u2019re building in the marketplace from our inventory availability to the power of the Duralast brand to service that our customers are seeing from our AutoZoners just, as I\u2019ve talked to customers, I see a whole different level of confidence that our customers have in us and our ability to service their needs. Matthew McClintock : Perfect. Thanks for the color. Happy holidays, guys. William Rhodes : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Liz Suzuki of Bank of America. Your line is now open. Elizabeth Lane Suzuki : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Could you talk about private label penetration broadly? And what percentage of your sales is in private label currently? And what the next initiatives are for the Duralast brand? William Rhodes : Yes. I mean, we feel terrific about the Duralast brand, which is the largest brand \u2013 about the largest brand in aftermarket auto parts and we have over 50% of our sales come from our private label products. And the merchandising organization has done a terrific job of continuing to expand that brand across categories. And it continues to have a very high penetration and it\u2019s very well received by the customers, both on the DIY side and on the commercial side both. And so our expectation is that we\u2019ll continue to develop the brand, broaden it out, continue to find further opportunities in other categories where we can do further line extensions on Duralast and Valucraft and Duralast Gold brand all together. Elizabeth Lane Suzuki : And are there certain product categories, where Duralast is not currently high in your lineup of products, and where do you think there\u2019s a big opportunity? William Rhodes : I think on some of those would be, some of the ones that are more dominated by national brands, for example, in oil and those kinds of categories that maybe they\u2019re already is an existing dominant national brand. But in many categories, we find that there continues to be significant opportunities from both Duralast and other private label products that we have. Elizabeth Lane Suzuki : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Baker of Nomura. Your line is now open. Michael Baker : Thank you. Within the margin outlook, it sounds like your sales have been up 5% each of the last few quarters adjusting for the extra week in the fourth quarter and you\u2019re talking about profits up low-to-mid single digits. So I guess that might imply some chance for margins to still be down. Is that right? And can you talk about your expectations of gross margins versus SG&A? William Rhodes : Yes. I mean, your math is right. And I would say that gross margin, we feel good about. I mean this quarter, we had a relatively flat, I think, was up 8 basis points on gross margin. So we feel pretty good about our ability to be able to continue to manage gross margin. Obviously, we get continued pressures from tariffs, et cetera. But the merchandising organization has done a great job of continuing to find opportunities to lower our costs. So we feel pretty good about the health of gross margin. And yes, on the SG&A front, we\u2019re going to continue to make the investments that we have made, many of which are focused on wages, as well as technology over the long haul. And so we expect there to be a little bit of pressure on that. But again, as Bill mentioned before, and we\u2019ve mentioned, that our goal is to continue to grow EBIT on a low-to-mid single-digit over the long-term. Michael Baker : Okay, understood. And then a quick follow-up. Just on the calendar shift, how does that impact 2Q where I think you pick up a February week, but lose a November week? William Giles : Yes. I think it depends on what happens in that week in February, as I\u2019ve talked about a couple of times already. That particular point in the calendar is very volatile. The last time we had this, it was very favorable to our second quarter results. We don\u2019t know what will happen this time. But we\u2019ll let you know, it could easily be favorable or it could easily be unfavorable, just depends on that \u2013 what happens right around Valentine\u2019s Day. Michael Baker : Understood. I appreciate that. Thank you. William Rhodes : Yep. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Zack Fadem from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Zachary Fadem : Hey, good morning. Could you talk a little more about the comp impact in markets where megahubs are added? And how that compares to the overall fleet? And then just as the hub presence matures, could you walk us through the comp trajectory and how those markets tend to perform after the opening? William Rhodes : Yes. I would say on the megahub markets, I mean, we continue to see good performance out of them and not to dissect it too much. But it depends on how broad the market is and how close then the market is. And keep in mind that we only have 37 megahubs today. And frankly, the vast majority of them are relatively immature. So I think, we\u2019re still identifying what we believe to be the maturation curve from a sales perspective on megahubs. But we continue to be encouraged by the year-over-year improvements that the megahubs perform. Hubs have a little bit more maturity to them. But again, we\u2019re doing things that are helping drive the business overall adding more inventory, et cetera. So it becomes a little non-comparable when you look at some of the hubs today versus where they were like maybe five years ago in terms of what we\u2019ve done inside the box to be able to drive sales. So the short answer is that, the maturation curve of both hubs and megahubs is still evolving. We continue to be very pleased with the investments that we\u2019re making and see that the improvements that we can drive and we will continue to invest in that category. Zachary Fadem : Got it. That makes sense. And could you also speak to the margin trajectory of the commercial business, whether you\u2019ve seen any improvement in incremental margins, as that business has gained scale? And are there any opportunities that you think are out there to drive higher commercial margins now that you\u2019re slowing the new commercial program investments? William Rhodes : Yes. I would say, I don\u2019t think that we\u2019re \u2013 I think the margin for commercial continues to remain healthy and there are obviously opportunities for us to improve margin on both sides of the business. But at the same time, keep in mind, that we\u2019re growing commercial at a rapid rate, but we\u2019re also making some investments and that\u2019s helping drive that. So over the long-term, I would expect margins to improve as some of those investments become more mature. But over the shorter-term, I would expect our margins to remain stable. Zachary Fadem : Got it. That makes sense. I appreciate the time. William Rhodes : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Greg Badishkanian of Citi. Your line is now open. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, good morning. This is David [indiscernible] on for Greg. Thanks for taking my questions. William Rhodes : Sure. Unidentified Analyst : So I want to talk about the DIY business a bit as well. So if we just take a step back and look at the big picture, so employment level was still strong, coupled with low gas prices across most of the country. So at this point, should DIY potentially be comping at the higher-end of that tight band that you talked about maybe 0% to 1% or so. I\u2019m just trying to gauge where that business is now and what\u2019s the correct run rate for comps in DIY. for where we are in the cycle? William Rhodes : All great questions. I just keep going back to \u2013 it trades in such a tight band that it\u2019s really hard to say. We certainly think lower gas mileage is beneficial. We think miles-driven increases are beneficial. But there\u2019s so minuscule that they\u2019re just not big drivers of the business overall. We think the most important driver of what happens with the DIY business is what our AutoZoner do to provide great service to our customers. And I think we\u2019re doing a really, really good job of that right now. The morale of this organization of our teams in our stores, in particular, they know they\u2019re winning. They feel like they\u2019re winning. They feel good about it. And I think that that\u2019s translating into better service, which is translating into better performance. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. And then my follow-up on the expense growth. So up high-single digits again here in Q1 and you\u2019ve been clear that that\u2019s going to remain elevated. But with the acceleration in comp sales we\u2019ve seen over the past few quarters, is there any thought as to pushing on these tech and store-based investments even further and above your initial plans now that we\u2019re seeing the benefit come through the top line? William Rhodes : Yes, that\u2019s a great question. Most of those investments take time. And so there\u2019s a lot of things in the pipeline. So we might like to accelerate some of them, but there is a certain amount that we can digest as an organization. There\u2019s a certain pace at which we can develop those initiatives. So we will continue to work hard. We will continue to drive them where we can. But I expect it to be a little bit more steady state. Unidentified Analyst : All right. Thanks, again, and congrats on a nice quarter. William Rhodes : Thank you. William Giles : Thank you. Operator : Our last question comes from Greg Melich from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Gregory Melich : Hi. Thanks. So I\u2019ll make a count. So first, I want to circle back. Thanks for your \u2013 the incremental on the tariffs. I know we\u2019ve started to see some exemptions coming through and also \u2013 but we still have the timing of pricing through what\u2019s already happened. Could you help us understand, is that any potential benefit maybe from refunds coming from any exemptions on certain products? And then when we think about further price increases, is it just as simple as taking when the tariffs went up and then thinking about your inventory turning once a year as to when that would actually flow through? William Rhodes : Yes. I think the second part of that is absolutely right, Greg, and it\u2019s going to depend on the categories. Certain categories turn faster or slower than other categories. So as we turn that inventory, the cost or the cost in our gross margin increase. And we\u2019re trying to manage that consistent with how we manage the retail increases. For the sole purpose of not shocking the system, we\u2019ve had lots of different cost increases over the years for a variety of reasons, whether that\u2019s all based prices going up, lead, steel, whatever the case might be. But when it\u2019s 25%, that\u2019s a significant increase. And so we\u2019re trying to do that over three or four tranches, so not to shock the system and to try to provide the customer with as good value as we can for as long as we can. So far, I\u2019m very pleased with how our merchants have managed those issues. What was the first part of your question, Greg.? Gregory Melich : The first part was we started to see some exemptions from the USTR on certain product SKUs. Has that \u2013 does that happen in for you guys on anything material? William Rhodes : We have filed some exceptions, don\u2019t know all the answers at this point in time. Some of them would impact us in a beneficial way if we were able to get them. Gregory Melich : Got it. And then on inventory, I know that\u2019s been growing up 9%. Is that a timing issue, or is it just up against a lower comparison? What should we think about that as a normal growth rate back towards sales in coming quarters? William Giles : I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll be back towards sales in coming quarters. You have some inflation baked in there as well on the inventory. And then again, I think a couple of points that I\u2019m going to refer that Bill pointed out highest in-stock level ever with a corporation, continued investments in hub and megahubs, again, inventory closer into the customer wins and we\u2019re going to continue to go down that path. We want to continue to maintain our AP to inventory ratio above a 100% and we have successfully. I think that we\u2019ll probably be at this level a little bit lower maybe, but not certainly at a sales growth rate. Gregory Melich : That\u2019s great. Congratulations, guys, and have a great holiday. William Giles : You, too, happy holidays. William Rhodes : Thank you, Greg. William Rhodes : Okay. Before we conclude the call, I\u2019d just like to take a moment to reiterate that we believe our business model continues to be solid. We\u2019re excited about our growth prospects for the year. We do not take anything for granted as we understand our customers have alternatives. We have an exciting plan that should help us succeed this fiscal year, but I want to stress that this is a marathon and not a sprint. As we continue to focus on the basics and focus on optimizing long-term shareholder value, we\u2019re confident AutoZone will continue to be successful. We thank you for participating in today\u2019s call. And we\u2019d like to wish our AutoZoners and everyone on the call a very happy and healthy holiday season and a prosperous New Year. Thank you very much. Operator : And that concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Bill Rhodes : Good morning and thank you for joining us today for AutoZone\u2019s 2020 second quarter conference call. With me today are Bill Giles, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax. Regarding the second quarter, I hope you\u2019ve had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter\u2019s results. If not, the press release along with slides complementing our comments today is available on our website, www.autozone.com, under the Investor Relations link. Please click on Quarterly Earnings Conference Calls to see them. Starting this morning, I want to thank all AutoZoners across the entire organization for their hard work and dedication to delivering great customer service in light of a challenging sales environment this past quarter. As I mentioned on our last conference call, weather, during our second quarter each year, can be volatile and can significantly impact our performance. Coming off of a strong fall selling season, having delivered 3.4% same-store sales in Q1, we were confident in our ability to execute, but remained cautious heading into our second quarter. And as it has been widely reported, the winter weather was much milder in our second quarter than last year. While our sales were certainly meaningfully below plan and our expectations to deliver both, net income and EPS at the level we were, was commendable. We have an amazingly simple business, yet it has to be executed every day at a very high level across more than 6,400 locations in multiple countries and geographies in order to make everything work. This is where our culture continues to guide and differentiate us. This past quarter, we continued to focus on our many initiatives, not the least of which included incremental inventory replacements, megahub rollouts, ongoing enhancements to how we digitally interact with our commercial customers, and the rollout of our updated retail POS system. We feel both, our store presentation and customer service is second to none in our space. But, I can also tell you with full certainty, we are happy to put this quarter behind us and focus on delivering materially better sales performance for the remainder of the year. In providing a little more color this morning, I\u2019ll talk about the monthly sales cadence, regional sales performance differences, retail versus commercial, and lastly, merchandise categories impacted by the quarter\u2019s results. In regard to cadence for the quarter. As we completed the first two-thirds of our quarter, our same-store sales were positive but certainly below our plan and expectations. As you will recall, in the prior year, the winter weather was also mild until the last two weeks of our quarter, when the polar vortex arrived. As we were comparing against the mild winter with another one, our same-store sales were positive but our two-year growth was considerably softer than it was in our first quarter. At the end of this quarter, as we compared against the severe winter weather last year, our performance compared to last year was very poor with combined same-store sales down 6% for the last two weeks. However, on a two-year comp-store basis, the last four weeks of the quarter were substantially stronger than the first two-thirds of the quarter. Unfortunately, as we have stated many, many times, the timing of our second quarter can result in quite volatile sales performance, both good and bad. And the timing this year couldn\u2019t have been much worse. In the end, weather impacts normalized over time, and our focus is on our long-term performance. Our performance was particularly soft in the Midwestern and Northeastern markets where same-store sales ended 580 basis points lower in these northern markets than in our remaining markets and an even larger 1,700 basis points lower than the remaining markets over the last two weeks of our quarter. Our sales fall off was more pronounced for our DIY business than commercial, but we certainly saw the trajectory of our business slow during this timeframe for both businesses. With over 25% of our sales coming from our Midwestern and Northeastern markets, we could not make up for the sales shortfall from these areas from sales in other markets. Regarding merchandise mix during the quarter. Our cold weather businesses, think batteries, antifreeze and seasonal fluids, were down materially in total across retail and commercial combined. These categories are significant businesses for us, particularly in the winter, and they were our worst performing categories, and combined were down more than 9% on a same-store basis across the country for the quarter, and were both down north of 20% the last two weeks of the quarter. The testament to our team is how resilient our model is during changes in performance during certain periods. With a very challenged sales environment, our team delivered 2% growth in EBIT and grew earnings per share 7.8% for the quarter. This clearly didn\u2019t meet our expectations or aspirations, but was impressive nonetheless. Our financial model allows us to grow cash flow and EPS steadily. I\u2019m very proud of how diligent our organization is in all business climates. During the quarter, our market share, based on the data available to us, was slightly positive through the end of January. While our sales performance for Q2 was comfortably below our plan and expectations, we haven\u2019t seen any material changes in the market or industry drivers beyond weather. We are excited to enter our third quarter where we began to enter our robust selling season, which is starting in earnest right now as federal tax refunds begin to reach our customers. We have had mild winters in the past, but each cycle is different. This year, we expect -- initially you\u2019re seeing a now normalized tax refund season. We believe both our retail and commercial businesses will improve from this quarter\u2019s results. We\u2019re also doing some great things that we feel will benefit sales over time. Our megahub store rollout continued along with key investments in technology. We believe these areas of investment allow us to further differentiate our offerings from our competitors or to close competitive gaps that may exist, allowing us to accelerate further in our industry. We opened two more megahubs this quarter and now have 39 locations. Our megahubs provide deep, very deep, local market coverage for hard-to-find parts. This is critical to both of our sectors but particularly important to our commercial business. And our store and commercial systems have and will continue to receive enhancements this year, making us easier for our customers to do business with, while simultaneously making it more efficient for our AutoZoners. As we enter our all-important sales season, our stores look great and our AutoZoners are doing an excellent job focusing on customer service. We believe we are ready for the remainder of the year. To provide specifics on the quarter, our total sales grew 2.6% this quarter. This compares to last quarter growing at 5.7%. Our DIY sales comps were down versus last year, while DIFM sales were up 8.2% in total. Both of these numbers were negatively affected by the calendar shift, causing a 63 basis-point headwind for the quarter. Regarding our domestic commercial business. We were up against 12.9% growth in the second quarter last year and a harder comparison to last quarter, but we expected we could reach positive double-digit growth. While we did not achieve our targeted double-digit goal for the quarter, we feel our team, across the organization from our sales team to our operators, merchants, technologists, marketers, credit team to ALLDATA, and on and on, have really bought into providing a compelling, differentiated, comprehensive experience for our customers. So, with that approach, we will continue to be rewarded with incremental business in the marketplace by our customers. While we remain smaller than many of our peers in absolute sales volume, our growth rate has been very robust, growing significantly more than the industry growth rate. This growth has come from a combination of many initiatives that have been in development for years, including inventory assortment improvements, hub and megahub store expansions, the ever-strengthening reputation of the Duralast brand across our professional customer base, technology enhancements, increased engagement of our very strong store operating teams and tremendous efforts on the part of our entire sales organization to effectively convey our value proposition. We also grew our commercial sales per store at mid-single-digit rate versus last year\u2019s second quarter. Although we are averaging fewer annual program openings as approximately 85% of our stores already have a program, the programs we have opened continued to produce for us. We averaged $9,400 in weekly commercial sales per program this past quarter, up 5% over last year. We have grown our sales with mature customers and mature programs at substantially improved growth rate the last two years versus previous years, indicating our offerings, products, coverage, customer service and ability to enhance the customers\u2019 overall shopping experience are improved and have been recognized and rewarded by our customers. Finally, our up and down the street business, otherwise known as independent repair shops, grew faster than our overall commercial business, indicating that the improvements we are making are broad-based across different geographies and customer types. Our AutoZoners\u2019 confidence regarding the commercial business continues to increase, and this will continue to have a very positive impact on the business. We believe there remains considerable growth opportunities for us in commercial as our customers are appreciating our new and enhanced offerings. Regarding our domestic DIY business. Regionally, we did better at West with the Northeast and Midwest performing quite poorly versus last year. As we reminded folks on last quarter\u2019s call, the second quarter is always our most volatile quarter from a sales perspective, both positively and negatively. But over time, weather effects normalize as does our sales performance. In regard to modeling for the upcoming quarters, we feel there are enough tailwinds within the business that we are planning for sales growth from here for the remainder of the year. We also expect that as our initiatives roll out across the chain for both DIY and DIFM, they will add to improved sales performance. In regard to our technology investments, we have invested a great deal in both operating and capital expense to benefit our DIY and DIFM businesses. Recently, we rolled out our internally developed new POS system to our stores. This new system leverages new architecture and technologies that will expedite retail sales transactions by making the workflow more succinct and logical with touch screen capabilities and allowing us to make future changes much quicker as we replace some very old legacy codes. We\u2019ve also done some important work behind the scenes that should help increase our agility by updating our store operating system and implementing a new human capital management system. We are also investing a great deal in our commercial systems. And as we continue to test these new technologies, we remain confident that allowing our customers easier means of doing business with us will help commercial continue to grow at an accelerated pace for the future. On last quarter\u2019s call, we highlighted that we were -- what we\u2019re seeing with tariffs. We noted that as a result of tariffs, we expected to have a higher amount of inflation in our cost of goods on a SKU-by-SKU basis than we had in the past. In past years, it was common for us to have deflation at the cost level, but due to tariffs, we began to see cost rise. As the tariffs were introduced, we began to pass those costs onto our customers through higher retail prices. We were also successful in negotiating with certain vendors to share the costs from tariffs. However, we did have to incur some price increases. As certain tariffs are considerable in particular product lines, we intentionally passed those costs along in higher retails in tranches as we absorbed those costs through our weighted average cost accounting method. At this point, we are not planning for any further tariffs on goods imported from China. And in fact, we are trying to get tariffs reduced by applying for relief through the U.S. customs office. To-date, tariffs and their impact on our cost in retails have been manageable. As we begin to lap the tariff cost and commensurate retail increases we implemented last year, we\u2019ve been asked about the impact this will have on same-store sales. While we do not expect to incur the same like-for-like SKU inflation as in the past year, we don\u2019t believe the tariffs were a material net benefit over the last year, nor do we think there will be a significant headwind for the next 12 months. At this point, I\u2019d like to talk about any disruption we may be seeing from the ongoing coronavirus epidemic. While we have not incurred disruption thus far, we must and are being diligent. We have created a contingency plan for each merchandise category sourced from China. Our teams have done a wonderful job planning for potential scenarios. At this point, we have nothing substantial to report. But the longer this outbreak lasts, the more it will impact ourselves, and both our and the overall retail industry. It is currently a very fluid situation as many of the factories have just begun to reopen after an extended Chinese Lunar New Year holiday. Some are coming back on line quickly, while others quite slowly and certain of them haven\u2019t come back on line yet. The next few weeks will be critical. Turning to our omnichannel efforts. We continue to invest in our strategy to enhance the customer shopping experience by meeting customers when, where and how they want to shop. We have initiatives in place to improve our in-store systems and websites, autozone.com, AutoZonePro mobile app, Duralast parts and ALLDATA. We continue to see growth in website traffic and rapid growth in ship-to-home, next day delivery, and buy online pick-up in-store sales. But, omnichannel still represents a very small percentage of our business, substantially below 5%. We continue to see buy online and pick-up in-stores as our largest omnichannel business with its mix of omnichannel total sales at over 40% and higher than last year. Our BOPIS model continues to grow faster than our ship-to-home business, highlighting the importance of our high-touch operating model where customers place a high value on the trustworthy advice our AutoZoners deliver to them. Regarding our annual operating theme for 2020, 40 years of wow customer service. We continue to push for a relentless focus on what matters to our customers : Exceptional service; fast deliveries; high quality parts and products; trustworthy advice; and flawless execution across the enterprise. We continue to identify and remove all redundant or non-customer-facing activities for our store AutoZoners. By removing or streamlining these tasks, we know we can improve our service levels of customer service. This will continue to be a major focus for us for the balance of the year. Along with improving local parts availability and assortment, we continue to manage this organization to provide exceptional service for our customers, provide our AutoZoners with a great place to work with substantial opportunities for advancement and work to ensure we provide strong returns for our shareholders. In summary, while we were not pleased with our top line performance, we were pleased with our operating performance and remain encouraged with our industry strength in both DIY and DIFM, and our prospects for the remainder of the fiscal year. We believe macro factors such as relatively low gas prices and increasing miles driven remain largely in our favor. We remain committed to growing our market share in both, DIY and commercial. Now, let me provide more detail on what we accomplished during the quarter. For the quarter, we opened 25 new stores in the United States and our commercial business opened 25 net new programs. Currently, 85% of our domestic stores have a commercial program and the vast majority of our international stores have a commercial program. During the quarter, we continued to expand our international footprint, opening two new stores in Mexico and one in Brazil. We should once again highlight another strong performance in return on invested capital as we were able to finish our second quarter at 35.3%. We continue to be pleased with this metric as it is one of the best in all of hardlines retailing. However, our primary focus has been and continues to be that we ensure every incremental dollar of capital that we deploy in this business, provides an acceptable return well in excess of our cost of capital. It\u2019s important to reinforce that we will always maintain our diligence regarding capital stewardship as the capital we invest is our investors\u2019 capital. Before I pass the discussion over to Bill Giles to talk about our financial results, I\u2019d like to again thank our AutoZoners for their efforts to deliver great service to our customers and solid financial results for the second fiscal quarter of 2020. Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Bill Giles. Bill? Bill Giles : Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everyone. To start this morning, let me take a few minutes to talk more specifically about our domestic retail, commercial and international results. For the quarter, total auto part sales, which includes our domestic, Mexico and Brazil stores, increased 2.6%. For the trailing four quarters ended, total sales per AutoZone store were $1,867,000, which is up from an average of $1,800,000 at Q2 ending last year. Total commercial sales increased 8.2% in the quarter. Commercial represented 23% of our total sales and grew approximately $42 million over last year\u2019s Q2. Our average weekly sales per program were $9,400, up 5% on a per program basis versus $9,000 per week last year. As Bill mentioned earlier, we expect our sales per program growth to do better in Q3 than this past quarter as we began our summer selling season. We now have our commercial program in 4,942 stores or 85% of our domestic stores. We remain committed to gaining market share with our commercial customers and we are encouraged by the initiatives we have in place and feel we can further grow sales and market share. Our Mexico stores continued to perform well. We opened two new stores during the second quarter, ending the quarter with 608 stores. We remain committed to open stores for many years to come. And regarding Brazil, we now operate 38 stores. Our performance continues to improve and we remain optimistic about the long-term future of this market. This market has the potential to be much larger than Mexico. So, while challenging and currently a drag on earnings, the potential size of the market is significant. Gross margin for the quarter was 54.3% of sales, up 28 basis points versus last year\u2019s second quarter. The increase in gross margin was primarily driven by supply chain leverage. While our accelerated pace of commercial growth has weighed on our overall gross margin, we continue to see opportunities to lower our costs through sourcing. I do want to stress, we remain committed to taking cost out of our business where appropriate. Our primary focus has always been growing absolute gross profit dollars in our total auto parts segment and we have been pleased with our growth driven by the acceleration we have experienced in commercial. SG&A for the quarter was 38.1% of sales, deleveraging 37 basis points to last year\u2019s second quarter. This was lower than our first quarter\u2019s deleverage of 65 basis points. In fact, our SG&A grew 3.6% over last year\u2019s second quarter. As we lap salary increases initiated in last year\u2019s first quarter and as our sales were challenged, our team aggressively managed costs and we returned to a more historically run rate. SG&A will remain something we manage in accordance with sales volumes. As sales pick up, we would expect the spend rate to increase. The deleverage for this quarter was primarily driven by our planned and ongoing domestic store payroll investments, which negatively impacted operating expenses. EBIT for the quarter was $407.9 million. Our EBIT margin was 16.2%. Interest expense for the quarter was $44.3 million, up 7.2% from Q2 a year ago, but in line with our expectations. We are planning interest at $44.7 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2020 versus $43.2 million last year. Our higher forecast than last year is driven mainly by the associated with the bond issuance we had in April of 2019. Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $5,451 million or $340 million above last year\u2019s Q2 ending balance of $5,111 million. Our adjusted debt level metric finished the quarter at 2.6 times EBITDAR. While in any given quarter we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on management\u2019s opinion regarding debt and equity market conditions, we remain committed to both our investment grade rating and our capital allocation strategy, and share repurchases are an important element of that strategy. For the quarter, our tax rate was 17.7% versus 17.8% in last year\u2019s second quarter. This quarter\u2019s rate benefited 412 basis points from stock options exercised while last year it benefited 389 basis points. Stock option exercises aren\u2019t predictable and as such, they will affect our tax rate, and ultimately our net income and EPS. For the third quarter of FY 2020, we suggest investors model us at approximately 23% before any assumption on credits due to stock option exercises. Because we cannot effectively predict this activity, we remain committed to reporting the stock option impact on the tax rate. Net income for the quarter was $299.2 million, up 1.6% versus last year\u2019s second quarter. Our diluted share count of 24.2 million was down 5.8% from last year\u2019s second quarter. The combination of these factors drove earnings per share for the quarter to $12.39, up 7.8% over the prior year\u2019s second quarter. Related to the cash flow statement for the second quarter, we generated $205 million of operating cash flow. Net fixed assets were up 4.8% versus last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $89.2 million and reflected the additional expenditures required to open 28 net new stores this quarter, capital expenditures on existing stores, hub and megahub remodels or openings, work on development of new stores for upcoming quarters and information technology investments. With the new stores opened, we finished this past quarter with 5,814 stores in the U.S., 608 stores in Mexico and 38 in Brazil for a total store count of 6,461. Depreciation totaled $90.7 million for the quarter versus last year\u2019s second quarter expense of $83.8 million. This is generally in line with our recent quarter growth rates. We repurchased $315 million of AutoZone stock in the quarter versus $350 million last year. At quarter end, we had $962 million remaining under our share buyback authorization and our leverage metric was 2.6 times. Again, I want to stress, we managed to appropriate credit ratings and not any one metric. The metric we report is meant as a guide only as each rating agency has its own criteria. We continue to view our share repurchase program as an attractive capital deployment strategy. Next, I\u2019d like to update you on our inventory levels. In total, the Company\u2019s inventory increased 7% over the same period last year, driven by new stores and increased product placement. Inventory per location was $713,000 versus $690,000 last year and $694,000 last quarter. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable on a per location basis, was a negative $41,000 versus a negative $58,000 last year and a negative $71,000 last quarter. As a result, accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 105.7% versus last year\u2019s Q2 of 108.5%. Finally, as Bill previously mentioned, our continued disciplined capital management approach resulted in return on invested capital for the trailing four quarters of 35.3%. We have and will continue to make investments that we believe will generate returns that significantly exceed our cost of capital. Now, I\u2019ll turn it back to Bill Rhodes. Bill Rhodes : Thank you, Bill. Clearly, our sales performance in Q2 was disappointing. We didn\u2019t achieve our plans nor our aspirations. We always know Q2, our shortest, lowest sales season, will be volatile. And this year, due to a very mild winter, our performance suffered and suffered mightily in specific weather-sensitive categories and in particular markets. As we analyze our performance in great detail, we are confident that the key driver this quarter was weather. As we cannot influence the weather and as we know weather impacts normalize over time, our goal is to ensure we understand the drivers of our business and then move on and focus on what we can control. Most of our senior team has been in this business and with this Company for decades. And we have seen this in the past and are focused on delivering optimal performance in the short term in light of the sales environment. But, our real focus isn\u2019t on any single quarters, but building our business for the long term. We all have seen enough cycles to know them when we see them. As we have recited internally, we weren\u2019t brilliant in the first quarter and lost our touch in the second. This too shall pass. With half fiscal 2020 behind us, we believe we continue to be very well positioned to grow sales and earnings for the remainder of the year. Many are now looking at previous mild winters and trying to extrapolate them to the balance of the year, as are we. But, there are always other key factors that impact our industry\u2019s performance, what is the timing of tax refunds, what\u2019s going to happen with summer weather patterns, where are we with the aging of the car park and sweet spots, and on and on and on. In the end, we believe our sales will strengthen from here. And our focus remains on managing this business to the optimum profitability based on the current industry sales environment, which will run through normal marginal cycles from time to time. Our team did just that in the second quarter. As we look to the balance of the year, we commit that we will manage this business well, and we will manage it for the long term. Our business model is amazingly consistent. We generate a healthy amount of cash flow each and every year, and this year will be no different. Each year, we target to generate as much or more operating cash flow as the year before. And this year, we have the same target. Let me reiterate, we believe we are in good shape for the back half of the year. For the New Year, we must continue to execute consistently at a high level. We understand we must adhere to living the pledge and doing what is right for our customers. We cannot take our eye off of execution. Success will be achieved with an attention to detail and exceptional execution. For the remainder of the year, we have a lot of deliverables from our IT initiatives, and we will remain focused on simplifying our store AutoZoners\u2019 workloads to reduce clutter and unnecessary task that given the way of making the customer experience better for both the DIY and the professional customer. We remain focused on growing our DIY business and continuing to grow our commercial business well in excess of industry growth rates. We promise to remain committed to both, executing our strategies and getting better every single day. I\u2019d like to take this opportunity to again recognize and thank our team of talented, dedicated, passionate AutoZoners for what they do each and every day for our customers, which expands opportunities for AutoZoners, allows us to support the communities we serve and ultimately, rewards our shareholders. Now, we\u2019d like to open up the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Michael Lasser from UBS. Your line is now open. Atul Maheswari : Good morning. This is Atul Maheswari on for Michael Lasser. Thanks a lot for taking our questions. Bill Rhodes : Good morning. Atul Maheswari : I know you\u2019re expecting sales to accelerate over the remainder of the year, but can you provide some color on quarter-to-date trends? How much of sales improved compared to the minus 6% that you witnessed in the final two weeks of the quarter, and what\u2019s really driven the improvement? Bill Rhodes : Yes, sure. I appreciate the question. We have a longstanding practice. We release our earnings usually within two weeks and a couple of days of the end of the quarter. And we have a longstanding practice to not talk about such a short period of time. As we evidence with the last two weeks of the quarter, our business can be incredibly volatile over short periods of time, and we don\u2019t want anybody to try to extrapolate that good or bad for a 12-week quarter. So, we have longstanding practice to not talk about it. What we do say is, the second quarter is certainly more volatile than the third quarter. As we are entering the third quarter, we anticipate tax refunds coming. As I\u2019m sure most of you have noticed, there was a significant amount of tax refund, $67 billion, that were issued last Wednesday that appears to be generally on track with where we were last year, and we\u2019re excited to enter this very important selling season for us. Atul Maheswari : Thank you. That\u2019s helpful. And then, just a quick one on the calendar shift drag. When should we really expect this drag to reverse and become a benefit? Is that going to be in the third or the fourth quarter of this year? Bill Rhodes : Yes. It\u2019s - again, one of those things is very hard to tell. As we talked about what happened with the end of the quarter, that could have -- Q2 could have been a net positive or a net negative. In the end, it was a net negative, because of the way that weather hit at the very end of the season. We anticipate we will get what\u2019s happened in the first half of the year back in the second, but it\u2019s going to depend somewhat on what happens around the beginning of the quarter and the ending of the quarters. Operator : Our next question is from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Simeon Gutman : I wanted to ask you, Bill, first on I guess the timing of bounce back. I know you don\u2019t comment to your last answer. I guess, the question is, do we have to wait for weather or do you -- is that what, we have to wait for weather to normalize or no, it\u2019s not about whether at this point, it\u2019s about tax refunds, and just the timing of the calendar to see the business normalize? Bill Rhodes : Yes. I think, you\u2019re right, Simeon. I think it\u2019s the latter. As we begin to move into the spring season, what dominates our performance is no longer extreme weather patterns. In the winter time, and a lot of people won\u2019t look at what\u2019s happening with average temperatures, which is an indicator. But, what really matters to us in the winter time is when we get extreme cold for an extended period of time, three, four, five days. That puts a lot of pressure on failure parts. The other part that really matters to us is what\u2019s happening with road conditions. If we get a lot of snow and ice and freezing temperatures, that puts the road conditions in pretty bad shape, which puts more pressure on under car and brake systems. One of the things, as we enter this period of time, it\u2019s more about the maintenance categories. And I mentioned in my prepared remarks that a lot of times everybody wants to compare to what\u2019s happened in the last three or four mild winters, and that\u2019s absolutely right, and we\u2019re doing the same thing. But there are other things that are happening in the environment. One of the things that\u2019s happened in some of the previous mild winters is we had a significant amount of our maintenance businesses that were pulled forward into Q2. You found not only was it not extreme cold temperatures but you had some very nice weekend weather and people did DIY jobs. We did not see that in Q2. So we are anticipating as these tax refunds flow, as the weather improves that we should have more robust maintenance performance. Simeon Gutman : Great. My follow-up is on the commercial strategy. You\u2019ve had great momentum. Can you talk about beginning that the megahub strategy is in and then any incremental inventory investments you plan to make this year? Bill Rhodes : So, we\u2019ve now opened 39 megahubs. We\u2019ve stated externally that we want to get to 70 to 90. We are very aggressively pursuing those at this point in time, very pleased with the continued performance of our megahubs, and think that they are a key contributor to commercial. They are also a contributor to retail, but very pleased with that progress. Bill Giles : Yes. And I would say, we\u2019re probably in the fourth or fifth inning, I would say, on the megahubs and we\u2019ll continue to roll out on the hub strategies as well. And to Bill\u2019s point, we\u2019ve been very pleased with the performance of both, the megahubs and the hubs, but in particular the megahubs both on DIY and on the commercial side of the business. Now, at the same time, that does create a little bit more inventory in the system as we get more inventory out closer to the customer, but we believe long-term that\u2019s the winning strategy. Operator : Our next question is from Seth Sigman from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Seth Sigman : Hey, guys. Good morning. I just wanted to follow up on a couple of those points. First just on the commercial side of the business. So, it sounds like the slowdown is really weather related and you\u2019re planning for trends to reaccelerate. Is there anything that you see that would suggest that you can\u2019t get back to double-digit growth in the commercial business in the next quarter or so? Bill Giles : I would say, no. I think that if we look back over the quarter and see our performance, some of that impacted by weather certainly geographically as we talked about on the DIY business with similar on the commercial side of the business as well. So, some of those more cold weather geographies underperformed considerably during the quarter. So, we believe fairly confidently that we\u2019ll get back to a more normalized double-digit growth rate as we head into Q3. So, fundamentally, we don\u2019t believe that we see anything different in the business. Bill Rhodes : I think adding a little bit of that too. We also -- and we talked about it in our prepared remarks, our up and down the street business continues to perform very, very well. We did see more challenges with our more national account business as many of which are concentrated in the Northeast and Midwest. So, we\u2019re encouraged by that as well. Seth Sigman : Okay. Thanks for that. And then, obviously in the quarter, the margin trends were quite healthy despite the sales shortfall. Your prior commentary had suggested an acceleration in operating profit growth as you move through this year, I guess, getting back to at least low-single-digit EBIT growth. Is that still a fair way to think about it? Anymore parameters around that would be helpful. Thank you. Bill Giles : Yes. I think, first of all, I think the organization did a great job of managing the way through a difficult quarter, being able to control SG&A leverage, gross margin and be able to drive EBIT growth of around 2%. And I believe last quarter, we said that we would expect to grow EBIT on a positive basis. And yes, we do expect to get to that low-single-digit, mid-single-digit kind of growth rate on a long-term basis. Operator : Our next question is from Bret Jordan from Jefferies. Your line is now open. Bret Jordan : In your prepared remarks, you talked about market share gains. Could you talk maybe DIY versus commercial? And I guess, regionally, did you outperform in any particular market more than other? Bill Rhodes : Yes, Bret. Great question. I should have clarified that in the prepared remarks. We don\u2019t have good visibility to market share gains and commercial. So, generally, we\u2019re growing commercial at 8% and the market has grown by 4%. We\u2019re pretty confident we\u2019re gaining share. My specific comments about growing share slightly are come up from a few different indications that we have on the DIY side of the business. Bret Jordan : Okay, great. And then, I guess a question on inflation. I think, Bill Giles was talking about or maybe it was you, Bill Rhodes, about not a material net benefit for the year. And I guess, the supplier association and a lot of the peers have been talking about 2% to 3% inflation seen in the last 12 months. Is it just that you haven\u2019t elected to pass through the costs you\u2019ve seen come out of China, or I guess, is there something different about you\u2019re addressing inflation versus theirs? Bill Rhodes : Yes. I can\u2019t speak for theirs. We have certainly seen SKU-over-SKU year-over-year inflation. And the bigger change isn\u2019t that we\u2019ve seen major inflation, it\u2019s generally that we\u2019ve seen deflation. As you think about it, our parts come into the life cycle and they\u2019re very short run until the costs are more expensive. As the part become -- goes through the bell curve and becomes much more -- much higher volumes, our costs go down. And therefore, we have significant deflation as is shown in our LIFO -- major LIFO reserve that we\u2019ve had forever. In the last 18 months or so, we have seen some inflation. We have been very careful about managing that inflation. And as we said in our prepared remarks, if we had a 25% tariff, we didn\u2019t go out and raise our price 25%. We went out and worked that in, in tranches so that we didn\u2019t shock the customer. Over time, we think we\u2019ve done a pretty good job of rolling those price increases in. We\u2019ve also worked with several of our partners on not pushing the full amount to the customer. There has been some changes in the RMB currency, and we\u2019ve taken advantage of that. So, we\u2019ve been very, I think, judicious about it. We don\u2019t think we saw a big net benefit as costs go up. There is some tampering down of demand. We don\u2019t think we saw a major significant net benefit and therefore we don\u2019t think we\u2019ll see a major significant net deficit. Operator : Our next question is from Seth Basham from Wedbush Securities. Your line is now open. Seth Basham : Thanks a lot and good morning. And my first question is just around the calendar shift. I mean, are we seeing two quarters of a negative impact from calendar shift? When do you expect to get that back? Is that more of a third quarter or fiscal fourth quarter event? Bill Giles : Yes. As Bill said, we\u2019ll have to wait and see to see how the performance is at the end of each of those quarters. Our anticipation is, this is likely more back-end loaded in the second half of the year. Seth Basham : Fair enough. And then, secondly, as it relates to your gross margin, did you saw your supply chain leverage as your primary driver of improvement here. Does that include lower costs you\u2019re getting from sourcing or are you specifically talking about savings within your supply chain and distribution? Bill Giles : That one was pretty much the savings within the supply chain and distribution on a year-over-year basis. We are continuing to try to lower our acquisition costs and believe that overall our margin remains relatively healthy. But for this specific quarter, we were able to leverage down supply chain just by lowering some costs during the quarter. Seth Basham : As a follow-up there, as we think about the impacts of tariff-driven inflation into your business over the last year, and what it means for your inventory balances and your gross margins in last quarters, have you been getting a benefit from that, or would you expect a headwind going forward into the back half of the calendar year? Bill Giles : I think, some of the tariff costs are going to continue to work their way through the average cost of the inventory. And as Bill said, I think, the merchandising organization has done a nice job of being able to feather in the increases to commensurate with the cost increases that we are experiencing. And our expectation is that we will continue to do that. It may be some pressure going forward, but our expectation is that we will be able to manage our way through that. Operator : Our next question is from Michael Montani from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Michael Montani, you are maybe on mute. Michael Montani : Hello. Can you hear me? Bill Rhodes : Yes, we can. Operator : Yes, we can. Michael Montani : Okay, great. Sorry about that. I just wanted to follow up on the inflation front for a minute, if I could and see what kind of an impact did you see to same-store sales from inflation, in particular for this quarter? And then, on a related note what kind of success have you had at this point in getting rebate checks from tariff-related exemptions? Bill Giles : Yes. Just to kind of go backwards first, we\u2019re in that process, I think Bill called it out in the prepared remarks that we\u2019ve gone through and made applications for some rebates relative to tariffs and we\u2019ve had some success, but we have more things in the work. So we\u2019ll see how it is. We don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be material, by the way. But we think it will be certainly a help overall. I think on the inflation side of it, as we said, we will probably have inflation of 2-plus-percent on a year-over-year basis from a SKU to SKU basis. But at the same time, it\u2019s very difficult to measure out what the demand impact is as some of the prices have raised a little bit. So, I think that\u2019s where we would say that we haven\u2019t seen a material impact overall from the inflation relative to comp store sales, because it is kind of a blended number with the demand as well. Michael Montani : And if I could, just follow-up. One housekeeping thing was the CapEx and D&A outlook for this year -- for the full year. And then secondly, any initiatives that you all may have in the pipeline on the productivity front that could help offset some of those wage increases, whether that be automation in the DCs or potential outsourcing et cetera. Bill Giles : Yes. From a CapEx perspective, I think our expectation is around $600 million of CapEx for the year and I believe depreciation is around that $350 million number. I would say overall from a CapEx investment perspective, obviously, first and foremost, we\u2019re investing in our stores, we\u2019re investing in the maintenance of our stores, continue to ensure that they look great. We\u2019re investing in hubs and megahubs along the way. We also have a good -- a sizable investment in technology as well. We continue to invest in technology, both to enhance our existing systems as well as to add new functionality in order to improve our customer experience both on the DIY and the commercial side of the business as well. So, those are the major projects that we kind of continue to work on. Michael Montani : Okay. Thanks. And just the productivity side? Bill Rhodes : On the productivity, we\u2019re always working on different productivity initiatives. But, if you\u2019re talking about are we changing the way we go to market in our supply chain by implementing a tremendous amount of new automation or those kind of things, at this point, we\u2019re not. We\u2019re constantly looking at the calculations of where the IRRs make sense. As wage pressure goes up, it changes the economics and we\u2019ll continue to look at it, but we don\u2019t have anything to talk about significantly currently. Operator : Our next question is from Zach Fadem from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Zach Fadem : Hey, guys. First question on coronavirus. You touched on supply chain. Curious, if you have any thoughts on the potential impact to miles driven and how that could impact your business. Bill Rhodes : It\u2019s a very interesting question. As you would expect, over the last month or so, we have been very-focused on the supply chain aspects of coronavirus. And in the last week or two, more and more focused on what\u2019s happening here in the United States and ultimately, Mexico and Brazil. We see no indications at this point in time of any demand destruction as a result of coronavirus. But just like we said with the supply chain, it\u2019s an incredibly, incredibly fluid situation. I think, the next couple of weeks to a month are going to be critical to see what actually happens. We don\u2019t have good insights into that. Zach Fadem : Got it. And then, just bigger picture on the car park. Curious, if you could speak to where you think we\u2019re at in terms of the sweet spot? How long do you believe the current tailwind can last? And whether it\u2019s more of a benefit to your DIY or your commercial business? Thanks. Bill Rhodes : There\u2019s a lot packed into that question. Yes, we haven\u2019t been big on talking about the ramifications of the car park over the last 12 years. We all know that there was a significant divot in new car sales in 2009. And as those cars came into the \u201csweet spot\u2019, there was a headwind for a while and now it looks like it\u2019s turned into a tailwind. I think it\u2019s on the margin in both instances. What we like to see is steady state new vehicles coming on the road, $16 million, $17 million. The scrappage rate doesn\u2019t appear to change much at all. And therefore, we just have a steady state of new cars. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything in the next two or three or four years, that\u2019s going to be radically different than what we\u2019ve seen in the past. Operator : Our next question is from Guru Wright with Daniel Imbro from Stephens Inc. Your line is now open. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, guys. This is Andrew on for Daniel. I just got a quick question here. I was wondering, your commentary has sounded pretty upbeat on the second half. What gives you this confidence and how could you weight that between Company-specific initiatives and improving demand outlook? Bill Rhodes : Yes, terrific question. I think what gives us the confidence is that we\u2019ve been here before. As I mentioned in our prepared remarks, most of our management team has been here for decades. We\u2019ve seen times of strength; we\u2019ve seen times of softness. We certainly saw softness in the second quarter. As we\u2019re looking at the second half of the year, we have concerns and we also have things that we\u2019re very positive about. On the concern side, I mentioned earlier that the roads, particularly in the Midwest and the Northeast haven\u2019t had the kind of difficult conditions that put stress on brake systems and under car systems. That\u2019s likely to be a bit of a headwind as we go through the second half of the year. That said, unlike some other previous winters, we didn\u2019t see this significant pull forward of demand in those exact categories, which are heavily maintenance categories. So, we\u2019re looking at where we are. We absolutely are disappointed with the second quarter, but we don\u2019t see anything that changed as a result of the second quarter other than those road conditions. And therefore, we\u2019ve made zero changes in our plans for the second half of the year. Again, to us, we are disappointed. We hate a bad quarter. But we\u2019re not managing this business for quarter-to-quarter. We\u2019re managing this business for long terms. And that\u2019s the approach we\u2019re going to continue to take and we\u2019re very optimistic that just like we\u2019ve been very successful over the last decades, we\u2019re going to continue to be successful as we look forward. Operator : I\u2019m showing no further questions in the queue. I\u2019d like to turn the call over back to Mr. Bill Rhodes for final comments. You may proceed. Bill Rhodes : Great. Thank you. Before we conclude the call, I\u2019d just like to take a moment to reiterate that we believe our business model continues to be solid. We are excited about our growth prospects for the year. We do not take anything for granted as we understand our customers have alternatives. We have an exciting plan that should help us succeed this fiscal year. But I want to stress that this is a marathon, not a sprint. As we continue to focus on the basics and focus on optimizing long-term shareholder value, we are confident AutoZone will continue to be successful. Thank you for participating in today\u2019s call. And have a great day. Operator : And that concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Bill Rhodes : Good morning and thank you for joining us today for AutoZone\u2019s 2020 third quarter conference call. With me today are Bill Giles, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax. Regarding the third quarter, I hope you\u2019ve had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter\u2019s results. If not, the press release, along with slides complementing our comments today, are available on our website, www.autozone.com, under the Investor Relations link, please click on Quarterly Earnings Conference Calls to see them. Since our last earnings release, the world has changed significantly, and so has our business. During our last call, on March 3rd, we were focused on COVID-19, but more from a supply chain disruption perspective. Quickly thereafter, the unprecedented ramifications of the pandemic and its disruption on lives across the globe became a reality. As we have navigated these remarkable times, our first priority has been and will continue to be the health, safety and well-being of our customers and AutoZoners. This quarter was the most remarkable quarter I have ever experienced. In light of that, this will be a different, more detailed update on our business. Our business is typically pretty predictable. As I\u2019ve said many times, our sales fluctuate in a very tight band, but currently that has not been true. We aren\u2019t sure what lies ahead, so we\u2019re going to share a lower level of granularity this quarter, so you have a deeper understanding of the fluctuations and drivers or potential drivers. I know, as we move into the Q&A, you want us to help you \u201cmodel\u201d our sales performance for Q4. Frankly, we are having a very difficult time forecasting our business week-to-week much less for the next quarter. And who knows what is in front of us this summer. Will the cases decline and subside? Will they escalate as we begin to reopen the economy? Will the government provide additional stimulus? Will enhanced unemployment benefits help our business? Will all of our commercial customer survive? We have too many unknowns. And our focus is on making sure in the short-term. We provide our AutoZoners with the resources they need to provide our customers with an exceptional experience. As for the long term, to date, we don\u2019t see anything that substantially changes our bullish view on our industry, but we must continue to monitor consumer shifts in behavior. And if the economy enters a deep and protracted recessionary environment, we believe our customers will focus more on maintaining their current vehicles and it will benefit our business, retail in particular as it has in the last three recessions. As a reminder, our strongest periods of outside sales growth over the last three decades have been the early 90s, 2001, 2002, 2009, 2010 and 2011, all coming out of recessionary periods. Well, we always begin these calls by thanking our AutoZoners. What our team has done as an essential retailer and remaining open throughout the crisis to serve the motoring public has been nothing short of phenomenal. I applaud our entire team, many who have had to quickly pivot to new ways of working, but I especially want to call out, recognize and show deep appreciation for our store AutoZoners and our distribution center AutoZoners. These remarkable people have done a tremendous job throughout this time and have made several large changes in how we operate and have done it quickly with tremendous passion and of course with excellence. I simply can't thank them enough for what they have done for our customers and our company. Now let's move into our performance for the quarter. Our same-store sales were down 1% versus last year's third quarter. Our net income was $343 million. And our EPS was $14.39 a share 10% below last year. Regarding our sales performance, the quarter can best be described in three time periods, each basically four weeks long. Recall that we had a very mild winter and a disappointing sales performance in our fiscal second quarter. We shared that we were optimistic about the balance of the year and in particular the third quarter as we felt there was pent-up demand. And unlike other mild winters, many of the maintenance categories had not been pulled forward and tax refunds were beginning on time and at normal levels. The first four weeks, our sales as expected were quite strong with same store sales up over 6%. Both Retail and Commercial are performing quite well with Commercial sales growth returning comfortably to double digits. And then for the second four weeks the world changed radically, literally overnight. Our sales performance immediately declined materially dropping to a one week low of comps down more than 25%. We began asking ourselves questions we never fathomed before. Do we have the liquidity necessary to weather this storm? Will we have issues with our debt covenants? Will we need to furlough AutoZoners or reduce compensation? How quickly and significantly can we stop capital expenditures and expenses? We immediately acted to shore up any liquidity concerns. We temporarily suspended our share repurchase program. Then we issued $1.25 billion of bonds on Wednesday, March 30. We also closed on an additional 364-day $750 million line of credit. This additional line of credit was on top of the un-utilized $2 billion line of credit already in place. We were running very pessimistic scenarios and preparing for what we thought could be the worst. Our team did a tremendous job enhancing our financial position in a chaotic environment in very short order, a testament to the team and also to the strong financial position and long-term performance of the company. Simultaneously, I\u2019m extremely proud to say that we acted swiftly in support of all of our field AutoZoners. Immediately we instituted reduced store hours of operation across the U.S. store base. This allowed our stores to enhance our cleaning protocols and allowed our AutoZoners time off in the evening to de-compress after a very stressful day. As an essential business, we were determined to be ready to safely service our customers, the motoring public each day. This meant taking care of our AutoZoners as well. Very early in the crisis, we announced that all eligible hourly [indiscernible] and part-time AutoZoners across the U.S. would receive emergency time off benefits and would be available immediately. We didn\u2019t wait to see what others were doing or wait on any mandates by governments. We felt it was imperative to act swiftly in support of our AutoZoners on the front lines. We provided them with two additional weeks of time off, including for the first time in our history, providing part-timers with paid time off up to 40 hours. This additional time off can be used as the AutoZoner desires. And if they don\u2019t use it between now and the calendar year end, we will pay them for those hours in January. We did this to provide our AutoZoners with choices. Some are in the more vulnerable populations and weren\u2019t comfortable coming to work, others had childcare issues, others were just anxious, while the vast majority were comfortable coming to work and providing great service to our customers. This decision, which was made in a couple of days, was aligned with our values and I was honored that our team and our Board of Directors lived up to the powerful culture we often espouse during this crisis. And you know a crisis is when real leaders lead. This alone was an incremental expense in the third quarter of $65 million. And combined with other directly related COVID-19 expenses, our SG&A was negatively impacted by about $75 million in the quarter. In addition to this past quarter\u2019s investments in our AutoZoners, we plan to provide certain other AutoZoners that were not eligible for the first emergency time off benefit with similar benefits during the fourth quarter. We are honored to recognize those AutoZoners, helping our customers every day on the front lines and to say thank you for their efforts. Based on what we know today, we expect to incur approximately $25 million in additional COVID-19 related expenses in the fourth quarter, including this recognition. Our business, retail in particular was beginning to rebound at the end of the second four weeks. Then, at the beginning of the third four week period, federal stimulus checks began to arrive and flow through the U.S. economy. We experienced a significant change in trend, moving from negative double-digit comps to a significantly positive comps almost immediately. To put this in perspective, in two days from a Monday to a Wednesday, our retail sales increased by roughly 50% \u2013 five zero percent in two days. And we continue to experience extremely robust sales performance through the end of the quarter. Throughout this crisis, our DIY business has been substantially stronger than DIFM. Retail began rebounding sooner and reacted stronger than commercial when the stimulus money arrived. At the end of the quarter, our commercial business turned positive again, but had not yet returned to double-digit growth like before the crisis. Specifically for the quarter, our overall same-store sales for each of the four weeks periods were up over 6%, then down more than 20%, then up in the low teens ending the quarter down 1%. Given the extreme volatility in the quarter as I just outlined and as I said in the opening, it is impossible to know what our future sales trends will be. Unfortunately, we\u2019re forced to manage the business literally from week to week and our field organization has done an outstanding job measuring or managing these extremes. We expect that our sales growth will moderate as the stimulus money works its way through the economy, but at the same time, the nation is reopened. What will that do to our business? We simply aren\u2019t sure. What we are sure about is, our team has been incredibly nimble. They have reacted quickly to every single change. We are no longer assuming there are no other significant shocks to the system asking ourselves some of those very difficult questions. Instead, we are focused on providing our team with the resources and support they need to live up to our pledge and our AutoZoners have definitely been and continue to put our customers first. Regarding geographies, our performance was much worse than some of the most affected areas, specifically the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic and also some of our stores in Puerto Rico and Brazil were down considerably as we were forced to close and/or operate under extreme restrictions. Certain markets rebounded pretty quickly like the Pacific Northwest while others like New York, as you would expect, has been slower to recover. Our best performing areas have generally been in the middle of the country. There have been very interesting trends in some of our merchandise categories, specifically in the retail business. Certain categories have been quite challenged like wipers and lighting as people have stayed home more and have not been as active at night or during periods of inclement weather. Other categories have been strong, particularly post stimulus. After a very mild winter, our battery sales have been strong, especially as people parked their cars for extended periods after which the batteries fail or are discharged. We\u2019ve also seen some surprisingly strong categories that I\u2019ll call project categories. These are categories for hobbyists or people who want to upgrade something. People have more time on their hands, so they\u2019re working on their project car doing that enhancement job. They\u2019ve been constantly putting off before. Now before moving beyond our sales trends, there\u2019s been some significant dialogue regarding short-term impact of miles driven on our business. We have touted miles driven as a key macro factor that impacts our industry\u2019s performance for decades. However, there have been times when the correlation with miles driven in our industry sales performance do not have a strong correlation, like during the Great Recession. We believe that during select generally shorter periods of time, other factors like new car sales, unemployment and the like are more important and miles driven is less important. Now let\u2019s turn our focus to the balance of the P&L. For the quarter our gross margin was up 2 basis points, along with past storylines around tariffs, supply chain and mix between DIY and DIFM sales, we\u2019ve been a very steady performer in regard to gross margin. On operating expenses, our team, particularly our store operations and commercial teams, did a remarkable job of managing our expenses during the massive volatility I noted earlier. Imagine trying to manage payroll in line with sales when you have a 50% change in sales in two days, yes, on the surface we had material deleverage, but the majority of that deleverage was associated with our decision to provide enhanced benefits for our hourly AutoZoners in the form of emergency time-off, costing us approximately $65 million in the quarter. While a very significant and expensive decision, as I\u2019ve visited stores and talked to our team, this decision strengthened our already unique and powerful culture and showed that this organization walks the walk. I believe there will be long lasting benefits from this decision. Additionally, we had other directly related COVID expenses of approximately $10 million. Excluding these unique charges, our overall operating expenses were below the prior year\u2019s quarter. Regarding our balance sheet, our debt came down a bit and our cash was up, both were purposeful as we were mindful of cash conservations. We also felt we managed our inventory well, as our inventory per store growth declined 0.5% versus Q3 last year. We feel we have strong liquidity heading into our summer season and can handle many of the future unknowns. As I mentioned previously, we temporarily paused our stock buyback program. It was certainly the right decision at the time as there was too much uncertainty in the business and in the world. Our share repurchase program has been a very important part of our capital allocation strategy and it will continue to be. We haven\u2019t restarted repurchases yet. But as we gain better visibility to our business trajectory, we intend to continue to leverage our free cash flow after robust investments in our business to reduce share counts. Our current thinking is to continue to operate at reasonably similar credit metrics to the past, while excluding the extraordinary unique COVID-19 expenses we discussed above. On last quarter\u2019s conference call, we discussed impacts from the supply chain and goods we received from China in particular. Today, we are in good shape and have no significant disruptions to report. While we created contingency plans for each merchandise category sourced from China, we ultimately did not have to implement them. Unfortunately, the COVID story shifted to become more of a U.S. centric story and away from the supply chain disruptions. That said that portion of this pandemic and the tariffs have made us think differently about supplier diversity. We need to also consider country diversity as well going forward. There will be certain of our plans that are disrupted as a result of the crisis, some known today while others will emerge over time. For instance, we paused our store development activities for about a month as we try to get a better understanding on where this was headed. We did this in the United States, Mexico and Brazil. We\u2019ve subsequently restarted development work in the municipalities that allow us to do so. As a result, we will not meet our new store opening goals for the year. We are pushing in an orderly fashion to get back to opening new stores as quickly as possible. But in this environment, arbitrary goals and dates are not terribly important. So look for us to open less than 200 stores globally this fiscal year. I\u2019ll spend a quick moment on our omni-channel efforts as COVID-19 effects on customers\u2019 ability to get out and shop grew, we ramped up our strategy to enhance the customers shopping experience by meeting customers when, where and how they wanted to shop. We initiated a curbside pickup option in an amazingly short period of time. Additionally, we saw very strong growth in our online shopping channels Buy Online Pick-Up In Store, next-day delivery and ship-to-home. In particular, our Buy Online Pick-Up In Store offering grew rapidly at over double the growth rate of our ship-to-home options. I do want to remind listeners that omni-channel for AutoZone still represents a very small percentage of the DIY business, substantially below 5%. Before I pass the discussion over to Bill Giles to talk about our financial results, I\u2019d like to again thank our AutoZoners for their extraordinary efforts during these unprecedented times. I cannot thank you enough nor can the rest of the management team, and I\u2019m confident that I can speak on behalf of our shareholders too and say thank you AutoZoners, you truly are essential and you are exceptional. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Bill Giles. Bill Giles : Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to talk more specifically about our domestic retail, commercial and international results. For the quarter, total auto part sales, which includes our domestic, Mexico and Brazil stores, increased 0.3%. For the trailing four quarters, total sales per AutoZone store were $1,856,000. Now, this compares to an average of $1,814,000 at Q3 ending last year. Total DIFM sales increased 6.7 \u2013 decreased 6.7%. In the quarter, sales to our DIFM customers represented 21% of our total sales and decreased approximately $40 million from last year\u2019s Q3. Our weekly sales per program were $9,700 and they were down 9% on a per program basis versus $10,700 per week last year. As Bill mentioned earlier, our DIFM business was materially impacted from the COVID impact, more so than our DIY sales. While certainly one of our most challenged sales performances in many quarters, we would ask listeners to see through this quarter and ask us if we believe we are in good shape for future market share increases and the answer to that question is yes. We feel there may be a real opportunity for us to grow our business in the future. With so many smaller, single proprietary shops still operating across America and having to be closed for an extended period of time creates unforeseen challenges for these shops. We continue to believe we can gain market share into the future. We now have our commercial program in 4,950 stores or 85% of domestic stores. While we did not roll out as many programs this past quarter, it was due to our inability to market to customers. We felt it appropriate to maintain distancing from customer shops, while this past quarter is certainly unique, we remain encouraged by the initiatives we have in place and feel we can further grow sales and market share. Much like the impact COVID had on sales in the U.S., our stores in Mexico were also impacted. In addition to impacting sales, the weakness in the foreign currency exchange rate put additional pressure on the business. At the start of the quarter, the exchange was below MXN 20 to $1, but weakened throughout finishing 26% weaker at MXN 24 to $1. During the quarter, we opened two new stores and finished with 610 stores. While the quarter was challenging, we believe the negative impacts, much like with the U.S. are short term in nature. We remain committed to our store opening schedules in Mexico for the foreseeable future. Regarding Brazil, we finished with 38 stores. We opened no new stores in the quarter. Similar to the U.S., Brazil faced the same challenges with COVID sickness and stay-at-home mandates. Much like Mexico, we view the COVID impact short-term in nature for our Brazil stores as well. Our commitment to growing our Brazilian business is not wavered. Gross margin for the quarter was 53.6% of sales, up 2 basis points versus last year\u2019s third quarter. Our primary focus will continue to be growing absolute gross profit dollars in our total auto parts segment. SG&A for the quarter was 35.9% of sales, deleveraging 201 basis points to last year\u2019s third quarter. Our SG&A grew 5.8% over last year\u2019s third quarter. As we discussed in our press release this morning, we incurred approximately $65 million in charges related to offer an Emergency Time-Off to eligible full and part-time AutoZoners, and another $10 million in additional direct COVID expenses. Excluding these extraordinary charges, operating expenses were below last year. As we have demonstrated over time, our organization is very good at adapting to the environment we are operating in. SG&A will remain something we manage in accordance with sales volumes. As sales pick up, we would expect the spend rate to increase. EBIT for the quarter was $491,700,000. Our EBIT margin was 17.7%. Interest expense for the quarter was $47.5 million, up 9.7% from Q3 a year ago and higher than our plan. The higher expenses related to the $1.25 billion bond issuance and the $750 million 364-day credit facility both completed this past quarter. We are planning interest at $68 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 versus $61.2 million last year. Our higher forecast than last year is driven again by the cost associated with the new bond issuance and the 364-day credit facility. Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $5.418 billion or $266 million above last year\u2019s Q3 ending balance of $5.152 billion. Our adjusted debt level metric finished the quarter at 2.6 times EBITDAR. While in any given quarter we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on management\u2019s opinion regarding debt and equity market conditions. We remain committed to both our investment grade rating and our capital allocation strategy, and share repurchases are an important element of that strategy. For the quarter, our tax rate was 22.8% versus 19.5% in last year\u2019s third quarter. This quarter\u2019s rate benefited 26 basis points from stock options exercised while last year it benefited 259 basis points. Stock option exercises aren\u2019t predictable and as such they will affect our tax rate, and ultimately our net income and EPS. For the fourth quarter of FY 2020, we suggest investors model us at approximately 23.7% before any assumptions on credits due to stock option exercises. Because we cannot effectively predict this activity, we remain committed to reporting the stock option impact on the tax rate. Net income for the fourth quarter was $343 million, down 15.5% versus last year\u2019s third quarter. Our diluted share count of $23.8 million was lower by 6.2% from last year\u2019s third quarter. The combination of these factors drove earnings per share for the quarter to $14.39, down 10% over the prior year\u2019s third quarter. Relating to the cash flow statement, for the third quarter, we generated $651 million of operating cash flow. Net fixed assets were up 1.4% versus last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $83.3 million and reflected the additional expenditures required to open 23 net new stores this quarter. Capital expenditures on existing stores, hub and MegaHub remodels or openings, work on development of new stores for upcoming quarters and information technology investments. With the new stores opened, we finished this past quarter with 5,836 stores in the U.S., 610 stores in Mexico and 38 in Brazil for a total store count of 6,484. Depreciation totaled $91.7 million for the quarter versus last year\u2019s third quarter expense of $84.9 million. This is generally in line with recent quarter growth rates. We repurchased $166 million of AutoZone stock in the quarter versus $466 million last year. At quarter end, we had $796 million remaining under our share buyback authorization. And again, our leverage metric was 2.6 times. Again, I want to stress, we manage to appropriate credit ratings and not any one metric. The metric we report is meant as a guide only as each rating agency has its own criteria. And as Bill mentioned earlier, we have temporarily suspended our share repurchase program as we continue to study future cash flow generation. Over time, however, we continue to view our share repurchase program as an integral to our capital allocation strategy remains and will remain a core tool to our earnings per share model. Next, I\u2019d like to update you on our inventory levels in total. The company\u2019s inventory increased 2.7% over the same period last year, driven by the new stores and increased product placement. Inventory per location was $685,000 versus $688,000 last year and $713,000 last quarter. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable, on a per location basis, was a negative $56,000 versus a negative $58,000 last year and a negative $41,000 last quarter. As a result, accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 108.2% versus last year\u2019s Q3 of 108.7%. Finally, our continued disciplined capital management approach resulted in return on invested capital for the trailing four quarters of 34%. We have and will continue to make investments that we believe will generate returns that significantly exceed our cost of capital. Now, I\u2019ll turn it back to Bill Rhodes. Bill Rhodes : Thank you, Bill. These certainly are unique and unprecedented times and they require a very different cadence of data gathering, evaluation and decision-making. I am extraordinarily proud of our team across the board for their commitment to servicing our customers, the motoring public, but doing so in a very safe manner. While making so many significant decisions so quickly, we know we won\u2019t get them all right. And that\u2019s okay, but as long as we are making the best decisions with the right motivations and adjusting as we go, we will continue to persevere. We don\u2019t know what lies ahead of us for the next few months or even the next couple of years. But what I know is we have a very resilient business that has performed exceptionally well in a wide variety of economic environments, and we have extraordinary people who are committed to servicing our customers and helping them get to work, go see their family, drive to a close vacation spot or other personal priorities. I wish we could provide you with more clarity on our expectations on business trends for the fourth quarter. But as I stated before, there are too many unknowns. But I want to be crystal clear, our expectations do not include sales remaining as robust as we experienced in the last few weeks of the third quarter. Our expectation is the stimulus money will work its way through the economy rather quickly. Our best guide is annual tax refunds and typically those funds positively impact our business for about three weeks. Frankly, our focus isn\u2019t on what happens this quarter. It\u2019s are we keeping our AutoZoners and customers safe today while providing our customers with their automotive needs. And more importantly, what can we do during this very difficult time to position our company for even greater future success. What really matters is how are we doing a year or two from now? And I continue to be quite bullish on our industry and in particular on our company. Now, we\u2019d like to open up the call for questions. Operator : The phone lines are now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] First question is from Seth Sigman from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Seth Sigman : Hi, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question and a nice job managing through the environment. I was hoping you could elaborate a little bit more on the commercial trends that you observed over that last four week period. It sounds like you got back to positive. Just wondering, would you categorize it as sort of a gradual improvement over that four week period tied in with miles driven improving? I mean, I guess how are you thinking about that? And if you could give us a sense on maybe how positive it got over that time period that would be helpful. Bill Rhodes : Sure. It was very interesting on the commercial business. It took a pretty deep dive. It\u2019s down roughly 30% and it stayed there for three or four weeks. Then it began to rebound. If you look at those last four weeks, it was negative the first two, and then it turned positive the second two, ending it caught in mid-single digits positive. It was also interesting \u2013 I can't say whether or not it was tied to miles driven. It certainly began rebounding as the \u2013 as the retail business took off when we got the stimulus money in the economy. But also a lot of customers \u2013 we saw a significant amount of customers that just stopped purchasing from us altogether for some period of time, our assumption and we tried to reach many of them, is they closed at the beginning of this. And as we got towards the latter part of the quarter, we saw that those non-purchasing customers had decreased substantially, if not completely. So it looks like some of them just closed their shops and went and did whatever they needed to do, stayed at home and then began reopening and our business picked up. Seth Sigman : Okay, that's helpful. And then, past the external factors, if you just think about how AutoZone is managing the commercial business with all the disruption and the volatility through the period, do you feel like the strategy has been set back in any way? Are there any limitations to sort of getting back that commercial momentum, that double-digit growth that we've seen in prior periods? Bill Rhodes : I don't think that our strategy has impacted one bit by what's happened in retail or commercial in any significant way at this point in time. Now, we're going to have to understand and watch what happens with consumer behavior. I don't think anybody really knows as the economies and the cities start reopening, who knows what consumer behavior is going to look like. So far what we're seeing is it looked a whole \u2013 looks a whole lot like it did before the pandemic, but I'm sure consumers are going to adjust parts of their behavior and we\u2019ll have to adapt accordingly to that. But on the commercial side of the business, the only thing that's still holding us back is, is we're not doing a lot of face to face sales calls yet. We'll be doing that probably before long, but we're not out there being able to tell our story like we were before. Seth Sigman : Understood. Okay, thanks. Best of luck. Bill Rhodes : Yes. Thank you. Operator : Next question is from Michael Lasser with UBS. Your line is now open. Michael Lasser : Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. So I know you\u2019ve been resistant to give us too much help with modeling the current quarter, but in light of your comments around the stimulus dollars potentially lasting around three weeks or so, should we take that to assume that your current quarter to date trends are meaningfully slower than what you experienced in that last four weeks of the third quarter? Bill Rhodes : Man, you're baiting me, Michael. Michael Lasser : Yes, I am sure I am. Bill Rhodes : And I completely understand, okay. We have a long history of not talking about what's going on intra-quarter because we release our earnings within two and a half weeks of our quarter end. So I just don't want to be giving two and a half week information and people trying to extrapolate that. I wouldn't make the interpretation that our business has gone way down since that point in time, but that's really all I want to say. Michael Lasser : Okay. And on your comment around the business development piece of the commercial growth, should \u2013 and that may be coming back more slowly than just the underlying growth. Should we assume that more than half of the call it double digit call it 10% growth that the commercial business has been growing over the last several quarters has been coming from new customer additions as a result, we can factor that piece to be lower to come back and that's how we should frame the outlook for the commercial program \u2013 for commercial segment from here? Bill Rhodes : I don't think it would be coming all from new customers. You have to believe that we're building our business with our existing customers, too. And as Seth mentioned in the previous one about our initiatives on commercial, we feel really good about the initiatives that we have in place, and a lot of it has to do with being easier to do business with our commercial customers, getting more inventory closer to our commercial customers, improving the time in which we can deliver that product. And that will continue on, and that's going to benefit both new customers and existing customers. So our ability to be able to grow with our existing customers remains very strong. Bill Giles : Yes, let me just add on to that, too. I mean one of the bigger changes that we saw as our business started growing significantly almost two years ago now, one of the biggest KPIs that improved for us was mature customer growth in mature programs, which said to us that we're becoming more and more important to our most important customers. Michael Lasser : Thank you very much and good luck. Bill Rhodes : Yes, thank you. Operator : Next question is from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Simeon Gutman : Hey guys good morning. First, just a two-parter on what we were seeing in the prior quarter. Any in states or geographies that were less impacted by COVID or more rural, did you experience a similar roller coaster? And then if you look at the product mix that you were selling, and Bill Rhodes, you gave some color on this, are there any products that where you would either \u2013 if I'm washing or waxing my car, I'm pulling forward margin or sales that we may not see that as strong in future periods? Bill Rhodes : Yes, terrific questions. So as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, the middle part of the country, Simeon, whether it was urban, suburban or rural, all had the same roller coaster. Maybe not \u2013 didn't go down quite as far but certainly went down significantly. They just rebounded faster, and they've increased more during this period of time. As far as the product categories, yes, there's been a lot of changes, some really interesting trends in the product categories. For instance, right now, we're seeing more work in paint and body than we've seen in a long time. And it's across the board. It's Bondo. It's sandpaper. It's paint. People just have time on their hands and they are doing some of those projects that they haven't done before. Excellent question about does that mean we're pulling some businesses forward or that we're going to have a headwind or a tailwind because of gross margin, I don't think any of that is true. I think we're probably pulling some work that was never going to happen before, and it's happening now. Simeon Gutman : Okay, thanks for that. And then my follow-up, I know you mentioned it\u2019s really hard to predict the environment. I don't know if there is a working hypothesis at AutoZone regarding miles driven, unless it's just taking week-to-week and month-to-month, but if there is, if you can share it. And then any different posture from the business as far as looking to acquire share vis-\u00e0-vis smaller businesses, which I know you haven't done a lot of that in the past, but I wonder if that \u2013 if this is some change that we can expect. Bill Rhodes : Yes. You want to take the latter part of that? Bill Giles : Yes. I think that from a share perspective, we're going to continue to do what we've been doing in terms of organically growing and taking market share. We believe that there's significant opportunity. Now given the current environment, I suspect that some players in the industry will continue to be challenged. And so that may create opportunities or not, but we're going to continue to stick with our strategy, and a lot of that is organic growth. Bill Rhodes : On the first part of your question, Simeon, on miles driven, we were very intentional in our prepared remarks to talk about miles driven. I think AutoZone was actually the one that came out with that notion 25 years ago or so that there was an important factor underlying the trajectory of the industry. And we\u2019ve held to that and believed that however, and we learned during the Great Recession that during certain periods of time, it is not correlated very well at all with the industry same-store sales. We saw that in 2009, 2010 and 2011. That there are just other factors and our thought is when people have a high degree of unemployment, people aren\u2019t buying new cars and the like that miles driven aren\u2019t as important as they were. Simeon Gutman : Okay. Thank you. Bill Rhodes : Yes. Thank you. Operator : Next question is from Mike Baker from Nomura. Your line is now open. Mike Baker : Hi. Thanks guys. So a couple of longer-term questions. I know, you said you\u2019re not really at this point changing your strategy, which makes sense. But longer-term, do you think there\u2019s going to be any change to consumer behavior with respect to DIY versus DIFM with some \u2013 a lot of jobs now, people getting used to working from home and if not going to the office, maybe not every day, but certainly working from home a couple days a week. Does that dictate longer-term that the whole industry might move more towards DIY in a way from commercial, which I think would be a reverse of trends that we saw pre-COVID? Bill Rhodes : Yes. Terrific questions. Many of which we\u2019re thinking through and we certainly don\u2019t have definitive conclusions at this point in time. I think on the shift between DIY and DIFM, there\u2019s been a long pattern of both sectors of the industry growing pretty well. DIY has been \u2013 our DIFM has been growing slightly faster than DIY, but DIY has continued to grow almost every single year. A lot of people are starting to talk about work-from-home. I think that they\u2019re also not thinking about who our customer is, for the most in particular, on the DIY side of the business. Our customers\u2019 generally are financially fragile customer. They\u2019re not going to have the opportunity to work-from-home. They\u2019re working blue collar jobs in a lot of cases. And so their shift in work, even during the crisis wasn\u2019t to go work at home, they had to be out doing their jobs. As we\u2019ve seen, we rolled out curbside pickup, which was really great. Our team did it in a remarkably short period of time. And we\u2019ve seen all of our digital sales grow through Buy Online Pick-Up In-Store, which includes curbside. We\u2019ve seen our next day delivery grow and we\u2019ve seen our ship to home grow. The biggest growth that we\u2019ve seen is in our Buy Online and Pick-Up In-Store. And as I\u2019ve been out in stores, I\u2019ve yet to see a customer do a curbside order. And as I talked to AutoZoners, I ask them, are you getting a lot of curbside orders? And they say, no. Once the customers realize that we\u2019re open, in fact, they\u2019ll come to the door and say, can we come inside? Then they want to come in and interact with our most important asset, which is our AutoZoners. So as people start returning to this new normal, it seems like their behaviors are pretty consistent with the way they were in the past. Now our Buy Online and Pick-Up In-Store is basically double what it was pre crisis right now. But that\u2019s still a very, very small percentage of our business. Mike Baker : Understood. Thanks. And if I could follow-up on that \u2013 again, in terms of the long-term. You mentioned a couple of times potential for commercial customers that were either closed or they might end up needing to close permanently. I guess the question is, have you seen any of that yet? Or is that just what you think could happen or potentially might happen? Or again, are you starting to see just commercial customers, smaller ones just go out of business and is that an opportunity for share gains? Thanks. Bill Rhodes : Yes, we absolutely saw commercial customers close on a temporary basis. Probably, as indicated by we had zero purchases from them for weeks, call it 5% to 10% of our commercial customers. It's very interesting as the stimulus money came in, as the commercial business began to pick up. One of the interesting things we've seen is, we were worried about our commercial receivables. Well, we're seeing that our commercial customers are in fact catching up on the receivables that they got behind on in the crisis. So I don't see any big wave of commercial customers that are closing. I'm sure that they are on the margin, certain commercial customers that were nearing retirement or we're teetering on the edge of not being solvent and they're going to go away. But I don't think that that business is going to go away. The customer might \u2013 that particular shop might go away, but then the work is just going to move to another shop. So I don't see any significant shifts yet at this point in time. Mike Baker : Okay. Thanks. I appreciate the color. Bill Rhodes : Absolutely. Thank you. Operator : Next question is from Matthew McClintock from Raymond James. Your line is now open. Matthew McClintock : Yes. Good morning, everyone. And it's great to hear your voices, I hope to hope god everyone sounds good. The one question I have is just, you talked about supplier diversity, you talked about country diversity, and I just wanted you to dig a little bit more into those comments and maybe just discuss the overall fragility of your supplier base and how your way of thinking towards the supply chain is \u2013 not supply chain, but your suppliers is changing. Thank you. Bill Rhodes : Sure. For a long time, we've been working on making sure that we have diversity in particular categories, vendor diversity. And as \u2013 it's actually again thinking about this long before the crisis hit, but the crisis made it even more acute at this point in time. But as you think about what's happened with China with the tariffs over the last year or so, it's significantly increased our cost structure at a moment\u2019s notice and what having all of certain categories, even if we had two or three or four vendors, all of those vendors would were in China take rotors and steel products, for example. All of those are coming out of China, when that happens and you get slapped with a 10% or 25% tariff, your costs went up 10% or 25% overnight. So we need to be thinking as we always have about vendor diversity, we also need to think about country diversity and this situation COVID-19 only made that, that much more important. Matthew McClintock : Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Bill Rhodes : Thank you. Operator : Next question is from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Chris Horvers : Thank you, and good morning. So I wanted to ask about the early part of the quarter, actually, up more than 6%. Now granted, you probably got some of the worst part of the winter behind you given the timing of your quarter, but it does seem like you've outperformed peers in that first four weeks. So you talked about the strength of the commercial business based on the data that you see, where you outperforming, did you gain share DIY and did it have anything to do with perhaps, weather or delayed tax refunds a year ago? Bill Giles : Yes, I think overall, I mean, like we gain market share during that time period and overall for sure. And so we feel pretty good about that. I think also we were in the heart of the tax season and so we were able to execute very well on that. There was also \u2013 to be fair, there was probably a little bit of the 53rd week shift in that time period as well that benefited us, but it was a strong period for us.  We had mentioned at the end of Q2 that we felt pretty good about starting Q3 and all the things that we thought we had in place, et cetera, from a supply chain perspective, from inventory initiatives. And so we were strong on both fronts and so we were pretty well positioned as we headed into Q3 and it showed up in our first four weeks of our numbers. Chris Horvers : And then what was the shift? The past couple of quarters that\u2019s hurt you, so what was the shift benefit in this quarter? Bill Giles : It was probably less than a 100 basis points for sure, probably closer to 40 to 50 during that time period. Chris Horvers : Got it. And then my follow-up on gross margin, so you did had negative comp, but you didn't deleverage, it seems like in the supply chain was there some benefits that came in, in terms of the DIY mix, that was an offset and just typically you do give some commentary about how you think about gross margin on a go-forward basis? Do you still see the sourcing benefits coming through and should we expect some modest positive there? Bill Giles : Yes, I think that we'll continue to see some modest positive it\u2019s a very good way to say Chris, in terms of our ability to be able to continue to expand our supply, our sourcing capabilities. When you think about the gross margin overall for this quarter, couple of interesting parts is that, one is that the commercial business was actually at a decrease. So although that typically is a headwind for us, it was not so much of a headwind in this quarter. Now at the same time, from a retail perspective, although we were very strong in the retail side of the business, couple of categories that Bill mentioned before are lighting, wipers that typically have higher margin were less sold as people were certainly driving less at night. So those two categories probably were a little bit of a headwind, so that kind of mixed out. And we wound up having kind of a flattish gross margin, so frankly we feel really good about the health of our gross margin, right and would continue to expect it to be strong and slightly positive as we move forward. Chris Horvers : Understood, best of luck. Thanks guys. Bill Rhodes : Thank you. Operator : Next question is from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Brian Nagel : Hi, good morning. Congrats on managing a tough environment really well. Bill Rhodes : Thank you. Brian Nagel : So the question I had a number of \u2013 a number of retailers now have called out the benefits of the stimulus payments from their sales trajectory as you did, is there \u2013 as you look at the data, is there a way to separate out? What benefit you may have gotten from consumers actually putting to work those stimulus checks versus just an overall underlying improvement of consumer confidence as that was taking place in the economy? Bill Rhodes : Yes, that's a fantastic question. I can't do it with data. I can tell you when your business changes 50% in two days, that there's a pretty strong correlation that consumer behavior changes take more time than that. Brian Nagel : Okay. That's helpful. The second question I had also, I apologize for getting too much into the weeds here we've watched your commercial business grow so nicely over the past few years. So we talked a lot about AutoZone really moving up that call list with your individual mechanic customers. Clearly there's disruptions here with all this going on and you called that, I guess Bill Giles called it out in his prepared comments, but have you seen any indications that one reason or another, that AutoZone has fallen down in individual mechanics? Bill Rhodes : Absolutely not, I think if anything, we're moving up that list. There are certain players in the commercial side of the industry that don't have the financial strength that we have. We've been there throughout the entire crisis, taking care of our customers and getting better and better every day. So I think if anything, we moved up that list and the crisis and I don't hear a lot of people talking about their commercial business being positive like we said, ours was for the last two weeks of the quarter. Brian Nagel : Very helpful. I appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : Next question is from Bret Jordan of Jefferies. Your line is now open. Bret Jordan : Hey, good morning, guys Bill Rhodes : Good morning. Bret Jordan : When you think about the diversifying your supply chain geographically, I guess how long a process is that? And I guess is there a capacity or adequate capacity in other manufacturing markets that could really sort of fill the hole that China would leave? And would that still be on the back of private label? Or do you have to start buying branded parts to get into other manufacturing markets? Bill Rhodes : I think it would definitely be on private label side more so than branded parts for sure. With this, what we've been doing with the China products anyway. Certainly Bret, it would take a considerable amount of time, but it's one of those things, if you don't ever start it, then you'll never get there. We've already begun some of that work. In fact, right before the crisis, I can remember having a conversation about some of our folks go into Turkey and we're like, are we comfortable with them going to Turkey? But those kinds of markets, Vietnam, South Korea, we've been working those markets for some time, India. And Mexico is bigger than anybody outside of China. So we're going to continue to cultivate those relationships and learn those new suppliers over time. Bret Jordan : Okay. And then a question on the market share consolidation, I mean it does sound as if some of these smaller distributors have been pretty stressed in this recent environment? If you think about potential door closures, how much contraction do you think we could actually get it? There's 36,000 auto parts stores out there. How many do you think we come out of this with? Bill Rhodes : And that's the age-old question. I mean, I think it's been 34,000 to 36,000 auto parts outlets for 20 years or so. I just \u2013 I don't have a good insight into that Bret. I wish I did, but obviously hard times are going to put more pressure on folks than good times are. I would expect a higher percentage than we've seen over the last five years. But does it go up 10% or does it go up 25%? I don't know. Bret Jordan : Okay. And if I could whip it a housekeeping question for Bill Giles, I guess on the leverage ratio, do you need to be down at 2.5 to start the buyback or can you start the buyback at 2.6 as you ended the quarter? Bill Giles : Yes, no, I mean we certainly, we ended the last quarter 2.6. So I think that anywhere in that neighborhood where we would be comfortable. So those are the credit metrics that we've always said. Bill Rhodes : Yes. I think the other part of that too is when we think about our business, we're going to pull out those COVID-related expenses. So if you pull them out, that also changes the leverage metric a little bit. Bret Jordan : Great. Thank you. Bill Rhodes : Thank you. Operator : And now I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Bill Rhodes. Bill Rhodes : Okay. Before we conclude the call, I want to pivot and encourage us all to take all the precautions we can take to keep everyone safe and healthy. Yes, we're taking precautions that inconvenience us. But during these times, our personal actions matter. And as we celebrated Memorial Day yesterday, we should remember all the heroes of yesteryear, but also remember today's heroes. They all matter. May God bless America during this challenging time. Thank you for being with us today. Operator : This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at this time.",

And thank you for joining us today for AutoZone\u2019s 2020 Fourth Quarter Conference Call. With me today are Bill Giles, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax; and Jamere Jackson, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer-Elect. Jamere who joined us just last week will be observing only today, but we are so glad to have him here and part of our great team. Regarding the fourth quarter, I hope you have had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter\u2019s results. If not, the press release, along with our slides complementing our comments today, are available on our website, www.autozone.com, under the Investor Relations link, please click on Quarterly Earnings Conference Calls to see them. Since our last earnings release in late May, much of the world\u2019s attention has been on COVID-19, its current and short-term implications and trying to evaluate the long-term ramifications of this pandemic. During Q3\u2019s conference call, we shared the incredible volatility we experienced during the third quarter, with three very distinct performance periods. Pre-COVID, where our same-store sales were up about 6% or so, and then the midst of the stay-at-home orders where our comps were down over 20% and then the last four weeks where our performance was in the low-teens following the stimulus checks and at the beginning of the enhanced unemployment benefits. We shared last quarter that our retail sales increased an incredible 50% one week from a Monday to a Wednesday. This quarter\u2019s sales story was very different. It was quite consistent and consistently, very, very strong. While last quarter was the most remarkable quarter I have ever experienced, this quarter marked another milestone. AutoZone enjoyed its largest quarterly same-store sales performance since going public in 1991, 22% -- 22% same-store sales growth, and that introduced new unfamiliar challenges. With the significant increase in customer traffic in our retail and commercial sales, we had to intensely focus on ensuring the safety of our customers and AutoZoners, and that took a tremendous amount of creativity on the part of our team. Our supply chain, specifically our distribution centers, our vendor partners and their operations were and continue to be under immense pressure to keep up with the surge in demand we have experienced over the last five months. Our in-stock positions today aren\u2019t up to our usual high standards and we are working diligently to get recover, but our supply chain wasn\u2019t built for 25% excess capacity. I have mentioned often that our sales are pretty predictable staying in a very tight band. Well, that couldn\u2019t be further from the truth since stimulus money began to flow. That said, our sales in both retail and commercial were high, but very consistent from the beginning of our quarter in early May through July. We were anxious to see what happened to our sales performance in August, after the enhanced unemployment benefits subsided. We are very happy to report that our domestic same-store sales in August, while down some from May through July were still up a remarkable 16.5%. During the quarter, there were certainly some geographic regions that did better than others as they are always are, but all of our regions performed well. I am sure many of you would like to know how we are thinking about sales for both the first quarter and fiscal \u201821. It remains very difficult for us to predict. Based on our performance post-enhanced unemployment, we feel our sales will remain elevated for some time, and typically, in recessionary environments, we performed well, but nothing, nothing about this global pandemic is typical. There is simply too many remaining unknowns, will the federal government\u2019s 300 hours enhanced unemployment benefit be sufficient? How long will it last? Will there be an effective vaccine, and if so, when? What consumer behaviors have changed temporarily? Which once have changed permanently? And many, many more questions. Beyond our primary objective to ensure the safety of our customers and AutoZoners, our focus is on providing our AutoZoners with the resources they need to provide our customers with an exceptional experience. As for the long-term to-date, we don\u2019t see anything that substantially changes our bullish view on our industry, but we must continue to monitor consumer shifts in behavior. And if the economy enters a deep and protracted recessionary environment, we continue to believe our customers will focus more on maintaining their current vehicles and it will benefit our business, retail in particular, as it has in the last three recessions. Last quarter, I reminded folks, the strongest periods we have experienced of outside sales growth over the last three decades have been the early 1990s, \u201801, \u201802, \u201809, \u201810 and \u201811, all coming out of recessionary periods. This is why we remain optimistic on the industry this upcoming year. Interestingly, after each of those outsized sales growth periods, they have never been followed by equivalent declines in the years that follow. We believe consumer behaviors changed during these recessionary periods, allowing us to showcase our skills and capabilities to new customers, and we retain many of those customers in the years that follow. We always begin these calls by thanking our AutoZoners. What our team continues to do has really been exceptional. I applaud our entire organization each and every AutoZoners across the enterprise from Hawaii to South Paulo from ALLDATA to our DataZone facility in Mexico. Every AutoZoners has had to learn new ways to work, new ways to meet and exceed the wants, needs and desires of our customers, and everyone has met, embraced and delivered on that challenge. I couldn\u2019t be more proud of the phenomenal team I have the honor of working alongside. I especially want to call out and on behalf of every AutoZoner, recognize our store and distribution center AutoZoners. These extraordinary people have been thrown many, many curveballs in the last six months and they have met every challenge with tremendous ingenuity, courage, innovation and passion. Most importantly, they have continued to deliver an exceptional service experience for our customers. Thank you, AutoZoners. You embody everything it means to be an AutoZoner and you deliver on our cultural and service promises every single day. Now let\u2019s move into our performance for the quarter. Same-store sales were up 21.8% versus last year\u2019s fourth quarter. Our net income was $740 million and our EPS was $30.93 a share, 36.9% above last year. Excluding the extra week in last year\u2019s fourth quarter, our EPS was up an amazing 47.6%. Regarding our sales performance, while the consistency from week-to-week was predictable, the volume of business was the outlier this quarter. Our sales were much higher than we could have forecasted at the beginning of the fiscal year and they sustained higher levels than we would have predicted on our last call in May. While our retail business was stronger than our commercial business, both businesses had week-to-week consistent sales performance. Our DIY same-store sales were up approximately 24%. Our share growth in retail over the last four months on the detailed information we have available for our broadest set of competitors shows that we have been gaining much, much more share than at any time before in both units and dollars. Our commercial business total sales were up approximately 17% on a 16-week basis. In commercial, we averaged over $60 million in weekly sales, which was over $12,200 in sales per program per week, both new records for us. Candidly, we are most proud to highlight that we continue to live up to our stated values when it came to taking care of our AutoZoners. During our third quarter, we announced that all eligible hourly, full and part-time AutoZoners across the U.S. would receive emergency time-off benefits and it would be available immediately. Remember back to that time, at that time, we didn\u2019t wait to see what others were doing or wait on any mandates by government. We felt it was imperative to act swiftly in support of our AutoZoners on the frontlines. We provided them with two additional weeks of time-off, including for the first time in our history, providing eligible part-timers with paid time-off up to 40 hours. This additional time-off can be used as the AutoZoner desires, and if they don\u2019t use it between now and the calendar year-end, we will pay them for those hours in January. We did this to provide our AutoZoners with choices. Some are in the more vulnerable populations and weren\u2019t comfortable coming to work. Others had childcare issues. Others were simply anxious. While the vast majority were comfortable continuing to come to work and providing great service to our customers in their time of need. This decision, which was made in a couple of days, was aligned with our values. In the fourth quarter, we extended these emergency time-off benefits to our store managers and distribution center advisors, each of whom have been on the frontline, supporting and leading their teams through this extraordinary season. We were honored to be able to make these investments in our AutoZoners in recognition of what they have done and continue to do for our customers and our organization. Overall, this quarter sales were a record for us, but it is simply impossible and would be irresponsible to extrapolate these results going forward. With so many variables heading into the fall, we continue to manage the business literally from week-to-week and our field organization continues to do an outstanding job managing the business. As we said on last quarter\u2019s call, we expect that our sales growth will moderate over time. But we continue to believe our products and services will be in high demand during these more difficult economic times. One thing that we are sure about, our team has shown their resiliency and they remain nimble. They are ready to react quickly to every single change. We remain focused on providing our team with the resources and support they need to live up to our pledge, and our AutoZoners have definitely and continue to put our customers first. While geographic differences weren\u2019t a significant story this quarter, there continued to be interesting trends across our merchandise categories specifically in the retail business. We continue to see some surprisingly strong categories that I will call project categories. These are categories for hobbyists or people who want to upgrade something. We believe that with people having more time on their hands and many having more discretionary money due to the enhanced unemployment benefits, often making more than they were making before or a lack of spending on entertainment-type categories, customers are working on their quote, project car or doing that enhancement job they have been constantly putting off. At the same time, we noted that certain product lines grew at a slower rate compared to the chain average. Merchandise categories like brakes, rotors or even motor oil, while up from pre-COVID levels aren\u2019t growing at the same rate as the overall store. We believe these categories maybe impacted by the decrease in miles driven and in the brake categories, specifically, the lack of severe winter weather last year. Now let\u2019s turn our focus to the balance of the P&L. For the quarter, our gross margin was down 33 basis points. Included in our cost of goods this quarter was a shift of mix and 9 basis points of headwind due to civil unrest expenses. In addition, we have also identified select categories that are more commodity based, which are less dependent upon service that we have lowered prices in order to be more effectively compete with our non-traditional competitors to increase volumes. On operating expenses, our team particularly our store operations and commercial teams continue to manage our expenses during these times well. As our sales accelerated drastically in a very short period of time, we didn\u2019t have the available labor to achieve our desired staffing labels until later in the quarter. So we wish we could have spent more on labor to provide an even better customer experience. Our expenses were up 9.2% versus last year\u2019s Q4 excluding the extra week due to our very strong sales results, we were able to leverage operating expenses 315 basis points. Included in this quarter\u2019s expenses were approximately $11 million related to emergency time-off and other COVID-related expenses. While the last two quarters expenses related to COVID have been significant, as we visit stores and distribution centers and talk to our team, this decision strengthen our already unique and powerful culture, and show that this organization walks the talk. We believe there will be long lasting benefits from this decision. Regarding our balance sheet, our debt was up a bit and our cash and cash equivalents were up dramatically. We now have over $1.7 billion in cash on the balance sheet, of which $1.6 billion is excess cash. Increasing our debt levels, adding a new 364-day line of credit and increasing excess cash were purposeful, as we wanted to maximize our liquidity position due to the significant uncertainty. We also felt we managed our inventory well as our inventory per store growth increased 1.3% versus Q4 last year. We feel our strong liquidity position heading into the fall months allows us immense flexibility when it comes to thoughtfully reinstituting our share repurchase program. As I mentioned previously, we temporarily paused our stock buyback program in March. It was certainly the right decision. At the time, as there was too much uncertainty in the business and in the world, our share repurchase program has been a very important part of our capital allocation strategy and it will continue to be so. We expect to gradually restart our buyback program during the first quarter. We intend to utilize our ongoing free cash flow to buy back stock and based on our view of the future, begin methodically utilizing some of the excess cash we currently have on our balance sheet. As we did in March, if we have concerns about the near-term, we can and will temporarily suspend repurchases again, which is one of the significant benefits of a share repurchase program versus a dividend approach of returning capital to shareholders. We expect to maintain an elevated level of cash and cash equivalents throughout most of this new fiscal year. In regard to our CapEx spend during the quarter. We spent less this year than last year. We paused our development on many stores during the depths of the stay-at-home orders, which slowed our ability to complete construction and open new stores. As a result, we finished this year with 113 new U.S. stores versus 154 last year and we opened only 25 stores across all of Mexico and Brazil for the year. For 2021, we would expect to get back to our usual cadence of approximately 150 domestic new stores and roughly 50 international stores. I will spend a moment on our integrated retail efforts. As COVID\u2019s effect on consumer\u2019s ability to get out and shop grew, we ramped up our strategy to enhance the customer shopping experience by meeting customers when, where and how they wanted to shop. This past quarter we continued to see very strong growth in our online shopping channels, buy online, pickup in store, next-day delivery and ship to home. In particular, our buy online pickup in-store offering grew rapidly at 4 times the growth rate of the ship-to-home options. I do want to remind listeners that our online sales still represent a very, very small percentage of the DIY business, substantially below 5%. While online purchasing is a smaller business for us, the traffic to the website is a tremendous marketing tool for our in-store business. We remain committed to improving the shopping experience online in order to help customers identify what they need and allow them a quicker in and out experience once they come to our stores for pickup. Before I pass the discussion over to Bill Giles to talk about our financial results, I\u2019d like to again thank our AutoZoners for their extraordinary efforts during these unprecedented times. I cannot thank you enough and I am confident that I speak on behalf of our shareholders too, and say, thank you. AutoZoners, you truly delivered on AutoZone\u2019s promise to provide exceptional customer service. Now I will turn it over to Bill Giles. Bill? Bill Giles : Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. To start this morning let me take a few moments to talk more specifically about both our domestic and international results. For the quarter, total auto parts sales, which includes our domestic, Mexico and Brazil stores increased 14.2%. For the trailing 4 quarters ended, total sales for AutoZone store were $1.914 million. This compares to an average of $1.847 million at Q4 ending last year. Total DIFM sales increased on a 16-week basis 16.8% to $976 million, an amazing number this quarter reached several records for us. In the quarter sales through our DIFM customers represented 21.5% of our total sales, an increase approximately $89 million from last year\u2019s Q4. Last year did have the extra week and excluding that week, our sales were up $140.4 million, our weekly sales program were $12,250 and they were up 14.2% on a per program basis versus $10,700 per week last year. As we open fewer program this year at 114 finishing with 5007 total programs, our sales efficacy per store has never been higher. Not only was $12,250 a week record for us, but we were able to average $60 million in total weekly commercial sales, an amazing accomplishment. While we know many of the industry participants remain comfortably ahead of us currently, we know we are on the right path. This past year, we again believe our sales increases were materially better than the overall industry and will remain focused on repeating this in FY\u201921. I should take a moment to discuss four major things that are making a real difference for us when it comes to commercial. First, we continue to expand our inventory availability initiative. One major example of this is adding to the number of mega hub locations. These stores have been opened five this quarter and now numbering 44 in total substantially increased local market availability. Mega hubs lift our sales noticeably in the markets where they open. With over 80,000 SKUs or more available same day and even multiple times per day from these mega hub markets, we are able to say, yes, materially more than when compared to carrying 40,000 to 50,000 SKUs from a hub. Second, we are improving our service. We are delivering faster and we are supporting our customers with their overall needs better than before. We recently began rolling out new technology that will significantly improve our delivery times and the accuracy of the commitments that we make to our customers. Third, we have got our stores managers to buy in to our commercial sales initiatives. They are not only involved with the commercial effort but they are fully onboard with driving sales calls and improving our service to our commercial customers. They now own the commercial business in their store. And fourth, we continue to rollout initiatives that make us much easier to do business with. We now have our commercial program in 5,007 stores or 85% of our domestic stores. Our Mexico stores continue to be impacted by the pandemic this past quarter. In addition to impacting sales, the weakness in the foreign currency exchange rate put additional pressure on our results. The exchange rate finished the quarter at 21.91 to the dollar and was roughly 15% higher than last year\u2019s fourth quarter. As a result of the devaluation, our total U.S. dollar sales were down for the quarter versus last year. During the quarter we opened 11 new stores and finished with 621 stores. While the quarter was challenging, we believe the negative impacts are short-term in nature. We remain committed to our store opening schedules in Mexico for the foreseeable future. Regarding Brazil, we finished with 43 stores. We opened five new stores in the quarter. Similar to the U.S., Brazil faced immense challenges with COVID-19 and stay-at-home mandates. In fact, many of our stores in Brazil were focused or forced to be closed for weeks like our stores in Puerto Rico. In both markets, our AutoZoners were very creative and quickly implemented drive-through no contact service. You should have seen the lines of cars. Currently, we view the COVID impact to be short-term in nature for our Brazil stores as well. Our commitment to growing our Brazilian business is not wavered. Gross margin for the quarter was 53.1% of sales, down 31 basis points versus last year\u2019s fourth quarter on a 16-week basis. This past quarter\u2019s gross margin included approximately $4 million and charges related to damage from civil unrest. The increase in gross -- the decrease in gross margin was attributable to lower merchandise margins driven primarily by a shift in mix. Our primary focus will continue to be growing absolute gross profit dollars in total auto parts segment. SG&A for the quarter was 30.7% of sales, leveraging 338 basis points to last year\u2019s fourth quarter on a 16-week basis. Our SG&A grew 9.2% over last year\u2019s fourth quarter. As we discussed in our press release this morning, we incurred a net $10.7 million in charges related to our offering emergency time-off and additional direct COVID expenses. SG&A will remain something we manage in accordance with sales volumes. As sales pick-up, we would expect the spend rate to increase, and as previously mentioned, at times, we haven\u2019t been able to adequately staff to the increase in volume, as our staffing levels have increased so will our labor cost. EBIT for the quarter was $1.18 million. Our EBIT margin was 22.4%. Interest expense for the quarter was $65.6 million, up 14% from Q4 a year ago. The higher expenses related to the $1.25 billion bond issuance and a $750 million 364-day credit facility, both completed in the third quarter. We are planning interest at $48 million for the first quarter of fiscal \u201821 versus $43.7 million in last year\u2019s quarter. Our higher forecast than last year is driven, again by the costs associated with the new bond issuance and 1 364-day credit facility. Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $5.513 billion or $307 million above last year\u2019s Q4 ending balance of $5.206 billion. Our adjusted debt level metric finished the quarter at 1.9 times EBITDA. Our lower-than-normal credit metric reflects the temporary suspension of share repurchase program. While in any given quarter, we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on management\u2019s opinion regarding debt and equity conditions, we remain committed to both our investment grade rating and our capital allocation strategy. In the long -- in long-term, our share repurchases are an important element of that strategy. For the quarter, our tax rate was 22.3% versus 21.5% in last year\u2019s fourth quarter. This quarter\u2019s rate benefited 35 basis points from stock options exercised, while last year it benefited 107 basis points. Stock option exercises aren\u2019t predictable and as such they will affect our tax rate and ultimately our net income and EPS. For the first quarter of FY\u201921, we suggest investors to model us at approximately 23.5% before any assumptions on credits due to stock option exercises. Because we cannot effectively predict this activity, we remain committed to report a stock option impact on the tax rate. Net income for the quarter was $740 million, up was 41.2% versus last year\u2019s fourth quarter when excluding the 17th week. Our diluted share count of 23.9 million was lower by 4.3% from last year\u2019s fourth quarter. The combination of these factors drove earnings per share for the quarter to $30.93, up 47.6% over the prior year\u2019s fourth quarter excluding the extra week. Relating to the cash flow statement for the fourth quarter, we generated $1.417 billion of operating cash flow. This was up approximately $600 million over last year\u2019s Q4 with an extra week. Net fixed assets were up 2.5% versus last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $183.8 million and reflected the additional expenditures required to open 65 net new stores this quarter, capital expenditures on existing stores, hub and mega hub remodels or openings, work on development of new stores for upcoming quarters and information technology investments. With the new stores opened, we finished this past quarter with 5,885 stores in the U.S., 621 stores in Mexico and 43 in Brazil for a total store count of 6,549. Depreciation totaled $125.4 million for the quarter versus last year\u2019s expense of $118.5 million. This is generally in line is generally in line with recent growth rates. We did not repurchase any AutoZone stock in the quarter versus $692 million last year. At quarter end, we had $796 million remaining under our share buyback authorization and our leverage metric was 1.9 times. As Bill mentioned earlier, we had suspended our share repurchase program, as we continue to evaluate cash flow generation and the economy as a whole. At this stage, based on current conditions and the strength of our business, we expect to be utilizing our free cash flow generated each quarter in order to opportunistically start buying back -- our program back up. It remains and will remain a core tool to our model, as we believe it is a terrific flexible way to return excess cash flow after appropriately investing in our business to our shareholders. Next I\u2019d like to update you on our inventory levels in total. The company\u2019s inventory increased 3.6% over the same period last year, driven by new stores and increased product placement. Inventory per location was $683,000 versus $674,000 last year and $685,000 last quarter. Net inventory, defined as merchandized inventories less accounts payable on a per location basis was a negative $104,000 versus a negative $85,000 last year and a negative $56,000 last quarter. As a result, accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at a 115.3% versus last year\u2019s Q4 of 112.6%. Finally, our continued disciplined capital management approach resulted in return on invested capital for the trailing four quarters of 38.1%. We have and will continue to make investments that we believe will generate returns that significantly exceed our cost of capital. Now, I will turn it back to Bill Rhodes. Bill Rhodes : Thank you, Bill. These continue to be unique and unprecedented times and they have required us to look at many things differently to manage our business day-to-day. I am extraordinarily proud of our team across the Board for their commitment to servicing our customers, the motoring public, but doing so in a very safe manner. While we are learning how to operate effectively in these times, we remain wary of the volatility that can exist, volatility in both the U.S. and our international markets. We don\u2019t know what lies ahead of us for this new fiscal year, but we feel we are much more prepared today for uncertainty than we were at the start of this pandemic. We will be ready for a wide variety of economic environments and we have extraordinary people who are committed to servicing our customers and helping them get to work, go see their families, drive to a close vacation spot or get back into the school year. I wish we could provide you with more clarity on our expectations on business trends for our upcoming first quarter and the new fiscal year. But as I stated before, that isn\u2019t practical for us with all the unknowns. But I want to be crystal clear. We plan conservatively in order to manage our cost structure appropriately. Our domestic retail business was a tremendous surprise for us this past quarter. We understand trends will ultimately slow. While we appreciate these things, we feel we are well-positioned for continued future share gain opportunities in both the domestic, retail and commercial segments. We had an outstanding quarter, but we have work to do as we start a new fiscal year. Frankly, our focus isn\u2019t on what happens this new quarter. Its, are we keeping our AutoZoners and customer safe today, while providing our customers with their automotive needs. And more importantly, what can we do during these extraordinary times to position our company for even greater future success. What really matters is how are we doing a year or two from now and I continue to be bullish on our industry, and in particular, bullish on our company. Before we proceed to questions, we made some exciting organization announcements a few weeks ago. We announced that Bill Giles and Bill Hackney, two tremendous long-term talented leaders plan to retire at the end of the calendar year. It is impossible to state the tremendous impact each of them have had on our business, our culture and our teams. They will be sorely missed. But in their typical fashion, they always put the company\u2019s interest ahead of their own and they have been sharing with us for a long time that this day would inevitably come. As such, their teams are prepared and we simultaneously announced the addition of two new fabulous leaders to our team. Our new EVP, CFO, Jamere Jackson is with us today and Seong Ohm will be joining us soon as our new Senior Vice President of Merchandising. We are so excited to add these two seasoned highly accomplished leaders to our team. It will be terrific to inject their ideas, thoughts, and perspectives into our future strategies and tactics. We welcome Jamere and Seong, and we look forward to celebrating the enormous contributions of Bill and Bill. Now, we\u2019d like to open up the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] First question in the queue is from Michael Lasser with UBS. Your line is now open. Michael Lasser : Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my questions and congratulations to everyone on their new roles and [Bill Giles] [ph] good luck on your retirement. Bill Rhodes\u2026 Bill Giles : Thank you, Michael. Michael Lasser : Thank you. Bill Rhodes, recognizing that you want to -- you don\u2019t necessarily want to opine on how to think about AutoZone\u2019s sales trends moving forward, but as you think about the period of extraordinary growth that the industry is experiencing right now from those what you categorized as project related items. As that [indiscernible], are you operating under the assumptions that the industry\u2019s sales can return to pre-COVID levels even if vehicle miles driven are structurally lower moving forward? Bill Rhodes : Yeah. I think that is one of those other questions that are really hard to say right now, Michael. And I will go back to, on our last call, if you would have told me that our sales would continue for four months -- additional four months at those elevated levels, I wouldn\u2019t have thought that to be true, but they did. And the biggest news to me was the fact that August still had 16.5% same-store sales growth post-economic stimulus and enhanced unemployment benefits. What happens with miles driven will be an element of it. But a lot of the miles that are being driven, they are not all the same. Our customer -- our core customer, their habits haven\u2019t changed. They are still going to work every day. When you think about the miles driven it\u2019s -- that have declined, it\u2019s generally higher socioeconomic groups that are working from home. Our core customers, they haven\u2019t worked at home, just like our store AutoZoners and D.C. AutoZoners. They haven\u2019t worked at home a day. So I don\u2019t think all miles driven are the same. What happens in the next 12 months? Frankly, it\u2019s very, very difficult for us to predict. The piece that I hang on to and we hang on to is, generally when economic times are tough people prioritize their vehicle at a different level because they are not going to get a new vehicle in any short-term period, and therefore, they change their maintenance and upgrade their vehicles. So, as I said earlier, the last -- over the last three decades, the best periods of performance for us have all been coming out of recessionary environments. Will this recessionary environment be the same as those other periods? I don\u2019t know. But that\u2019s the best analogy that we have at this point. Michael Lasser : That\u2019s helpful. And my follow-up question is on your gross margin. How much did lowering prices on commodity items impact the gross margin in the quarter? Did that have any effect on your ability to gain share seemingly within the commercial side of the business and do you expect to push this strategy further over the next couple of quarters that it will continue to have a lingering impact on the gross margin? Bill Giles : Yeah. It\u2019s a good question, Michael. I would start by first saying, most of the gross margin impact was product mix shift. So we had some categories like lighting and brakes that typically have higher margins than our average and those underperformed the quarter. Batteries as an example, outperformed during the quarter and they typically have slightly lower margins than the average. So that\u2019s what drove it a little bit. But, yes, we did provide -- we did find opportunities for us to lower select categories like commodities, where we are really not adding a lot of service and it\u2019s an opportunity for us to be more competitive. And we did gain market share in many of those categories during the quarter. So we think it was the right decision and long-term it will help drive sales and ultimately help drive gross profit. But to dimensionalize it was probably a single-digit basis point impact. Michael Lasser : That\u2019s helpful and best of luck. Thank you. Bill Giles : Thank you. Operator : Next question is from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Simeon Gutman : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I have a question on sales and then a question on margin. My first question on sales, Bill Rhodes, you mentioned, the 16.5% through August a couple times and I think towards the end of your prepared remarks, you said, sales will ultimately revert back. Is there anything more you can talk about on September, sorry, to be so short-term and if we get CARES 2\u2026 Bill Rhodes : Yeah. Simeon Gutman : \u2026do you think we will see a bigger impact in DIY or commercial? Bill Rhodes : Okay. So you know this, our long history is, we report earnings so quickly after the end of our quarter. Usually three quarters of the year within two and a half weeks at the end of the year because of year [and] [ph] we go three and a half weeks. I just don\u2019t want to talk about trends in September, because I just don\u2019t want people focusing that much attention on such a short period of time. That\u2019s why we were so crystal clear about what happened in August, that we did see a 16.5% comp in August. So I want to leave it at that, Simeon. I understand your desire to hear more but I don\u2019t want us extrapolating two weeks or three weeks. Simeon Gutman : Fair enough. And then, I guess, I will throw the follow-up and then I don\u2019t know if you have a thought on the -- if CARES 2 will help commercial or DIY more, but the follow-up is also on gross margin. And in the past, I don\u2019t know if you have provided a rule of thumb or the market has that gross margin for AutoZone could be up on average from 10-ish basis points or so a year. Is that still a fair framework, the idea maybe or is there a lower threshold given your reserve the right to invest back in price and then, if it was down a little in 2020 does that mean it could be up a little bit more than sort of typical algorithm in 2021? Bill Rhodes : Okay. Let me answer your first follow-up question on the CARES Act and then, Bill, will take the gross margin one. As far as the CARES Act, if there was a CARES, I think, it\u2019s now 4 and we provided additional enhanced unemployment benefits. I think you see more of the benefit on the DIY side of the business, because that\u2019s where the most financially fragile customers are. If you look back to what happens every year when tax refunds come out and it\u2019s the DIY business, they both pick up, but the DIY business picks up even more. So I think it would be beneficial on both sides, more beneficial on the DIY side. Bill? Bill Giles : On the growth side, I would just say that, look we grew gross profit dollars by 20%. Our focus is again on driving gross profit dollars. And so where we can find opportunities to invest back in the business, we are going to do that, and over time, retail and commercial prices will go up and down based on market conditions. So, again, our standpoint is, look, our margin is in a really healthy place right now and we have got great opportunities for us to lower cost through lower acquisition opportunities and so we have -- on a category-by-category basis, we feel really good about where our margin is. There\u2019s always going to be some shift in product sales mix that\u2019s going to impact the margin. Simeon Gutman : Got it. Okay. Thanks Bill and congratulations. Bill Giles : Thank you, Simeon. Bill Rhodes : Thanks, Simeon. Operator : Next question is from Seth Sigman with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Seth Sigman : Great. Hey, guys, good morning. Congrats on the quarter, and Bill Giles, congrats on your announced retirement as well. I wanted to focus a little bit more on that 16.5% exit rate, obviously, a very strong trend. Can you just discuss the DIY and commercial trends that you saw as you moved through the quarter? And then the second part of it is, if you can talk about the types of projects that you see getting done and whether you have any concerns that sales are being pulled forward or do you believe that what you have seen is largely projects that had been delayed from earlier in the year? How are you are you thinking about that? Bill Rhodes : Yeah. Some terrific questions in there. As far as the last question of, did we pull projects forward? I think the project work is kind of, I call it, the never doing now category. These are projects that people thought that they would do some time, but they never had the time to do them, and therefore, when they had the time and they had some incremental disposable income they tackled those jumps. I do -- our battery business, as Bill said, has been very, very strong. A lot of the reasons we believe it\u2019s been strong is because a lot of people park their vehicle for some extended period of time. Once they restarted it the battery had been discharged some. So are those some failures that might have happened this coming winter when it got cold? That\u2019s the only piece that I wonder if that might have a bit of a pull-forward. But we will see when we get into next year. What was the first part of your question? Seth Sigman : Just the DIY versus commercial trends as you move through the quarter? Bill Rhodes : Yeah. DIY started, I mentioned it, went up 50% in two days back in April and so it ramped really quickly. The commercial business lagged it, but it continued to build very methodically over the course of the quarter. As we got into August, both businesses took a little bit of a step down when that enhanced unemployment benefit went away. Seth Sigman : Okay. That makes sense. And then just a follow-up on commercial, I do think the most important trend in the quarter was the strength you saw in commercial, obviously, reflects a lot of the things that you have been doing over the last couple of years. Can you just update us on the hub strategy, frame for us how markets perform when you add a hub to the network? And then how are you thinking about growth of hub locations at this point, particularly given all the disruption in retail and the real estate opportunities that may come up? Thanks. Bill Giles : Great question, Seth. Yeah. We think that there\u2019s continued opportunity. As we mentioned before, we are going to continue to expand our mega hubs. As we said, we have 44 open today. We have targeted 75-plus mega hubs in the future. We are well on our way to accomplishing that over the next couple of years. We have got about 200 hubs today. We think on a longer term basis we could almost double that number. So, we are excited about it. The markets do perform well when we introduce those hubs into the marketplace and so we are certainly getting an adequate return and excited about the sales volume is generated from that. And you are right that there are more and more boxes that are available in the marketplace. They just have to be in the right place and that hopefully will be an opportunity for us, as we move forward. Operator : Next question is from Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Christopher Horvers : Thanks. Good morning, guys. So a couple of follow-ups. On the hurricane in August, did hurricane, how much -- to what degree that impacted the 16.5%, and perhaps, as you peel that hurricane back, did -- do it for me actually moderate post-stimulus? Bill Rhodes : Okay. So the hurricane, this was not a massive hurricane except for the people that were directly impacted. So it was a pretty small area that was hit. Our sales were softer in that last week, not disproportionately softer but they were softer. We did lose a store in Lake Charles, Louisiana. Fortunately, we know no AutoZoners that were significantly impacted, as a result of that hurricane or the one that happen week and a half ago. As far as commercial moderating, they both moderated in the August period of time. That\u2019s what we saw. They just stepped down a little bit. But we were, frankly, tickled to death with 16.5% comps in August. Christopher Horvers : Yeah. Really strong. And then, from a regionality perspective, as you saw some of the flare ups of COVID over the summer, did you see any change in your business, any deceleration or acceleration? And as you think about some of the harder hit areas around COVID earlier, the spring, for example, the Northeast, how do that -- those areas perform over the quarter? Bill Rhodes : Back in the spring, there was a clear delineation between the hardest hit areas and the rest of the country. This summer there was very little differentiation, and certainly, little differentiation that you could attribute to COVID. You would see some weather patterns as we always do. But I would say, that the COVID impact in the summertime was unremarkable. Christopher Horvers : And then on the Northeast? Bill Rhodes : I am sorry? Bill Giles : Northeast. Christopher Horvers : The Northeast, did that as miles driven hasn\u2019t gotten less worse there, has that part of the country seeing a more marked improvement? Bill Rhodes : It has rebounded back to being more normal with the rest of the markets. Christopher Horvers : Understood. Thanks very much and congratulations to all. Bill Rhodes : Thank you. Bill Giles : Thank you, Chris. Bill Rhodes : Appreciate it, Chris. Operator : Next question is from Zach Fadem with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. David Lance : Hi. This is David Lance on for Zack. Thanks for taking my questions. So as you continue to take share on the commercial side, I was just curious if you could comment on how this business has changed as a result of the pandemic and whether you would view the double-digit growth is sustainable going forward? Bill Rhodes : Well, I think, one of the things that happened in the pandemic is everybody that run -- was operating a business, started running down case scenarios, us included, I talked about it on the last call that we were asking ourselves questions that I never thought we would ask ourselves, questions like liquidity. But in the midst of the depths of the pandemic, we did two things, one, we invested in our AutoZoners. Other people were saying, how do I cut my costs like crazy. We said, how do we stand in the gap for the most important thing we have, which is our AutoZoners. We have provided them with that emergency time off benefit. The other thing that we did was we didn\u2019t lay-off or furlough one single person, not one, as a result of the pandemic and we kept our operations as normal as possible. Yes, we cut back our store hours of operation. But that was about it. Other people, particularly the less sophisticated, less well-capitalized people, many of which were on the commercial side of the business, they reacted very swiftly and very strongly and they let people go, they cut back their service level. And so it provided us an opportunity to over serve our customers during that period of time, certainly from a competitive point of view. I think that, that has a longstanding impact, whether or not we can grow commercial 10% into the foreseeable future, that\u2019s anybody\u2019s guess. What I know is we are winning in the marketplace. If you look at our growth over -- most of the periods over the last 10 years, our growth versus the competitive landscape has been significantly better, 2 times or 3 times, many times what the industry growth rate is and we feel really good about where we are. David Lance : Great. And then just one more from us, how do you think miles driven plays out when you think through the moving parts around extended work-from-home, but also the higher demand from used cars in a population shift to the suburbs? Bill Giles : It feels as though the miles driven is getting better each month, I mean, obviously, it was down maybe close to 10% back in July. But if you look at the current fuel sales, it would imply that miles driven is down in the mid- to low-single digits at this point. So our expectation is that that\u2019s a number that\u2019s going to continue to improve. And back to Bill\u2019s point earlier, that relative to our customer, it\u2019s very likely that their miles driven is not necessarily negative. They are more likely than not essential workers needing to be able to get to work and able to operate their cars. So our expectation is it will continue to get better and that it is, probably, already a little bit better for our customer. Bill Rhodes : Can I jump in on that as well, and I just want to remind everybody to go back to the \u201808, \u201809 period of time and when miles driven dipped during that period of time, the correlation between miles driven and our sales performance was -- and the industry sales performance was broken. And we attribute that to the fact that there were a lot of people -- our trends were more aligned with what was going on with employment. And so in these tough economic times, I think, the correlation between miles driven breaks. It comes back together in more normal times. But it definitely is not a good contributor in short-term recessionary environments. David Lance : Great. Thanks so much. Operator : Next question is from Michael Baker with D.A. Davidson. Your line is now open. Michael Baker : Hi. Thanks. I wanted to ask a question on SG&A, it was up, we think about 6% per foot when you adjust for the extra week. What I am trying to understand is, so sales are probably going to slow, which means that maybe the SG&A growth would slow, but then again that SG&A growth maybe was understated because you didn\u2019t have the labor you needed earlier in the quarter. So how do we think about that going forward, for instance, if you continue to comp in the low- to mid-teen level, does that SG&A per foot go up in the next quarter? Bill Giles : Yeah. It\u2019s a good question, Michael. And as you know, our game plan is, is that we are going to play in the environment that we are in. So if sales are continued to be strong, we are going to continue to invest back into that. As Bill mentioned before, we probably ended the quarter in reasonably good shape from the standpoint of labor and service, but certainly, at the beginning of the quarter, we were trying to catch up a little bit. So, on an overall basis I would expect us to continue to invest in labor as our sales continue to be strong and we are going to find other opportunities for us to be able to make investments when our business is really strong. Because, again, it\u2019s all about the future and it\u2019s all about our long-term growth and ensuring that we are creating a great service environment for our customers both on the retail side and the commercial side. Michael Baker : Okay. So that makes sense. So just to follow-up on that, presumably if we were to be able to look at it on a month-by-month basis or something along those lines, the SG&A per foot in August towards the end of the quarter was up more than 6% and that\u2019s maybe the trajectory we should think about going forward as long as we assume that sales are going to remain pretty strong. Is that fair? Bill Giles : I would just say on a relative basis, it would have increased as the quarter progressed, yes. Michael Baker : Okay. Understood. Thanks. Appreciate that. Bill Giles : Thank you, Michael. Operator : Next question is from Daniel Imbro with Stephens, Inc. Your line is now open. Daniel Imbro : Yeah. Thanks for taking my questions. Good morning guys. I add my congrats to Bill Giles and Jamere welcome to the team. Bill Giles : Thank you. Jamere Jackson : Thank you. Daniel Imbro : Starting on gross margins, Bill, I think, something you guys have talked about in the last 12 months has been a focus on direct sourcing and kind of growing that initiative. Can you update us on where that stands? And then your recent hire of Seong Ohm, obviously, experienced in the global sourcing department, can you talk about how she adds to that capability going forward? Bill Giles : Yeah. Great question. In fact, we spent a lot of time in energy building, our foreign sourcing office -- buying office over in China and so we continue to find opportunities in a lot of different categories for us to be able to find areas where we can reduce our acquisition costs. One of the other things that pandemic taught us was that, we also want to ensure that we are not too dependent on any particular geographic area of the world and so the team is going to be continuing to find other opportunities throughout the world in order for us to be able to source product. So that will actually, I think, reduce our risk on a long-term basis and should also find other opportunities for us to lower our acquisition cost. Seong will come to us with a significant amount of experience in this area and we are excited about her joining the organization and helping the great team that we have already built overseas buying product every day, but Seong will be able to add a lot of value in that area as well. Daniel Imbro : That\u2019s great. Thanks for the color. And then Bill Rhodes, a follow-up on maybe a higher level industry question. I mean you just discussed some of the differences why you are gaining so much share, and obviously, it sounds like it\u2019s coming from the independent operators. As we think through the long-term impacts of that, how long can the independents keep losing share before we start to see maybe a more rapid pace of independent store closures or how do you think that longer term, what are the impacts of that as you keep gaining the share from that base? Thanks. Bill Rhodes : Well, that\u2019s a terrific question. I have been in this industry for over 25 years and I have seen the consolidation happen and AutoZone was a significant participant of it in the late \u201890s all the way through 2008 or so. On the commercial side, this consolidation is much more challenging. On the retail side of the business, everybody was looking for geographic expansion and we could all take reasonably the same size boxes and over time turn them into our standard prototypes. On the wholesale side, it\u2019s not as easy. We don\u2019t need the wholesaler\u2019s inventory. We don\u2019t need their distribution. We don\u2019t need their locations. We need their customers and is there more efficient ways for us to get their customers by winning in the marketplace is what we have learned over time. We did great team step our toe into the water with our acquisition of IMC and that didn\u2019t work out very well for us. We believe our strategy and approach to -- approach in the market will win over time. If you look at what we have done in some of our close-in competitors, we have all substantially changed our inventory assortments over the last five years to 10 years. We have all built really strong sales forces and we are continuing to chip away at some of the competitive differentiation that was in the marketplace. I think that that\u2019s what\u2019s happening with share over time. These companies, many of the independents, they are not working for a return on the capital though. They are working for their salaries and so what happens them over time, I think, they have longer staying power than other enterprises would. So I think it will take time but I do think that there\u2019s a lot of pressure on independent operators in this commercial side of the business today and that\u2019s not going to let up. Daniel Imbro : Great. Thanks so much for the color and best of luck. Bill Rhodes : You bet. Thank you. Operator : I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Bill Rhodes. Bill Rhodes : Okay. Before we conclude the call, I want to take a moment to reiterate that we believe our industry is very strong and our business model is solid. We will take nothing for granted as we understand our customers have alternatives to shopping with us. We will continue to focus on the basics as we strive to optimize shareholder value in FY 2021. Thank you for your time and thank you for your interest in our great company. Stay safe and be well. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation.

With me today are Bill Giles, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer; Jamere Jackson, Chief Financial Officer-elect; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax. Regarding the first quarter, I hope you've had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not, the press release, along with slides complementing our comments today, are available on our website, www.autozone.com under the Investor Relations link. Please click on quarterly earnings conference calls to see them. Since our last earnings release in late September, much of the world\u2019s intention remains focused on COVID-19, including its current and future implications for communities, businesses and markets. These times remain extraordinary for all of us. From the start of the pandemic through this quarter, our team has had to deal with challenges unlike any we have seen in our company\u2019s history. While at the start of the pandemic our sales dipped, we performed quite well once economic stimulus was implemented in the U.S. and Americans began to drive more. By mid-April, our business began to strengthen and reached an apex last quarter when we reported 21.8% same-store sales, the best same-store sales performance in our company\u2019s rich history. For this quarter, ending in late November, we are proud to report 12.3% same-store sales, another historically strong performance. While last quarter\u2019s sales were more consistent, particularly across the first 12 weeks of the 16-week quarter, this quarter was a bit less so. Considering the meaningful volatility resulting from the pandemic and economic responses, we are sharing our same-store sales cadence for equal-week period of the quarter. We were up 16.5%, then up 11.4%, ending up 8.8% in the last four weeks. The deceleration appears to be related to a combination of normal seasonality and how far away we work from the benefits of economic stimulus. This quarter\u2019s traffic was far more beneficial to same-store sales than ticket growth by quite a wide margin. When we talked in September, we could not have effectively forecasted our growth for this quarter\u2019s same-store sales, albeit we would have been much closer than we would have forecast in Q4 at the beginning of that quarter. We are continuing to learn as we go. In Q1, we felt we would see substantial above-normal growth, but we wouldn\u2019t have thought double-digit same-store sales. Our number one priority continues to be the health, safety and wellbeing of our customers and our AutoZoners. Throughout the pandemic, we have continued to follow the myriad of national, state and local mandates and ordinances and have always kept close tabs of the CDC guidelines. We require mask entering our facilities, perform questionnaires of our team and take many other safeguards like enhanced cleaning protocols, providing mask, hand sanitizers and other PPE to our AutoZoners to ensure safe shopping and work environments. Last quarter, we talked about the pressure our supply chain was experiencing to make sure we were in-stock and replenishing the stores on a timely basis. I\u2019m very happy to say, today, we feel we\u2019ve made significant progress in this area. Our in-stocks are much improved and our supply chain in most of our vendor partners have done an exceptional job reacting to the unprecedented surge in volumes that have now lasted six-plus months. The progress has been significant, but at the end of the quarter, we had only closed about half of the gap from our depths to our normal levels of in-stock. To provide a little more color on the drivers of our sales performance this quarter, I\u2019ll remind you that we were anxious to see what would happen as we got further away from the enhanced unemployment benefits. While the initial stimulus package ended at the end of July, there were still funds being distributed on a state-by-state basis at lower levels this fall. As you recall, last quarter we reported finishing the quarter with comp sales running up 16.5%. And you can see we remain strong for this quarter. While our enhanced sales growth declined over the quarter to still historically high levels, we believe the noise around the election, the reemergence of COVID in many areas and the beginnings of seasonal weather patterns hurt food traffic particularly in the last four-week period. While it remains extremely hard to predict sales performance in the near-term, we believe the fundamentals of our business remain quite strong. During the quarter, there were certainly some geographic regions that did better than others as there always are, but all of our regions performed well. And I could not be more proud to say that based on the retail sales for customer segment data we have, we continue to experience historically unprecedented share gains, historically unprecedented share gains. The data shows the industry has been growing in the high-single digits and our sales have been growing at close to double that rate for these categories. While we are thrilled to have these share gains today, our charge is to determine how we maintain them. I am sure many of you would like to know how we are thinking about sales for both the second quarter and the balance of fiscal 2021. I\u2019ll remind you that typically in recessionary environments, our business is remarkably resilient. However, nothing about this global pandemic is typical. There are simply too many remaining unknowns, like will the Federal Government pass the second round of stimulus? And when will the vaccine be distributed? And how effective will it be? What consumer behaviors have changed temporarily? Which ones have changed permanently? All of this creates uncertainty. But our focus on execution remains the same. Beyond our primary objective to ensure the safety of our customers and AutoZoners, our focus is on providing our AutoZoners with the resources they need to provide our customers with an exceptional shopping experience. For the long-term, we\u2019ve remained bullish on the health of our industry. And as the economy enters a deep and protracted recessionary environment, we continue to believe our customers will focus more on maintaining their current vehicles. These time periods have benefited our business in the past, retail in particular, as it has in the last three recessions. Last quarter, I reminded folks the strongest periods we experienced of outsized sales growth over the last three decades have been the early 90s, 2001-2002, 2009, 2010 and 2011, all coming out of recessionary periods. Therefore, we remain optimistic on the industry this upcoming year. Interestingly, after each of these outsized growth periods, they have never been followed by equivalent declines in the years that followed. We believe consumer behaviors changed during these recessionary periods, allowing us to showcase our skills and capabilities to new customers, and we\u2019ve retained many of those customers in the years that followed. I would be remiss if I did not thank our AutoZoners for their exceptional efforts. While I\u2019ll praise our entire organization from our stores to our distribution centers, from the U.S. to Mexico to Brazil at all data and our store support teams, I always owe our thanks to our customers who continue to believe in our capabilities to help them with their automotive needs. I couldn\u2019t be prouder of our team. As usual, I want to especially recognize on behalf of every AutoZoner our store and distribution center AutoZoners. These extraordinary people have been challenged more than they ever could have expected, and they have met every single challenge. Thank you, AutoZoners. You embody everything it means to be an AutoZoner, and you deliver on our cultural and service promises every day. Now let\u2019s move into more specifics on performance for the quarter. Our same-store sales were up 12.3% versus last year\u2019s first quarter. Our net income was $442 million, and our EPS was $18.61 a share, 30.1% above last year. Sales were higher than we forecasted at the beginning of the quarter and certainly higher than historic norms. Both our retail and commercial businesses showed strength in the quarter with DIY same-store sales up approximately 13% and commercial total sales growth of approximately 12%. In commercial, we averaged over $58 million in weekly sales, which was over $11,500 in sales per program per week. While average weekly sales per program decelerated from last quarter, that is normal as we change seasons. Moving forward, we expect our commercial business to show continued strength as we execute on our growth initiatives and gain additional share in this space. I\u2019ll remind you that this is a highly fragmented $75 billion market, and we believe our product and service offerings provide us tremendous opportunity to significantly grow sales and market share over time. While there are some geographical differences this quarter, there continue to be interesting trends across our merchandise categories, particularly in the retail business. Our sales floor categories continue to be strong as we believe people have more time and many have more money. Many parts of the economy are still operating at fractions of their normal capacity : movie theaters, vacation resorts, entertainment venues, hotels and the like. Some Americans have the luxury to, \u201cwork-from-home\u201d, eliminating their commute, and unfortunately, while vastly improved from the early days of the pandemic, unemployment is still twice the pre-pandemic rate. This extra time and for some, extra funds, have been repurposed for that project car or doing that enhancement job our customers have been perpetually putting off. At the same time, while our sales have increased in merchandise categories like brakes, rotors and even motor oil, they aren\u2019t growing as fast as the rest of the categories due to last year\u2019s mild winter and lower current miles driven. We believe miles driven will continue to improve and maintenance parts will increase as miles driven go up. And we know from history that the muted brake and rotor growth is also still being impacted by last year\u2019s very mild winter. As for this year\u2019s winter, all indications we have call for a normal winter. Anything, anything normal in this environment will be welcomed. We expect that our sales growth from the pandemic-related surge will moderate over time. However, we will continue to invest in growth initiatives in both our retail and commercial that position us well for the future. In addition, we continue to believe our products and services will be in high demand during more difficult economic times, and this resiliency gives us significant confidence about our prospects. One thing we are certain of is our team continues to perform at an exceptional level. I\u2019m so proud of them across the enterprise. We remain focused on providing everyone with the support, encouragement and resources they need to live up to our pledge of always putting customers first. Now I\u2019d like to again thank our AutoZoners for their extraordinary efforts during these unprecedented times. In particular, I would like to recognize the tremendous contributions of our store and distribution center AutoZoners and their leaders who have been there for our customers, external or internal, every day since the beginning of the pandemic. I ask each of you listening to this call to stop for a moment and imagine yourself in a public environment five-plus days a week for the last nine months, helping customers while at the same time trying to keep yourself, your teammates, your customers and ultimately your own family safe from the virus. Seriously, seriously stop and think about that. That is exactly what our team has done. Our stores haven\u2019t closed. Our distribution centers are operating at breakneck speed. Thanks to these AutoZoners at our stores and distribution centers for all they\u2019ve done. In the spring, we implemented something innovative and new for all eligible full and part-time hourly AutoZoners and ultimately for our store managers and DC advisors. We offered them emergency-time off or ETO as we call it. In essence, it amounted to two extra weeks of vacation to give them the flexibility to ensure their safety, deal with childcare issues, care for a sick family member or most importantly, stay home, stay home if they were showing any symptoms. It is worth and it\u2019s worked exceptionally well. Many of them have used this benefit while a significant portion have saved it and will receive meaningful payouts should they choose next month, an $800 to $1,600 or more bonus for most of our hourly AutoZoners. When we rolled this new benefit out, as you would expect, we shared that it was a one-time extraordinary benefit. Who knew then that the pandemic would still be racing at the turn of the calendar year? So two weeks ago, we announced our team that we would allow them to carry over any unused ETO or be paid out in January at their election, that every single AutoZoner who has unused normal vacation would be allowed to carry it over six months past the normal deadline. And most importantly, that we would be extending all eligible full and part-time hourly AutoZoners, store managers and DC advisors in the U.S. with another week of ETO at the beginning of the new calendar year. This is an expense that will be recognized in our second quarter of approximately $50 million. And as I\u2019ve told our AutoZoners on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving when I made the announcement, it\u2019s a large expense, but is more importantly a tremendous investment in them and their safety. I\u2019m exceptionally proud to work with a team of leaders and a Board of Directors who ensure we live consistent with our stated values. Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Bill Giles. Bill? William Giles : Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to elaborate on the specifics in our P&L for Q1. For the quarter, total auto parts sales, which includes our domestic, Mexico and Brazil stores, increased 13.1%. For the trailing four quarters ended, total sales for AutoZone store were $1,960,000. This compares to $1,865,000 in Q1 last year. Now let me give a little more color on sales and our growth initiatives. For the first quarter, our domestic do-it-for-me or DIFM sales increased 11.9% to $695 million, another strong quarter for us. In the quarter, sales to our DIFM customers represented 22% of our total sales and increased approximately $75 million from last year\u2019s Q1. Our weekly sales per program were $11,500, up 9.2% on a per-program basis versus $10,600 per week last year. Not only was $11,500 per week the second highest average ever for us, but we were able to average $58 million in total weekly commercial sales, another near record and a tremendous accomplishment for our teams. As you know, commercial sales is an important growth initiative for us, and we are investing in a disciplined way to create a faster growing business. We now have our commercial program in 85% of our domestic stores. This year, we have opened 36 net new programs, finishing with 5,043 total programs as our sales efficiency per store remains at near-record levels. Let me give a little more color on our success in commercial and the growth playbook as we move forward. This past year, we believe we grew share and remain focused on repeating this for FY2021. Fundamentally, we believe that our share gains are underpinned by the investments we made in improving the quality of our parts offering, many in the Duralast brand, improvements in our parts coverage by model year and a commitment to providing exceptional service. These core focus areas have enabled us to drive double-digit sales growth for the past two quarters and position us well in the marketplace. As we move forward, we are focused on several initiatives that we believe will accelerate growth. First, we continue to expand our inventory availability initiatives by adding MegaHub locations. We opened three new MegaHubs this quarter, bringing our total to 47. These stores substantially increase local market availability, and we see a meaningful lift in sales in the markets where they opened. With over 80,000 SKUs or more, we deliver same day and often multiple times per day to stores in MegaHub markets. This means a store can say, yes, we have it significantly more than when they are sourced from a hub that carries 40,000 to 50,000 SKUs. Second, we are improving our service continually by upgrading service levels with our parts professionals and drivers. We are delivering faster, and we are supporting our customers with overall needs better than before. We recently implemented chainwide to the U.S. technology that will significantly improve our delivery times and the accuracy of the commitments that we make to our customers. Third, using our one team approach, we have further integrated our commercial business at our stores where we offer programs. This means that store management and the entire team is focused on driving sales and improving service to our commercial customers. And fourth, we continue to invest in disciplined way in initiatives that make us more competitive in the marketplace and much easier to do business with. We like our growth prospects in commercial and believe our growth initiatives will help us create a faster growing AutoZone. Now Bill gave a lot of color on our DIY business, which I won\u2019t repeat, but I would like to spend a moment on our integrated retail efforts. As COVID\u2019s effect on customers\u2019 ability to get out and shop grew, we\u2019ve ramped up our strategy to enhance the customer shopping experience by meeting customers when, where and how they wanted to shop. This past quarter, we continued to see very strong growth in our buy online, pick-up in-store shopping channel. While our other two options, next day delivery and ship-to-home were also up nicely, our buy online, pick-up in-store offering continued its rapid growth. Pick-up in-store grew faster than our ship-to-home option as customers continue to value interaction with our experienced in-store advisors. While our online sales remain less than 5% of our DIY business, the traffic to the website is a tremendous marketing tool for our in-store business. We remain committed to improving the shopping experience online in order to help customers identify what they need and allow them a quicker in and out experience once they come to our stores for pick-up. Our Mexico stores continue to be impacted by the pandemic. In addition to impacting sales, the weakness in the foreign currency exchange rate put additional pressure on our results. The exchange rate finished the quarter at 20.6 to the dollar and was roughly 6% higher than last year\u2019s first quarter rate. As a result of the devaluation, our total U.S. dollar sales were negatively impacted. During the quarter, we did not open any new stores and finished with 621 stores. While the macro environment has been challenging, we believe we are seeing signs of a turnaround with the Mexican economy. We remain committed to our store opening schedule in Mexico for the foreseeable future. Regarding Brazil, we finished with 45 stores. We opened two new stores in the quarter. Like the U.S. and Mexico, Brazil faced challenges with COVID-19, stay-at-home mandates and foreign exchange headwinds. The Brazilian real devalued roughly 30% for Q1 year-over-year. We view the COVID impact to be short-term in nature for our Brazil stores as well. Our commitment to growing the Brazilian business has not wavered. Now I\u2019ll pass it off to our CFO-elect and the new member of our team, Jamere Jackson, to take us through additional P&L items and our cash flow and balance sheet highlights. But before I do, I would like to personally welcome Jamere to our team. We are also excited to have him here. He has done a very quick study and we all look forward to his valuable contributions for many years to come. Jamere? Jamere Jackson : Thanks, Bill. And let me first say how delighted I am to join AutoZone at this point in my career and the company\u2019s rich history. It\u2019s been a pleasure working with you, and I\u2019m so grateful for the opportunity to lead the world-class Finance & Store Development teams that you\u2019ve built over the years. I\u2019m also fortunate that you\u2019re running through the tape to use a sports analogy which has enabled me to spend valuable time in our stores and distribution centers and learn the business from the ground up. Your track record of building shareholder value as CFO of this company has been impressive. Certainly, not many CFOs post the kind of numbers that you put on the board during your tenure. I wish you enjoy all the best as you write the next chapter. Let me begin on the P&L and gross margins. For the quarter, our gross margin was down approximately 62 basis points. I would categorize the drivers in three buckets. About a third of the pressure is the result of one-time markdowns on COVID-related goods such as hand sanitizer, where we saw a significant slowdown in sales velocity as we moved through the quarter. Another third of the pressure is the result of higher loyalty transactions. As our transaction counts have been up materially the last two quarters, we simply have issued more $20 credits to customers. This has translated into higher sales and profits, but slightly lower margins. Given the share gains we have seen as evidenced by the high single-digit transaction growth that Bill Rhodes mentioned earlier, we are planning for this headwind on gross margins to remain in future quarters. Now, this is a good outcome for our business as we are driving new customers and retention. The remainder of the deleverage was driven primarily by mix and some pricing investments we are making in select merchandise categories to improve our competitive positioning. Our industry remains extremely rational when it comes to pricing. All of the investments we are making suggest that we are growing our DIY and DIFM businesses at roughly double the rate of the overall market or better, and we are committed to capturing our fair share and improving our competitive positioning in a disciplined way. Our primary focus will continue to be growing absolute gross profit dollars in our total auto parts segment. Regarding operating expenses, our team, particularly our store operations and commercial teams, continue to manage our expenses well during these times. Our expenses were up 6% versus last year\u2019s Q1 due to our very strong sales results, and we\u2019re able to leverage operating expenses 222 basis points. Included in this quarter\u2019s expenses were approximately $5.2 million related to emergency-time off and other COVID-related expenses. We believe there will be long-lasting benefits from our decision to provide emergency-time off for the heroic efforts undertaken by our AutoZoners during the pandemic. This is perhaps one of the most important investments we have made, maybe ever. We will continue to manage SG&A in line with sales volumes. Moving to EBIT. EBIT for the quarter was $615 million, up 23% versus the prior year. Our EBIT margin was 19.5%, up 160 basis points versus the prior year\u2019s quarter. Interest expense for the quarter was just over $46 million, up 5.6% from Q1 a year ago. The higher expenses related to the $1.25 billion bond issuance and the $750 million 364-day credit facility, both completed in last year\u2019s third quarter. We are planning interest in the same $47 million range for the second quarter of fiscal 2021 versus $44.3 million in last year\u2019s second quarter. The increase in Q2 is driven by the same reasons noted for Q1. Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was just over $5.5 billion or approximately $228 million above last year\u2019s Q1 ending balance of just under $5.3 million. Our adjusted debt level metric finished the quarter at 1.9x EBITDAR. While in any given quarter we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on debt and equity market conditions, we remain committed to both our investment grade rating and our capital allocation strategy, and long-term share repurchases are an important element of that strategy. For the quarter, our tax rate was 22.2% versus 23.2% in last year\u2019s first quarter. This quarter\u2019s rate benefited 134 basis points from stock options exercised while last year it benefited 33 basis points. Stock option exercises are unpredictable and as such they will affect our tax rate and ultimately our net income and EPS. For the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, we suggest investors model us at approximately 23.5% before any assumption on credits due to stock option exercises. Because we cannot effectively predict this activity, we remain committed to reporting the stock option impact on the tax rate. Moving to net income and EPS. Net income for the quarter was $442 million, up 26.3% versus last year\u2019s first quarter. Our diluted share count of 23.8 million shares was lower by 2.9% from last year\u2019s quarter. The combination of these factors drove earnings per share for the quarter to $18.61, up 30.1% over the prior year\u2019s first quarter. Now I\u2019ll move to cash flow. For the first quarter, we generated $683 million of operating cash flow. This was up approximately $236 million over last year\u2019s Q1. Our operating cash flow results were driven by the exceptionally strong earnings that Bill mentioned earlier and working capital. Net fixed assets were up 3% versus last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $113 million and reflected the spending to open 41 net new stores this quarter, investments in existing stores, hubs and MegaHubs and information technology investments. With the new stores opened, we finished this past quarter with 5,924 stores in the U.S., 621 stores in Mexico and 45 in Brazil for a total store count of 6,590. For fiscal year 2021, we expect to get back to our usual cadence of approximately 150 domestic stores and roughly 50 international stores. Depreciation totaled $89.6 million in the quarter versus last year\u2019s expense of $89.7 million. We repurchased $678 million of AutoZone stock in the quarter versus $450 million last year. At quarter end, we had $117.6 million remaining under our share buyback authorization. Regarding our balance sheet, our debt was flat with last quarter, and our cash and cash equivalents remain significantly higher than historical levels. We now have over $1.7 billion in cash on the balance sheet, of which $1.5 billion is excess cash. Our liquidity position remains strong as we have both a multiyear and a 364-day credit facility totaling $2.75 billion that remains untapped. We are also managing our inventory well as our inventory per store growth was up 1.2% versus Q1 last year. Inventory per store was $702,000 versus $694,000 last year and $683,000 last quarter. Total inventory increased 3.7% over the same period last year, driven by new stores and improved product assortment. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable, on a per location basis, was negative $99,000 versus negative $71,000 last year and negative $104,000 last quarter. As a result, accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 114.1% versus last quarter\u2019s Q1 of 110.3%. Now let me spend a few minutes on capital allocation and our share repurchase program. This past quarter, we restarted our share repurchase program. As we mentioned on our last quarter\u2019s call, we expected to gradually restart our buyback program during the first quarter. We said that we intended to utilize our ongoing free cash flow to buyback stock and based on our view of the future, begin methodically utilizing some of the excess cash we currently have on our balance sheet. As we said last quarter, if we have concerns about the near-term, we will simply temporarily suspend repurchases again, but we feel comfortable with our ongoing strategy. This past quarter, we spent $678 million on stock repurchases, representing 584,000 shares. We remain confident in our near-term plans and as such expect to systematically reduce the level of cash and cash equivalents on hand through the remainder of this fiscal year and return meaningful and historically unprecedented amounts of cash to shareholders as part of our disciplined capital allocation strategy. To wrap up, we had a very strong quarter, highlighted by exceptionally strong comp sales which drove a double-digit increase in net income and EPS. We remain confident in our ability to drive long-term shareholder value by, first, investing in our growth initiatives, driving robust earnings and cash and returning excess cash to our shareholders. I\u2019ll remind you that our business remains remarkably resilient through the cycles, and the investments we are making today in our products and services position us well in the near and long-term. Let me give you just a few initial impressions of my short time here in the CFO chair. This is a tremendous business with an incredibly bright future. We have a world-class leadership team with deep domain expertise and a passion for winning in the marketplace. I have experienced first-hand the dedication and heroic actions of our AutoZoners in the stores and distribution centers, and as a long-time customer, I know that they are the reason why we are delivering exceptional results. And finally, our execution on our growth initiatives give me great confidence in our ability to grow our business and build tremendous value for our shareholders. Now I will turn it back to Bill Rhodes. William Rhodes : Thank you, Jamere and welcome. These continue to be unique and abnormal times, and they require us to look at many things differently to manage our business day-to-day. I\u2019m extraordinarily proud of our team across the Board for their commitment to servicing our customers, the motoring public, but doing so in a very safe manner. While we are learning how to operate effectively in these times, we remain wary of the volatility that can exist, volatility in both the U.S. and our international markets. We are fortunate to have extraordinary people who are committed to servicing our customers and helping them get to work, go see their families or simply get back and forth to school. Our operating theme this year is AutoZone is strong, and I\u2019m honored to say we have come together this year to live this theme like never before. While it\u2019s impossible for us to know what the cadence of the new year sales will be, I want to be crystal clear. We plan conservatively in order to manage our cost structure appropriately. While our domestic retail business continues to do very well, we understand trends will slow in the future. But we believe we have a tremendous ongoing opportunity within our domestic commercial business. While we understand these things, we also feel we are well positioned for continued future share gain opportunities across all the business segments we operate. Our business continues to do very well, but as always we have work to do as we start calendar 2021. First and foremost, our focus will be on keeping our AutoZoners and customers safe, while providing our customers with their automotive needs. Secondly, we must continuously challenge ourselves during these extraordinary times to position our company for even greater future success. We will ultimately be measured by what our future cash flows will look like three to five years from now. Lastly, I continue to be bullish on our industry, and in particular, bullish on AutoZone. Before we proceed to Q&A, I want to take the liberty to publicly thank two exceptional leaders. Over 37 years ago, Bill Hackney followed in his father\u2019s footsteps and joined this extraordinary enterprise. And over those 37-plus years, Bill leveraged his knowledge of virtually every part of this business and his deep understanding of our customers to our and our customers\u2019 benefit. He will be missed. And almost 15 years ago, Bill Giles traded home goods for auto parts, and boy, weren\u2019t we fortunate. I\u2019ve had the honor to partner with Bill ever since he joined the company. How many CEOs have the privilege to host 59 consecutive earnings release calls with the same world-class CFO. Bill has been a great team member and advisor for our entire organization, and we thank you, Bill. While we will miss both of them, as our Founder\u2019s father J.R. Hyde Jr., often said, \u201cNo individual builds a business, they build an organization, and the organization builds the business\u201d. Both of these AutoZoners for life have embraced that mentality and built tremendous teams. We wish you and your families the best of luck in your next chapter and thank you for all you\u2019ve done for each of us. Now I'd like to open up the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now start the Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Bret Jordan with Jefferies. You may go ahead, sir. Bret Jordan : Hey. Good morning, guys. William Rhodes : Good morning, Bret. Bret Jordan : I guess a little more follow-up on the market share gains. It seems like the second quarter you guys have been picking share up. Could you maybe give us some color both on the commercial and DIY side? Where you're seeing the share donors? And I guess the follow-up question would really be on sustainability. If you're picking up share from WDs given your higher in-stocks, do you see that share sustaining in the sense that those customers stay with you as the WD bring inventory backup? I guess, is your position higher on the call list relatively defensible? Thank you. William Rhodes : Thank you for the question Bret. On the commercial side of the business, you've seen the publicly available numbers and I think first of all, we're at the top of the heap in both the retail and commercial businesses with our public peers. So I think we're doing very well there. Regarding your specific question on WDs, clearly during the worst of times back in Q3, we were in a very different position than some of our smaller competitors. They really shut things down, many of them closed or work reduced hours had less inventory and the like. And I think that that gave us a real opportunity to introduce ourselves and be there for certain customers, that maybe we didn't have the same relationship before. As we've said many, many times the commercial part of this business certainly is a relationship business. And when you're there for customers, you build up some credibility that you can leverage for a long time. So I think that's the bigger issue rather than them getting back to where their normal operating procedures are, that we were there in people's times of need. And I think that people have long memories about that. On the retail side of the business, again, I think we're performing at the highest level of any of our public peers. But I also think that there are other parts of the channel, other channels in the retail sector, mass and online that we did particularly well against during this period of time and continue to do so. Again, I think, is it sustainable or not? That's the biggest charge that we have as a management team. We have this opportunity to introduce ourselves to new customers. And as we said in our prepared remarks, much of our business growth in the retail business is coming from existing customers who are doing more business with us. And I think it's very encouraging that we're \u2013 they're participating with us in different categories than they normally do. And so we feel very good about that. Bret Jordan : Yes. On the DIFM, on the commercial side, I guess the WDs historically had strong relationships, but might not have had inventory at a point in time. And I guess as their inventory balance has come back up, I guess my real question is, do you see any shift in the cadence of your share gains? Or the WD is becoming more effective competitors or you really holding all of the share that you picked up in the downturn? William Rhodes : Yes. I wish I had better information to answer that question, Bret. We have very specific information on the sales floor categories in our retail business. We don't have that level of information on the commercial business. So we have to \u2013 like everybody else look pretty much at the topline numbers and try to extrapolate from there, but we feel like we're doing well. I can't tell you how the WDs are doing as a whole. Bret Jordan : Okay. Great. Thank you. William Rhodes : Yes. Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. You may go ahead. Simeon Gutman : Hey. Good morning, everyone. And I wish Bill Giles a good send-off again. I think we did it last quarter, but there was a nice message from Bill Rhodes. My first question is on price. I think we've talked about investing in price a little more prominently in the last couple of quarters. Can we talk about the rationale? Any specific areas you're trying to address? Is it price spreads online? Is it DIY, DIFM? And then can you talk big picture around the elasticity of demand? I'm assuming it's not for short-term gains because a lot of the demand is failure base, but how do you think about that? Jamere Jackson : Yes. This is Jamere. What I'll say is a couple of things. First of all, we control our own destiny here. In the results, as it relates to our gross margins, are not a result of cost pressures or pricing spirals within the industry. What we're doing is, we're investing in a disciplined way to improve our competitive positioning. We're improving our overall profitability. And in many ways the productivity we're achieving in operating expenses serves as a bill payer for some of the investments that we're making. What I'll say about pricing is that we're making decisions on pricing, merchandising and investments based on data and discipline. And these are decisions that are resulting in both share gains and higher overall earnings. So I like the playbook that we have as it relates to the pricing. Simeon Gutman : Okay. Thanks for that. Let me ask maybe a follow-up on stock buyback. I think you mentioned, you may exceed, I guess historic levels. And I think the last amount that you purchased was something in the $2 billion category or $2 billion level on a peak basis. So I mean, is there any way are you planning to eclipse that target? And then, would you take up your leverage short-term? Would it have any impact vis-\u00e0-vis the rating agencies? Can you take your leverage up to buyback an outsized amount? Jamere Jackson : Yes. So let me say this. I mean, this is perhaps one of the most powerful free cash flow stories really in all of industry. And the business model that we have enables us to invest in a disciplined way in growth and return meaningful amounts of cash to shareholders in a very consistent and efficient way. And so what we recognized is that, this model is powerful enough from a cash flow standpoint for us to do that investment in a growth of our business and continue along the journey that we've been, returning meaningful amounts of cash and what the free cash flow that we generate. So we don't see a need today to do anything different in terms of leverage and we also don't see a need today to do anything different in terms of moving off the center line that we have for this disciplined capital allocation strategy. Simeon Gutman : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. You may go ahead. Christopher Horvers : Thanks. Good morning, guys. I think Bill, the trade from home furnishings to AutoZone is definitely the trade of the century coming to this organization from Linens N' Things, so congratulations, again. So my question \u2013 two questions. So first on the do-it-for-me side of the business. Your annual run rate is now 600,000 per program per year. A couple of years ago you were sub 500. And so you look at your peers there in this 800-plus type range. I guess how do you think about getting to that level? Do you think that the service changes, the parts availability changes, the MegaHub strategy and the delivery strategy are sufficient to sort of keep step functioning up to that level of productivity? William Rhodes : Yes. Chris, thank you for the question. A lot of attention gets focused on our close end competitors and rightfully so, and they both outperform us on a sales per program basis and have for a long time. I'm really pleased with what our team has been able to do to begin closing that gap. But we really don't want to get too focused on our close end competitors. We want to think about the industry as a whole. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, it's a $75 billion market. It is incredibly fragmented, much more so fragmented than the retail side of the business. So I want to make sure that we're focused on the entire market, not our close end competitors. If you look back over the history of time, what our team has been able to do has really helped us as you've noted, accelerate our growth in a significant way. We've vastly improved our inventory assortments in every individual store, particularly as it relates to commercial oriented vehicles. We have this hub and MegaHub strategy, which we are rolling out and continue to outperform, particularly the MegaHubs. Every time we talk about the MegaHubs, we talk about that they have outperformed our expectations. We now have built this fabulous brand called the Duralast brand, which five to seven years ago, people thought it was an inhibitor to our success. Now, everybody else sees it as a real key part and a leverage point for us in the commercial business. Think about the other national brands at a decade ago were so powerful. Many of them are gone. Those that are still around are less relevant today than they were back then. And now we've also built this really strong salesforce, which we didn't have a decade ago. We're now supplementing all of that with some technology tools that are some of the largest investments that we've made in technology to make our teams more efficient and improve our delivery and reliability. So we're very bullish on what the future is and frankly, pretty proud of the progress that we've made today. Christopher Horvers : Got it. And then in terms of the last four weeks of the quarter, you talked about roughly, an 8.8% in the last four weeks. Some of your peers have talked about disruption in the election week. I was just curious you mentioned that if we took out the election week, would it suggest that, maybe the underlying trend rate is better than that 8.8%. And I'll ask just because we should ask any commentary on what you're seeing so far this quarter? William Rhodes : Perfect. Chris, thanks for getting that normal question in another way. I'll answer it the normal way because we released our earnings so quick in the quarter, so we're two weeks and three days into this quarter. We don't want to talk about what's happening this quarter because we don't want our owners to get focused on two and a half week periods of time. So historically, we have not talked about what's happened inter quarter and we're not going to do that today. We were very specific in showing you what happened in each four-week period during the quarter. We don't generally give that level of clarity either. I want to remind us coming into Q4 that we told you we were up 16.5% in the last four weeks of last quarter. I told you today that we were up 16.5%, the first four-week period. I think a lot of people thought our sales had gone down materially in September, and that wasn't true. Regarding that 8.8 that we had in the last four-week period of time. We were very intentional in saying, yes, the election was going on. We also \u2013 in this period of time, sales are driven up and down based upon weather patterns. We get a cold snap, it can be very positive. We get very rainy weather, it can be very negative. So we've given you the cadence. It's very hard for us to talk about and even understand what the next 12 weeks is going to be like, we don't know. These are unprecedented levels. 12.3% same-store sales is the best performance in this company since I\u2019ve joined the company over 26 years ago. It will slow down over time. How fast that happened? I don't know. But I do know we have an incredibly strong business that regardless will continue to outperform over the long-term. Christopher Horvers : Awesome. Thanks very much. And have a great holiday season. William Rhodes : Yes. You too. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Lasser with UBS. You may go ahead, sir. Michael Lasser : Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Bill and Jamere, congratulations and best of luck to you both. Bill Rhodes in your prepared remarks, you pointed out that during the last 30 years or so, the best \u2013 the periods of strongest growth for the industry have been in during times of recession. And subsequently the year after the industry still didn't come negative, do you think this time is different because what's been driving the industry has been some of the discretionary categories rather than the strengths in maintenance and failure, like happened last time. Because there's a perception out there that the DIY business is going to give back a lot of what it's gained this year, when consumers get back out and do what they've been doing previously and because of AutoZone mix of business, it will have \u2013 it'll be the most sensitive to softness in the DIY segment whenever that happened? William Rhodes : Well. Really terrific question, Michael. Yes, this time is different. There's no question about it. I\u2019ve said it \u2013 I\u2019ve just said it. This is the second best quarter since I've been at the company. The best quarter was last quarter. Will we be able to comp 21.8% same-store sales in Q4? I highly doubt it. Will we give some of that back? Absolutely. The question is, will we give it all back? Are we introducing ourselves to new customers? Or introducing existing customers to new categories for us? Are we kind of standing in that gap for customers? I think we are. And I think we're going to build loyalty with our customers over the long-term. My real question for us is if we had this pandemic, what would our sales have been two years from now? I'm sorry, there's a train outside of the room. If we had this pandemic and you moved forward two years from now and we have 2%, 3%, 4% increase in business that we would have had the pandemic not happen. I think that's a distinct possibility. And if we do, I think we'd be very pleased with that. Michael Lasser : Got it. The train is a good euphemism for suggesting that. AutoZone is going to keep chugging along. So that's helpful. William Rhodes : You are always good at those kinds of things, Michael. It is light and it's not a train usually. Michael Lasser : Okay. The follow-up is on the gross margin. So it's been down two quarters in a row. There's a perception that this might be the beginning of a longer-term trend, particularly if AutoZone chooses to use some of the flexibility it has on the SG&A side to go and reinvest that into the price or other gross margin driving initiatives. So a), is that true? And b), there's a lot of well-documented pressure on labor, so do you lose some of the flexibility? Or do you foresee losing the flexibility if we treat some other factors that are driving your cost of labor, hurt that side of your P&L? Thank you very much. William Giles : I would just jump in and say that look from a gross perspective, it's down two quarters in a row, but frankly, a big chunk of this one was one-time. So you've got a little bit of pressure on some of the things that Jamere pointed out, for example, on loyalty. That's a great example of the fact that to follow on what Bill was talking about, is that we're seeing a tremendous amount of traffic and therefore we're seeing a tremendous amount of new and existing customers. Our existing customers are visiting us more and they're building up more loyalty points. That's fantastic. As we talk about pricing and think about pricing and we're going to be incredibly surgical about it. As Jamere said, it's going to be very data-driven. And at the end of the day, this is about driving gross profit dollars. Ultimately that is what we are most focused on is driving dollars. And as you can see, we're improving operating margin overall because we're leveraging our fixed cost structure based on the sales that we are generating from all of our activities and pricing is just a small example of one of those activities. But I think overall, the way I think about it is, look, I think our gross margin is very healthy. I think it's completely in our control. We have opportunities to improve and reduce our cost through importing, increasing our importing, lowering our acquisition cost. And as Jamere pointed out, we have an opportunity to be surgical about how we price. And so I think there's a lot of pluses and minuses in gross margin. And right now, they're all working to drive sales and drive profits. Jamere Jackson : And the only thing I'll add is, you've talked a little bit about operating expenses and wage pressure. You saw this last quarter, our teams did an outstanding job of really driving productivity and we run the productivity play with intensity inside the company, and we've been able to manage our labor costs sort of in line with volume. There will be pockets of wage pressure, as you mentioned in certain regions, but quite frankly, we're committed to investing in our AutoZoners regardless of what happens with the regulatory environment. And quite frankly, that's one of the reasons why we're so good at driving productivity inside of the company. So again, we control our own destiny as it relates to these things and we're going to invest in a disciplined way to move the needle on earnings as a whole. Michael Lasser : Understood. Thank you so much and good luck. William Rhodes : Thank you, Michael. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew McClintock with Raymond James. You may go ahead, sir. Matthew McClintock : Hi. Thanks, everyone. And honestly amazing results, so I don't even know what to say. Good job guys. The whole team\u2026 William Rhodes : Thank you. Matthew McClintock : Jamere also welcome. Really happy to have you. I can't wait for you to talk more because honestly, this is a great company. So you made a good choice to be honest with you. So at end of the day, my biggest question here is, end of the day, I'm trying to think about your commercial growth was pretty outstanding this quarter and vehicle miles driven is still negative. And I'm trying to think through this because end of the day, are you trying to say that people now are coming back to work? The professionals that normally would go to mechanics are coming back to work and that's why they're starting to go to mechanics. And that's why the commercial business is good or end of the day, the exit rate of what your commercial business is doing right now. Should be pretty higher than what it is right now, if vehicle miles driven increases. So that's kind of \u2013 anything you can say toward that would be very helpful? How you think about the commercial business and the growth you did this quarter given that honestly, it should get better from here? William Rhodes : Yes. Another fantastic question. Thank you. As you look at the commercial business, you're exactly right, that miles driven are down and they\u2019ve been down for a period of time. I would also tell you that another thing that's muting the commercial business is the lack of winter that we had last year. Tire sales were down. Maintenance sales were down, brakes, rotors, which I\u2019ve talked about specifically in the prepared remarks. The other thing that's happening in that sector is the independent part of the sector is performing much better today than the national accounts, if you will. And I think those things will change over time. As you see, we get back into a normal weather pattern, but again, we're having this opportunity to introduce ourselves, particularly to some of these up and down the street accounts at a different level than we have on the past. I don't believe that people are \u201creturning to work\u201d. We don't see it yet in a significant miles driven improvement. It improved vastly in the summertime, but then it's kind of been fairly steady over the recent months we've seen. But I\u2019ll remind you that not all miles driven are the same. So people that are driving to work in some of these urban cores, generally aren't our core customer. Our core customer has not had the luxury just like our AutoZoners that are in the stores and the distribution centers. Our core customer doesn't have the luxury to work from home. They're doing manual labor. They're providing service economy kind of jobs. And so I don't think that our core customers really seen a significant change in their driving behaviors. Matthew McClintock : So if I could follow-up on that and just ask this question, just because you've made so many investments in the commercial business, and I agree you guys are very good in DIY, right? But because you made so much investment in the commercial business over the years, isn't that a sticky business? And doesn\u2019t that kind of imply that next year? The comparisons aren't that difficult because once somebody goes to you, they kind of don't go back. Is that a fair way to think about this? William Rhodes : I think it's a very fair way to think about it. And I'll just remind you, when we got serious about the commercial business was 2008. We were doing about $750 million annually at that point in time. In the last 12 years, we've more than tripled the business, getting close to quadruple in the business. And it's been pretty darn sticky along the way. That's certainly our hope. And as we're launching many of these new initiatives that are only going to amplify our service advantage, as we've now shored up our inventory assortments, we\u2019ve built this brand and we've got somebody telling our story and our salesforce, we feel pretty good about the future. Will it be a straight line? No, it never is. But we've had a pretty strong trajectory over the last 12 years of growing that business much faster than the industry has grown. Matthew McClintock : Look, guys, I really appreciate the color. Thank you very much. William Rhodes : Thank you. Appreciate it. William Rhodes : All right. Before we conclude the call, I want to take a moment to reiterate, we believe our industry is strong and our business model is solid. We'll take nothing for granted as we understand our customers have alternatives to shopping with us. We're excited about our growth prospects for the year. We do not take anything for granted as we understand our customers have alternatives. We have an exciting plan that should help us succeed this fiscal year, but I want to stress that this is a marathon and not a sprint. As we continue to focus on the basics and focus on optimizing long-term shareholder value, we are confident AutoZone will continue to be successful. We thank you for participating in today's call and we'd like to wish our AutoZoners and everyone on the call, a very happy and most important, a healthy holiday season and a prosperous new year. Thank you very much. Have a great day. Operator : And thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may go ahead and disconnect at this time.",

Okay. Well, good morning and thank you for joining us today for AutoZone\u2019s 2021 second quarter conference call. With me today are Jamere Jackson, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer Investor Relations and Tax. Regarding the second quarter, I hope you\u2019ve had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter\u2019s results. If not the press release along with slides complementing our comments today are available on our website, www.autozone.com under the Investor Relations link. Please click on quarterly earnings conference calls to see them. To start off this morning, I'll spend some time talking about our sales results, trends over the 12 weeks, merchandise categories that drove our performance, and any regional discrepancies. As I said in our press release this morning, we could not deliver the kind of results we had without the heroic efforts of our store and supply chain AutoZoners. While classified as essential workers, essential seems insufficient to describe their remarkable contributions to our company, our customers and our results. Our AutoZoners have really stepped up during the pandemic and been nothing short of exceptional. And our top priority remains being committed to providing all of our AutoZoners with a safe work environment. To be sure to, so they can help our customers. While Jamere, we'll talk more about this when he discusses the investments we've been making. I will say the additional Emergency Time Offer or ETO we offered is something we just knew was the right thing to do for our AutoZoners. Thank you AutoZoners again. Okay. Let's turn to our sales results. Our overall comp sales were up 15.2% this quarter, our growth rates for retail and commercial were both strongest quarter. With retail comps being slightly stronger than commercial, commercial came on strong at the end of the quarter and comps similarly to retail for the last four weeks. Let's review our sales cadence. We told you on our last call we ran an 8.8% comp for the last four weeks of Q1. In the first four weeks of this quarter. Our sales accelerated to a 10.7% comp. As the holidays arrived, we saw further acceleration, which was sustained for the balance of the quarter. We ran a 17.5% comp pretty consistently over the last eight weeks of the quarter. This quarter's traffic versus ticket growth was pretty close to split down the middle, although ticket was slightly stronger. It was encouraging us - for us to see sales, inflect upward starting in January with both ticket and traffic moving higher. Our ticket growth was stronger this quarter due to hard part sales mixing higher than what we experienced in the first quarter. Our number one priority continues to be the health, safety and well being of our customers and our AutoZoners. Throughout the pandemic, we continue to follow all the national, state and local mandates and ordinances, and have always kept close tabs on the CDC guidelines. We continue to require masks entering our facilities perform questionnaires of our team members and take many other safeguards like enhanced cleaning protocols, providing masks, hand sanitizers and other PPE to our AutoZoners to ensure safe shopping and work environments. And just last week, we announced that we would provide every AutoZoner with a $100 reward once they completed their vaccination for COVID-19. That's every AutoZoner, including part-timers. This is just the next logical step in our efforts to provide a safe, working and shopping environment. I continue to be inspired by our Board and our management team's commitment to doing what is right, putting safety first. You see, our values and our culture have been in full force and effect over the last year in this pandemic. Addressing our supply chain, we've done a solid job with handling the extra demand, and our in-stock levels have continued to improve. To provide a little more color on industry drivers of our sales performance this quarter, I remind you that we were anxious to see what would happen as we go further and further away from the enhanced unemployment benefits that ended last July. In the first week of January, over $100 billion of stimulus was distributed to Americans. The majority of these funds was for the onetime checks as part of the $600 billion stimulus package passed in late December. While smaller in size than the April disbursements, we did see our business pick up nicely, and our sales remained elevated throughout the remainder of the quarter. While we continue to be encouraged with the current selling environment, we feel any additional stimulus should lead to a strong sales environment. During the quarter, there were certainly some geographic regions that did better than others as there always are. Across both our retail and commercial customer bases, we saw the majority of the country perform well, with the Midwest and Northeastern markets underperforming the others pretty consistently. Again, these markets, which represent just over 25% of our store base, were solid but not as strong as the remaining markets. For example, the spread in comp sales between these markets and the others was approximately 300 basis points for the quarter. We believe the separation was due to lingering effects of a mild winter last year and colder weather happening later this winter. But winter did come this year. Boy, did it? And the performance gap closed. So we are encouraged about the summertime and believe we won't have to discuss why mild winter affected comp sales during our upcoming fourth quarter. And I could not be more proud to say that based on the retail sales data we have for our industry, we continue to experience historically unprecedented share gains. The data shows the industry has been growing in the mid single-digit range, with our sales closer to three times, the industry's growth rate. While we are thrilled to have these share gains now, our charge remains to maintain them heading into the spring and summer months. I'm sure many of you would like to know how we're thinking about sales for both the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2021. I'll remind you that typically in recessionary environments, our business is remarkably resilient. However, nothing about this global pandemic is typical. Beyond our primary objective to ensure the safety of our customers and AutoZoners, our focus is on providing our AutoZoners with the resources they need to provide our customers with an exceptional shopping experience. We are optimistic about the sales environment heading into the third fiscal quarter, but we will obviously have a much more difficult comparison in the fourth fiscal quarter as last year's fourth quarter benefited from the April 2020 stimulus package. For now, it remains difficult for us to predict sales for the remainder of the year. This is especially true for the fourth quarter of this year when we were up against the fourth quarter of previous year's 21.8% comp store sales growth. While we continue to expect our sales growth will moderate over time, we believe our products and services will be in high demand during these more difficult economic times. Over the long term, if the economy enters a deep and protracted recessionary environment, we continue to believe our customers will focus more on maintaining their current vehicles. These time periods have benefited our business in the past, retail in particular, as it has in the last three recessions. Last quarter, we reminded you the strongest periods we'd experienced of outside sales growth over the last three decades have been the early 1990s, 2001 and 2002, 2009, 2010 and 2011, all coming out of recessionary environments. Therefore, we remain optimistic on the industry this upcoming year. Interestingly, after each of those outsized growth periods, they have never been followed by equivalent declines in the years that follow. We believe consumer behaviors changed during these recessionary periods, allowing us to showcase our skills and capabilities to new customers, and we retained many of those customers in the years that followed. Now let's move into more specifics on our performance for the quarter. Our same-store sales were up 15.2% versus last year's second quarter. Our net income was $346 million. And our EPS was $14.93 a share, 20.5% above last year. Sales were higher than we forecasted at the beginning of the quarter and certainly higher than historic norms. Both our retail and commercial businesses showed strength in the quarter, with DIY same-store sales up approximately 16% and commercial total sales growth of approximately 15%. For commercial, we averaged over $53 million in weekly sales, which was over $10,500 in sales per program per week. While average weekly sales per program decelerated from last quarter that is normal as the winter months are lower selling months for us. Moving forward, we remain very encouraged with what we are doing within our commercial business. The initiatives we have in place are helping our sales. I'll remind you that, this is a highly fragmented $75 billion market, and we believe our product and service offerings provide us a tremendous opportunity to significantly grow sales and market share over time. While there were some geographical differences this quarter, there continue to be interesting trends across our merchandise categories, particularly in the retail business. Our sales force categories continue to be strong, with categories like tools, antifreeze, small repair and floor mats showing strength. But our hard parts business definitely picked up. In fact, our hard parts business comped in line with our sales floor for the quarter. This is the first quarter since the pandemic began where we saw our hard grow in line with sales force. Our business improved in many merchandize categories such as batteries, categories like brakes and rotors are not comping as high as the overall business. We believe this performance gap with certain categories will close as miles driven continue to improve. As for this year's winter, it was late arriving, but it did arrive. Overall, we view the winter as not having a material impact on our upcoming spring and summer business one way or the other. We expect that our sales growth from the pandemic-related surge will moderate over time. However, we will continue to invest in growth initiatives in both our retail and commercial that position us well for the future. In addition, we continue to believe our products and services will be in high demand during more difficult economic times, and this resiliency gives us significant confidence about our prospects. On last quarter's call, we announced we would be expensing additional payroll during the second quarter. The additional expense was to provide our AutoZoners with more emergency time-off. While this is the second time in our history, we've offered ETO benefits, we believe it is the least we could do to support our AutoZoners in the field. This extra time-off award has been enthusiastically embraced by our team. Our AutoZoners have the right to use the benefits to address medical emergencies, take time off to get the vaccine, take additional paid vacation time-off or wait until the end of the calendar year and get paid what remains in their incremental paid vacation bank. In January, we paid out $31 million to AutoZoners who didn't utilize the ETO we offered them back in March of 2020. I have to tell you, it was an honor to provide these AutoZoners with sizable checks in recognition of their heroic efforts. We feel this is a very important investment in our AutoZoners and in their safety. I'm exceptionally proud to work with a team of leaders and a Board of Directors who ensure we live consistent with our stated values. Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Jamere Jackson. Jamere? Jamere Jackson : Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As Bill mentioned, we had another outstanding quarter. Our growth initiatives are delivering and the heroic efforts of our AutoZoners in our stores and distribution centers are driving exceptional results. To start this morning, let me take a few minutes to elaborate on the specifics in our P&L for Q2. For the quarter total auto parts sales, which includes our domestic Mexico and Brazil stores were $2.9 billion, up 16%. For the trailing four quarters ended, total sales per AutoZone store were just over $2 million. This compares to just under $1.9 million in Q2 last year. Now let me give a little color on sales and our growth initiatives. Starting with our commercial business. For the second quarter, our domestic DIFM sales increased 14.7% to $639 million. Sequentially, commercial growth was nearly three points higher than Q1. In the quarter, sales to our commercial customers represented 22% of our total sales, and our weekly sales per program were $10,500, up 11.7%. We averaged $53 million in total weekly commercial sales. Internally, we have been executing against our commercial acceleration program where we are focused on building a faster-growing business with disciplined investments in pricing, service, technology and assortment. We have a tremendous market opportunity as we are significantly underpenetrated in this highly fragmented portion of the market. We now have our commercial program in 85% of our domestic stores, and we're focused on building our business with national, regional and local accounts. This quarter, we opened 45 net new programs, finishing with 5,088 total programs. And our sales efficiency per store remained at near-record levels as we leveraged our DIY infrastructure and increased our share of wallet with existing customers. Let me be clear, our strategy is working. We believe we grew share and we remain focused on repeating this for the balance of fiscal 2021. Fundamentally, we believe that our share gains are underpinned by the investments we made in improving the quality of our parts, improvements in our assortment and parts covered by model year, more competitive pricing and a commitment to providing exceptional service. These core focus areas have enabled us to drive double-digit sales growth for the past three quarters and position us well in the marketplace. And as we move forward, we are focused on our core initiatives that we believe will accelerate our growth even further. First, our Mega-Hub strategy is improving our parts availability. We opened one more Mega-Hub this quarter, bringing our total to 48 locations, and we expect to open between 7 and 10 more Mega-Hubs by the end of the fiscal year. Given the success of our Mega-Hubs and increasing parts availability and driving meaningful sales lift, we're now raising our target from 75 to 90 mega hubs at build-out to 100 into 110. These stores help us expand coverage and say, yes, we have it more frequently. Second, we are leveraging technology to improve delivery times and service levels. The technology investments we're making in electronic ordering and tracking will significantly improve our delivery times and the accuracy of the commitments that we make to our customers. We're making it simpler to do business with AutoZone, and we're driving efficiency for our sales professionals and drivers. Third, we are committed to being price competitive. We have a laser focus on the key categories where investment and pricing lead to accelerated sales growth and higher EBIT dollars. We're using data science and market intelligence to live up to our pledge to have the best merchandise at the right price. We like the competitive hand that we have in our commercial business and believe we are in the early innings of a transformational growth story. Now Bill gave a lot of color on our DIY business, which I won't repeat, but I would like to spend a moment on our retail acceleration initiatives. We're excited about the gains we're seeing in our DIY share growth. Like the commercial initiatives I mentioned earlier, we are running an intense playbook in DIY that is driving solid results for our business. First, the assortment work and mega hubs strategy that I mentioned earlier drive tremendous benefits to our DIY business. Our investments are improving coverage and availability, leading to a meaningful impact on trial and repeat purchase activity. Second, we continue to focus on improving the customer shopping experience with the work we have done on the digital front. Our efforts in Buy Online Pick-Up In-Store, next-day delivery and ship to home have helped us meet customers win where and how they want to shop. We are investing in technology to continue to improve the customer experience and make it easier to shop our broad array of products. Third and similar to our commercial approach, we have a laser-like focus on being competitively priced in the marketplace. We're using disciplined and sophisticated data analytics to drive pricing decisions in certain categories, categories where we typically compete with non-traditional competitors like mass and online-only sellers in commodities and very slow-moving parts and products. We have tested our approach in key categories and markets, and this effort is yielding increased top line and gross profit dollar growth, albeit at slightly lower gross margins. This is a data-rich environment, and our tools and capabilities give us a meaningful competitive advantage. Again, we're living up to our pledge of having the best merchandise at the right price, and we believe it is helping us create a faster-growing business. Fourth, we simply have a relentless focus on execution. As Bill mentioned, our AutoZoners in our storage and distribution centers have delivered exceptional results in a tough environment. As I said last quarter, perhaps the best investment we have made in our company is the investment in additional emergency time-off. In return, we continue to see our supply chain process record volume and our store AutoZoners handled record store traffic, while still delighting our customers. This focus on execution is a meaningful competitive advantage for us and we're winning in the marketplace. Now let me spend just a few minutes on international. First, we continue to be pleased with the progress we're making in Mexico. During the quarter, we opened seven new stores to finish with 628 stores and our store sales accelerated sequentially. Like last quarter, the exchange rate again played a role in the U.S. dollar equivalent reported sales. The exchange rate finished the quarter at roughly 77% higher than last year's second quarter rate. That's 7% higher than last quarter's second rate. And as a result of the devaluation, our total U.S. dollar sales were negatively impacted. While the macro environment has been challenging, we believe we're seeing signs of a turnaround in the Mexican economy. We remain committed to our store opening schedules in Mexico for the foreseeable future. Regarding Brazil, we opened one new store to finish with 46 stores this quarter. The Brazilian real continues to face headwinds and devalued roughly 25% for Q2 over last year. Long term, Brazil will be an important market for AutoZone and we will invest in a disciplined way. Now let me spend a few minutes on the P&L and gross margins. For the quarter, our gross margin was down approximately 77 basis points. 37 basis points of margin headwind is due to higher supply chain costs, including a onetime benefit last year that did not repeat this year. The remaining 40 basis points came from our pricing initiatives, loyalty program and mix shift. As I discussed above, we're focused on competitive pricing that will drive top line and gross profit dollar gains. To be clear though, the industry's pricing remains rational, and overall, we still have pricing power. We have tested certain categories and taken action when we have the ability to drive both top line and gross profit dollar gains. This is a dynamic market and we remain disciplined in our approach. The strategy is working. We see our work translating into higher sales and profits, as evidenced by the transaction and share growth that Bill mentioned earlier. As we continue to refine our strategy over the next several quarters, we're planning for higher sales and gross profit dollars that outpace the drag from gross margin rate. This is a good outcome for our business as we're driving new customers and retention. All of the investments we are making suggest that we're growing our DIY and DIFM businesses at roughly double the rate of the overall market or better, and we're committed to capturing our fair share and improving our competitive position in a disciplined way. Again, our primary focus will continue to be growing absolute gross profit dollars at a faster than historic rate in our total auto parts operating segment. Regarding operating expenses, our teams, particularly our store operations and commercial teams continue to manage our expenses well in this environment. Our expenses are up 12.5% versus last year's Q2. But included in this quarter's expenses were approximately $40 million related to emergency time-off and other COVID-related expenses, which represented 4.2% of the overall SG&A growth. We believe our decision to provide emergency time-off for the heroic efforts undertaken by our AutoZoners during the pandemic was absolutely the right thing to do. As I said last quarter, this is perhaps one of the most important investments we have made, maybe ever. We will continue to manage SG&A in line with sales volumes. Moving to the rest of the P&L. EBIT for the quarter was $482 million, up 18.1% versus the prior year's quarter. Our EBIT margin was 16.6%, up 32 basis points versus the prior year's quarter. Interest expense for the quarter was just over $46 million, up 4% from Q2 a year ago. The higher expenses related to the $1.25 billion bond issuance and the $750 million 364-day credit facility, both completed in the last fiscal year's third quarter. We are planning interest in the same $46 million to $47 million range for the third quarter of fiscal 2021 versus $47.5 million in last year's third quarter. Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was just over $5.5 billion versus last year's Q2 ending balance of just under $5.5 billion. Our adjusted debt level metric finished the quarter at two times EBITDAR. While in any given quarter, we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on debt and equity market conditions, we remain committed to both our investment-grade rating and our capital allocation strategy. And long term, our share repurchases are an important element of that strategy. Moving to tax, our tax rate was 20.6% versus 17.7% in last year's second quarter. This quarter's rate benefited 265 basis points from stock options exercise, while last year, it benefited 412 basis points. Stock option exercises aren't predictable, and as such, they will affect our tax rate and ultimately our net income and EPS. For the third quarter of fiscal 2021, we suggest investors model us at approximately 23.5% before any assumption on credits due to stock option exercises. Because we cannot effectively predict this activity, we remain committed to reporting the stock option impact on the tax rate. Moving to net income and EPS. Net income for the quarter was $346 million, up 15.6% versus last year's second quarter. Our diluted share count of 23.2 million was lower by 4.1% from last year's second quarter. The combination of these factors drove earnings per share for the quarter to $14.93, up 20.5% over the prior year second quarter. Let me talk a few minutes about our cash flow. For the second quarter, we generated $356 million of operating cash flow. This was up approximately $150 million over last year's Q2. Our operating cash flow results benefited from the strong sales and earnings previously discussed. We repurchased $900 million of AutoZone's stock in the quarter versus $315 million last year. At quarter end, we had approximately $718 million remaining under our share buyback authorization and our leverage metric was two times. Regarding our balance sheet, our debt was flat with last quarter, and our cash and cash equivalents remained significantly higher than historical levels. We now have $1 billion in cash on the balance sheet, of which approximately $830 million is excess cash. Our liquidity position remains strong. We're also managing our inventory well as our inventory per store growth was flat versus Q2 last year. Inventory per store was $715,000 versus $713,000 last year and $702,000 last quarter. Total inventory increased 2.8% over the same period last year, driven by new stores and improved product assortment. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable on a per location basis, was a negative $93,000 versus negative $41,000 last year and negative $99,000 last quarter. As a result, accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 113% versus last year's Q2 of 105.7%. Lastly, I'll spend a moment on capital allocation and our share repurchase program. As you will recall, we restarted our buyback program during the first quarter. We said that we intended to utilize our ongoing free cash flow to buy back stock and based on our view of the future, began methodically utilizing some of the excess cash we currently have on our balance sheet. As we said last quarter, if we have concerns about the near term, we will simply temporarily suspend repurchases again. But we feel comfortable with our strategy and our execution. As I mentioned, we spent $900 million on stock repurchases, representing 752,000 shares. We remain confident in our near-term plans and as such, expect to continue reducing the level of cash and cash equivalents on hand through the remainder of this fiscal year. This will enable us to grow our business and return meaningful amounts of cash to shareholders as part of our disciplined capital allocation strategy. So to wrap up, we had a very strong quarter, highlighted by exceptionally strong comp sales, which drove a double-digit increase in net income and EPS. We remain confident in our ability to drive long-term shareholder value by investing in our growth initiatives, driving robust earnings and cash and returning excess cash to our shareholders. Our growth initiatives are delivering, and this gives me tremendous confidence in our ability to drive significant and ongoing value for our shareholders. And now I'll turn it back to Bill. William Rhodes : Thank you, Jamere, and I have to take a moment and recognize you. Your grasp of the fundamentals of this business in less than six months is extraordinary, and thank you for being here. We're so glad you joined the team. These continue to be unique and extraordinary times and they continue to require us to look at many things differently while managing our business day to day. I'm extraordinarily proud of our team, across the board for their commitment to servicing our customers, the motoring public, but doing so in a very safe manner. While we are learning how to operate effectively in these times, we remain wary of the volatility that can exist, volatility in both the U.S. and our international markets. We are fortunate to have extraordinary people, who are committed to servicing our customers and helping them get to work, go see their families or simply get back and forth to school. They've worked exceptionally well to deliver on our commitments thus far, but we must stay focused and we must continue to deliver. There are no layups. We must continue to innovate and we must continue to execute. Our domestic retail business continues to do tremendously well. We understand trends will slow in the future. We're going to work. We're going to work as hard as possible to gain as much share as possible and limit our headwinds. And we continue to see a tremendous ongoing opportunity within our domestic commercial business. Our business continues to do very well and we are still in the early innings of growth. But as always, we have work to do as we head into our spring selling season. First and foremost, our focus will be on keeping our AutoZoners and our customer's safe while providing our customers with their automotive needs. Secondly, we must continuously challenge ourselves during these extraordinary times to position our company for even greater future success. We will ultimately be measured by what our future cash flows look like three to five years from now. Lastly, I continue to be bullish on our industry, and in particular, on AutoZone. Now, we'd like to open up the call for questions. Operator : Our first question comes from Michael Lasser, UBS. Your line is now open. Michael Lasser : Bill Rhodes, I want you to elaborate a bit on pricing investments and other investments that are being weighting on your gross margin? Do you view this as a temporary condition and once you get - you on the next few quarter your gross margin will stabilize or is this is going to be beginning of a longer-term trend of your gross margin continuing to be down for the foreseeable future? William Rhodes : Well, thank you for the question, Michael. Yes, as you've seen over time, we've been very artful in how we've been able to manage gross margin for not just years but decades. We found some particular specific opportunities where we found places to invest and improve our value proposition to our customers. They're very specific pieces, both in the retail business and the commercial business. I don't know exactly what's going to happen a year from now. Our team is going to continue to innovate. We are constantly raising prices and we are constantly lowering prices, trying to find that sweet spot where our customers value - the value that they're getting the best. So I don't know exactly what it's going to be over the long term. But if you recap and what Jamere said, the gross margin, we had about 40 basis points, which was a onetime negative from last year. So, all the things that were embedded in there, of which price was one of them, accumulated to 40 basis points. Frankly, I'm not that smart to know what the gross margin is going to be within 40 basis points, two or three years from now. Michael Lasser : Okay. And you articulated a lot of confidence that your commercial growth can accelerate this year. How - what's driving you to make that statement? Are you seeing some customer wins that already give you the visibility that it can accelerate? William Rhodes : Yes. We talked, I guess, probably three years ago that we were embarking on a new commercial study, and we developed a new strategy that we began rolling out probably 18 months or so ago. And we're still in the early innings of rolling out that strategy. It has many different elements. I mean, this Hub and Mega-Hub portion of the strategy, which is taking years but it is making a meaningful difference, a very meaningful difference in our ability to say yes to our customers. And it's leaning towards commercial although, it's helping DIY tremendously as well. That's an element of it. We've rolled out new technology in our commercial business. Handheld technology, which allows us to be able to better understand what our delivery times are and manage our delivery times better. We're significantly already reduced our delivery times in the last six months, and we think we have more room to go. We've also enhanced our website, and our ability to communicate and be easy to do business with, with our commercial customers. So I don't think it's - and then, of course, the ongoing evolution and building of the Duralast brand. So it's not one individual issue. It's an amalgamation of all these different issues coming together and improving our competitive position. Not to mention, during the global pandemic and the stay at home and safe at home orders, we were there for our customers, every day. And that allowed us to introduce ourselves at a different level to some customers. And I think that has resulted in stickier long-term relationships. Operator : Our next question comes from Simeon Gutman, Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Simeon Gutman : I think you touched on this in the prepared remarks. Can we talk about price elasticity and some of the investments you're making? I think in the past, there hasn't been a lot of elasticity in price in this category. And can you talk about, the immediacy of some of the reaction you're seeing from consumers? Or is this, 'Hey, we're doing well. We're investing for the future. So the customer, when they come back a year from now or a few quarters from now, we're in a better position.' William Rhodes : Yes. I would say a couple of things. First, as I said in our script, and it's pretty clear from the data that we have. The strategy is working. What we're seeing is the benefits of top line growth. We're seeing our share numbers go up. We're seeing strong traffic. We're seeing ticket. We're seeing unit growth, so all of the metrics point to the fact that the strategy is working. What we're not seeing is we're not seeing a ton of cost pressures that are material. And industry pricing remains rational. So what we're doing is part of this strategy is very surgical. In other words, we're not peanut butter-spreading, price declines across the business, but we're being very surgical using very sophisticated data and analytics. And those are the thing that give us a lot of confidence that what we\u2019re doing makes a lot of sense for the consumer and makes a lot of sense for us. So as we move forward, we're going to continue to lean into this strategy. And our approach is delivered in the marketplace. Listen, I - as I spent time over the last six months or so, I like the competitive hand that we have, if we can continue to delight our customers the way we have over the past year or so, and we live up to the pledge of having the best merchandise at the right price, this will continue to be a win for our shareholders, and we're going to see the results in the bottom line of our business. Simeon Gutman : Okay. And then my follow-up is just on pricing for 2021 or calendar 2021. Are you - what are you seeing in terms of pricing? Can inflation be a bigger driver than it was in prior years? Thank you for that. Jamere Jackson : Well, I mean, our approach on inflation, quite frankly, is to be disciplined. Where we see commodity price inflation, we have to be disciplined enough to take price to recover that. And that's something that we've done over time in the business. What we're seeing today is we don't see any material increases that have us concerned. But if we do, we will be disciplined to make sure that we're taking price to recover those bumps that we see from commodity pricing. So even in an environment where we're trying to be as surgical as we can about the pricing moves that we make, and as Bill said, we're taking price up and price down, where it makes sense for us to take pricing, we do have pricing power and we're disciplined enough to take price where we see commodity inflation. Operator : Our next question comes from Christopher Horvers, JPMorgan. Your line is open. Christian Carlino : It's Christian Carlino on for Chris. Just - it might have been touched on an earlier question. Just wondering on the gross margin outlook, is it going to be 1Q 2022 when you start to lap these higher loyalty redemptions and markdowns, where you start to get flat to up gross margins? And similarly, were there - the one-time impact this year, that was from lapping the supply chain leverage last year, correct? Jamere Jackson : That's right. So as we said, we had about 77 basis points of deleverage this quarter. About 40% of that was related to supply chain costs, and the other roughly 40 basis points is the supply chain costs and the remainder is the initiatives that we talked about. And what I'll say about our outlook in the future is that we're going to continue to lean into the strategy that we have today, because in this environment, what we're seeing is it's working. We're getting top line. We're getting EBIT dollar growth, and we're going to lean into that as we move forward. So we won't be date-certain necessarily about when you'll see an inflection point, because we're in the early innings of this strategy and it's delivering for us. William Rhodes : Let me add to that for just a second, too. You mentioned loyalty. And we don't know what's going to happen to loyalty costs as we go forward. The reason our loyalty costs are up is because our customers are doing more repeat business with us. The biggest part of our growth is coming from existing customers returning to our stores more frequently. We are tickled to death with that. I hope it continues next year and is another pressure point because it means we're gaining additional share, and it's a very profitable share gain for us. Christian Carlino : And then when you think about the lagged impact of the weather, both the better winter weather on whole and the recent events in Texas, these events in Texas hurt in the near term, but you would expect a net positive as we get to the summer? William Rhodes : Absolutely. And yes, you're right. There's a temporary - while people are locked down, our business suffers and suffers significantly, but when things warm up, our business rebounds immediately and for a sustained period of time. More importantly, those conditions put significant incremental wear and tear on certain under-car parts. And there's a lag effect that will typically last nine months or so for us. And it's something we were talking about before the pandemic. The fact that our business was expected to be soft last spring and summer because we had a mild winter. Well, when the pandemic hit, that changed everything. But this year, we shouldn't have to be talking about a mild winter dampening our results in the spring and summer. Operator : Our next question comes from Bret Jordan, Jefferies. Your line is open. Bret Jordan : Talking a little bit about the share gains. And could you maybe bucket for us where you're seeing maybe more or less? Are you seeing more of these share gains from warehouse distributors in the three-step model? Or are you seeing an improving cadence and share gain from two-step peers? Maybe if you could talk about, sort of, where you see the shifts and some of the non-traditional channels on the DIY side as well. William Rhodes : Yes, terrific question. And yes, you have to bifurcate it between what's going on in the retail sector versus what's going on in the commercial sector, both of which we're gaining share two times or three times - we're growing two times or three times faster than the industry growth rates by all indications we have. We have really good data on the retail share gains. We don't have as good a data but we can look at headline growth numbers in the commercial gains. On retail, we are picking up a lot of share from what's traditionally, we believe in the mass channel. I think a lot of people are not frequenting those large stores at the same rate that they did in the past. And what we're focused on is making sure, as we're getting those incremental visits, that we are going above and beyond so we get those visits in the future. I think also, as this brick-and-mortar omnichannel strategy comes to place, I think we're also not losing share that we might have been losing before to the online channel, and in fact, maybe gaining some of that share back over time. In the commercial sector, I think it's hard to say where the share is coming from. We are less than 4% market share in the commercial industry today. I think it's likely coming from probably multiple different places. We certainly have intensified our understanding of what the wholesale distributor market is doing, and we're paying more attention to them and our competitive analysis and building our strategy. And we think that over time, we've significantly changed our competitive position, particularly against the WDs. You think about what we've done with assortment, what we've done building a sales force and now we've got this technology that we have in place, it's going to improve our deliveries. I think that our competitive positioning in the marketplace is vastly different than what it was four, five years ago. Bret Jordan : Okay, great. Thank you. And then a question on supply chain. You mentioned that batteries were strong in your category remarks. Do categories or particular areas that there is a shortage, either in stocks in the market in general? And I guess, obviously, we hear a lot about some of the import issues and freight costs. But is your - I guess, are you seeing any shifts in your supplier base to sort of diversify around that? William Rhodes : Yes. Certainly, Bret. We've experienced significant supply chain disruptions over the last 11 months. Certainly a lot less today than we had, call it, June, July, August. I think I mentioned on one of these calls, we couldn't get sandpaper for a while. We had trouble with fuses. We had trouble with tools. I mean, we just had such enormous surges in certain parts of our business that we couldn't keep up, and many of those came with an extended supply chain that ran into China or Asia. We've worked through most of those. I have to give our team and our battery suppliers some kudos that the battery business has been as strong as it's been for as long as it's been. And then we had this huge cold surge or cold snap and we did just fine. Our team was very creative and worked with lots of different suppliers to make sure we were in good shape. So we don't have any acute needs right now. Some issues on the edges. Our in-stock position has significantly improved, but it's not back to our normal levels yet, probably going to take a few more months. Operator : Our next question comes from Seth Sigman, Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Seth Sigman : I wanted to follow-up on the DIY business. Earlier in the year, I think there was a concern that the DIY strength at the time, and this is back in the spring of last year, the strength at the time meant that maybe sales were being pulled forward. As you see the DIY business pick up here again, I guess that would suggest that, that wasn't really true. So I guess, how do you think about pull-forward and just the strength that you're seeing in the DIY business right now, and I guess, just the sustainability of it? Thank you. William Rhodes : That's a terrific question, Seth. I'm not sure how to answer it all. Clearly, I think we talked that we were worried. If anything, we might have pulled forward some battery business, because those cars parked last spring, and they sat for five or six weeks, as soon as the safe at home went away, our battery business boomed. But that battery business has sustained really high levels ever since. We've seen no dip in our battery business. We've seen weeks where we're going up against tough winter weather where it might be softer. But overall, it has exceeded our expectations over the last 11 months. As far as sustainability of these sales surges, the thing that keeps resonating with me is, if you think about our business over really long periods of time, when our customers have incremental time and specifically, incremental money, our business outperforms normal periods of time. And it's been that way for the last decade when we get tax refunds. How much have we talked in this environment about the surge we see during tax refund season, which is just beginning right now? We've seen it every single year. And when and when tax refunds moved back three weeks, we had to spend a lot of time talking about it because it moved out of one quarter into another quarter. It's just evidence that when our customer who are often term as financially fragile, when they get some incremental dollars, we seem to get a disproportionate share of those funds. And we saw it again in January when the stimulus came out. It wasn't nearly the stimulus that we saw last April, but within a day, within a day, we saw that those funds showing up in significantly improved business for us. And that sustained itself through the end of the quarter. Now we're talking about another stimulus, which could frankly, could dwarf what happened last April. If that comes, what does that mean to our business? All the indications we have is it would be very strong for our business because each time we've seen those incremental dollars our business has performed better than normal. Seth Sigman : And Bill, I guess, you mentioned the gap between retail and commercial narrowing the last four weeks of the period. Did that actually mean that commercial accelerated through the period and exited at a stronger rate? And if so, can you just elaborate on that as well? I mean, do you think that's stimulus or something else? William Rhodes : Yes. I don't think the stimulus plays nearly as much in the commercial business as it does the DIY business. And I think most of the end consumers in the commercial business are higher socioeconomic - higher up on the socioeconomic ladder. So that incremental money doesn't mean as much to them. In fact, both businesses were doing really well. Commercial is continuing to rebound. But there are still elements of the commercial business that aren't as strong as they were pre-pandemic, particularly some of our national account players, the up and down the street business has been stronger than the national account business. And again, I think that, that has to do with the end consumer that is servicing or picking the UDS business versus picking the national account business. Operator : Our next question comes from Zach Fadem, Wells Fargo. Your line is open. David Lantz : This is David Lantz on for Zach. Thanks for taking our questions. So within the 15% growth in commercial, how much would you attribute to new mega hubs? And can you talk about how performance in commercial business tends to evolve once you open a mega hub in a certain market? Jamere Jackson : Yes. So the key with mega hubs is that, it increases the number of SKUs that we have available, and it enables us to say, yes, more. And so to the extent that we have that coverage and those parts available, that bodes well for us as we're going into our existing customers and our new customers. What I'll say about commercial is that we grew 15%. We grew significantly with locals and nationals.  But probably the one story that I want people to continue to focus on is that, we're underpenetrated. I mean, a 4% share gives us a tremendous opportunity to create a faster-growing business. So as we execute on this growth playbook that we talked about, we're seeing significant share gains. We're pleased with that execution in the marketplace.  And the mega hub strategy, the things that we're doing with technology, the fact that we're laser-focused on being competitively priced, all of these things give us an opportunity to create a faster-growing business and we're pretty excited about it. David Lantz : And then just one more for me. Can you talk about the impact that you think the rollout of electric vehicles is happening in the industry and what you think could happen over the long-term there? Jamere Jackson : Yes. First of all, we believe there's going to be a market. And AutoZone is going to be a big player, just as we are today with the internal combustion engine. Our strategy is simple. We're just going to follow the consumer just like we've done in the past. We're not wed to internal combustion engine technology. We've significantly changed our assortment over time to reflect the latest technology. So this is not an accidental threat for us. We're operating from a position of strength. If you think about our business today, we're already supplying parts and supplies to the EV market, things like wiper blades. We have world-class capabilities in supply chain and merchandising. We have great relationships and partnerships with the OEMs who have a seat at the table today and can help us forecast the volumes and the timing of the market changes. And we have this tremendous retail footprint in commercial business that gives us distribution points.  So as we think about the parts and supplies that are at risk with electric vehicles versus internal combustion engines, there will be offsets. I mean, there will be - clearly, there'll be some things that are at risk, but there will be offsets to those. And there'll be opportunities for us in both DIY and DIFM. So listen, despite what we see in headlines and announcements from the OEMs, we're a bit cautious because the market has some near-term challenges that we're watching closely.  First of all, consumer adoption is uncertain. We - roughly 2% of the market today and it's growing slowly. And if you look at the U.S. in particular, the charging infrastructure is not ready for prime time. The rapid charging stations need to be built out. It's going to be expensive. It's probably going to take some combination of public and private partnerships. The business model there has an uncertain path to profitability. And quite frankly, we think there's going to be some need for some pretty significant power grid investments. But we do believe there's going to be a market and we're going to be a player, and we're simply going to follow the consumer. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Baker, D.A. Davidson. Your line is now open. Katy Hallberg : This is Katy on for Mike Baker. Thanks so much for taking our questions. Kind of tagging on to one of the previous questions asked. I was wondering, if you guys saw any difference in what your retail customers spent between the two rounds of stimulus, and if you saw any sort of category shift between those. Thank you. William Rhodes : Yes. I don't think we've really seen any significant category shifts. I mentioned the battery business has been particularly strong. We've seen - we talked about the sales floor business being really strong. What we have seen in recent - in this quarter is a resurgence of our hard parts business, in particular, some of the failure-related items. I think some of that has to do with actually getting into winter and having a more normal winter this year. We've also talked about our maintenance products not being at the same levels that we're experiencing in the rest of our business, things like brakes and rotors and the like. And I think that, that's personally a hold on from the lack of winter last year, and the fact that miles driven are down and those maintenance items for some of the higher socioeconomic groups may be negatively impacted. Katy Hallberg : And then just again, real quickly on the cash balance. I know you guys mentioned being fairly confident about more share repurchases through the end of the year. And I was just wondering if there are any other plans or sort of strategic investments to use some of that excess cash. Jamere Jackson : Well, what we've said is that, we're going to take our free cash flow. And our number one priority has been and will continue to be to invest in our business in a disciplined way. The free cash flow that we generate inside the business gives us tremendous financial firepower to both invest in our business in a disciplined way and return significant amounts of cash to investors in the form of our repurchases currently. We've got tremendous confidence in that plan, and we're going to continue to execute as we finish out the balance of the year. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Montani, Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Michael Montani : It's Mike Montani on for Greg Melich. Just wanted to ask two questions. I had 1 for Bill and then a follow-up for Jamere, if I could. So first off, for Bill, obviously, there's been a lot of investment in technology and multichannel. And I'm wondering, Bill, if you could just expand a little bit, if you care to go there on what percentage of the B2B business today is kind of digital ordering, if you think about that, almost $3 billion business. And then the same question for your retail business. We've been thinking probably 4% to 5% type range, but is that true? And then related was just, if you can talk about FedEx initiative as well as BOPIS? Just kind of some incremental color on what's working well in those two areas? William Rhodes : There's a lot to unpack there, Mike. Thank you for the question. I really hate this new setup with Bill and Jamere. Used to if somebody said Bill and it was a hard question, I would just look at Giles and let him answer it. But you put it on me this time. So let's talk about our digital business. In the commercial sector, it's not like the retail system where our customer's really picking a channel, they're picking the way they want to order parts. So there are two primary ways they order parts. They pick up a phone and call us or they go online and click buttons. And we fulfill it the exact same way regardless of how they initially interact with us. We've been doing a lot of work trying to make - doing it digitally with us, easier and we've made significant strides, really proud of the team that's been doing that work over the last couple of years, in particular. And we've also made a lot of other back office things easier for the customer. We've also done some work with ALLDATA to make ALLDATA more ingrained in the purchase decision with the customer. So I'm really pleased where we are with that. And we are seeing significant growth, but the vast majority of our interactions with customers today are still over the phone. We believe and hope over time that our percentage of digital penetration in the commercial business will continue to increase at a pretty rapid pace. On the retail side of the business, we kind of have three different businesses that we interact with. We have Buy Online, Pick-Up In-Store. We have traditional ship to home, which comes out of our fulfillment center or we have next-day delivery, which is the program that you mentioned with FedEx, where we're leveraging our Hubs and Mega-Hubs, and customers can order with us as late as 10 p.m., midnight in a couple of markets, and we'll have it on their doorstep the next day. Each one of those three businesses is growing significantly, really high rates faster than the rest of the business. But our Buy Online Pick-Up In-Store is growing at twice the rate of our ship to home and next-day delivery business. And that again shows us, once again - and remember, the way we price in the online world, if you do ship to home or next-day delivery, on most purchases, you can generally get a 20% discount. But our customers are electing to do Buy Online Pick-Up In-Store with us at twice the growth rate of ship to home or next-day delivery, which again proves to us the notion that we have to be an omni-channel provider. We've got to have great stores and great customer touch points, convenience and knowledge that our AutoZoners provide to our customers is very valuable to our customers. So I hope I unpacked that okay for you. Michael Montani : Great. Thank you, Bill. That was helpful. And then for Jamere, I guess you can have the tougher questions, which we get this from investors, which is really around the minimum wage. And obviously, we saw Walmart go up to $15-plus an hour. We've been thinking new hour kind of $13 to $14 an hour range. But the heart of the question really is when we try to analyze this, we think it could be 100 bp-plus headwind to the P&L in isolation. But then we think there's a lot of levers you all have to pull to kind of mitigate. And one thing, for example, was COVID costs seem to be running above 100 bps. So is this a case where we should be kind of confident that you all can kind of mitigate some of these headwinds to the extent that this happens in a rational way? Just any color that you can share there on productivity initiatives, pricing power would be super helpful. Jamere Jackson : Yes. So a couple of things about this one. One is, we do think that there will be several mitigants at our disposal as we move into this environment. It's still uncertain about what we'll see and the cadence that we will see that. These are all things that we've been contemplating for a while. The first thing I'll say is that, we've done a tremendous job inside of our operations, really driving productivity. And over time, what that's meant for us is that we have a highly productive workforce here that is delivering. And you can see that in this environment where we have accelerated sales growth, you're seeing us getting very decent leverage with our teams in the field. So that's one. The second thing is, the reality is that when there are inflationary pressures in the business, whether they're commodities or wages, you have to be disciplined as a company to make sure that you recover those. And so we're very disciplined on the pricing front. Whenever we see cost inflation from any area of the P&L, we find ways to offset that with pricing. And we believe we're going to have that pricing power into the future. And then I think the third thing that stands out to me as it relates to minimum wages, we're going to do what's right for our AutoZoners.  That's always been our philosophy inside the company. And so the cadence with which the legislation happens will have an impact on that. But across our business today, we're always focused on doing what's right for the AutoZoners and making sure that we're competitive in terms of acquiring labor. And so to the extent that there are changes that happen in the wage landscape, we're going to be competitive there, and we're going to have a business that enables us to be competitive in the future. William Rhodes : All right. Before we conclude the call, I want to take just a moment to reiterate, we believe our industry is strong and our business model is solid. We'll take nothing for granted as we understand our customers have alternatives to shopping with us. We're excited about our growth prospects for the year. We have an exciting plan that should help us succeed this fiscal year. But I want to stress, like always, that this is a marathon and not a sprint. As we continue to focus on the basics and focus on optimizing long-term shareholder value, we are confident AutoZone will continue to be very successful. Thank you for participating in today's call. Have a great day and stay safe. Operator : Thank you for your participation in today's conference. You may disconnect at this time.",

Operator : Greetings, and welcome to AutoZone\u2019s 2021 Third Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.  It is now my pleasure to introduce Bill Rhodes, Chief Executive Officer. Thank you. You may begin. William Rhodes : Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for AutoZone\u2019s 2021 third quarter conference call. With me today are Jamere Jackson, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer Investor Relations and Tax. Regarding the third quarter, I hope you\u2019ve had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter\u2019s results. If not the press release, along with slides complementing our comments today, are available on our website, www.autozone.com under the Investor Relations link. Please click on quarterly earnings conference calls to see them. I am excited and honored to share with you the exceptionally strong performance our team of 100,000 AutoZoners delivered this quarter. As I've said previously, throughout this pandemic, we could not deliver the kind of results we have without the continued exceptional performance of our entire team, especially our store and supply chain AutoZoners. As our sales volumes have remained at historic all-time highs, our AutoZoners have met this demand head on with enthusiasm for going the extra mile for our customers. While we've had - have asked a lot of our AutoZoners over the last year, they've taken on the challenge and continue to inspire and impress us all.  I also want to reiterate, our top priority remains being committed to keeping all of our customers and AutoZoners safe. Thank you, AutoZoners, again.  Now to our sales results. Our overall same-store sales were up 28.9% this quarter. Our growth rates for retail and commercial were both strong, with commercials growth north of 40%. This is almost double the comp growth rate of our DIY business, an incredible accomplishment for both businesses, but especially for commercial.  We achieved our highest weekly commercial sales of all-time. We averaged nearly $70 million a week in commercial sales. This is incredible, considering we averaged $48 million for Q3 of last year. For the trailing four quarters, we have sold domestically $3.1 billion to commercial customers. We are doing some really exciting things in commercial and we couldn't be more proud of our team's recent successes.  Now let's focus on sales cadence. This quarter, we stripped -- this quarter stretch from mid-February to the first week of May. In the first four weeks, our sales comp was approximately 11.6%. This was lower than the trend we were experiencing at the end of our second quarter. We believe the cause of our sales slowing were the winter storms experienced across the Central and Southeastern states.  Sales picked up for the next four weeks from mid-March to mid-April, concurrent with the arrival of additional stimulus payments. The final four weeks happened to coincide perfectly with the stimulus payments from last year. It was over these four weeks last year when our sales ramped materially. This year, over those four weeks, we averaged a 14% comp, with the last two weeks coming down to the mid-single-digit range. We continue to maintain solid growth rates post-stimulus. For Q3, our two-year comp was 27.9%. On a two-year stack basis, the first four weeks were up 17.9%, the next four weeks were up an impressive 49.9%, and the last four weeks were still up 26.7%. It was encouraging for us to see sales inflect upward this quarter, with both traffic and ticket moving higher. Our traffic growth was roughly double the ticket growth rate, as the reintroduction of Federal Stimulus Payments and the execution of our growth initiatives drove a material increase in traffic.  During the quarter, there were certainly some geographic regions that did better than others, as there always are. Across both our retail and commercial customer basis, we saw the majority of the country performed consistently well. Normally, we talk about the Midwest and Northeastern markets underperforming the others; no, not this quarter.  These markets were in line with the rest of the country for both DIY and the DIFM. And we believe that winter weather we experienced in February bodes well for our future sales opportunities this summer and into the fall.  And I could not be more proud to say that based on the retail sales data we have for our industry, we continue to enjoy share gains. The shared data we have available for the first eight weeks of this quarter shows we are growing at a roughly 10% higher rate than the remainder of the industry. While we are thrilled to have those share gains, our charge remains to maintain them heading into the summer and fall months. Our number one priority continues to be the health, safety and wellbeing of our customers and AutoZoners. On last quarter\u2019s call, we shared that we would provide every single AutoZoner with $100 incentive once they completed their vaccination for COVID-19. That's every AutoZoner, including part-timers. This was the logical next step in our efforts to provide a safe working and shopping environment, as we have with our ongoing PPE efforts.  We spent about $1 million during the quarter incentivizing our AutoZoners to get that vaccine. I continue to be inspired by our Board and management teams\u2019 commitment to doing what is right and that is putting safety first. Our culture and our values of taking care of one another have been in full force and effect over the last year during this pandemic. While we continue to be encouraged with the current sales environment, we are cautious about predicting future trends. The latest round of stimulus payments certainly accelerated our sales and sales remained at elevated levels through the end of the quarter. However, we can't fully predict what all the different pushes and pulls on macro trends mean for us.  However, we remain bullish on the industry's ability to grow this year. And we believe we are well positioned to gain additional share beyond what we already have. I'm sure many of you would like to know how we're thinking about the sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. I'll remind you that typically in recessionary environments, our business is remarkably resilient. However, nothing about this global pandemic is typical.  Beyond our primary objective to ensure the safety of our customers and AutoZoners, our focus is on providing our AutoZoners with the resources they need to provide our customers with an exceptional shopping experience. We are optimistic about the sales environment heading into the fourth fiscal quarter, but we will obviously have the most difficult comparison in our history. As last year's fourth quarter benefited from the April 2020 stimulus package and enhanced unemployment benefits through July, and we generated an astonishing 21.8% same-store sales growth last year in Q4. While we understand you would like more clarity on our expectations for this Q4, this remains a very challenging environment to predict, especially in DIY, as many evolving macro factors meaningfully impact our results. Now, let's move into more specifics on performance for the quarter. Our same-store sales were up 28.9% versus last year's third quarter, our net income was $596 million, and our EPS was $26.48 a share, 84% above last year's third quarter. Our same-store sales growth this quarter was a record for any quarter since we became a publicly traded company back in 1991. Both our retail and commercial businesses showed strength in the quarter with DIY same-store sales up approximately 25% and commercial total sales growth of approximately 44%. For commercial, we averaged $70 million in weekly sales, which was approximately $13,500 in sales per program per week. These commercial sales numbers easily set all-time records for us. The initiatives we have in place are helping drive our commercial sales. I'll remind you that this is a highly fragmented $75 billion dollar market. And we believe our product and service offerings provide us a tremendous opportunity to significantly grow sales and market share over time. Next, I'll talk about trends across our merchandise categories, particularly in the retail business. Our sales floor categories continue to be strong with categories like tools antifreeze, small repair and floormats showing strength. But our hard parts business definitely picked up. And our hard parts business comp in line with our sales floor for the quarter. This now represents our second quarter in a row where we saw our hard parts business grow in line with sales floor items.  We believe the strengthening of our hard parts businesses due to the significant winter weather we experienced, additional stimulus and the pickup in miles driven the nation is beginning to see as people return to a new normal. Business remained very strong in many merchandise categories, such as accessories and batteries, notably brakes and rotors. While still slightly below our average growth had a meaningful rebound this quarter due to the winter weather. As we expect, our sales growth from the pandemic-related surge will moderate over time. We believe the investments we have made in both our retail and commercial businesses positioned us to deliver outsized share gains relative to the overall industry.  In addition, we continue to believe our products and services will be in high demand during more difficult economic times. And this resiliency gives us significant confidence about our future prospects.  Now, I will turn the call over to Jamere Jackson. Jamere? Jamere Jackson : Thanks, Bill. And good morning, everyone. As Bill mentioned, we had another outstanding quarter. Once again, our growth initiatives are delivering and the heroic efforts of our AutoZoners in our stores and distribution centers are driving extraordinary results.  To start this morning, let me take a few minutes to elaborate on the specifics in our P&L for Q3. For the quarter, total auto parts sales, which includes our domestic Mexico and Brazil stores were $3.6 billion up 31.8%. For the trailing four quarters ended, total sales per AutoZone store were just over $2.1 million. This compares to just under $1.9 million in Q3 last year.  Let me give a little more color on sales and our growth initiatives. Starting with our commercial business, for the third quarter, our domestic DIFM sales increased over 44% to $829 million. Sales to our DIFM customers represented 23% of our total sales. And our weekly sales per program were $13,500, up 39.2% as we averaged nearly $70 million in total weekly commercial sales.  Our growth was broad based as national accounts and local and regional accounts, both grew over 40% in the quarter. Our execution on our commercial acceleration initiatives is delivering exceptional results. As I've said previously, we're focused on building a faster growing business with discipline investments in pricing service and assortment. We have a tremendous market opportunity, as we are significantly under penetrated in this highly fragmented portion of the market. We now have our commercial program in over 85% of our domestic stores. And we're focused on building our business with national, regional and local accounts.  This quarter, we opened 19 net new programs finishing with 5107 total programs. We continue to leverage our DIY infrastructure and increase our share of wallet with existing customers. Our strategy is working as we continue to grow share this past quarter. We're confident that we can continue to gain shear as we deliver improvements in the quality of our parts, particularly with our Duralast brand, make improvements in our assortment, maintain competitive pricing, and stay committed to providing an exceptional service. These core focus areas have enabled us to drive double-digit sales growth for the past four quarters and position as well in the marketplace.  As we move forward, we're focused on our core initiatives that we believe will accelerate our growth even further. First, our mega hub strategy is improving our parts availability, and giving us tremendous momentum. We opened two more mega hubs this quarter, bringing our total to 50 locations. And we expect to open between four and seven more mega hubs by the end of the fiscal year.  As you might recall from last quarters conference call, we raised our near-term target of build out of mega hubs from 75 to 90 to 100 to 110. Mega hubs help us expand coverage and say yes, we have it more frequently. Expanding our mega hub footprint delivers a meaningful sales lift to both our commercial and DIY business. Second, our technology investments are improving delivery times and service levels. We continue to make enhancements to our AutoZonePro system and mobile app to enable faster and more efficient parts ordering. We're leveraging technology to improve delivery times and making it simpler to do business with AutoZone. All of our efforts are driving efficiency for our sales professionals, drivers and customers and will help build a meaningful competitive advantage. Third, we're committed to being price competitive and the strategy is working. We have a laser focus on the key categories, regions and segments where investments in pricing are leading to accelerated sales growth and higher EBIT dollars. We're using data science and market intelligence to test our approach in different markets and different customer segments and delivering solid results.  We will continue to lean into this strategy and live up to our plans to have the best merchandise at the right price. Our execution in the commercial business gives us tremendous confidence in our ability to create a faster growing business.  On the retail side of our business, we're excited about the gains we're seeing in our DIY market share, and our initiatives are driving solid share gains. Our growth in the quarter was broad based across regions and categories.  In the quarter we delivered double digit comps and eight of the 12 weeks. And all 12 weeks had positive comps, despite some weeks having tough comparisons from a year ago. Our sales floor market share as measured by NPD grew nearly two points for the first eight weeks of the quarter. And we saw double digit growth across both failure and maintenance categories in the quarter. We also who share in April, despite the tremendous growth last year signifying that those customers have likely changed their buying behavior. Our growth in retail is driven by our continued focus in a few key areas.  First, the relentless focus on execution by our AutoZoners in our stores and distribution centers has been remarkable. Our supply chain AutoZoners have processed and handled record volumes. And our store AutoZoners have handled record store traffic and delighted our customers. To be clear we are winning in the marketplace and execution of our AutoZoners, we're taking care of our customers is a key competitive advantage.  Second, the assortment work and mega hub strategy continue to improve our coverage and availability leading to a meaningful lift in sales. Third, we continue to focus on improving the customer shopping experience with our e-commerce efforts. Buy online pick up in-store, next-day delivery and ship-to-home which were up against significantly this quarter have helped us meet customers when where and how they want to shop.  We're particularly pleased with buy online pick up in-store the fastest growing portion of our e-commerce offerings, which enables our customer to shop our broad array of products online and maintain the opportunity to get expert advice from our AutoZoners when they pick up in store. This is a significant competitive advantage versus our pure play competitors.  Fourth, and similar to our commercial approach, we're using discipline and sophisticated data analytics to ensure that we're competitively price. This is a data-rich environment and our data-driven approach tools and capabilities give us a meaningful competitive advantage.  We've tested our approach in key categories and markets and this effort is yielding increased top line and gross profit dollar growth albeit it's slightly lower gross margins. The strategy is working. And we're going to lean into this approach more as we live up to our pledge of having the best merchandise at the right price. DIY has been a strong contributor to the growth of our company. And while comps get more difficult as we lapped the accelerated sales growth that we've seen over the past four quarters, the fundamentals of our business have never been stronger. Our strategy and execution are delivering solid results.  Now, let me spend just a few minutes on international. We continue to be pleased with the progress we're making in Mexico and Brazil. During the quarter we open seven new stores in Mexico to finish with 635 stores, and one new store in Brazil to finish with 47.  On a constant currency basis, we continue to see solid sales growth. More importantly, as those economies stabilize, we remain committed to our store opening schedules in both markets, and expect both to be significant contributors to growth and earnings in the future.  I am particularly excited about our prospects in Brazil, where based on all of the hard work by our Brazilian AutoZoners over the past several years, we're now poised to significantly accelerate our new store growth rate over the coming years. Now let me spend a few minutes on the P&L and gross margins. For the quarter, our gross margin was down 118 basis points driven primarily by the accelerated growth in our commercial business in our investment in our pricing initiatives.  As I mentioned, our commercial business grew 44% this quarter. We're also making discipline pricing investments to drive top line-growth and gross profit dollars. The strategy is working. Our work is translating into higher sales and profits as evidenced by our sales and share growth that outpace the remaining market this quarter.  Our approach is discipline and specific to certain categories where we have rigorously tested and determine which actions move the sales and gross profit dollar performance in the right direction. We're beginning to see some cost inflation in certain product care categories along with rising transportation costs. To be clear, overall, we have pricing power. The industry\u2019s pricing remains rational, and we're pricing accordingly. All of the actions we're taking have resulted in us growing our DIY and DIFM businesses at roughly double the rate of the overall market or better. And we're committed to capturing our fair share and improving our competitive positioning in a disciplined way. This is a good outcome for our business. And as such, you should expect to see similar margin performance in the fourth quarter.  We will continue to drive new customers and overtime grow absolute gross profit dollars at a faster and historic rate in our total auto parts operating segment. Moving to operating expenses. Our store operations and commercial teams continue to manage our expenses well in this environment. Our expenses were up 11.3% versus last year Q3 as SG&A as a percentage of sales shows leverage of 550 basis points. Included in this quarter\u2019s expenses were over $1 million of COVID-related expenses, compared to last year third quarter COVID expenses that totaled $75 million, which included provisions for additional emergency time off. Excluding this comparison, SG&A levered 284 basis points, driven by our exceptionally strong sales growth. While our SG&A dollar growth rate has been higher than historical averages, we remain committed to managing SG&A in line with sales volumes over time. Moving to the rest of the P&L. Even for the quarter was $804 million or 63% versus the prior year quarter, or EBIT margin was 22%, up 432 basis points versus the prior year's quarter, driven by the strong top-line growth and operating expense leverage I spoke about earlier.  Interest expense for the quarter was just over $45 million down 5% from Q3 a year ago, as our debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was just under $5.3 billion versus just over $5.4 billion last year. We're planning interest in the $60 million to $61 million range for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 versus $65.6 million and last year's fourth quarter. Our adjusted debt level metric finished a quarter at two times EBITDAR. While in any given quarter, we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on debt and equity market conditions, we remain committed to both our investment grade rating and our capital allocation strategy. And our share repurchases are an important element of that strategy. Moving the tax. For the quarter, our tax rate was 21.4% versus 22.8% in last year\u2019s third quarter. This quarter\u2019s rate benefited 211 basis points from stock options exercise, while last year had benefited 26 basis points. Stock option exercises are unpredictable, and as such they will affect our tax rate and ultimately our net income and EPS. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we suggest investors model us at approximately 23.4% before any assumption on credits due to stock option exercises. Because we cannot effectively predict this activity, we remain committed to reporting the stock option impact on the tax rate. Moving to net income and EPS. Net income for the quarter was $596 million up 73.9% versus last year third quarter. Our diluted share count of 22.5 million was lowered by 5.5% from last year's third quarter. The combination of strong earnings and lower share count drove earnings per share for the quarter to $26.48, up 84% over the prior year's third quarter. Now, let me talk about our cash flow. For the third quarter we generated $1.2 billion of operating cash flow. This was up $539 million over last year's Q3. Our operating cash flow results benefited from the strong sales and earnings previously discussed.  And as we move forward and make the investments that we have discussed to drive growth, you can still expect us to be an incredibly strong cash flow generator that returns meaningful amounts of cash to our shareholders.  Regarding our balance sheet, we now have $976 million in cash on the balance sheet and our liquidity position remains strong. We're also managing our inventory well as our inventory preferred growth was up 2.3% versus Q3 last year. Inventory per store was $701,000 versus $685,000 last year, and $715,000 last quarter. Total inventory increased 5.1% over the same period last year driven by new stores.  Net inventory is defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable on a per store basis was a negative $167,000 versus negative $56,000 last year and negative $93,000 last quarter. As a result accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished a quarter at 123.9% versus last year's Q3 of 108.2%. Lastly, I'll spend a moment on capital allocation in our share repurchase program. We repurchased $900 million of AutoZone stock in the quarter. As of the end of the fiscal quarter, we had approximately $21.6 million shares outstanding. At quarter-end we had just over $1.3 billion remaining under our share buyback authorization. Year-to-date, we bought back $2.5 billion of stock or approximately 2 million shares.  The powerful free cash flow we have generated this year combined with excess cash carry over from last year has enabled us to buy back over 8% of our shares over the first three quarters of the year. We remain confident in our near-term plans and as such, expect to continue reducing the level of cash and cash equivalents on hand through the remainder of this fiscal year.  Our business remains remarkably strong. And this will enable us to invest in our existing assets grow our business, and as I emphasized earlier, return meaningful amounts of cash to shareholders as part of our disciplined capital allocation approach.  So to wrap up, we had another very strong quarter highlighted by exceptionally strong comp sales, which drove a 74% increase in net income and an 84% increase in EPS. We're driving long-term shareholder value by investing in our growth initiatives, driving robust earnings and cash and returning excess cash to our shareholders. Our strategy is working. And I have tremendous confidence in our ability to drive significant and ongoing value for our shareholders.  Now I'll turn it back to Bill. William Rhodes : Thank you, Jamere. These continue to be unique and extraordinary times. Our team has done a wonderful job of managing and leading throughout this timeframe. I am proud of our team across the board for their commitment to servicing our customers, but doing so in a very safe manner.  At the start of this pandemic last year, we could never have guessed the positive impact it would have on our sales. To be able to report our largest domestic comp sales number ever this quarter, 30 years after going public is just amazing. But with this fortuitous outcome, we knew we had to take advantage of this window of time and experiment. We've tested to understand the origins of our share gains and potential for retaining those gains as the world goes back to some sense of normalcy. We believe the environment continues to allow us this chance to learn, but we will be deliberate.  We understand the value of the capital invested as our capital as our investors\u2019 capital, we must have an appropriate return. We've worked exceptionally well to deliver on our commitments thus far. But we must keep focused and continue to deliver. There are no layups, we must continue to innovate.  While our domestic retail business continues to do tremendously well, we understand that trends will slow. We're going to work hard, real hard to gain as much share as possible now in order to limit our future headwinds.  Our goal is to retain all of these new customers and new occasions where existing customers are choosing AutoZone. And as we've discussed, our domestic commercial businesses still in the very early innings of the maturation process. It is an honor to have reported this morning, that we are now doing materially over $3 billion in domestic commercial sales on a trailing four quarter basis. But we hope, and we believe the best is yet to come for our commercial business. As always, we have work to do as we head into our summer selling season. But we are excited to exploit the opportunities that are in front of us. First and foremost, our focus will be on keeping our AutoZoners and customers safe while providing our customers with their automotive needs. Secondly, we must continuously challenge ourselves during these extraordinary times to position our company for even greater future success. We know that investors will ultimately measure us by what our future cash flows look like in three to five years from now. Lastly, I continue to be bullish on our industry, and in particular, very bullish on our company.  Now, we'd like to open up the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Please proceed with your questions. Bret Jordan : Hey, good morning, guys. William Rhodes : Good morning, Bret. Jamere Jackson : Good morning, Bret. Bret Jordan : In your prepared remarks, you talked about the improvement in quality of the Duralast parts, obviously, started as a driver of [ph] the commercial traction. Could you talk about how maybe higher input costs, obviously, buying a higher value part is impacting margins versus the price investments? William Rhodes : Yeah, Jamere talked about the fact that we're beginning to see some pretty significant inflation on certain product categories. I don't think that that's been a big driver of our performance in Q3, but it is something that we are very mindful of as we move into Q4. And frankly, we have in the past, some of those costs along to our customers, just like we've done for the last 40 years. Bret Jordan : Okay. And I guess on the price investment conversation, I guess, when you think about the DIY business versus the commercial, could you maybe just sort of bucket it for us? Do you see more aggressive price investment on one side versus the other? And then within commercial, are you seeing more competition in national accounts versus regional? I guess, where do you see that, I guess, the heat zones of price competition? Jamere Jackson : Yeah, what I'll say in general, is that we've been very disciplined about the investments that we've been making in pricing. As I mentioned, this is a very data-rich environment. We're using data-driven through tools. We're using artificial intelligence and data science to help us figure out exactly where to price, which categories to price, which reasons to price. So it's a very dynamic environment in that regard. We're fortunate that we don't have to peanut butter spread this across the chain, if you will. So, what we're doing is very surgical and very strategic. What I'll say in terms of the competitive responses that the industry remains very rational. We're seeing rational pricing across the industry and the response. To that extent, it's been pretty muted. So our strategy is working. Our goal is to create a faster-growing business with higher-margin dollars. It's a much more sustainable way for us to grow cash and ultimately, shareholder value.  And on the commercial side, what we're seeing is that, all the initiatives that we put in place, which price is just one element of it. And I would argue it's probably the smallest element of it. You mentioned, the investments that we're making in our Duralast brand, including some of the offerings that we have in Duralast Gold, those things are very meaningful to our customers. The investments that we've made in technology that have helped us be easier to do business with, it's helping us lower our delivery times, is a significant impact on the business.  The work that we're doing around mega hubs to increase our parts availability is huge for us and huge for our customers. So when you put all of those initiatives together, that's why we're so bullish on the commercial growth. And what I'll say is that even as we move through this environment, that commercial growth is sticky. Once we win those customers and continue to delight those customers and we're competitively priced, that gives us a lot of confidence about our future prospects in this area of the market. Bret Jordan : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your questions. Simeon Gutman : Hey, everyone, good morning. I'm going to stick on the pricing topic. My first question is, did you get more aggressive in this quarter? It looks like the margin compression got a little worse and there were some other factors. But \u2013 and if you did, why now? And just to be clear, are these price investments more on the DIY side or the DIFM? William Rhodes : Yes. Simeon, good morning, and thank you for the question. Clearly, they\u2019re on both sides of the business. We've had very targeted approach on the DIY side that has been focused more on two different spectrums of the business.  One on commodity products that are highly available in lots of different environments, and then two on very slow moving hard to find powerful - maybe our value proposition isn't as different as it is, when you can walk in the store and get the immediate product availability. The DIY piece is smaller than the commercial piece today and we've done that work. And it's all in place. And on the commercial side, we did get more aggressive. We didn't get more aggressive, because we took prices to a different level. We continue to roll out the pricing initiatives that we're working. We originally started with six regions, then we went to 14 regions.  As of the beginning of this quarter, this has been rolled out. The pricing initiatives in our commercial business have been rolled out across the chain. So you'll see this mature over the next year or so. We don't plan on having around two of these pricing initiatives. What we have seen is these have worked. As you know, in the commercial business, pricing transparency isn't what it is in the retail business. But also, more importantly, the competitive set is vastly different.  When you think about the large players, if you add all of us up in the commercial sector, we're around 20% of the market share. So these pricing initiatives are not designed versus our traditional in-channel competitors. They're more making sure that we have the right pricing and value proposition that gets other sectors of the industry. Simeon Gutman : Got it. Okay. And I guess the follow-up is in the same -- I guess, the same vein. So it seems like you're having success with this strategy, which on the one hand, is showing that there is some elasticity of demand. And now we're going to be going through a bit -- some inflation, and you're already starting to see it. And I would think in theory, the industry would try to pass that along. Is there any sort of disconnect? Or how should we think about inability to pass along pricing if the customer is showing elasticity, if that makes any sense? And might you lean into pricing more next year? Is this working and you have inflation? Yeah. William Rhodes : Yeah. I would say it's the elasticity of demand for us, but it's not driving elasticity of demand for the industry. I think in some respects, it's improved our competitive position, not against our in-channel competitors, but against other competitors and that's proven to be successful.  As we think about an inflationary environment, I know AutoZone will make sure that we pass those costs along to our consumers, just like we always have. And I don't think that that'll be any different than normal. Simeon Gutman : Okay, thanks. Good luck. William Rhodes : All right. Thank you, Simeon. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your questions. Christopher Horvers : Thanks, and good morning. So I'll stick to the pricing side too for my first question. It seems like the transition here is the rollout of the commercial side. But you're also going to be, you're going to start lapping through the DIY price investment. So, as we think about 3Q and 4Q would seem like the peak gross margin pressure is now. And then that starts to moderate as we lap through the DIY side of the business price investments. Is that fair? Jamere Jackson : Yeah, that's the right cadence to think about. One of the things that Bill mentioned is that, we don't have around to plan here. So, as we rolled the price investments through the entire chain, and all the categories that we're going to roll it through, you'll start to see us anniversary this in the back half of next year.  So -- and again, we're pleased with the execution of those initiatives. Again, it's one element of the strategy, if you will. It certainly gets a lot of a lot of attention. But we would not be in a position to even be talking about making pricing investments if we weren't executing so well, on all of the other elements of the strategy. And when I think about, again, the work that we've done on assortment, I think about the work that we're doing to lean in the technology. Those things have been the foundation or the enablers for us to then focus on this element of being competitively priced. And, I said it a couple of times in my prepared comments about having the best merchandise at the right price. That combined with the other things that we're working on, give us a meaningful competitive advantage. And it's why we're so bullish about being a faster growing business in the future. Christopher Horvers : Yes. And that leads to my follow up. If you look back versus two years ago to try to neutralize versus what happened last year, your gross margins down 120, your operating margin is up more than 200 basis points, given the sheer gains and the sales leverage that you're driving. So you'll have continued gross margin headwinds. But as you think about the operating margin line into next fiscal year, is it fair to think that the operating margin can at least be flat if not better, as we look out, given the increased scale, and share gains that you've driven? Jamere Jackson : Well, we've done a couple of things in this environment where we've had accelerated sales. Number one, we've had outstanding leverage on the SG&A line, which quite frankly served as a little bit of a bill payer for some of the investments that we're making in gross margin. And we do have the ability as we move forward to continue to price in a very disciplined way, when we're in an environment where there's inflation. Quite frankly, that gives us an opportunity to price. And we are seeing cost inflation in certain categories.  But with a rational industry pricing environment, we're going to price to recover those inflationary impacts. So, going forward, as we think about managing the business, we're going to manage the business to maximize the cash that we generate inside the business, grow our EBIT dollars, that's going to give us tremendously powerful free cash flow.  And you can tweak margins by a point or a point and a half, doesn't change the underlying story here, which is this is a business that is generating a tremendous amount of cash. And we're putting that to work by investing in our existing assets. We're investing in our growth initiatives, and we're returning meaningful amounts of cash to investors in a meaningful way. That portion of the AutoZone model does not change even with all the things that we've talked about this morning in terms of investments. Christopher Horvers : Understood, thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is come from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Please proceed with your questions. Michael Lasser : Good morning. Thank you for taking my question, how are you? I got to be consistent and ask about price investment. The bottom line is still -- is it worth it? And to help frame this question, if you just take a 1% -- 1% investment in your price in this most recent quarter, what that means is $35 million of sales that you're investing back into price to get something more than that. In any given quarter prior to the pandemic, AutoZone would regularly see an average of $70 million in year-over-year sales increases. So now you're having to invest almost half that amount to drive these share gains. How do you find that point at which it really becomes worth it, especially as the longer that you do this, the more attention it's going to attract from your competitors? And one of the fundamental underpinnings of why investors allocate capital to the state is because of the margin stability. And this strategy could call into question that margin stability? William Rhodes : I understand your point about the $35 million investment is exactly right. And that's one of the things that we wrestled with over time as clearly there's a sales headwind before you even begin talking about -- picking up the gross profit dollars. But as I said earlier, Michael, we've tested this, we've tested it extensively for over a year. Again, these are very surgical pricing investments. They're not across the board. And yes, some of our commercial or our closest competitors may follow us. They may not on some of these things. But that's really not where our focus has been on making sure that we have the right value proposition.  It's been making sure that we're priced right with other competitors that are outside of the close in competitors. We feel like we're doing exceptionally well with that. I think also want to go back to what Jamere said.This strategy is not a pricing strategy. This strategy, which we have been working on for over three years now, it had the single largest technology investment in our company's history in it, where we rolled out handheld devices, where we improved our website all making us much easier to do business with, and substantially lowering our delivery times. We've continued to invest in the Duralast brand, which is -- that's one of the strongest brands in the automotive aftermarket, if not the strongest. People used to think that that was a headwind. Now people understand that as a tremendous asset. We've continued to roll out hubs and mega hubs, where we're substantially improving our immediate availability of parts and products.  So this is a holistic strategy of which pricing is an element of it. And I understand what you're saying that a lot of people have invested in this sector for years, because of the margin characteristics, not just gross margin characteristics, but the overall operating margin characteristics.  And Michael, you're -- you've been around long enough through. Remember in 2005, when I came into this role, and we made an SG&A investment. Everybody said, Okay, this is the beginning of the SG&A, or the beginning of the operating margins going from 17.5 down to 12. Well, what happened? Over time, we found a way to increase our operating margins. I'm not sure if that'll happen from here. But these are very marginal investments, to make sure that we are in the right competitive position against all channels. Michael Lasser : Okay. Got it. I think market can get a little bit more comfort, if you did a fix -- or very clear about a timeframe associated with it? It seems like what you're suggesting before, but we're going to do this for another four quarters, while it's going to be a bit more intense over the next cup or two. It should start after that so is it fair?  And then just a quick follow up for Jamere, how will a higher current commercial mix in the business in fiscal \u201822 impact the gross margin so we can frame out these two pieces as we try and model the business moving forward? Thank you. William Rhodes : Michael, before I turn that second part over to Jamere, I want to hit your earlier part. I was very clear, in my comment a few minutes ago, that as of now we have rolled out this commercial pricing initiative across the vast majority of the chain. And as Jamere said there is no Act 2 under development or under consideration.  So as we annualize this time next year, we'll be annualizing those investments. Jamere? Jamere Jackson : Yeah. So in terms of our commercial mix, we're very bullish about our commercial business. And, as we talk pretty extensively about today, and last quarter, we're investing in a disciplined way in our commercial business. This past quarter, our national accounts and our regional and local accounts both grew over 40%. We are pleased to see the Nationals actually snap back car counts are up, staffing has improved, miles driven is improving. And we're under penetrated. We think we're roughly a four to five share in a $75 billion category. So there's a tremendous opportunity to create a faster growing business here. And as we execute on this growth playbook and see significant share gains, we will likely be in a position where we see a little bit of a mixed drag from commercial on the overall margins. And that's going to be perfectly okay. This will be a faster growing and still high margin business as we move forward.  And, as we see that growth materialize, we'll be very transparent about what our expectations are. Michael Lasser : Okay, thank you very much, and good luck. William Rhodes : Thanks. Jamere Jackson : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is come from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions. Scot Ciccarelli : Good morning, guys. Love to ask a pricing investment question, but I just couldn't do that to you. William Rhodes : Thanks, Scot. Scot Ciccarelli : You're welcome. You talked about seeing product inflation starting to ramp. Can you talk about the potential impact on the cost side of the ledger, particularly on wages, given the current employment environment? Jamere Jackson : Yeah, so we're seeing cost inflation in certain categories. We're also seeing, some higher transportation costs. But as I said before, the industry pricing is rational. And this has always been an industry that's price to recover those inflationary impacts. And we're pricing accordingly in this environment as well.  Transportation costs in particular, we've had some contracted rates that are below the spot market. So this is protected us to some extent. But we'll see more of those as we move forward.  From a labor standpoint, it's a very tight labor market. And you have to look no further than, what you're seeing amongst other retailers or even in your local neighborhoods with the pressure that local restaurants are seeing. We're certainly not immune to those dynamics. But the value proposition of having a career opportunity at AutoZone, we think gives us a little bit of a competitive advantage. Our store operations teams and our distribution center teams, and our supply chains are doing a fantastic job of recruiting talent. We're working really hard to retain talent in this environment. And as -- we also believe that from a macro standpoint, as some of the enhanced unemployment benefits start to ease and be retracted. We think that will sort of unstick the labor market to a certain extent.  But all the efforts that we're doing inside of our company to attract talent, is quite frankly, one of the reasons that we've been able to put up the kind of numbers that we put up in both our DIY and our commercial business. Scot Ciccarelli : And Jamere, just as a follow up, is there any kind of estimate regarding what might happen to labor costs, if we actually did eventually get a federal mandated $15 an hour minimum? Jamere Jackson : Well, I think a couple of things will potentially happen there. One is that, we'll see labor costs start to go up in different environments. We're already seeing some markets where labor costs have gone up in that zip code. And what you have to be able to do is, more importantly, you have to be able to price accordingly, so that you don't have the margin and profitability drags.  And so when I think about the impacts of inflation, it isn't just what we're seeing in product costs, or transportation costs, but labor is a part of that equation. And we'll be disciplined enough to price accordingly, in that environment as well. William Rhodes : Let me jump in there. As you know, Scot, we've been dealing with accelerated labor inflation for some time for five years. And we have many markets where we're already at $15 or above. I was recently in Seattle. Our minimum wage in Seattle is $16.70. And we are figuring out a way to make sure that we manage through that. And part of that is our pricing has to be different when we have that kind of change in our labor component of our cost structure. Scot Ciccarelli : Excellent. Thanks a lot, guys. William Rhodes : Thank you, Scot. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Zach Fadem, Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your questions. Zach Fadem : Hey, good morning, guys. As we look back over the past year, your business has accelerated to a double-digit growth rate despite a double-digit decline in miles driven. And now that miles driven starting to recover and return to growth. Do you expect this dynamic to be a tailwind for your business, despite the tougher compares? Or are there any other puts and tastes that we should keep in mind? William Rhodes : Clearly, we said over a long, long period of time that miles driven is a good indicator of what -- of how our business is going to perform. However, we've also said and we said this back in the Great Recession, that in certain times, it's not a good predictor of what happens in our business.  Clearly, if you just straight line what happens to miles driven, you would never forecast what happened to us over the last year. Because miles driven were down significantly, but there was a new element called Federal Stimulus. And we were talking this morning that, a family of four, over the last four years or last four quarters has picked up over $10,000 in Federal Stimulus. That does not count, unemployed -- Enhanced Unemployment Benefits, that is just the stimulus.  For our customer, that's a tremendous amount of money. And many of those customers turn to their automobiles and enhanced them repaired them or whatever the case may be. Clearly, as miles driven return, there will be some small tailwind. But I don't think that it will be nearly enough to offset the headwind that will come from us lapping those tremendous amounts of economic stimulus that were in the environment. Zach Fadem : Got it. And Is it possible to break out the makeup of the commercial growth across new customers versus existing customers or nationals versus independents? And then, when you think about your average weekly commercial sales in that mid-13,000 range, was that relatively stable through the quarter? And is it fair to call that a new run-rate for the business? William Rhodes : We're calling it that internally. We're putting the pressure on the team, we got to keep that. I think that there's some level of stimulus. It's been in our commercial performance as well, but not nearly to the extent that it has helped accelerate the DIY business.  So we have big expectations to continue to grow commercial at fairly robust rates going forward. Clearly, the DIY piece will be more challenged as we head into Q4, and really frankly the next 12 months. But commercial we think, is a much stickier business. Yes, we picked up new customers. More importantly, we've penetrated our existing customers with new categories or deeper levels of their business.  As Jamere said, as far as the trade-off between the up and down the street customer or the national account customer. Before this quarter, our up and down the street business was performing much better than our national account business. This quarter, the national account business was generally in line with our up and down the street business. And as we talked to those leaders, their businesses have improved along the same lines. Zach Fadem : Got it. Appreciate the time today. William Rhodes : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is come from the line of Michael Baker with D.A. Davidson. Please proceed with your questions. Katy Hallberg : Hi, everyone, this is Katy Hallberg on for Mike Baker. Just want to say great job on the quarter. And I know you guys touched on recently about how stimulus might have impacted the commercial sales versus DIY. But I was kind of curious about within that 44% growth and commercial, how much would you attribute to the mega hubs? So kind of, tacking on the stimulus and the pricing initiative, curious about the mega hub impact? Jamere Jackson : Yeah, so parts availability is a big piece of the story that we have in the commercial market today. When we put a mega hub in a market, two things happen. Number one, we see a lift in sales in the four walls, if you will of the mega hub. But it also gives us an opportunity as we're selling to commercial accounts. It gives us an opportunity to tell the commercial accounts in that area, if you will, that we have parts available, significantly more parts available than we would otherwise. And that gives us a meaningful lift and sale.  So a big piece of that strategy that we've talked about is improving that assortment, putting mega hubs in the marketplace, signaling to the market, that we have more parts available in the marketplace. And then taking advantage of that that opportunity. We've talked about lots of things that drive our commercial business. But, in the top one or two is parts availability. If we have the parts, if we can get them there in a reasonable amount of time, they're competitively priced. We're easy to do business with that gives us a tremendous tailwind for this business. And that's what we're excited about. Katy Hallberg : Okay, great. Thank you. And then just sort of a follow up. And this is a more broad question. Where are you guys seeing the most opportunity for your share gains? I mean, does it seem like the industry is sort of through the thick of store closures as we're kind of approaching? What could be the end of the pandemic? And just kind of curious about what you're seeing in the industry? Thank you. William Rhodes : Yeah, I think the share gains that we got because of store closures were really over around May of last year. But we've continued to grow share gains, as consumer behaviors have changed.  Just think about not -- whether or not a store is open. But think about your own personal shopping habits. Are you going in more convenient, smaller box stores? I think we've seen a lot of that across all kinds of channels, including ours. And part of our desire is how do we -- now that we're getting those new customers or frankly, more so new occasions from existing customers. How do we make sure that we provide them a stellar shopping experience now and permanently change those shopping behaviors, so we keep those occasions going forward? That's what we're really focused on. Jamere Jackson : Yeah, just to build on that. One of the things we've been paying a lot of attention to internally, is just a tremendous success that we're having in our loyalty program. Our loyalty member sales are up 32% versus last year. And when I look at the stats around the number of members that are earning rewards, the number of members that are redeeming rewards, the spend for those loyalty customers relative to last year on a per transaction basis, and the retention rate, all of those numbers are up. And so that gives us a lot of confidence that, the things that we've done in terms of our in-store execution, are driving great results. So as we think about share gains are lots of things that are part of that mix including some of the dynamics that you talked about on a macro basis.  But our execution has just been fantastic in this environment. And the data around our loyalty programs certainly suggests that we're doing the right things. And those are the kinds of sales that are a lot stickier than, when you have non-member sales. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is come from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your questions. Brian Nagel : Good morning. Great quarter. William Rhodes : Good morning. Thank you. Brian Nagel : So the first question I want to ask, Bill, this goes back to early in your prepared comments. You talked about the cadence of sales through the period. So this -- where did you end? What was the exit rate is the quarter concluded?  And now just a bit of a follow up to all those questions. But if you look at the business now, do you think stimulus is still driving it now? Or was that largely been burned through? William Rhodes : We exited -- I don't have the numbers right in front of me, because I went through -- I quoted some of them in the script. And we were very intentional about that, that talk about those four weak differences. So that you can see, as we were -- before stimulus, we were seeing a slight deceleration of our sales coming out of Q2. Then when stimulus happened, I think we said we were up roughly 50%, I think it was 49.9.  And when we came out the other side, and on a two-year basis, we were still up 26.7 in those last four weeks. Our comps, as we exited the quarter, the last four weeks this year, were 14% with the last two weeks coming down to the mid-single digit range. So what we have seen is that stimulus -- those stimulus dollars that came in March. They stayed and had a lingering effect in helping drive our business longer than we would have expected.  Similar to what happened last summer, if you remember our business was really, really strong post the April stimulus. Now last year, you had the enhanced unemployment benefits at $600 a week versus $300 a week this year. So clearly, that will be a headwind as we look in Q4, but not completely. Does that help? Brian Nagel : No, it's very helpful. I appreciate it. Then my second -- I guess my follow up question would be something maybe bigger picture. But you look at the commercial business. And obviously a lot of cross currents at this point. But your commercials been a bright spot for AutoZone for a while. It's straight been here lately. As you look out there, what do you view? Is this still the slack within your model? And you're talking about opening the new -- the mega hubs and launching new programs? How should we think about the real drivers going forward as particularly as we pull out of this COVID crisis? William Rhodes : Well, as Jamere mentioned, we have 50 mega hubs now. We're on a path ever 100 to 110. So we will more than double the amount of mega hubs that we have today. And I will tell you, Jamere, who's in charge of store development, has a big bogey out there to make that happen very fast. And you'll see significant amount of mega hubs come online this quarter, and over the next year.  So I think that that will help us in a big way. As Jamere said, this business is about parts availability. It was that way when we started 42 years ago, it's still that way today. If you don't have it, you can't sell it. And we're getting parts closer and closer and closer to our customers.  I also talked about all this technology that we've rolled out. And we're still in the very early innings of that. We've seen reductions in our delivery times. But we are looking for significantly bigger, larger reductions in delivery times as this technology matures as our team understands how to utilize it and how to change. Getting parts and products frankly, out of the building is our biggest focus, not necessarily the drive time. Brian Nagel : Appreciate Thank you. William Rhodes : All right, thank you very much. All right. Before we conclude the call, I want to take a moment to reiterate that we believe our industry is strong, and our business model is solid. We're excited about our future growth prospects. But we take nothing for granted as we understand our customers have alternatives.  We have exciting plans that should help us succeed for the future. But I want to stress that this is a marathon and not a sprint. As we continue to focus on the basics and focus on optimizing long-term shareholder value, we are confident AutoZone will continue to be very successful.  Lastly, as we celebrate Memorial Day next Monday, we should remember all of our country's heroes, both past and present. We owe these Americans a tremendous debt of gratitude. Thank you all for participating in today's call. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Have a great day.",

And thank you for joining us today for AutoZone\u2019s 2021 fourth quarter conference call. With me today, are Jamere Jackson, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax. Regarding the fourth quarter, I hope you've had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not the press release, along with slides complementing our comments today, are available on our website, www.autozone.com under the Investor Relations link. Please click on quarterly earnings conference calls to see them. As I have said previously, throughout the pandemic, we could not deliver the kind of results we have without the outstanding performance of our entire team, especially our store and supply chain AutoZoners. As our sales volumes have remained at historic all time highs our AutoZoners continue to enthusiastically meet and embrace the challenge. As we say, they're going the extra mile for our customers and we owe them a tremendous debt of gratitude. I also want to reiterate our highest priority remains being committed to keeping all of our customers and AutoZoners safe. Thank you, AutoZoners. Again, you are remarkable. This morning we will review our overall same store sales DIY versus the DIFM trends, sales cadence over the 16 weeks of the quarter, merchandise categories that drove our performance and any regional discrepancies; we\u2019ll also share how inflation is affecting our costs and retails and how we think they will impact our business for the remainder of the calendar year. Okay. Onto our sales results, our domestic same store sales were an impressive 4.3% this quarter on top of last year's historic 21.8% growth. This time last year, we had no vision, none of delivering a positive comp this quarter, but our team once again performed at an exceptionally high level, congratulations again to AutoZoners everywhere. Our growth rates for retail and commercial were both strong with domestic commercial growth north of 21%. Our commercial business set a record this quarter with $1.2 billion in sales for the quarter, an incredible accomplishment. Additionally, we reached a new milestone in commercial sales surpassing $3 billion for the year finishing with over $3.3 billion in annual sales versus $2.7 billion in sales a year ago, an impressive 23% increase. We set new records in annual sales volumes per store reach $12,600 for the year up from $10,600 just last year. We continue to execute well in commercial and we couldn't be more proud of our team's recent success. I'm also very proud of our organization on our domestic DIY performance. We ran a roughly flat comp this quarter after increasing well over 20% in last year's fourth quarter, while our DIY two year stack comp decelerated some from the third quarter, we were expecting substantially more deceleration as we got further and further from the last round of stimulus back in March. We were quite pleased with the stability of our two year stack, same store sales. In commercial on a two year basis our sales were very consistent with last year's performance. Sorry, last quarter\u2019s performance. \\ Now let's focus on our sales cadence. This quarter stretched from early May to the end of August. The first eight weeks of the quarter, our comp was 3.1%. In the last eight weeks, our comp averaged 5.5%. The strength in the back half of the quarter was attributable to easier comparisons to last year. Given the dynamics of the past 18 months, we like others who've benefited from the lumpiness of the pandemic sales believe it is more insightful to look at a two year stack comp. For Q4 our two year comp was 26.0%. On a two year basis, our cadence for each four week period of the quarter was 26.8%, 28.2%, 25.5% and 24.0%. Our two year comp sales trends were remarkably strong and fairly consistent across the quarter. Regarding whether we experienced a noticeably warmer summer out west than in previous years, which helped our sales, but we experienced a milder summer in the Midwest and Northeast, which drove our sales to underperform the chain there. Overall weather impacts were neutral on our performance. Regarding the quarters traffic versus ticket growth, our retail traffic was down roughly 4% while our retail ticket was up 3%. This was expected as stimulus, stay at home orders and closures of big box retail automotive service departments drove outsized traffic last year. Our commercial business saw the vast majority of growth come from transaction growth from new and existing customers. It was encouraging for us to see sales trends remain strong this quarter, and we like the momentum we are seeing in both domestic businesses heading into fiscal year 2022. During the quarter, there were some geographic regions that did better than others as there always are. Across both our retail and commercial customer bases, we saw the Midwest, Mid-Atlantic and North-eastern markets underperform, roughly 400 basis points in comp versus the remainder of the country. The data suggests that we have actually gained some share in these markets. However, we believe the milder summer weather was a large contributor to our sales comp results there. And across the country in retail, our share trends remain strong despite the reopening of big box retailer\u2019s automotive service departments that were closed this time last year. We have been very pleased that we have retained the roughly 10% market share we gained in our retail sales floor business last year. Our number one priority continues to be the health, safety, and wellbeing of our customers and AutoZoners. On Q2\u2019s call we shared that we would provide every AutoZoner with a hundred dollar incentive once they completed their vaccination for COVID 19, that's every AutoZoner, including part-timers. This was the logical next step in our efforts to provide a safe working and shopping environment as we have with our on-going PPP efforts. We spent another $2.7 million in the fourth quarter reimbursing our AutoZoners for the vaccine. I continue to be inspired by our Board and management team's commitment to doing what is right, putting safety first, while caring deeply for our AutoZoners. We are strongly encouraging our AutoZoners to get the vaccine as our culture and values of taking care of one another have been on display for the past 18 months. Now let's move into more specifics on our performance for the quarter. Our same store sales were up 4.3% versus last year's fourth quarter. Our net income was $786 million and our EPS was $35.72 a share, 15.5% above last year's fourth quarter. Our domestic retail, same store sales were down slightly for the quarter while our commercial business remained remarkably strong. Commercial total sales grew approximately 21%. We averaged $74 million in weekly sales, which was approximately $14,400 in sales per program per week, which was easily an all-time record for us. The initiatives that we have in place are meaningfully helping our commercial business. I'll remind you that this is a highly fragmented $75 billion market, and we believe our product and service offerings provide us a tremendous opportunity to significantly grow sales and market share over time. Next I'll talk about trends across our merchandise categories, particularly in the retail business. Our sales for categories continue to outpace the hard part categories with categories like wipers, fluids and lighting all showing string. Our hard parts business was in line with our expectations. Ran roughly flat with last year. We were especially pleased as last year our hard parts business was very strong, especially in categories like batteries. We believe our hard parts business will continue to strengthen as our customers drive more. Let me also address what we are seeing from inflation and pricing in our space. This quarter, we saw our retail sales impacted positively by about 2% year-over-year from inflation, while our cost of goods was basically flat. We believe both numbers will be higher in the first quarter as cost increases in many merchandise categories work their way through the system. We can see low single digit inflation in retails as rising raw material, labor and transportation costs are impacting us and our suppliers. We have no way to say how long it will last, but our industry has been disciplined about pricing for decades. While we continue to be encouraged with the current sales environment, it is difficult to forecast near term sales. What I will say is this past quarter sales were better than we expected, and we exited the fiscal year with strong fundamentals in our business. For FY 2022, our sales performance will be led by the continued strength in our commercial business as we execute on our initiatives, both DIY and commercial have gained considerable share that we are maintaining. And we believe that we are in an industry that is positioned for solid growth for the long term. We will earn our fair share and we hope to exceed expectations. In addition, we continue to believe our products and services will be in high demand during more difficult economic times. And this resiliency gives us significant confidence about our future prospects. As we progress through the year, we will as always be transparent about what we are seeing and provide color on our markets and outlook as trends emerge. Now, I will turn the call over to Jamere Jackson. Jamere? Jamere Jackson : Thanks, Bill. And good morning, everyone. As Bill mentioned, we had another great quarter. Our growth initiatives are continuing to deliver strong results and the efforts of our AutoZoners in our stores and distribution centers have enabled us to maintain strong results. To start this morning, let me take a few minutes to elaborate on the specifics in our P&L for Q4. For the quarter total auto parts sales, which includes our domestic, Mexico and Brazil stores, were $4.8 billion up 8%. And for the total year, our total auto parts sales were $14.4 billion up 15.9%. Now let me give a little more color on sales and our growth initiatives. Starting with our commercial business, for the fourth quarter, our domestic DIFM sales increased 21% for $1.2 billion and were up 31% on a two year stack basis. Sales to our DIFM customers represented 24% of our total sales and our weekly sales per program were $14,400 up 18% as we average $74 million in total weekly commercial sales. Once again, our growth was broad based as national and local counts all grew over 20% in the quarter. For the full year, our commercial sales grew 22.6% and 29% on a two year stack basis. Our execution of our commercial acceleration initiatives is delivering exceptional results as we focus on building a faster growing business. The disciplined investments we're making are helping us grow, share, and we're making tremendous progress in growing our business in this highly fragmented portion of the market. We now have our commercial program in over 86% of our domestic stores, and we're focused on building our business with national regional and local accounts. This quarter, we opened 72 net new programs finishing with 5,179 total programs. We continue to leverage our DIY infrastructure and increase our share of wallet with existing customers. And fiscal year 2022 commercial growth will lead the way. Our growth strategies continue to work as we continue to grow share. We are confident in our strategies and execution and believe we will continue gaining share. We remain focused on delivering improvements in the quality of our parts, particularly with our Duralast brand, making improvements in our assortment, maintaining competitive pricing, and staying committed to providing an exceptional service. These core focus areas have enabled us to drive double-digit sales growth for the past five quarters and position as well in the marketplace. As we move forward, we're focused on our core initiatives that we believe will accelerate our sales even further. Let me highlight one key initiative that is driving our performance and positioning in us for an even brighter future in our commercial and retail businesses. And that's our mega hub strategy. Our mega hub strategy has given us tremendous momentum, and we are doubling down. We now have 58 mega hub locations, and we expect to open approximately 20 more over the next 12 months. As a reminder, our mega hubs typically carry roughly a hundred thousand SKUs and drive tremendous sales lift inside the store box, as well as serve as a fulfilment source for other stores. The expansion of coverage and parts availability continues to deliver a meaningful sales lift, to both our commercial and DIY business and we're testing greater density of mega hubs to drive even better sales results. With this effort, we are leveraging sophisticated analytics to help us expand our market reach, give us closer proximity to our customers and improve our product availability and delivery times. I will remind you that our current mega hub strategy envisions our expansion to a total of a 100 mega hubs to 110 mega hubs. However, as these assets continue to outperform our expectations, we would expect to expand significantly further. We are excited about this work and its ability to further accelerate our commercial growth. All of our efforts are building meaningful, competitive advantage and give us tremendous confidence in our ability to create a faster growing business. On the retail side of our business, our domestic retail business was down just 40 basis points, but up 23.4% on a two year stack. For the full year, the retail business was up 11.2% and 18.7% on a two year stack basis. The business has been remarkably resilient as we have gained and maintained nearly 300 points of market share since the start of the pandemic. We are excited about the initiatives that drove the tremendous sales and share growth and the relentless focus on execution by our AutoZoners in our stores and distribution centers has been remarkable. We are winning in the marketplace and the execution of our AutoZoners who are taking care of our customers remains a key competitive advantage. As we exit fiscal 2021, I'm really pleased with the competitive positioning of our DIY business and our outlook going forward. The work we have done on improving the customer shopping experience, expanding assortment, leveraging our hub and mega hub network and maintaining competitive pricing have led to tremendous results over the last two years. DIY has been a strong contributor to the growth of our company and while comps are difficult because of our strong past performance, the fundamentals of our business have never been stronger. Our strategy and execution are delivering solid results. Now I'll say a few words regarding our international business. We continue to be pleased with the progress we're making in Mexico and Brazil. During the a quarter, we opened 29 new stores in Mexico to finish with 664 stores and five new stores in Brazil to finish with 52 on a constant currency basis. We saw accelerated sales growth in both countries. Most importantly, as those economy stabilize, we remain committed to our store opening schedules in both markets and expect both to be significant can contributors to sales and earnings growth in the future. Now I'll say a few words regarding our international business. We continue to be pleased with the progress we're making in Mexico and Brazil. During the quarter, we opened 29 new stores in Mexico to finish was 664 stores and five new stores in Brazil to finish with 52. On a constant currency basis, we saw accelerated sales growth in both countries. Most importantly, as those economies stabilized we remain committed to our store opening schedules in both markets, and expect both to be significant contributors to sales and earnings growth in the future. Now let me spend a few minutes on the P&L and gross margins. For the quarter, our gross margin was down 82 basis points driven primarily by the accelerated growth in our commercial business, where the shift in mix coupled with the investment in our initiatives drove margin pressure, but increased our gross profit dollars by 6.4%. I mentioned on last quarters call that we expected to have our gross margin down in a similar range to our third quarter where we were down 118 basis points. However, the team has been focused on driving margin improvements primarily through pricing actions that offset inflation to drive a better than expected outcome. As Bill mentioned earlier in the call, we're beginning to see cost inflation in certain product categories along with rising transportation costs. To be clear overall, we have pricing power, and consistent with prior inflationary cycles, we have been successful thus far at passing these higher cross through our retails. Overall the industry pricing remains rational and we're pricing accordingly. All of the actions we're taking have resulted in us growing our DIY and DIFM businesses at a significantly faster rate than the overall market. And we're committed to capturing our fair share while improving our competitive positioning in a disciplined way. We should expect our margins in the first quarter to be down in a similar range to the fourth quarter. We are however focused on driving new customers to AutoZone and overtime, growing absolute gross profit dollars at a faster than historic rate in our total autoparts operating segments. Moving to operating expenses, our expenses were up 9.2% versus last year's Q4 as SG&A as a percentage of sales deleverage 33 basis points. The deleverage was primarily driven by higher payroll expenses to support our sales and customer service initiatives and higher IT investments that underpin our growth initiatives. These dynamics were partially offset by lower pandemic related expenses in the previous year. While our SG&A dollar growth rate has been higher than historical averages, we've been focused on maintaining high levels of customer service during a period of accelerated growth and taking care of our AutoZoners during these difficult times. We will continue to be disciplined on SG&A growth as we move forward and manage expenses in line with sales growth over time. Moving to the rest of the P&L, EBIT for the quarter was just over $1 billion up 2.6% versus prior year\u2019s quarter driven by strong top line growth. EBIT for fiscal year 2021 was just over $2.9 billion up 21.8% versus fiscal year 2020. Interest expense for the quarter was just over $58 million down 11.5% from Q4 a year ago as our debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was just under $5.3 billion versus just over $5.5 billion last year. We're planning interest in the $46 million to $48 million range for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 versus $46 million in last year\u2019s first quarter. For the quarter, our tax rate was 20.3% versus 22.3% in last year's fourth quarter. This quarter's rate benefited 215 basis points from stock options exercise, while last year it benefited 35 basis points. For the first quarter of 2022, we suggest investors model us at approximately 23. 6% before any exemptions on credits due to stock option exercises. Moving in net income and EPS, net income for the quarter was $786 million up 6.1% versus last year's fourth quarter. Our diluted share count of $22 million was lower by 8.1% from last year's fourth quarter, the combination of higher earnings and lower share count drove earnings per share for the quarter to $35.72 up 15.5% over the prior years fourth quarter. Net income per share for fiscal year 2021 was $95.19 up a remarkable 32.3% reflecting our outstanding top line performance and lower share count. Now, let me talk about our cash flow. For the fourth quarter, we generated $1.3 billion of operating cash. Our operating cash results continued to benefit from strong sales and earnings previously discussed. You should expect us to be an incredibly strong cash flow generator going forward, and we remain committed returning meaningful amounts of cash to our shareholders. Regarding our balance sheet, we now have nearly $1.2 billion in cash on the balance sheet and our liquidity position remains strong. We are also managing our inventory well as our inventory per store growth was up four tenths of a percent versus Q4 last year. Total inventory increased 3.7% over the same period last year, driven by new stores, net inventory defined as merchandise inventories, less accounts payable on a per store basis was a negative $203,000 versus negative $104,000 last year and negative $167,000 last quarter. As a result, accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 129.6% versus last year's Q4 of 115.3%. Lastly, I'll spend a moment on capital allocation and our share repurchase program. We repurchased $900 million of AutoZone stock in the quarter. As of the end of the fiscal quarter, we had approximately 21.1 million shares outstanding. At quarter end, we had just over $418 million remaining under our share buyback authorization and over $900 million of excess cash. For the full year, we bought back $3.4 billion of stock, or approximately 2.6 million shares. The powerful free cash flow we have generated this year combined with excess cash carried over from last year has enabled us to buy back over 11% of our shares outstanding at the beginning of the year. We have bought back nearly 90% of the shares outstanding of our stock since our buyback inception in 1998, while investing in our existing assets and growing our business. We remain committed to this disciplined capital allocation approach, where we expect to have powerful free cash flows that will enable us to invest in the business and return meaningful amounts of cash to shareholders. So to wrap up, we had another very strong quarter highlighted by strong com sales, which drove a 6.1% increase in net income and a 15.5% increase in EPS. We are driving long term shareholder value by investing in our growth initiatives, driving robust earnings and cash and returning excess cash to our shareholders. Our strategy is working and I have tremendous confidence in our ability to drive significant and ongoing value for our shareholder. Now I'll turn it back to Bill. William Rhodes : Thank you, Jamere. Nice job. Also, congratulations on your one year AutoZone anniversary that you celebrated last week. Jamere Jackson : Been fantastic. William Rhodes : As we start a new fiscal year, I'd like to take a moment to discuss our operating theme for the New Year. It is go the extra mile. And we will be hosting our annual national sales meeting here in Memphis next week to formally announce this theme. Being in person for the first time in two years, yes, we are going to host our AutoZoners who are vaccinated and wearing masks in person, and we are going to celebrate all they have accomplished over the past two years. I can't tell you how excited I am about next week. 2022 will again be focused on superior customer service and flawless execution. In fiscal 2022, we are launching some very exciting initiatives. We will be announcing some significant expansions to our supply chain to fuel the growth of our domestic and Mexico businesses. We are also targeting to open 20 new domestic mega hubs in the U.S. that will enhance our ability and support growth in our retail and commercial businesses. We'll open approximately 200 new stores throughout the Americas with notable acceleration in our Brazil business. These capacity expansion investments reflect our bullishness on our industry and our own growth prospects. We are being disciplined, yet we are being aggressed. Lastly, I want to reiterate how proud I am of our team across the board for their commitment to servicing our customers and doing so in a very safe manner. At the start of the pandemic last year, we could never have guessed the positive impact it would have had on our sales. First and foremost, our focus will be on keeping our Autozoners and customers safe while providing our customers with their automotive needs. And secondly, we must continuously challenge ourselves during these extraordinary times to position our company for even greater future success. We know that investors will ultimately measure us by what our future cash flows look like three to five years from now. And we welcome that challenge. I continue to be bullish on our industry and in particular on AutoZone. Now, we'd like to open up the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Please proceed with your questions Bret Jordan : Hey, good morning guys. William Rhodes : Morning, Brett. Jamere Jackson : Good morning, Brett. Bret Jordan : On the share gain, could you give us a little bit more color I guess, as far as you know, where the share is coming from, is it warehouse distributors or from other two step distributors? And then, I guess are there particular categories that you're seeing relative outperformance and then I guess the cadence. You talked about maintaining the 10 points of share you'd picked up last year, is that slowed post COVID disruption. Are you still seeing the share gains continuing? William Rhodes : Yes. Terrific. So I'm going to bifurcate it and talk about retail and then come back and talk about commercial and then Jamere if you'll jump in and clarify anything if I miss it. Sorry. I had a mask on. First of all, on the retail business, we have very quantifiable data that we receive. It is not on the hard parts business. So think about it as everything in front of a parts counter, including batteries and spark and plus batteries and spark plugs. So we have real live data that is a larger set of data than just our traditional close in competitors. So we have facts there. We grew share very significantly this time last year. And as we began to lap those largest share gains in our company's history, we anticipated we might lose some of that share. We haven't lost any of it. I mean, it's on the margin. It's slightly positive, slightly negative month to month. But we basically grew our share in that dataset by 10%. So we moved from roughly 30% share to 33% share. I've never seen anything like that. And I'm really proud of our organization for sustaining that share over time. On the commercial side of the business, we don't have that kind of quantifiable data, but we obviously look at what's going on in the overall market. We look what's going on with our close in competitors and other competitors. And it's pretty clear when you're growing in these kinds of growth rates that we are significantly outgrowing the market probably by multiples two or three times the market growth. Where all is it coming from? You probably has as good insights into that as we do, we look at the, the publicly available data. We see that we're, we're doing very, very well in both the retail business and the commercial business. I think that the standout for us right now is the growth that we have in the commercial business. And our belief is it's because of not the pandemic, it's because of the initiatives that we've embarked on over the last three years, as we implemented this latest round of strategy work, where we're really working on making sure we've got the best parts coverage, we're continuing to amplify the Duralast brand. We've got great people doing great things. We're rolling out our mega hub strategy. Now we've implemented some technology to help us be more efficient. And we've also made sure that we're priced right, not necessarily versus our close in competitors, but we've looked deeper and looked at the warehouse distributors and making sure that our value proposition is appropriate for the kind of service that we're delivering. So those are my thoughts. Jamere, do you have anything to add? Jamere Jackson : Yes, I think a couple things stand out to me. One is that, as you mentioned, our business has been remarkably resilient and you combine that with a great execution that we have, and it's, it's striving exceptionally strong results. As we get further away from the lumpiness of the stimulus payments, I mean, it's clear that our share gains have been maintained. Bill talked about what we're seeing on the, on the sales floor market share. We've got great results and readouts from our loyalty programs that give us a lot of confidence. And our teams are doing a great job of executing. On the commercial side, we're continuing to see those significant share gains behind the business that are behind the initiatives that Bill talked about. And a couple of things really stand out to me, it's broad base. So it's national accounts and it's local accounts that are growing over 20%. We've seen the national snap back over the last year as car counts are up and staffing is improved and miles driven is improving. And our team is doing a fantastic job of executing with those customers. So we have a tremendous amount of confidence as we move forward into the year, and this is helping us create a faster growing business. Bret Jordan : Great. Thank you. And Jamere, just a quick question on the accounts payable, I think that's a record at 129% of inventory. Is there a number or a range we should think about that being in going forward? Can it get it go higher than this? Jamere Jackson : It's benefited over the last year, quite frankly, because our terms have been up significantly in an accelerated sales environment. We don't expect us to go much higher than, than where we currently are. But we're continuing to do all the things that we can to manage working capital both with our suppliers and with our partners and but I wouldn't expect it to go much higher just based on the tremendous amount of [turns] (ph) that we've had over the last year or so. Bret Jordan : All right. Great. Thank you. Jamere Jackson : Thank you, Bret. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your questions. Greg Melich : Thanks. I really had two questions. One you mentioned 200 stores in the Americas. Could you sort of walk us through the breakdown of what would be domestic and then those other markets and basically is that a, a run rate we should use going forward? If you look about, look at the opportunities and I have a follow-up. Jamere Jackson : Yes. You can expect us to be in that zip code probably for the next couple of years or so. Roughly two thirds of that or more are going to be in and sort of the U.S. market if you will. We've, we've been looking at doing 150 to 170 stores, or so based on the opportunities that we see in the marketplace. You could see us do, 30 to 50 stores in Mexico, depending on the market conditions or so, and then, the remainder coming from Brazil. I think the good news for us is that we see tremendous market opportunities, both in the U.S. and in Mexico. And we talked about on our previous earnings call that we've been testing our market potential in Brazil for really the last decade or so and we think Brazil can be a very big market for us. So we've got great potential there. We've made some leadership team changes as well. So Tom Newbern is leading our international efforts going forward. Tom is a fantastic operator, has a ton of experience. And we look forward to that being a much bigger part of our story and our strategy as we go forward. Greg Melich : Great. And then the second question is linked to product availability and inflation. I think you mentioned that costs are going up, industries rationally passing it through. Was it fair to say the fourth quarter that inflation is maybe now running three to four in the top line, and how you think about that going forward? William Rhodes : Yes. We're not seeing it at that level yet Greg. I think we will see it at that level. As you know, it takes some time for those price increases to work themselves through the system. And right now is, is a little bit different in that you're seeing direct product cost inflation, but the, the hyperinflation that we're seeing frankly, is in the transportation, or are not directly in all the product costs. And so we're having to be thoughtful about how do we ultimately pass those price increases or cost increases on through retail prices in both the domestic, both the retail and the commercial businesses. We think that you will see it more in the range you're talking about in Q1 and Q2, if not even a little bit higher, but that seems to be where we're headed. Greg Melich : Got it. And the product supply there hasn't been an issue in terms of getting products? William Rhodes : No, there are absolutely significant issues in getting products. This we are running the lowest level of in stock that I can ever remember. It's, it's, 3% or 4% below where we normally run, it moves from one category to the other. This is the most difficult supply chain environment that I have ever seen, but I will tell you, our supply chain and merchants are working it so well. And so closely with our vendors and finding new suppliers along the way where we have to in the spot market or other areas that I think we are doing competitively. And when I say competitive, I'm talking about retail in general. I'm very proud of where we are, but very dissatisfied with it on a historical basis. Greg Melich : Got it. But competitively you feel you\u2019re in a better than typical spot in your space, just that is tight out there. William Rhodes : Yes. And, and Greg, I think, we looked at our outperformance versus the market in both retail and commercial. The one piece that we really didn't highlight that I would highlight is AutoZone has been known as an execution machine for decades long before I got here. And I think that our core flawless execution has been a big contributor to our success over the last 18 months in these uncertain times. Greg Melich : Right. Well, congrats to you and the team. William Rhodes : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your questions. Christopher Horvers : Thanks. Good morning guys. So you spoke to a two year contracts over a while with some moderation in July, and then in August. Can you share what that trend looked like for the DIY versus the commercial side of the businesses or, or what drove that to moderation? And then related to that, as you think about August did given the easier comparing DIY, did that flip back the positive on a one-year basis? Jamere Jackson : Yes. So if you, if you look at the trends that we saw. I mean, we saw most of the moderation, obviously in our DIY business where our comps were significantly higher last year in the fourth quarter. But a couple things stand out to us. Again, as we move further and further away from the, the lumpiness is the stimulus payments that we talked about. Our business was, was pretty resilient. And so our business actually outperformed our expectations. Our commercial business has been just remarkably resilient as well. And, if you think about the commercial business, it's a lot stickier. The relationships that we built with our commercial customers is, is driving that business. And as we see the macro environment improve, and those are things like car counts, those are things like miles driven. The fact that our commercial customers are, are staffing have been able to, get their staffing levels back to where they need to be. That, that business has been very, very strong, as we, as we exited the quarter. As been our past practice, we typically don't you know, talk about what we see in the, in the early innings of, of the, the following quarter. But what I will say is that, as we, as we exited the fourth quarter we were very pleased with the trends that we were, we were seeing. And it gives us a lot of confidence about not only the first quarter, but the year in total. Christopher Horvers : And then so did DIY in that last four weeks that you spoke to, to DIY turned back to being positive? Jamere Jackson : It was, it was, close to being flattish in that last four weeks or so. And again, when we get to the first quarter, we got much easier comps if you will. So that ought to give you some idea of what we're seeing in terms of trends moving into the first quarter. Christopher Horvers : It makes a lot of sense. So I guess on the pricing side so, so just to summarize there, it doesn't sound like you've seen any sort of fall out because of unemployment insurance expiring here in September. On the price side, you've invested in price and DIY to retain the share commercial to retain the share. How do you feel about where your price gaps are in the market currently in, in our things playing out the plan, i.e. there's not a necessarily a step up here from a price investment perspective that you feel you need to make to, in order to continue these great share trends? Jamere Jackson : Yes. We believe the price investments are behind us. And, when we look at the moves that we made last year, we're going to start the anniversary, those going into this year. And as we said, the strategy is working. I mean, we, you see it in the numbers. We put on the board in terms of our DIY results and our commercial results and price has just been one element of the strategy. So all the other things that we've talked about from an execution standpoint, and making sure that we have the right assortments, the investment that we've made in our products, the technology that we have on the commercial side, those things combined with competitive pricing have underpinned the growth story that you see here. So as we're in this inflationary environment, as Bill mentioned, we're being very disciplined. We're moving retails up on the commercial and in the DIY side, the industry has been very rational. But we're maintaining those competitive price differentials if you will, that have underpinned the share growth that we've seen over the last year or so. And that's what's really important. It's not an absolute price point of view is, if you will, but it's a relative price point. But as we have opportunities to take price up, we're certainly doing that. Christopher Horvers : Awesome. Have a great fall. Thanks very much. William Rhodes : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Please proceed with your questions. Michael Lasser : Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Bill, the industry has seen tremendous DIY growth over the last several quarters as consumers have largely been staying at home, have had more time on their hands to do projects on their cars. Why wouldn't the industry give a lot, a lot of that volume back as we get back to some sense of normalcy? And if that's the case, how can you manage its P&L to maintain the algorithm that the market to cut from the theme [ph] from models on. William Rhodes : Terrific question, Michael, I'll take the first part. I'll let Jamere figure out the second part. On the sales side, your logic is very sound. If you look at the, our business overall is up roughly 25% versus pre pandemic levels. You've been watching this industry for a long time. I've been watching it longer and, it's generally a nice grower, but in the, the industry grows around 4% a year to grow 25% over 18 months is pretty phenomenal. I think, as we said, in our prepared comments, we expected our sales to step down some this summer that we saw the last round of stimulus in March. Every time we've seen stimulus, we can see a direct correlation to our sales really grow at an exponential rate when that happens and then tail off some, but they never go back to where they were. And we spent a lot of time talking about the share gains that we have seen because we, we do think that that is beyond what's going on with COVID. I think it's somewhat related to COVID in that our teams have done a really, really good job of making sure that we have product of making sure that our customers and our AutoZoners feel safe in our stores. I would encourage, we've spent a lot of money making sure that we create a safe environment in our stores. And I would encourage you all to go in our stores and go look at us versus our competitors. Go look at us versus other retailers. It is a very, in this interesting time, a very comfortable shopping environment, as comfortable as you can find, I believe. And so I think that customers have changed their shopping behaviors. They're not necessarily wanting to go to a big box store. I think there are some online retailers that deemphasized this category during the pandemic. And, fortunately for us, we don't give guidance because it would be very difficult to tell you what's going to happen in Q3 or Q4, just like it would have been difficult to tell you this time last year, what would happen in Q4 this year? We are very confident that we will win in the marketplace by leveraging our flawless execution. The industry trends will be the industry trends, but I would refer you all back to think about on a long-term historical basis. There have been before this period three times in my career where I've seen substantially above industry performance or industry performance above the norm. And that was in '93 and '94 01 and 02, 09, 10 and 11. All of those were coming out of very difficult economic environments. This pandemic seems to be behaving a lot like that, just in an exponential fashion. What was the interesting thing out of those most the best times that we've seen was following each one of those times, we didn't step back down as an industry to where the performance was before. Well, we have some step down as an industry maybe, but I don't expect it. And I certainly don't expect AutoZone to go back to the levels that we were performing at before. It will step back a little bit, maybe, I don't know, cause this is unchartered waters, but I do think we have reintroduced ourselves to some customers. And I think our existing customers have started relying on us on a more frequent basis. And I believe many of those shopping habits will have changed forever. On the commercial side of the business, I think it's somewhat related to the pandemic. I think we're winning in a big way in the marketplace. I think we have changed our competitive position because of all the initiatives that we have. So I am, and I think we are quite bullish on the long term of the commercial business. Jamere, I'll let you talk about the P&L. Jamere Jackson : Yes. From a P&L standpoint, here's the interesting thing for us. I mean, we have a tremendous amount of confidence in our business going forward. And if you recall, this is a business that has an algorithm that works at low to mid-single digit top line growth with high margins, that's fits off a lot of cash that we invest in our existing assets. We invest to grow our business and we return a lot of that to shareholders. Over the last couple of years or so we've had the opportunity to have outsize top line performance, and you've seen us ratchet up the things that we've done. So we've increased the level of investments that we've made in our existing infrastructure. We talked about, what we're doing to expand the capacity in our distribution centers and our supply chain. Bill talked about it in his, in his comments this morning. You've seen us invest in our, in our growth initiatives and we've had an outsize return to shareholders. So the algorithm works. It's worked for us in the past. It's worked for us through this environment where we've had accelerated sales, where we've done even more than we've done in the past. And we've got a tremendous amount of confidence in our growth prospects going forward. We're going to have tremendous financial firepower to grow this business and return cash to shareholders. And that quite frankly, is the AutoZone algorithm. Michael Lasser : Very helpful. And my follow-up question is you seem to suggest that your gross margin is starting to stabilize either because you have lacked some of the price investments that you've made, or there's other factors that, that will also contribute your gross margins on pace to be 52.7% this year which is down almost a hundred basis points from, from the peak. So are you suggesting that you can get back to the peak level or now that you you've we based it lower, this is the right way to think about the gross margin moving forward. William Rhodes : Yes, I think we're not projecting that we're going to get back to any particular level, Michael. I think what we are saying is for the most part, the actions that we have taken in retail are done, many of those actions are behind us. We are very pleased with the competitive position that we have. We've always been pleased with our competitive position with our close in competitors, but we've looked a little bit beyond that, to those competitors, that I\u2019ll call or a half a step away. In the commercial business, we took much more significant pricing actions. And they were on the margin in DIY. They were fairly significant in commercial, but we finished those actions at the beginning of, of this past quarter call it in June. So, and those took some time to roll in. We started it with six markets and we went to 14 markets and we rolled it to the chain. So we're beginning to annualize the first smaller tranches of that. And we will annualize that in in the beginning of next year's fourth quarter. We feel really good, really good about the actions that we've taken. They are an element, not the element of our strategy, but as you can see in our commercial performance, we were winning in the marketplace in a big way. So we will annualize that in nine months or so. We do not have the next tranche of pricing strategies that we are planning to do in DIY or in commercial. This was, this is what we wanted to do. And I think we're very pleased with how both have played out. Jamere Jackson : Yes. The only thing that I'll add there is that our core capability inside the company, hasn't changed. The things that we've historically worked on in terms of assortment the awesome work that our, our merchants have done over the years, the things that we see in terms of the industries, pricing dynamics, those things haven't changed. So, the core fundamentals and the core capability of the business hasn't changed over time. I've often said that, as we go through these dynamics, we tend to look at gross margins and pricing at a point in time. But over the long term, we've been very, very disciplined. As we've seen inflationary impacts hit the business, we've been very disciplined about raising pricing. And I've, I've often said that inflation is our friend in that, in that we're in that regard. So our core capabilities to expand margins hasn't changed. What we've done as Bill said is, we made some fundamental changes in terms of where we needed to be competitively in certain categories that have improved the growth rate of our business and nothing else about our businesses has changed. So all the great work that we've done in the past, we still have that capability going forward. Michael Lasser : Very helpful. Thank you so much. William Rhodes : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question has come from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your questions. Simeon Gutman : Hey everyone, a nice results. Maybe continuing on the gross margin thread maybe a comparer phrase what I heard from the last answer, which is, after these price investments we sort of that's the new base. And then from there, we could move into, the, where we were pre these price investments, which could have been up a little down a little sort of subject to the normal Jamere you said inflation, maybe mixed issues. But is there anything different about the go-forward once we laughed at these price investments and how you think the gross margin progresses? Because I think previously it's flattish maybe even up a little bit, is there anything wrong with that thought process in, in the out year? Jamere Jackson : I think you said it better than I did Simeon. The only thing that I would add to it is, and you mentioned mix. If our commercial business continues to grow at a substantially accelerated rate versus our retail business, that'll provide incremental headwind. Simeon Gutman : Okay. Got it. Okay. That's fair. And then my follow-up, maybe it is it's for you Bill, because you're, you had the quote in the press release about aspiring or aiming for growth prospects in this current fiscal year. I assume you're mentioning, it's meant to be sales curious if it can be sales and EBIT or one could be without the other. And then, 2022 is a complex year because of what you're lapping. Is there any reason we shouldn't be back to algo by 2023? The only thing different I heard on the call was just additional capital investments, Bill that you mentioned in terms of investment, not sure if those hit the P&L any different, but if you can speak about, theoretically the, the out year progression. William Rhodes : Yes. It's a, it's an interesting way out. I would've told you FY 2022 would have been the normalized year this time last year Simeon, but I just can't tell you what's going to happen in the environment. I mean, we're sitting here take, we'll get people with mask on. Jamere and I are taking our mask on and off to answer questions. I would have never dreamt we were here in June, right? We all took our mask off and we're done with them. And here we are with Delta variants, so I can't tell you what's going to be in front of us. I do think the algorithm of the company is not going to change. The only thing that you highlight that is different right now is we will spend a little bit more on CapEx. One of the things that we've learned is, is that we probably operated our supply chain to the optimal level as I keep calling it to three decimal points. We didn't plan our supply chain to have sustained 25% surge in volume for 18 months. That has put an enormous strain on our facilities, more importantly on our people. So as we think about the future, we're going to be a little bit more aggressive. We're going to have a little bit more capacity in our supply chain to handle the volatility that we have seen for the first time in my career over this period of time. So that that'll be, over, over a couple of year period, probably a couple of hundred million dollars a year in incremental capital that we'll spend. But as we've said, all along our capital allocation strategy is one, continue to invest in the existing assets that we have to have them perform at an optimal level. Two, invest in every growth aspect that we can, that will provide us a reasonable investor IRR, and then three, whatever we have left over we'll return to shareholders, that algorithm is going to stay the same. I hope in 2023, we're back to whatever normal is. It will be interesting to see what happens in the sales environment as, as we enter whatever the new normal is. I can understand people think that the sales environment might be challenged as we lap these enormous growth in FY 2020 and 2021. I would have thought the same thing a year ago. I'm getting more and more confident that some of this is structural and some of this is permanent. What percentage your guess is as good as mine, because I've never seen a global pandemic before. Simeon Gutman : Got it, okay. Good luck. Thanks. William Rhodes : Thank you, Simeon. Operator : Thank you. Our final questions come from the line of Liz Suzuki with Bank of America. Please proceed with your questions. Liz Suzuki : Great. Thank you. So I guess first, just a question on, on same skew inflation you mentioned that the retail business had about two percentage points of benefit there, was that consistent in the commercial channel as well? William Rhodes : Yes, we saw similar inflation in both retail and commercial. Liz Suzuki : Great. And as we think about just modeling the impact of cost increases, when did you really start to experience an acceleration of cost inflation? And as you set out that inventory, could there be a period where you're able to raise price on product sold that may have been acquired before costs really went up, which would enable some gross margin expansion, just as we think about modeling the cadence of the sell in versus sell out, how should we think about that? William Rhodes : Yes, it's a good point. We started to see the cost inflation really at the tail end of the third quarter and pretty much all of the fourth quarter. And, our merchants have done a fantastic job of negotiating timing and also done a fantastic job of making sure that we got retails raised in a way that kept us competitive in the, in the marketplace. And the way that, costs actually ended up flowing through the system. You typically will have a little bit of margin accretion at least in the early endings, as you raise retails before all of the costs increases, make their way through. And to the extent that, we see price increases come, there are times where we actually move a little bit early. So those are things that can actually help you at least in the near term get a little bit of margin accretion and get out ahead of what you're seeing from an inflation standpoint. And that's no different than, what we've done in the past. Liz Suzuki : Yep. Great. And just, sorry, one more follow up just on, on cost. Just as you think about rising wages, what's your average, entry-level minimum wage for at AutoZone and what are your expectations for how that could trend going into next year? Jamere Jackson : Yes, we really haven't disclosed our average entry level wage, but what I, what I will tell you is for the last four years, I've been talking about, we've been operating in the toughest labor and market I've ever seen, and that our wage inflation has been significant. It has basically doubled the wage inflation during this period of time. It is very, very difficult to get new AutoZoners to join the company. I hear that from all of our retail peers. Fortunately in the last five weeks or so we, things have changed a little bit. I don't know if that's directly related to the change in enhanced unemployment or not. But we have seen a meaningful improvement in the ability to hire people in both the distribution centers and the stores over time. But we are dealing with the most significant inflation in the labor market that I've ever seen. And really don't anticipate that slowing down materially until the labor market frees up some. William Rhodes : Yes, it's a, it's a macro issue. And certainly we're not immune to the market dynamics there. What else is that, we've done a very good job of sort of managing it. Our operations teams, both on the stores and the supply chain side are working really hard to manage turnover in this environment. We've been competitive in the marketplace. And then, when it, when it's all said and done, we do have pricing power that underpins our capability to price, to deal with the influx of the impacts of inflation, whether it's product costs or transportation costs, or what we're seeing in terms of labor. And that's, that's one of the things about this industry, the discipline in this industry that gives us a lot of confidence. Liz Suzuki : Great. Thanks very much. William Rhodes : Thank you. Okay. Before we conclude the call, I want to take a moment to reiterate. We believe our industry is strong and our business model is solid. We'll take nothing for granted. As we understand our customers have alternatives to shopping with us. We'll continue to focus on the basics as we strive to optimize shareholder value in FY 2022 and beyond. We thank you for participating in today's call and have a great fall. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. We appreciate your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Have a great day.",

And thank you for joining us today for Autozone\u2019s 2022 first quarter conference call. With me today, are Jamere Jackson, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax. Regarding the first quarter, I hope you've had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not the press release, along with slides complementing our comments today, are available on our website, www.autozone.com under the Investor Relations link. Please click on quarterly earnings conference calls to see them. As we begin, we want to continue to stress that our highest priority remains the safety and wellbeing of our customers and AutoZoners. Everyone across the organization takes this responsibility very, very seriously, and I am very proud of how our team has responded. Since the start of the pandemic, we've reiterated consistently that we could not deliver the kind of results we have without the exceptional efforts of our entire team, especially our store and supply chain AutoZoners. As our sales volumes have remained at historic all-time highs, our AutoZoners continue to go the extra mile and surprise and delight our customers by providing WOW customer service regardless of the myriad of challenges that are thrown their way. As part of saying thank you to our AutoZoners this past quarter, the company committed $9 million to the AutoZoner Assistance Fund. The Assistance Fund is an independent non-profit whose primary mission is to provide assistance to AutoZoners who find themselves in a very difficult place. We are very fortunate to be able to help our AutoZoners in this way. To me, it's yet another example of our organization living consistent with our values. We can't thank our team of roughly 105,000 AutoZoners enough for all they do for our customers, each other, our communities, and ultimately our shareholders. This morning we will review our overall same store sales, DIY versus the DIFM trends, our sales cadence over the 12 weeks of the quarter, merchandise categories that drove our performance and any regional discrepancies. We'll also share how inflation is affecting our cost and retail, and how we think they will impact our business for the remainder of the fiscal year. Okay, on to our sales results. Our domestic same-store sales were an impressive 13.6% this quarter on top of last year's very strong 12.3%. Our team once again executed at an extraordinarily high level and deliver amazing results. Congratulations again to AutoZoners everywhere. Our growth rates for retail and commercial were both strong, with domestic commercial growth impressively north of 29%. Commercial set a first quarter record with $900 million in sales. I was reflecting on that this morning and remembering back to the day that we cracked $1 billion in commercial sales for a full year. And now we've delivered 900 million in sales in one quarter, an incredible accomplishment. On a trailing four quarter basis, we had over $3.5 billion in annual commercial sales versus $2.8 billion a year ago, up 27%. We also set a record in average weekly sales per store for any quarter, reaching over $14,400 versus $11,500 just last year. On a two year basis, our sales accelerated from last quarter, exceeding 40%. Many people want to understand what is driving our tremendous sales growth in commercial. In short, it is not one thing, and I want to repeat that it is not one thing. It's a host, a whole host of key initiatives we've been working on for several years. Those initiatives include improved satellite store availability, massive improvements in hub and mega hub, coverage and access, the continuing strength of the Duralast brand, leveraging technology to make us easier to do business with and amplifying our execution strength to improve delivery times, enhancing our Salesforce effectiveness and engaging our store operations team deeper in the business and ensuring that we live consistent with our pledge by being priced right for the value proposition that we deliver. We continue to execute very well in commercial, and we are extremely proud of our team and their performance. We're also very proud of our organization's performance in domestic DIY. We ran a 9% comp this quarter on top of last year's 12.7%. Wow. While our DIY two year stat comp decelerated slightly from our fourth quarter, it's remarkable to reflect on a more than 20% two year comp in this sector of our business. From the data we have available to us, we continue to not only retain the enormous 10% share gains we built during the initial stages of the pandemic, but modestly build on those gains. Our performance considering the amount of time from the last stimulus and the ending of the enhanced unemployment benefits has substantially exceeded our expectations and raises our expectations on how sustainable these sales gains may be long term. Now let's focus on our sales cadence. Same-store sales increased sequentially from September through November. However, this acceleration could be deceiving as last year's comp weakened as the quarter progressed. Given the dynamics of the past 20 months, we like others who've benefited from the pandemic believe it is more instructive to look at two-year stacked comps. On this basis, the monthly results were almost identical and very, very stable. For Q1, our two year comp was 25.8% and the four week periods of the quarter increased by 26.3%, 26.0%, and 25.3% respectively. Regarding weather, we experienced warmer than usual weather in the north-eastern United States, while the remainder of the country experienced normal trends. Overall, we feel weather did not play a material role in our sales results for the quarter. As we look forward to the winter months, we are encouraged to see forecast estimating a slightly colder than usual winter. Historically, extreme weather be that hot or cold helps drive parts failure. Regarding this quarter's traffic versus ticket growth and retail, our traffic was up 1% while our ticket was up 7.5%. This low-single-digit transaction count growth continues to be a meaningful acceleration from pre pandemic levels, although it decelerated versus last year as expected due to the elimination of stimulus to reduce the elimination of enhanced unemployment, stay at home orders, and the closure of some big box retail automotive service departments last year. In our commercial business, we saw most of the sales growth come from transaction growth from new and existing customers. It was encouraging for us to see sales trends remain strong and we continue to be pleased with the momentum we are seeing in both domestic businesses heading into the winter months. During the quarter, there were some key geographic regions that did better than others as there always are, while last quarter we saw roughly 400 basis point gap and comp performance between the northeast and Midwestern markets versus the remainder of the country. We did not see that gap this quarter. In fact, the northeast and Midwestern markets slightly outperformed. The market share data suggests that we continue to gain share in most markets across the country. Now let's move into more specifics on performance for the quarter. Our same store sales were up 13.6% versus last year's first quarter, our net income was $555 million, and our EPS was $25.69 a share increasing an impressive 38.1%. Regarding our merchandise categories in the retail business, our sales floor and hard parts categories grew at a similar rate this quarter. As Americans get back to driving more, we've seen maintenance and failure related categories perform well. We've been especially pleased with our growth rates and select failure related businesses like batteries that have successfully left very strong performance last year. We believe our hard parts business will continue to strengthen as our customers drive more. Let me also address what we are seeing from inflation and pricing. This quarter, we saw our sales impacted positively by about 4% year-over-year from inflation. While our cost of goods was up about 2%, on a like-for-like basis. We believe both numbers will be higher in the second quarter as cost increases in many key merchandise categories continue to work their way through the system. We could see mid-single digit inflation and retails as rising raw material pricing, labor and transportation costs are all impacting us and our suppliers. We have no way to say how long this will last, but our industry, our industry has been disciplined about pricing for decades and we expect that to continue. While we continue to be encouraged with the current sales environment, it remains difficult to forecast near to midterm sales. What I will say is that the past three quarter sales have all been consistent on a two year stat comp basis. And both our DIY and commercial businesses have been remarkably resilient. While it's difficult to predict absolute sales levels, we are excited about our growth initiatives, our execution and the tremendous share gains we have achieved in both sectors and are maintaining and/or continuing to grow those gains. Currently, the macro environment while more uncertain than normal, is certainly favorable for our industry. And if these near term trends fade, we believe that we are in an industry that is positioned for solid growth over the long term. For FY 2022 our sales performance will be led by the continued strength in our commercial business as we continue executing on our differentiating initiatives. As we progress through the year, we will as always be transparent about what we are seeing and provide color on our markets and outlooks as trends emerge. Now I like to turn the call over to Jamere Jackson. Jamere? Jamere Jackson : Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everyone. As Bill mentioned, we had a strong second quarter, our growth initiatives continued to deliver strong results. And the efforts of our AutoZoners in our stores and distribution centers have enabled us to take advantage of robust market conditions. To start this morning let me take a few minutes to elaborate on the specifics in our P&L for Q1. For the quarter, total auto parts sales, which includes our domestic Mexico and Brazil stores were $3.6 billion up 16.2%. Let me give a little more color on sales and our growth initiatives. Starting with our commercial business for the first quarter, our domestic DIFM sales increased 29.4% to $900 million, and were up 41% on a two year stack basis. Sales to our DIFM customers represented 25% of our total sales, and our weekly sales per program were $14,400 up 25% as we averaged $75 million in total weekly commercial sales. Once again, our growth was broad based as national and local accounts both grew over 25% in the quarter. Our execution of our commercial acceleration initiatives is delivering exceptional results as we focus on building a faster growing business. The discipline investments we're making are helping us grow, share, and we're making tremendous progress in growing our business in this highly fragmented portion of the market. We now have a commercial program and approximately 86% of our domestic stores and we're focused on building our business with national, regional and local accounts. This quarter, we open 32 net new programs finishing with 5211 total programs. We continue to leverage our DIY infrastructure and increase our share of wallet with existing customers. As I said on last quarters call, in fiscal year 2022 commercial growth will lead the way and our first quarter results reflect this dynamics. Our growth strategies continue to work as we continue to grow share, we are confident in our strategies and execution and believe we will continue gaining share, delivering quality parts particularly with our Duralast brand, improved assortments, competitive pricing and providing exceptional service has enabled us to drive double digit sales growth for the past six quarters. Our core initiatives are accelerating our growth and position us well in the marketplace. And notably, our mega hub strategy is driving strong performance and position us for an even brighter future in our commercial and retail businesses. Let me add a little more color on our progress. As I mentioned last quarter, our mega hub strategy has given us tremendous momentum and we're doubling down. We now have 62 mega hub locations, and we expect to open approximately 16 more over the remainder of the fiscal year. As a reminder, our mega hubs typically carry roughly 100,000 SKUs and drive tremendous sales lift inside the store box as well as serve as a fulfillment source for other stores. The expansion of coverage and parts availability continues to deliver a meaningful sales lift to both our commercial and DIY businesses. And we're testing greater density of mega hubs to drive even stronger sales results. By leveraging sophisticated predictive analytics and machine learning, we're expanding our market reach, driving closer proximity to our customers, and improving our product availability and delivery times. These assets continue to outperform our expectation, and we would expect to open significantly more than 110 locations we have previously targeted. In commercial, we are building a meaningful competitive advantage, and we continue to have confidence in our ability to create a faster growing business. On the retail side of our business, our domestic retail business was up 9% and up 21.4% on a two year stack. The business has been remarkably resilient as we have gained to maintain over three points of market share since the start of the pandemic. As Bill mentioned, we saw an increase in traffic versus the prior year as our initiatives are continuing to drive tremendous sales and shared growth along with a relentless focus on execution by our AutoZoners in our stores and distribution centers. These initiatives include improving the customer shopping experience, expanding assortment, leveraging our hub and mega hub network and maintaining competitive pricing. These dynamics along with favorable macro trends and miles driven, a growing car park and a challenging new and used car sales market for our customers have continued to fuel sales momentum in DIY and the execution of our AutoZoners were taking care of our customers gives us a key competitive advantage. I'm also very pleased with the competitive position of our DIY business and our outlet going forward. Our in-stock positions while still below where we would like for them to be are continuing to improve as our supply chain and merchandising teams have made great progress in a challenging supply chain environment. We've been able to navigate supply and logistics constraints, and have product available to meet our customer\u2019s needs. DIY has been a strong contributor to the growth of our company, and while comps are difficult because of our strong past performance, the fundamentals of our business remain strong. Now I'll say a few words regarding our international business. We continue to be pleased with the progress we're making in Mexico and Brazil. During the quarter, we opened two new stores in Mexico to finish with 666 stores and one new store in Brazil to finish with 53. On a constant currency basis, we saw accelerated sales growth in both countries. We remain committed to our store opening schedules in both markets and expect both to be significant contributors to sales and earnings growth in the future. With approximately 10% of our store base now outside the U.S. and our commitment to continued expansion in a discipline way, international growth will be an attractive and meaningful contributor to Autozone\u2019s future growth. Now let me spend a few minutes on the P&L and gross margins. For the quarter, our gross margin was down 65 basis points driven primarily by the accelerated growth in our commercial business, where the shift in mix coupled with the investments in our initiatives drove margin pressure, but increased our gross profit dollars by 14.9%. I mentioned on last quarters call that we expected to have our gross margin down in a similar range this quarter as we saw in the fourth quarter of last fiscal year where we were down at two basis points. However, the team has been focused on driving margin improvements primarily through pricing actions that offset inflation to drive a better than expected outcome. As Bill mentioned earlier in the call, we're continuing to see cost inflation in certain product categories along with rising transportation and distribution center costs. We are continuing to take pricing actions to offset inflation and consistent with prior inflationary cycles, the industry pricing remains rational. We would expect our margins in the second quarter to be down in a similar range as the first quarter. All of the actions we have taken have resulted in us growing our DIY, and DIFM businesses at a significantly faster rate than the overall market. And we're committed to capturing our fair share while improving our competitive positioning in a discipline way. We're laser focused on taking care of our existing customers, driving new customers to AutoZone, and over time, growing absolute gross profit dollars at a faster than historic rate. Moving to operating expenses, our expenses were up 10.4% versus last year's Q1 as SG&A as a percentage of sales leveraged 171 basis points. The leverage was driven primarily by our strong sales results. While our SG&A dollar growth rate has been higher than historical averages, we've been focused on maintaining high levels of customer service during a period of accelerated growth and taking care of our AutoZoners during these extraordinary high sales growth times. We're also investing in IT to underpin our growth initiatives and these investments will pay dividends in user experience, speed and productivity. We will continue to be disciplined on SG&A growth as we move forward and manage expenses in line with sales growth over time. Moving to the rest of the P&L, EBIT for the quarter was $754 million, up 22.6% versus the prior year\u2019s quarter driven by strong top line growth. Interest expense for the quarter was $43.3 million down 6.3% from Q1 a year ago, as our debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was just under $5.3 billion versus just over $5.5 billion last year. We're planning interest in the $45 million range for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 versus $46 million in last year\u2019s second quarter. For the quarter, our tax rate was 21.9% versus 22.2% last year's first quarter. This quarter\u2019s rate benefited 159 basis points from stock options exercise, while last year had benefited 134 basis points. For the second quarter of fiscal 2022, we suggest investors model us at approximately 23.6% before any assumption of credits due to stock option exercises. Moving to net income and EPS, net income for the quarter was $555 million, up 25.5% versus last year's first quarter. Our diluted share count of $21.6 million was lower by 9.1% from last year's first quarter. The combination of higher earnings and lower share count drove earnings per share for the quarter to $25.69 up 38.1% over the prior year's first quarter. Now let me talk about our cash flow. For the first quarter, we generated approximately $800 million of operating cash flow. Our operating cash flow results continue to benefit from the strong sales and earnings previously discussed. You should expect us to be an incredibly strong cash flow generator going forward and we remain committed to returning meaningful amounts of cash to our shareholders. Regarding our balance sheet, we now have nearly $1 billion in cash on the balance sheet and our liquidity position remains strong. We're also managing our inventory well as our inventory preferred was up a 10th percent versus Q1 last year. Total inventory increased 3% over the same period last year driven by new stores. Net inventory defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable on a per store basis was the negative $207,000 versus negative $99,000 last year and negative $203,000 last quarter. As a result, accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished a quarter at 129.4% versus last year's Q1 of 114.1%. Lastly, I'll spend a moment on capital allocation in our share repurchase program. We repurchased $900 million of AutoZone stock in the quarter. At the end of the fiscal quarter, we had approximately 20.7 million shares outstanding. At quarter end, we had just over $1 billion remaining under our share buyback authorization and just under $700 million of excess cash. The powerful free cash we generated this quarter allowed us to buy back approximately 2.5% of the shares outstanding at the beginning of the quarter. We bought back over 90% of the shares outstanding of our stock since our buyback inception in 1998, while investing in our existing assets and growing our business. We remain committed to this disciplined capital allocation approach where we expect to maintain our long term leverage target in the two and a half times area and generate powerful free cash flows that will enable us to invest in the business and return meaningful amounts of cash to shareholders. To wrap up, we had another very strong quarter highlighted by strong comp sales, which drove a 25.5% increase in net income and a 38.1% increase in EPS. We're driving long term shareholder value by investing in our growth initiatives, driving robust earnings and cash, and returning excess cash to our shareholders. Our strategy is working and I have tremendous confidence in our ability to drive significant and on-going value to our shareholders. Now, I'll turn it back to Bill. William Rhodes : Thank you, Jamere. Fiscal 2022 is off to a stellar start. And we continue to be focused on superior customer service and flawless execution. That in our culture is what defines us. From July 4 1979, when our first store opened in Forrest City, Arkansas, customer service has been paramount to our success. At the end of the day, it is why customers come back to us whether they are a seasoned professional or a new DIY. They trust us. They trust us to help them with their needs. We continue to be bullish on our industry and in particular, on our own opportunities for the New Year. We believe the macro backdrop is in our favor for the foreseeable future. Our customers across the Americas want to get out, get out and drive. And we'll be there when they need helpful advice. Our team has worked diligently and collaboratively with our suppliers. And together they have done a very good job dealing with the enormous supply chain challenges that exist for all retailers. While we are not where we'd like to be on our store in stock levels, we believe we are better than most real retailers. And I think our results support that belief. For the remainder of fiscal 2022, we are launching some very exciting initiatives. We are focused on further growing share, but as always doing so on a very profitable basis. We will be announcing significant expansions to our supply chain to fuel the growth of our domestic and Mexico businesses. We are also targeting to open 16 more new domestic mega hubs in the U.S. that will enhance our availability and support growth in our retail and commercial businesses. We will also be leveraging our hub and mega hub strategy further in Mexico. For the fiscal year, we will open more than 200 new stores throughout the Americas with notable acceleration in our Brazil business. These capacity expansion investments reflect our bullishness on our industry and our growth prospects. We are being disciplined, yet aggressive. Before we move to open up the call for questions, I want to take a moment, a moment to give special thanks to Mark Finestone, our Executive Vice President, Strategy and Innovation, customer satisfaction on his upcoming retirement in early calendar 2022. Our company, our customers, our leadership team, and in particular, our AutoZoners have greatly benefited from Mark's 19 years of remarkable service. Mark spent the majority of his years with AutoZone leading our merchandising team, and has played a critical role leading our supply chain and marketing teams in recent years. He leaves our organization much, much better than he found it and leaves us well positioned for accelerated growth. We thank Mark for his amazing service and leadership with the company. And we wish he and his wife Cindy well in their well-deserved retirement. I also want to reiterate how proud I am of our team across the board for their commitment to servicing our customers and doing so in a very safe manner. First and foremost, our focus will be on keeping our AutoZoners and customers safe while providing our customers with their automotive needs. And secondly, we must continuously challenge ourselves during these extraordinary times to position our company for even greater future success. We know that investors will ultimately measure us by what our future cash flows look like three to five years from now. And we, we very much welcome that challenge. I continue to be bullish on our industry and in particular, on AutoZone. Now, we'd like to open up the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Bret Jordan at Jefferies. Your line is live. You may begin. Bret Jordan : Hey, good morning, guys. William Rhodes : Good morning, Bret. Bret Jordan : Hey, on the commercial comp, it really seems like the super hubs are a tailwind? Do you have any color as to how the comps are for stores that are serviced by a super hub versus those that are not and maybe the benefit we might get as you roll out more super hubs? William Rhodes : Yes Bret, it's really hard to tease that out, and I\u2019ve spent considerable time in our prepared remarks talking about it. I think a lot of people think that this success that we're seeing in commercial is either driven by the mega hubs or driven by pricing. And frankly, that's not what we believe. We talked about it about four years ago that we were launching a new strategic plan or developing a new strategic plan for our commercial business, and it has a whole host of elements, mega hubs is a critical part of it. But don't forget, we also refreshed the assortments in every single AutoZone store in the United States and put those assortments commercial leaning forward. But the mega hubs are helping us a tremendous amount, but so is the Duralast brand, so is our sales floor, so is our engagement of our store managers and district managers. We see the mega hubs in and of themselves perform exceptionally well. They continue to exceed our expectations. And as we've said, we're going to go to 100 to 110. Like we've also said that Jamere and the senior leadership team believe once we're finished, we'll be closer to 200 mega hubs than we will be 100 mega hubs. But that's a vision at this point in time, not a plan. Bret Jordan : Okay, and then my follow up, I guess you talked about share gain, and that your in-stocks were better than most. Do you have any feeling for where you're retaining your share, I guess against smaller WDs against the big box or sort of your major aftermarket peers? Do you have a feeling sort of buckets of where your share gain came from and where you're holding it best? William Rhodes : Yes, I think it's a tale of two stories. Right on the DIY side of the business. Clearly, there were some significant share gains that happened in the depths of the pandemic and the stay at home orders where we did pick up a lot of share from mass retailers. We anticipated that we would have a pretty good headwind starting in last August, but But that simply hasn't manifested itself, and I think what's happened is customers that were coming to us before experienced us during the midst of this crisis and really enjoyed their experience, our team did a great job. So I think it's still coming from those more mass oriented and the retail side of the business. On the commercial side of the business, we believe it's likely coming from the smaller players, you mentioned, WDs. But I think over time, what happened was a lot of people, when the sales went down in our industry by about 25%, overnight, a lot of people in our industry pulled back considerably. Some people furloughed people, they laid off people, they took their order -- inventory orders down significantly, we certainly took some actions. We never furloughed one person. We never terminated one person because of the pandemic. In fact, we gave them two extra weeks of vacation, we called it emergency time off. And so when all of a sudden the business rebounded very quickly, we were in a terrific place. And I think that gave us trial in the commercial business with a lot of folks that we might not have gotten trial as quick as we did otherwise. And when we were there for those customers, I think that they appreciated the whole host of offerings that we had. And we've continued to grow since then, mean that to be up 40% on a two-year basis is really astounding, and to be up 29% in this quarter alone, I just couldn't be more pleased of what our team has done and we believe this is just the beginning. We've talked about the importance of the commercial business for a long time. And we're still the fourth in market share and that's not where we want to be, and I'm excited about what's in front of us. Bret Jordan : Right, thank you. William Rhodes : Thank you Bret. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Simeon Gutman at Morgan Stanley. Your line is live. You may begin. Simeon Gutman : Good morning everyone. Not sure if Mark\u2019s in the room, but congratulations to him. My first question Bill is on the demand environment. There was a lot of buzz, positive buzz at Apex this year probably more than it's ever been. I'm curious if you share the optimism, is there anything unique about this moment whether it's used cars, why the demand environment could be above average for the foreseeable future? William Rhodes : Yes, thank you for your shout out to Mark, Simeon. He's been just a tremendous partner to all of us for all these years. And, and I think about the AutoZone that Mark inherited versus the AutoZone that that he leaves to the rest of us, and it's a very different place and he played an enormous role in that as did so many others. But thank you for that. You know, I share your thoughts, Simeon, at Apex, there was a different vibe than probably we've ever seen before. I was kind of hoping everybody would be down and out because I knew how our sales were performing and I hoped we were doing very different than everyone else. I think it's just a great reminder of the strength of this industry. If you think about this industry over a very long period of time, I just celebrated my 27th anniversary with AutoZone, seen a lot of different cycles. One of the things that has happened, the strongest performing periods in our 30, last 30 years have been \u201893, \u201894, \u201801, \u201802, \u201809, \u201810 and \u201811. That is before the pandemic. The pandemic has blown away those performance. In each one of those environments, you've seen AutoZone\u2019s performance maybe more than the industry but the industry also make a step function change up significant growth in the midst of a recession. What has been remarkable is in each of those times, you've never seen the industry or our sales, take a step back down, not even partially back down towards it. It's as if we reached a new plateau. And we just stayed there until we built again. I think my expectation with the pandemic and the amount of sales that we saw, particularly in the retail business, from the depths of the stay at home orders and all those things was, we would see somewhat a reversion to the mean, and here we sit today, it's December, the last stimulus happened in March 15. The enhanced unemployment ended at the end of August 1 or September. And we would have thought we would have seen some deceleration which we have not seen -- our business on both sides of the business, a 9% comp in DIY is remarkable. And so we'll be interested to see how long it holds at this level. I wish we had a crystal ball and could tell you, but I know that this organization is focused on how do we optimize our performance in the midst of whatever sales environment we have? How do we make sure we're taking care of customers? How do we make sure that we're keeping AutoZoners and customers safe? And how do we make the P&L work and maximize our performance? And I think we've done a really good job of that. And I'm very proud of the organization so far. Simeon Gutman : Okay, thanks for that. And then my follow up, I\u2019m not sure if it's for you, or Jamere. On the gross margin side if commercial, comps and DIY coms end up growing at a similar amount, and I realized that that may not happen, but if they do, what happens to gross margin? We're trying to isolate, I guess the mix shift and maybe the invest -- you know, how much investment is happening in the business? Jamere Jackson : Yes, so if you think about gross margins, first of all, I'll say this, we've been seeing cost inflation in certain categories and higher transportation costs. However, the industry pricing has been rational, and we're pricing to recover inflationary impacts, as we've done in the past. And as Bill mentioned, from a retail pricing standpoint, where we've raised retails in sort of mid-single digit range, the industry has been disciplined and rational. And quite frankly, inflation has been our friend in terms of retail pricing. But I will remind you, as you highlighted here is that our commercial business will be a mixed drag. And right now we're significantly outpacing DIY growth on the commercial side of the business. And so that's been a margin drag. In fact, all of the margin drag in this quarter can be attributed to that acceleration that we have in our commercial business. So going forward, it will be a drag on the business and, but that will be good for us as a business because we'll see our gross profit dollars growing which is exactly what we're what we're shooting for. So we like where we are, we're going to continue to lean into the strategy. You'll see a little bit of a drag from a margin standpoint, from commercial mix, but net net it will be good for our business in total. Simeon Gutman : Thanks, everyone. Happy holidays. William Rhodes : Hey you too, Simeon. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Michael Lasser at UBS. Your line is live. You may begin. Michael Lasser : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Bill you mentioned at this point in the cycle the perception was that the DIY business was going to be comping negative as you pointed out it comes up 9% in the quarter, with a little less than half of it likely coming from price increases to why has it not slowed otherwise? The perception early in the pandemic was that the marginal or incremental customer was that more affluent consumer who was working from home had more time on their hands, is doing some work on their car. As a result, is that still the incremental customer? Or has it evolved? Even some of the underlying dynamics like fewer new car sales similar to the other factors? William Rhodes : Yes, it\u2019s a fantastic question. Michael, I wish I could tell you with certainty, it was built by x, y, and z. Let me just share some of our thoughts. But our thoughts are evolving. And we don't have clear insights into the strength of it, which we're [Indiscernible] to have, but we can't explain every element of it. Clearly an element right now is increased inflation. So our traffic count is positive, slightly positive in the retail business. Normally, because of changes in technology, and the improvement of quality of parts, we've typically had, three, three and a half percent deceleration in in transaction count. So despite the enormous customer count growth we had last year, we're still growing customers and growing them much faster than we have, let's say on average over the last 10 years. But we also have an inflation benefit. Let\u2019s call it 4% or so on top of that. So that is a significant element. When we believe, what we believe was the biggest thing that happened to us in the pandemic, was we had a lot of what I call our financially fragile customers. Those lower socio economic customers that had two things that they don't typically have. They had time because many of them were furloughed, and they had money, because they were living off of stimulus and significant enhanced unemployment. We anticipated as those two things ended in March 15 of 21 and early September 21, on enhanced unemployment, that we would see it slow down. I think there are some other dynamics that are happening. You mentioned new and used car sales. One of the things that we believe has happened in the recessions over the years as people change their perspective on how long they're going to keep their car. And so they focus on how they maintain it right versus thinking they're going to get a new car in six months, so don't worry about it. I think this environment of new car shortages and use car prices being up I think the last time I saw it, something like 38% I think people in particular are more challenged economically, customers are thinking I'm going to have this car for a long time. I better take care of it. And I think that also, all levels of consumer appear to still be very, very healthy financially, versus historical norms. And as we've seen for years, any period where there's a tax refund or something, we see a big spike in our business stimulus, we saw big spikes in our business. So I think the fact that they still have more discretionary income than normal bodes well for our business, it's showing up in our results and likely stays with us for some period of time. How long, your guess is as good as mine. Michael Lasser : My guess isn't that good? So I'm sure you're a little bit better. But my follow on hasn't\u2026 William Rhodes : Mine hasn\u2019t been very good, either. Michael Lasser : My follow up question is on one of the key debates on your investment case right now is what is the algorithm look like? Moving forward historically, AutoZone\u2019s algorithm has been monitoring store growth, 2% to 4%, comp, stable margins and healthy share repurchases to deliver double digit EPS growth. Jamere made the point that you're building a faster growing business. So does the algorithm change moving forward, especially if commercial sustains its recent increases in puts pressure on your gross margin? Would you be willing to accept a formula over the long run where you have a slightly higher same store sales growth? Even if that meant about the same gross profit dollar growth that you've had historically cause it comes with gross margin pressure over the longer run? And as part of that I think Jamere mentioned that cost inflation is 2%. Price increases were 4%. You saw gross margin benefit this quarter from that spread? Doesn't that reverse in the quarters ahead? Thank you. William Rhodes : Yes, three very complex questions. I think the answers are yes, yes and yes. Let me start and then I'll let Jamere talk about it as well. Yes, we've had a long term algorithm that says you know how do we grow store count that 2% to 3%? How do we grow EBIT growth in the 3% to 5% in normal times, and maybe faster in these recessionary environments? How do we leverage our consistent and predictable free cash flow to share to do share repurchases that push us in and around double digit EPS growth for a sustained period of time? You remember, Michael, we had, I think, 41 consecutive quarters of double digit EPS growth. So that's still long term generally, the model that we believe. However, we've had the most incredible six straight quarters we've ever seen. There could be a deceleration to get us to whatever the new normal is, I would have thought we would have experienced that. By now, I feel better about our sustainability of holding on to these significant sales growths over a longer period of time at different levels than I would have thought six and 12 months ago. But once so we may have a slowdown at some point. But I don't believe once we get to whatever the new normal is that the algorithm changes any. You asked would we be willing to grow the commercial business at a faster rate at the expense of gross and operating margin percentages? And I would say an emphatic yes. We are focused on how we grow gross profit dollars and operating profit dollars at an accelerated rate, while we make sure we get great returns, and I think any organization's running a roughly a 40% ROIC, we've proven that we know how to how to leverage our capital structure. Jamere, anything that you would say differently, or do you want to address his last point? Jamere Jackson : No, I think a couple things stand out to me. And Bill answered your question. I think very clearly, our goal has always been to grow our gross profit dollars. We have the luxury of having in this environment, a faster growing business with higher margin dollars overall. And I would argue this as a more sustainable way to grow cash and ultimately shareholder value. What doesn't change in the about the algorithm is the most important part of the algorithm, which is, this is a business that is going to generate a tremendous amount of cash that enables us to grow our business and return a significant amount of cash to shareholders over time. So as we've gone through this, this period, and we see an opportunity to accelerate the growth in our commercial business, by creating a faster growing business overall, it's ultimately meaning that we're a more profitable company on a $1 basis, and that's going to lead to more cash. And we're going to grow the business and return a significant chunk of that to shareholders. So long term, what I've been saying is that, while the geography changes a little bit, the algorithm at the bottom line doesn't change. This is a business that generates a ton of cash, and has tremendous firepower to grow and return cash to shareholders. Michael Lasser : Anything to add about the timing between price increases and cost increases? Jamere Jackson : Yes, so from the standpoint of price increases, and cost increases, we've been very disciplined about making sure that when we see cost increases coming, we've taken retail pricing, sometimes we will take those in anticipation of those cost increases, there's a there's usually a catch up over time. But what I will say to you is that this is a pretty dynamic market, and that there are always pricing opportunities and cost increases that are that are coming our way. Our teams have done a tremendous job of managing this mix such that, we've historically found ways to have margin accretion when we go through this environment. And the most important part of that is that this is an industry that has been disciplined and rational and we expect this to continue. So we don't expect, ultimately for the cost increases, to be a margin drag over the business. We've done. We've done a fantastic job of managing that dynamic in the past and will continue to do so in the future. Michael Lasser : Thank you very much. Best of luck and have a good holiday season. Jamere Jackson : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Zach Fadem at Wells Fargo. Your line is live. You may begin. Zachary Fadem : Good morning, guys. First I want to follow up on Michael's last question. If you look at your business over the last three to four years, your commercial mix has shifted from roughly 20% of your sales mix to now closer to 25%. While your EBIT margins have expanded by about 100 basis points during this time. So the question is as your business continues to evolve and you start to think about 30% or 35% commercial mix, how does this impact your EBIT margins? And to what extent should we view that 19%, 20% level as sustainable with or without the change in mix? Jamere Jackson : Well, I think a couple dynamics are associated with that. Number one, the commercial business naturally will be a margin drag for us just based on the nature of the business. But you've got to remember we have a large DIY business, that we are continuing to drive efficiencies and margin expansion in that DIY business over time, such that there isn't a cliff associated with margins over time. So what you can expect from us is that we'll continue to push, to drive margin expansion in our in our business, overall, commercial will be a drag, but we'll continue to work on things from a productivity standpoint, and naturally, you may, you may see some of that impact our EBIT margins. But from a total EBIT dollar standpoint, we'll be in pretty good shape. And it will be a great story. And again, I always come back to this notion that from an earnings standpoint, from a cash standpoint, the most important part of this algorithm is that we're going to have tremendous firepower to grow the business and return a bunch of cash to shareholders. William Rhodes : Let me jump in on that, too, Zach. I think when you look at what's happened over the last three or four years, to margins, you need to make sure that we don't lose sight of what happened to our DIY business over the last two years. Our same store sales and DIY are up 20% on a two year basis. We are getting a ton of leverage because of that outside sales group, our hope, and my hope is that we maintain all of it, or certainly a significant amount of it, we that's yet to be seen. But that changed the economics of the operating margin in the DIY business. Our focus, whether it's 19%, or 20%, is to is to make sure that we're growing operating profit dollars at a good return. And sometimes our margin, our operating margin might go down, because I've said for many times, if we could double our commercial business, at a substantially lower operating margin. Tomorrow, we would do it, because it doesn't require a lot of capital, and it would grow our operating profit dollars tremendously. Zachary Fadem : Got it. That's helpful. And on the DIY side, obviously a lot of noise out there on the state of the lower income consumer as we move further and further away from stimulus. And considering the uptick and gas prices, food CPI and just overall broad based inflation and could your business. Could you talk about what you're seeing out there as it doesn't seem to be impacting your business at all? Curious how you think about the disconnect there? William Rhodes : Yes, I\u2019ll first start with you have to remember that our business is generally an inelastic business. Except for some reason, whenever the low end consumer has excess cash, we see a significant pop in our business. But I'll go back to what I said earlier, we historically haven't seen it revert back to the norms. The look at our business in the quarter, our retail business, our transaction count was meaningfully better than it normally would be. We're also seeing that we grew share by 10%, during the depths of the crisis, and we are continuing to modestly grow share on top of that, I would have anticipated we would give some of that back. We're not. And then you layer in the fact that there is this inflation, and that's probably accelerating our growth by about 4%. We don't think that there's a lot of elasticity in that inflation at this point in time. The bigger question is the one that you're bringing up. If we continue to see significant inflation across the market, does that put more and more pressure on particularly the low end consumer? And ultimately, do we see a deceleration as a result of that? And I think that's a logical thesis. But we've had a lot of logical thesis during this pandemic that haven't come to fruition. Jamere Jackson : Yes, I would just add that, that that piece of the thesis, if you will, we're a long way from that being the case, and if you just look at the things that Bill talked about three things, one, share growth, inflation being our friend, and this favorable macro environment. That's what gives us a lot of confidence here in the near term about our business. And we're continuing to perform very well in this environment against that backdrop. Zachary Fadem : Thanks so much, guys. Happy holidays. Congrats to Mark. William Rhodes : Yes, thank you very much, Zack, Happy Holidays to you too. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Chris Horvers at JPMorgan. Your line is live. You may begin. Christopher Horvers : Thanks Good morning guys. So Bill you talked to a lot about consistency of on the monthly basis, on a quarterly basis, on a two year stack basis. But also, historically, we've talked a lot about, the impact of the business on shifting tax refund timing, and different periods. If you held the stock into this next quarter, obviously, that's a really impressive number, but you will also run into the stimulus payments from January. So I guess, what are your thoughts there? Do you think you saw a lift last year on the DIY side of the business? And do you think that, that would cause that to your stock to break? William Rhodes : It\u2019s a great question, Chris, and I'm very happy that Jamere has not allowed us to reverse our long term history of not giving guidance. I don't know the answer to it, right? Yes, we'll be going up against the stimulus payment around the first of the year. Yes, we're going to be something we've talked about a lot, historically, we'll be going up against a pretty significant weather event, towards the end of our quarter and beginning of the next quarter. For us, we're going to maximize our performance and optimize our performance in whatever sales environment we have. We don't have to change, if we thought we were going to be plus two or down 2% on a historical basis, we don't have to change how we operate. And if we left that stimulus, and we have a little bit of a headwind for four weeks, so be it. We're running this business for the long term. As I've said in the prepared remarks, the valuation needs to be placed on this company depends on how our investors and particularly our long term investors feel our cash flow is going to be three to five years from now. And that's the lens that we're looking at. If we go through a tough quarter, because our business is up 25%, from pre pandemic, so be it, we need to make sure that we're making the investments today that allow us to continue to have this amazing cash flow generation for the long term. Christopher Horvers : Got it? And then make sense. And then in terms of the investments that you're making this year, can you give us some expectations term of CapEx? And will this create will the investment cycle or investment program for this year create pressure in OpEx, like in terms of what one might say, an appropriate relationship between, say, top line growth versus SG&A dollar growth might how that could be impacted? Jamere Jackson : Yes, I mean, we're able to do this within the framework of our long term financial model, if you will. We will have some accelerated CapEx this year to build out the initiatives that Bill talked about. But if you look at sort of where we are in terms of our cash generating capability, the amount of free cash flow that we\u2019ll generate this year, it certainly won't impact anything that we're doing from a capital allocation or our ability to return cash to shareholders. So this is sort of a multiyear investment cycle, if you will. We\u2019ve talked about the capacity investments that we're making in the supply chain. I've talked about things that we need to do from an IT standpoint. We've talked about the growth that we're going to do in our store base. And we're able to do that within the framework of our financial model, if you will, without making material changes to the P&L. Christopher Horvers : Got it. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Brian Nagel at Oppenheimer. Your line is live. You may begin. Brian Nagel : Good morning. Congrats on another really incredible quarter. Nicely done. Jamere Jackson : Thanks. William Rhodes : Thanks, Brian. Brian Nagel : So the first question I have, I think goes to the comments you were making Jamere in the prepared remarks. But with regard to supply chain, no, it sounds like what you're saying AutoZone continues to manage this manage the challenges quite well. The question I have is, as you look at the challenges out there, are you starting to see some of these bottlenecks that are safe subsiding? And do you see is there a path towards and obviously it\u2019s going to take some time. Is there is there a path towards the supply chain for you improving significantly? William Rhodes : It's a great question, Brian. I think the answer is yes, but it's ever changing. And I want to stop for just a second and really say thank you to our supply chain team and our merchants. You talk about collaboration. These folks have been working unbelievably hard now for 20 months trying to figure out how we deal with this enormous surge in volume. So round numbers, our business is up 25% or more since the pre pandemic level. Our supply chain, our manufacturers and their supply chains nobody built for 25% excess capacity that would last for 20 months. Our teams have done a really, really, really good job of managing through it. That said, we have challenges. Our in-stock levels are not where we want them to be. They haven't been the whole time. And they'll go down a little bit and they'll come up a little bit, but we're generally 3% or 4% below the in-stock levels that we want on a weekly basis. To your point, are we seeing things change that give us optimism about the future? And the answer is yes. But as soon as we do, we see another part of the supply chain that is more challenged. In a lot of respects, we're playing a little bit of Whack a Mole. In the beginning, it was particular categories, sandpaper. Now it's tools and brake rotors. We also back in the summer time we couldn't get capacity to get enough container loads from Shanghai, to the U.S. Now it's can we get them through the ports in the U.S. and our team's done, been really creative about getting the ships, but now also finding different ports across the country to go to. So we are seeing it get better. But we are nowhere out of the woods on stage saying that next month, we're going to be back into it. We're about to face Chinese New Year, which is always a difficult time in any supply chain. So it'll be interesting to see how we manage through that. My hope is late spring, early summer, we get back to some semblance of normality. But every time we thought, okay, this one is easing, there's been another part of the supply chain that has shown challenges. Brian Nagel : Now this is very, very helpful. Thank you. The second question I have, I guess you're kind of more strategic in nature as well. But we talked about just the sales growth. And the sales growth has been phenomenal. And you're looking at the stack comps have been extraordinarily resilient here, even as the economy has moved away from the pandemic, from stimulus, the benefits, the benefits of stimulus. So the question I have is, if you think about the business, to the extent that you start seeing signals that maybe this is even the sales growth is even more sustainable than you initially thought, Is there a point at which you would start to invest more aggressively or a back into the business? Are there even places you would want to put more money, more investment to work in the business or sector reinvest their sales gains? William Rhodes : I think we already have Brian. I talked in my prepared remarks, we're going to make the most significant investments that we've seen in our supply chain. Because we've seen this this surge in volume. Now, I don't want to spook everybody. Our CapEx is going to be up $100 million, $150 million kind of range over last year. And it \u2013 but it will have an elevated level in our supply chain for a couple of years. And as we've talked about as a team, think over the long term, we've optimized our supply chain to the third decimal point, when you've been through a surge in volume, like we've experienced over the last 20 months, that was probably a little pennywise and pound foolish. And so we're going to be a little bit more aggressive with our supply chain investments. We've clearly made a ton of investments in our commercial business over the last four years, from inventory assortments to mega hubs and hubs, to investments in the Duralast brand, to investments in price, investments in technology, the single largest technology investment we've ever made as a company is what underpins this commercial strategy. And we're beginning to see benefits from it. But we've got a ton of benefits left in front of us on the commercial side of the business. So I think we've been making investments at an accelerated rate. And when you have the kind of profitability characteristics that we have today, we're looking at, are there other places that we can invest? I also want to say, one place that we've invested very aggressively that I don't think others have done at nearly at the same level is we've invested in our people. We've invested in our people in accelerated wage rates. We've invested in our people and our culture, through things like emergency time off. The last time I've tallied up, what we'd invested from emergency time off vaccine incentives and those kinds of things. We were in the $135 million range. And then we announced again, today that we added $9 million to our AutoZoners Assistance Fund. We believe in times like this, if we're going to have values that we state, it's imperative that we live consistent with those values. And I think we've walked that walk very clearly during the pandemic. Brian Nagel : Very helpful. Congratulations again to all. Thank you. William Rhodes : All right. Thank you. Appreciate it, Brian. So before we conclude the call, I just want to take a moment to reiterate that we believe our industry is strong, and our business model is solid. We'll take nothing for granted as we understand our customers have alternatives to shopping with us. We will continue to focus on the basics as we strive to optimize shareholder value for the remainder of fiscal 2022. Lastly, we want to wish everyone a happy, healthy and safe holiday season and a very prosperous new year. Thank you for your time today. Thank you for your interest in AutoZone. Take care Operator : Thank you ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's event. We thank you for your participation. Have a wonderful day.",

Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for AutoZone's 2022 second quarter conference call. With me today are Jamere Jackson, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax. Regarding the second quarter, I hope you've had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not, the press release, along with slides complementing our comments today are available on our website, www.autozone.com under the Investor Relations link. Please click on Quarterly Earnings Conference Calls to see them. As we begin, we want to continue to stress that our highest priority remains the safety and well-being of our customers and AutoZoners, Everyone, everyone across the organization takes this responsibility very seriously, and I am extremely proud of how our team has continued to respond to COVID-19 and the recent Omicron variant. Since the start of the pandemic, we have consistently recognized our AutoZoners in our stores and distribution centers for giving exceptional service in the face of all the challenges COVID-19 has presented. This quarter, we will start the same way by saying thank you to our AutoZoners for their dedication to providing exceptional customer service and helping our customers with their automotive needs. This morning, we will review our overall same-store sales, DIY versus DIFM trends, our sales cadence over the 12 weeks of the quarter, merchandise categories that drove our performance and any regional discrepancies. We'll also share how inflation is affecting our costs and retails and how we think they will impact our business for the remainder of the fiscal year. Lastly, I'll touch on the subject of pricing in the industry. Our domestic same-store sales were an impressive 13.8% this quarter, on top of last year's very strong 15.2%. Our team has once again executed an exceptionally high level and delivered amazing results despite the ongoing very challenging environment. In Q1 of this fiscal year, we reported 13.6% same-store sales on top of 2021's Q1 same-store sales of 12.3%. Impressively, very impressively, our team delivered accelerating two-year comps in our second quarter. Our growth rates for retail and commercial were both strong with domestic commercial growth north of 32%. Commercial set a second quarter record with $844 million in sales, an incredible accomplishment. We generated $200 million more in sales this quarter than in Q2 last year. On a trailing four-quarter basis, we generated $3.8 billion in annualized commercial sales versus $2.9 billion just a year ago, up 30%. We also set a record in average weekly sales per store for any second quarter at $13,500 versus $10,500 last year. On a two-year basis, our sales accelerated from last quarter, exceeding 46% in commercial. Domestic represented 25% of our total company sales, another record for us compared to 21. 9% last year. Our commercial sales growth continues to be driven by a host and I want to emphasize, a host of key initiatives we've been working on for the last several years. We improved our satellite store inventory availability. We've had massive improvements in Hub and Mega-Hub coverage. We're leveraging the strength of the Duralast brand. We have better technology to make us easier to do business with. We have significantly improved our delivery times. We've enhanced our sales force's effectiveness and we're living consistent with our pledge by being 'priced right' for the value proposition that we deliver. We continue to execute very well in commercial and we are extremely proud of our team and their performance. We're also very proud of our organization's performance in domestic DIY. We ran at 8.4% comp this quarter on top of last year's 15.7%. As our DIY two-year stacked comp accelerated from the first quarter, it's remarkable to reflect on four consecutive quarters of more than 20% two-year comps in this more mature portion of our business. From the data we have available to us, we continue to not only retain the enormous three full points of share gains we built during the initial stages of the pandemic, but modestly continued to build on those gains. Our performance, considering the amount of time from the last stimulus and the ending of the enhanced unemployment benefits, has substantially exceeded our expectations and gives us more conviction on the sustainability of these sales levels. Now, let's focus on sales cadence. Our same-store sales decreased sequentially from late November through January and then accelerated again in the few days of the quarter we had in February. The deceleration through January could be deceiving as last year's comp strengthened as the quarter progressed as a result of the federal stimulus distributed around the first of last calendar year. Given the dynamics in the past 20 months, we, like others who've benefited from the pandemic, believe it has been more instructive to look at two-year stacked comps. On this basis, the monthly results were almost identical and were very stable. For Q2, our two-year comp was 29.1%, and the four-week periods of the quarter increased 29.6%, 28.9%, and 29.1%, respectively. Regarding weather, until February, we experienced warmer than usual weather in the northeastern US, while the remainder of the country experienced pretty normal winter trends. Overall, we feel weather did not play a material role in our sales performance. As we look forward to the spring months, we believe we will see normal weather trends and therefore, weather is not planned to be a big story for this upcoming quarter or summer. As a reminder, historically extreme weather, either cold or hot, drives parts failures and accelerated maintenance. Regarding this quarter's traffic versus ticket growth, in retail, our traffic was up slightly while our ticket was up 7.8%. This slight transaction count growth continues to be a meaningful acceleration from pre-pandemic levels, although it decelerated versus last year, as expected, due to the elimination of stimulus and enhanced unemployment. In our commercial business, we saw most of the sales growth come from transaction growth from new and existing customers. It was encouraging for us to see sales trends remain strong, and we continue to be pleased with the momentum we are seeing in both domestic businesses heading into the spring months. During the quarter, there were some geographic regions that did better than others as there always are. But this quarter, we saw a mere 15 basis points difference between the Northeast and Midwest compared to the balance of the country. As winter definitely came in late January in the Northeast and Midwest, we are expecting that gap will remain close. Also, the market share data suggests we continued to gain share in most of our markets. Now let's move into more specifics on performance for the quarter. Our same-store sales were up 13.8% versus last year's second quarter. Our net income was $472 million and our EPS was $22.30 a share, increasing an impressive 49.4%. Regarding our merchandise categories in the retail business, our hard parts grew slightly faster than our sales floor categories, but not material, say, maybe less than 1%. As Americans get back to driving more, we've seen maintenance and failure-related categories perform well. We've been especially pleased with our growth rates in select failure-related businesses like batteries that have successfully lapped very strong performance last year. We believe our hard parts business will continue to strengthen as our customers drive more. Let me also address inflation and pricing. This quarter, we saw our sales increase by over 5% from inflation. While our cost of goods was up over 4% on a like-for-like basis. We believe both numbers will be slightly higher in the third quarter as cost increases and many key merchandise categories continue to work their way through the system. As rising raw material pricing, labor and transportation costs are all impacting us and our suppliers, inflation has been prevalent in the aftermarket space. We have no way to say how long this will last, but our industry has been disciplined about pricing for decades and we expect that to continue. It is also notable that following periods of higher inflation, we typically do not see corresponding deflation. While we continue to be encouraged with the current sales environment, it remains difficult to forecast near to midterm sales. What I will say is that, the past 4-quarter sales have all been consistent on a two-year stacked comp basis and a three-year basis, and that goes for both our DIY and our commercial businesses. While it's difficult to predict absolute sales levels going forward, we are excited about our growth initiatives. Our team's exceptional execution and the tremendous share gains we have achieved in both sectors. Currently, the macro environment, while uncertain, remains very favorable for our industry. And even if these near-term trends fade, we believe that we are in an industry that is positioned for solid growth over the long term. For FY 2022, we expect our sales performance to be led by the strength in our commercial business as we continue executing on our differentiating initiatives. As we progress through the year, we will, as always, be transparent about what we are seeing and provide color on our markets and outlooks as trends emerge. Before handing the call over to Jamere, I'd like to address the subject of pricing. And if AutoZone's pricing disciplines or philosophies have changed from past practices. The short answer is a resounding no. While we initiated a retail pricing adjustment last year in Q1 and further adjusted some commercial pricing in quarters two through four, these moves were done to be price competitive but with other channels, not with our direct competitors. Specifically, in the retail business, we reduced our premiums to mass, particularly on highly visible commodity products. Regarding the more significant change in commercial, our prices have always, always been meaningfully higher than our WD competitors as our service level is superior. Our pricing changes over the last year or so have been too narrow. I emphasize narrow, but not eliminate that gap. We must make sure we receive a premium for our service advantage, but we narrowed that premium by roughly half. While this has created some consternation in the investment community, we think our results have shown that this was a prudent and productive decision. We continue to see our industry as very rational when it comes to pricing strategies. And I want to be clear, crystal clear. I don't want anyone to conclude that our growth in commercial is solely due to pricing. We launched a comprehensive new strategy about three years ago, with improvements in assortments, local market availability with Hubs and Mega-Hubs, our delivery times are dropping as we leverage new technologies that have been deployed. Our team's execution is enhanced. We've made ourselves easier to do business with and we've improved our pricing versus WDs. We stated last year, we didn't envision any additional pricing reductions beyond those deployed at the beginning of last year's Q4, and that remains our stance. Now I'll turn the call over to Jamere Jackson. Jamere? Jamere Jackson : Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As Bill mentioned, we had a strong second quarter with double-digit comp growth, a 30% growth in EBIT and a 49% growth in EPS. Our results for the first half of the fiscal year have been remarkably strong as our growth initiatives continue to deliver great results and the efforts of our AutoZoners in our stores and distribution centers have enabled us to take advantage of robust market conditions. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to elaborate on the specifics in our P&L for Q2. For the quarter, total auto parts sales, which includes our domestic, Mexico and Brazil stores, were $3.3 billion, up 15.6%. Now let me give a little color on sales and our growth initiatives. Starting with our commercial business for the second quarter, our domestic DIFM sales increased 32.1% to $844 million and were up 46.8% on a two-year stacked basis. Sales to our DIFM customers represented 25% of our total company sales, and our weekly sales per program were $13,500, up 28.6% as we averaged just over $70 million in total weekly commercial sales. Once again, our growth was broad-based as national and local accounts both grew at approximately 32% for the quarter. While the second quarter is seasonally our lowest selling quarter, our results for the quarter are exceptional and represent the highest volume second quarter in the history of the chain. I want to continue to reiterate that our execution on our commercial acceleration initiatives is delivering better-than-expected results as we focus on building a faster-growing business. We are making tremendous progress in growing share in this highly fragmented portion of the market by winning new business and increasing our share of wallet with existing customers. We have our commercial program in approximately 86% of our domestic stores, which leverages our DIY infrastructure, and we're building our business with national, regional and local accounts. This quarter, we opened 22 net new programs, finishing with 5,233 total programs. As I said at the outset of the year, commercial growth will lead the way in FY 2022 and our results in the second quarter and the first half of the year reflects this dynamic. We remain confident in our strategies and execution and believe we will continue gaining share, delivering quality parts, particularly with our Duralast brand, improved assortments, competitive pricing and providing exceptional service has enabled us to drive double-digit sales growth for the past seven quarters. Our core initiatives are accelerating our growth and position us well in the marketplace. And notably, our Mega-Hub strategy is driving strong performance and positioning us for an even brighter future in our commercial and retail businesses. Let me add a little more color on our progress. As I mentioned last quarter, our Mega-Hub strategy has given us tremendous momentum. We now have 64 Mega-Hub locations, and we expect to open approximately 14 more over the remainder of the fiscal year. While I mentioned a moment ago, the commercial weekly sales per program average was $13,500 per program, the 64 mega hubs averaged significantly higher sales and are growing much faster than the balance of the commercial footprint. As a result, our mega hubs typically carry roughly 100,000 SKUs and drive tremendous sales lift inside the store box as well as serve as an expanded assortment source for other stores. The expansion of coverage and parts availability continues to deliver a meaningful sales lift to both our commercial and DIY business, and we are testing greater density of mega hubs to drive even stronger sales results. What we are learning is that not only are these assets performing well individually, but the fulfillment capability for the surrounding AutoZone stores gives our customers access to thousands of additional parts and lifts the entire network. By leveraging sophisticated, predictive analytics and machine learning, we're expanding our market reach, driving closer proximity to our customers and improving our product availability and delivery times. We're building a meaningful competitive advantage, and we continue to have confidence in our ability to create a faster-growing business. On the retail side of our business, same-store sales for our domestic retail business was up 8.4% and up 24.1% on a two-year stack. The business has been remarkably resilient as we have gained and maintained nearly three points of market share since the start of the pandemic. As Bill mentioned, we saw traffic up slightly to go along with 7.8% ticket growth as we continue to raise prices in an inflationary environment. Our growth initiatives are also leading to share gains as we improve the customer shopping experience, expand assortment, and leverage our Hub and Mega-Hub network. These dynamics, along with favorable macro trends in miles driven, a growing and aging car park, and a challenging new and used car sales market for our customers have continued to fuel sales momentum in DIY. Our in-stock positions, while still below where we were pre-pandemic, are continuing to improve as have made great progress in a challenging supply chain environment. We've been able to navigate supply and logistics constraints and have product available to meet our customers' needs. Our AutoZoners, who are taking care of our customers, give us a key competitive advantage that enables us to thrive in this market environment. Now, there's no question that DIY comps get tougher in the back half of the year due to exceptionally strong back half performance in both FY 2020 and FY 2021. But we remain confident that the fundamentals of our business remain strong, macro conditions are favorable for us, and we have had great execution by our teams. Now, I'll say a few words regarding our international business. We continue to be pleased with the progress we're making in Mexico and Brazil. During the quarter, we opened three new stores in Mexico to finish with 669 stores and two new stores in Brazil to finish with 55. And on a constant currency basis, we saw accelerated sales growth in both countries, in line with the growth rates we saw overall. We remain committed to our store opening schedules in both markets and expect both countries to be significant contributors to sales and earnings growth in the future. With only just over 10% of our total store base now outside the US and our commitment to continue expansion in a disciplined way, international growth will be an attractive and meaningful contributor to AutoZone's future growth. Now, let me spend a few minutes on the P&L and gross margins. For the quarter, our gross margin was down 59 basis points, driven primarily by the accelerated growth in our commercial business, where the shift in mix, coupled with the investments in our initiatives, drove margin pressure, but increased our total gross profit dollars 14.5%. I mentioned on last quarter's call that we expected to have our gross margin down in a similar range this quarter as we saw in the first quarter where we were down 65 basis points versus the previous year. Our merchandising team has been focused on driving margin improvements, primarily through pricing actions that offset inflation, resulting in slightly better performance than our initial expectations. As Bill mentioned earlier in the call, we are continuing to see cost inflation in certain product categories, along with rising transportation and distribution center costs. We're continuing to take pricing actions to offset inflation and consistent with prior inflationary cycles, the industry's pricing remains rational. We would expect our margins in the third quarter to be down in the 50 bps range versus Q3 last year, driven primarily by mix headwinds from our fast-growing commercial business. Moving to operating expenses, our expenses were up 7.5% versus last year's Q2 as SG&A as a percent of sales leveraged 264 basis points. The leverage was driven primarily by our strong results and approximately $40 million or 137 basis points and prior year pandemic-related expenses. While our SG&A dollar growth rate has been higher than historical averages, we've been focused on maintaining high levels of customer service during a period of accelerated growth. We also continued to invest at an accelerated pace in IT to underpin our growth initiatives, and these investments will pay dividends in user experience, speed, and productivity. We will continue to be disciplined on SG&A growth as we move forward and manage expenses in line with sales growth over time. Moving to the rest of the P&L. EBIT for the quarter was $627 million, up 30.1% versus the prior year's quarter, driven by strong top line growth. Interest expense for the quarter was $42.5 million, down 7.7% from Q2 a year ago as our debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $5.8 billion versus just over $5.5 billion at Q2 end last year. We are planning interest in the $45 million range for the third quarter of fiscal 2022, roughly flat with Q3 last year. For the quarter, our tax rate was 19.3% versus 20.6% in last year's second quarter. This quarter's rate benefited 401 basis points from stock options exercised last year -- exercised, while last year, it benefited 265 basis points. For the third quarter of fiscal 2022, we suggest investors model us at approximately 23.6% before any assumption on credits due to stock option exercises. Moving to net income and EPS. Net income for the quarter was $472 million, up 36.4% versus last year's second quarter. Our diluted share count of 21.2 million was 9% lower than last year's second quarter. It's a combination of higher net income and lower share count drove earnings per share for the quarter to $22.30, up 49.4% over the prior year's second quarter. Now let me talk about our free cash flow for Q2. For the second quarter, we generated $362 million of operating cash flow and spent $106 million in capital expenditures, allowing us to generate $270 million of free cash flow, up 3.1% versus the prior year. Year-to-date, we have generated $960 million in free cash, up 12.4% versus the prior year. You should expect us to continue being an incredibly strong cash flow generator going forward, and we remain committed to returning meaningful amounts of cash to our shareholders. Regarding our balance sheet, through our share repurchase program and the prepayment of a bond due in April, we have exhausted our excess cash balance on the balance sheet, but rest assured our liquidity position remains very strong and our leverage ratios remain below our historic norms. We're also managing our inventory well as our inventory per store was up 3.3% versus Q2 last year. Total inventory increased 6.2% over the same period last year, driven mainly by new stores and inflation. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable on a per store basis, was a negative $198,000 versus negative $93,000 last year and negative $207,000 last quarter. As a result, accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 126.8% versus last year's Q2 of 113%. Lastly, I'll spend a moment on capital allocation and our share repurchase program. We repurchased nearly $1.6 billion of AutoZone stock in the quarter. As of the end of the fiscal quarter, we dropped below 20 million shares outstanding. As a point of emphasis, when we started our share repurchase program in 1998, we had 154 million shares outstanding. Now we have less than 20 million. At quarter end, we had just under $958 million remaining under our share buyback authorization. The powerful free cash we generated this year has allowed us to buy back over 6% of the shares outstanding since the beginning of the fiscal year. We have bought back over 90% of the shares outstanding of our stock since our buyback inception in 1998, while investing in our existing assets and growing our business. We remain committed to this disciplined capital allocation approach where we expect to return to our long-term leverage target in the 2.5x area and generate powerful free cash flows that will enable us to invest in the business and return meaningful amounts of cash to shareholders. To wrap up, we had another very strong quarter, highlighted by strong comp sales, which drove a 36.4% increase in net income and a 49.4% increase in EPS. We are driving long-term shareholder value by investing in our growth initiatives, driving robust earnings and cash and returning excess cash to our shareholders. Our strategy continues to work. We are growing our DIY and DIFM businesses at a significantly faster rate than the overall market, and we are committed to capturing our fair share while improving our competitive positioning in a disciplined way. I continue to have tremendous confidence in our ability to drive significant and ongoing value for our shareholders. And now I'll turn it back to Bill. Bill Rhodes : Thank you, Jamere. Fiscal 2022 is off to a very strong start, and we remain focused on superior customer service and flawless execution. Our culture is based on exceptional service and that will continue to define our success. I want to step back for a minute and talk about the big picture. Throughout the pandemic, each of us has had a very difficult time forecasting the future in light of all the uncertainties : the disease, the variants, consumer and government responses, competitive dynamics and on and on. But we are now nearly two years into this pandemic. What has happened to our business over those two years due to the tremendous contributions of our AutoZoners is nothing short of phenomenal. On a trailing 12-month basis versus pre-pandemic, our sales volumes have increased by over a remarkable 30%, and our profitability expressed as EBIT has increased nearly 50%. Six to nine months ago, if you would have asked us, our expectation was that some of those incremental sales and profits would go back closer to historic norms. While it is still very difficult to predict the next six to 12 months, our perspective has morphed, as we are nearly a year past the last stimulus and nearly six months from the suspension of enhanced unemployment, we believe most, if not all, of this growth is sustainable. We believe our competitive positioning is improved, as indicated by our significant share gains in both retail and commercial. And consumer behaviors may have permanently changed. If this holds true, it will be the fourth time in the last 30 years that the economy and society have had significant shocks, leading to material acceleration in our growth in sales and profits without a corresponding decline back to pre-recessionary or pre-pandemic levels. Our industry is unique, but it has a very long track record of strong performance with high return and cash flow characteristics. As we begin to lap the second anniversary of the pandemic, some of the measurements we've all used recently to measure our performance will become skewed. Remember, at the beginning of the pandemic, our sales dropped radically. Our retail sales rebounded quickly with the April 2020 stimulus, but commercials rebound lagged and it took several months to recover. For Q3, the two-year stacked comp measurement holds reasonably well as we delivered basically flat overall comps in Q3 of 2020. However, that measure for our commercial business won't be as meaningful. And then in Q4, in light of the amazing performance in 2020, the two-year comparison for overall comps won't be comparable. We would encourage you to migrate to three-year comps. We continue to be bullish on our industry and, in particular, on our opportunities for 2022. We believe the macro backdrop is in our favor for the near and long-term. Our customers across the Americas want to get out and get out and drive, and we'll be there when they need helpful advice. Our team has worked diligently and collaboratively with our suppliers, and together, they have done a very good job dealing with the enormous supply chain challenges that exist for everyone. While our in-stock levels are improving and we expect that to continue, we also believe we are better in stock than most retailers. And our results, they support that belief. For the remainder of fiscal 2022, we are launching some very exciting initiatives. We're focused on further growing share, but as always, doing so on a very profitable basis. In fiscal 2024, we plan to open a new distribution center in California to fuel continued growth of our domestic business. We just recently announced a new distribution center in Virginia. And we're now planning an additional distribution center in Mexico to allow us to service a growing store base in that country. This is a meaningful acceleration in our historic investments in distribution centers as during the pandemic, we have learned we need to have a bit more excess capacity in our supply chain. We're also targeting to open 14 more new domestic mega hubs in the US that will enhance our availability and support growth in our retail and commercial businesses. As we've mentioned many times before, our mega hub strategy is at the core of materially improving our inventory availability. This strategy is expected to help us drive both commercial and retail sales for many, many years to come. We also will be leveraging our hub and mega hub strategy further in Mexico. For the fiscal year, we expect to open more than 200 new stores throughout the Americas with notable acceleration in Brazil. These capacity expansion investments reflect our bullishness on our industry and, in particular, our own growth prospects. We're being disciplined yet we're being aggressive. I also want to reiterate how proud I am of our AutoZoners across the stores and distribution centers, in particular, for their commitment to servicing our customers and doing so in a very safe manner. First and foremost, our focus will be on keeping our AutoZoners and customers safe, while providing our customers with their automotive needs. And secondly, we must continuously challenge ourselves during these extraordinary times to position our company for even greater future success. We know that investors will ultimately measure us by what our future cash flows look like three to five years from now. And we very much, very much welcome that challenge. I continue to be bullish on our industry and, in particular, on AutoZone and AutoZoners. Now I'd like to open up the call for questions. Operator : Certainly. Ladies and gentlemen, the floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] We do ask that all Q&A participants please limit to two questions per person. Your first question is coming from Bret Jordan from Jefferies. Your line is live. Bret Jordan : Hey, good morning, guys. Bill Rhodes : Good morning, Bret. Jamere Jackson : Good morning, Bret. Bret Jordan : Yes. On the Americas expansion, sort of thinking longer term, how do you see the potential size of Mexico and Brazil on a three to five or maybe even longer-term basis? Bill Rhodes : Sure. So we haven't given specific numbers, Bret, but what we have said repeatedly is, in both the United States and Mexico, we believe we can continue to grow at the current kinds of levels for the foreseeable future. So in the U.S., that's 150, 170 stores, Mexico, it's 40 to 50 stores. We believe we can do that for the foreseeable future. So it's going to be much, much larger than it is today. As far as Brazil is concerned, we're just getting started. You all know, we've been down there for over nine years now, and we were very methodical and very thoughtful and careful about making sure that this model worked for us. Just about a year ago, we presented to our Board that we felt like Brazil was now at the stage where we're comfortable, the model works. We knew it worked for the customers. We are now comfortable it works for us financially, and we will be stemming out and growing much faster in Brazil. I believe, over the long term, Brazil will end up being larger than Mexico for AutoZone. But with 50-some-odd stores, it's a long way to go. Bret Jordan : Okay, great. And then I guess, you called out share gains, obviously, and it's quantified your DIY at 3 points. Could you give us any more color on the commercial side of the business? And within the share gains, have you seen any either any meaningful contribution, national versus independent recently? Bill Rhodes : Yes, Bret, I wish I could. We just don't have -- in the DIY business, we have very specific data. We have POS data for all front-of-store items. So it's crystal clear and we are comfortable sharing that with you. And that's where we said, during the height of the pandemic, we gained over 3%, which was 10% growth in share. Never seen that before personally. And we suspect that we would give some of that back up as the economy reopened. We have not. In fact, we continued to grow marginal amounts of share on top of that, which we've been very, very pleased with. On the commercial side of the business, we don't have a tool that gives us the direct insight. But when we look at it at the rates that we're growing, I think 46% on a two-year basis, we are quite comfortable that we're growing share exponentially many times what the industry is growing, but we don't have specifics, and so we can't tell you this is how we're doing against this sector or that sector. Bret Jordan : Do you have a feeling whether it's -- is national account, or up and down the street business stronger than the other, or are they both sort of comparable growth rates? Bill Rhodes : They're very comparable growth rates right now. That changes over times during the depths of the pandemic. The nationals weren't growing as fast as the up and down the street. I think that's changed now. They're both growing at really high rates. I think Jamere even mentioned like 32% for both sectors during the quarter. So, we're really, really pleased. We've really developed some very nice relationships with our national account partners. And we have a specific program for our up and down the street that we call Pro Vantage, and both of those sectors are really, really doing well. Bret Jordan : Okay, great. Thank you. Bill Rhodes : Yes, thank you, Bret. Have a good day. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Zach Fadem from Wells Fargo. Your line is live. Zach Fadem : Hey, good morning. So, for your Do-It-For-Me customers, can you talk a bit about your historical price gap versus your peers as well as WDs and how that's been trending over the last couple of years? And as you think about the drivers of sales for national, regional, and local accounts, where do you think the biggest drivers of share is today across price, availability or simply the fact that you're now able to serve certain customers that you historically weren't able to serve? Bill Rhodes : Yes, I'll start. I think that there's a misnomer by many that our pricing strategies are at the core of our growth. They are an element, not the element of our growth. What we did about four years ago is we embarked on a new strategy in commercial. And we looked at all elements of our offering. We changed the assortment methodology in every store in the United States. Every store has a different product assortment that leans further into the commercial business today than it did four years ago. We also said how are we going to get significant increase in local market availability? And we came up with this concept called a Mega-Hub store. We've now had over 60 Mega-Hubs. We've said publicly, we're going to go to at least 110. I think Jamere and I both feel like it's going to be closer to 200 than it will be 100, and maybe even more than that as we're testing -- one of the things about the Mega-Hubs, every time we measure them, they do better than our projections. Every single time. So, we've done these Mega-Hub improvements. We've taken our sales force, which was relatively immature and, frankly, brand new a decade ago. And as they mature and develop tenure, they're getting more professional, better at doing their sales techniques. We've deployed those single largest technology endeavor of the company's history in the commercial business. We've enhanced how we interact with our customers digitally. We've also rolled out handheld devices to all stores and all drivers so that when they're picking the products, we make sure we've got the right products. When we deliver the products, we can understand delivery times. We're driving our delivery times down about 15% so far and that's nowhere near our goal. So, we're improving our service on that front. The Duralast brand continues to be become stronger and stronger across the board and really excited about that. And then we've lowered our price gaps. We didn't -- we don't have the same level of transparency in the commercial business that we have in retail. Everybody can see everybody's retail prices every day. In the commercial business, we're going to have different pricing philosophies with certain of our national account customers and then up and down the street customers that penetrate this category are going to be priced different from somebody else. So, you don't have the level of transparency. We talked about it at length about a year ago that we were focused on making sure that our total value proposition, including price, was a strong value proposition versus a different set of competitors called the warehouse distributors. And we cut, as I said in the prepared remarks, our gap versus them. We've always been premium priced to them because our service offering is premium priced. Then we cut the gap after \u2013 about a year of testing, so we knew it worked. We cut the gap by about half. So call it 15% to 8%-ish, 8.5-ish kind of percent. And we've been extraordinarily pleased with how that has worked over time. Zach, did I answer all your questions? You had a few of them embedded in there. Zach Fadem : No, no. So that was great. I just wanted to follow-up on just your expectations for industry growth as a whole in 2022. How are you thinking about DIY versus Do-It-For-Me in terms of volume versus price inflation? And I presume you still see room to build on the three points of market share that you've taken since the pandemic. Jamere Jackson : So I would say a few things. One, if you look at our results specifically, there are really four dynamics. The first is, to a certain extent, inflation has been our friend. It's helped us drive higher pricing and the volumes are actually holding. If you look at where we've seen pricing grow, I mean, we're up mid-single digits in retails for the first half. And quite frankly, if we see that same level of inflation in the back half, which is reasonable, then you could expect us to take pricing up in a similar dynamic. The share gains we've talked about are driving our business. We're up nearly three points versus the pre-pandemic. We've hung on to those share gains and the growth initiatives that Bill talked about, both in DIY and commercial, are giving us a lot of confidence that we'll maintain those shares as we go forward. And then the last dynamic for us that we've talked at length about is this macro strength that we're seeing. It's -- you have an aging and growing car park. You have used car prices that are up, 60% versus pre pandemic. And you're seeing many new cars that are actually selling higher than the sticker prices. And if you look at the used car price dynamic just in general, I mean, those higher residual values are actually encouraging our customers to invest in maintaining their vehicles because they're comfortable that the value is actually holding. So when you mix all of those things together, it suggests that the industry as a whole is not going back to pre-pandemic sales levels. And while we won't be date certain about when you'll see comps move one direction or the other, what we'll say is that the fundamentals are strong. We don't expect to return to the levels that we saw prior to coming into the pandemic. So our growth dynamics and the industry backdrop gives us a lot of confidence about the future. Zach Fadem : Appreciate that. Thanks for the time. Bill Rhodes : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Brian Nagel from Oppenheimer. Your line is live. Brian Nagel : Hi, good morning. Nice quarter. Congratulations. Bill Rhodes : Thank you. Jamere Jackson : Thanks, Brian. Brian Nagel : I guess I have two questions. I'll kind of merge them together. I mean, so first off, Bill, in your opening comments, you talked about just the strength in the business. Is there anything -- as you look at the acceleration in sales from fiscal Q1 into fiscal Q2, is there anything specific to point to? I mean, is inflation, your ability to pass along those inflationary prices, so to say, a factor there? And then my second question is just on the gas price front. I mean, I know you're not -- AutoZone does not provide guidance, but what we are seeing here is gas prices are again climbing due to, I guess, issues in the United States and now probably more importantly, geopolitical issues. Do these higher gas prices concern you at all in terms of sales and the health of your consumer? Bill Rhodes : Yeah. So two great points, Brian. First of all, what changed versus Q1 and Q2, there's a lot of different things that changed. I think our -- we're going to hang our head a lot on our execution and our team's execution. But clearly, this inflation has a lagging effect and we had more inflation in our sales growth in Q2 than we did in Q1, not material but maybe a point or so. So that is an element of our acceleration, and we didn't accelerate that much. I think we accelerated two or three points on a two-year basis. Then as far as gas prices, as you know, you've followed this industry for a long, long time. Gas prices fluctuate and they fluctuated very significantly during my tenure here. What we've said historically is that there's not a ton of correlation between gas prices and our business until it hits a magic point. And historically, and I don't know what that magic point will be now because it's been a long time since we hit it, but historically, when it hit $4 a gallon, it seemed to impact miles driven. And you could almost see a direct correlation once it hit that $4 a gallon in miles driven. We don't know if that will hold true if it gets to $4 a gallon again. But for us, it goes up and it goes down. There's nothing we change in our business as a result of gas prices. So sometimes we're going to have industry tailwinds like we've had. Sometimes, we're going to have industry headwinds. We need to just manage this business through both environments and make sure that we optimize our performance based upon the macro environment. Brian Nagel : That's very helpful. Congratulations again. Thanks. Bill Rhodes : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Christopher Horvers from JPMorgan. Your line is live. Christian Carlino : Hi, good morning. It's Christian Carlino on for Chris. Could you just help us lay out some of the drivers of the inflation, whether that be product or supply chain costs and how you're thinking about that going ahead this year? I'm understanding you're not giving guidance. And do you expect it to be a potential lift to sales in the second half of calendar 2022? Jamere Jackson : Yes. As we mentioned before, I mean, we are seeing cost inflation in certain categories. We're also seeing higher transportation costs. We're seeing higher labor costs across the board. But I think the important point is that the industry pricing has remained rational, and we are pricing like our competitors to recover inflationary impacts, just as we've done in the past. And if you look at the history of this industry, it's been very disciplined about passing along inflation. And typically, what we see is that the demand doesn't fall off, just given the essential nature of the goods that we're providing. We've raised retail prices in line with inflation. As we mentioned, it's been mid-single digits. We expect that you could see similar dynamics in the back half of the year, and we'll be disciplined to raise prices accordingly. The other dynamics as it relates to this is that we're seeing broad-based inflation. It isn't just in our industry. But if you look at transportation, you look at labor, you look at wage rates, there's another side of the coin, which is our customers, are benefiting from higher wage rates and particularly that lower-end customer is benefiting from higher wage rates. And that, quite frankly, has provided a little bit of a safety net, probably more so than in the past. And we're filling that inflation even in our own business. If I think about what we're seeing in terms of wage inflation, it's probably -- on a percentage basis, it goes up maybe low single digits every year. We're probably seeing inflation 2x that, as we look to take care of our AutoZoners in an inflationary environment, our customers are seeing that. So those dynamics have made the lower-end consumer a little bit more resilient than probably they would have been in the past in an inflationary environment. So we're not seeing any wobbles at this point, but it is something that we're keeping our eye on. Christian Carlino : Got it. That's really helpful color. I appreciate that. And then, I guess, you're clearly doing a lot to leverage technology to improve fulfillment on the commercial side of the business. Could you speak to the opportunity to build out technology on the pricing front? Maybe sift through all data, are you able to -- do you have better pricing visibility across the commercial market than, say, some of your peers? How should we think about that opportunity? Jamere Jackson : Yes. One of the things I'm really excited about is, the investments that we're making in technology. And you typically don't hear CFOs say that, because typically, they're only thinking about the cost side of that. But the investments that we're making in technology are really underpinning the growth strategy. And the sophisticated nature with which we're able to figure out what we're doing on the store development side, how we're using AI and machine learning to help us think about pricing and get a lot more surgical from a pricing standpoint are all things that I'm really excited about to help us drive growth and improvements in our business. So indeed, we are using technology to do that. It's a little bit more difficult, sometimes on the commercial side of the business. But you combine that technology with the on-the-ground intelligence that we're receiving from our AutoZoners in the field, and I like our capabilities there. And it's given us a competitive advantage as we think about what we're doing from a pricing standpoint. Christian Carlino : Got it. Thanks. Thank you very much and congrats on a great quarter. Bill Rhodes : Thank you. Jamere Jackson : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is coming from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. Your line is live. Jackie Sussman : Hi. This is Jackie Sussman on for Simeon. Congrats on a great quarter. My first question is just on product availability. Kind of how much of an advantage has been in the stock over the last two years, has been kind of in-stock and does it narrow as supply chains come back? Kind of what is your outlook there? Thanks. Bill Rhodes : Yes. It's a fantastic question, Jackie. And frankly, we don't have really, really good data on how our in-stock position compares to our direct competitors or with retail in general, except for walk-in stores, and which we've done a lot of over time. I'm really, really proud of the way that our supply chain team, our merchandising team and our suppliers, they've worked at unprecedented levels during this past couple of years. And we've gotten very creative. Our logistics team has done an amazing job with all the challenges getting merchandise from the Far East to the United States into our distribution centers. Our belief is, we've had an improved in-stock position versus others. But our in-stock position, even today is a couple of hundred basis points below where it is normally. And it's been a little bit of a game of whack-a-mole. We solve it in this category, then it moves into that category, then it moves into another category. Overall, we're getting better and better and better on a weekly basis, just about. But we still got a ways to go before we get back to that level. Trying to quantify how much of that has been embedded in our share gains and sales lift, it's just -- it's too much art for us to figure that out. Jackie Sussman : Got you. Understood. And you talked a bit about the Duralast brand. Have you disclosed kind of Duralast penetration by product category? Which products are kind of over-indexed and which are under? Bill Rhodes : Yes. We haven't done it by product category. We obviously said it's over half of our hard part sales and continues to grow. We continue to introduce it in different categories or line extensions. Not too long ago, we introduced the Duralast Elite brake pad program, which is doing really well. We've added Duralast Gold chassis, which has done extremely well. A couple of years ago, we added Duralast shocks and struts. It's interesting, we did some market research as part of our commercial strategy development about four years ago, and we went by in the commercial business. And we said, what are the top three brands by product category? And the Duralast brand was listed in two categories as the number two brand, and we had never sold one piece in that category. So it just shows you the overall power of the Duralast brand. And if you turn back the clock a decade, it was interesting. People would have said we couldn't have been successful in commercial because we had private label. We don't have private label. We've got the Duralast brand, and it's high-quality products that our customers continue to turn to and trust. Jackie Sussman : Great. Congrats on a great quarter. Bill Rhodes : Thank you, Jackie. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Scot Ciccarelli from Truist. Your line is live. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. This is Joe [ph] on for Scot. I just had a quick question. Given the success you guys have shown in the Mega-Hub strategy, do you think we could see an acceleration of these rollouts next year and going forward? And what does that look like for margins? Bill Rhodes : Well, Jamere is in charge of store development so I'll answer it for him. The answer is yes. Jamere, you want to add some color? Jamere Jackson : You're writing my development plan for this year and next year. Thanks. The key for us is making sure that we leverage these assets. As Bill mentioned, every time we've doubled down on our Mega-Hub strategy, it's paid dividends for us and the Mega-Hubs are outperforming our expectations. The ability to put these assets in the market, provide a lift to the overall network, benefit both our DIY and our DIFM business, there's a very strong business building proposition for us. And we're going to go further and faster. One of the things I mentioned we're testing is higher density of Mega-Hubs in a marketplace. You typically are worried about cannibalization if you get stores or assets too close from a proximity standpoint. But what we're finding is when we put more parts into those markets and we do that in a disciplined way based on the analysis that we're doing and the research that we've done and the actual results that we're seeing, it's exceeded our expectation. Cannibalization is lower. It's a lift to the overall marketplace, and that's why we're so bullish and that's why we're going to double down on it. Unidentified Analyst : Appreciate it. Thanks. Bill Rhodes : Thank you, Joe. Before we conclude the call, I want to take a moment to reiterate. We believe our industry is in a strong position and our business model is solid. We are excited about our growth prospects for the year, and we will take nothing for granted as we understand our customers have alternatives to shopping with us as we continue to focus on the basics and strive to optimize shareholder value for the remainder of FY 2022, we are confident AutoZone can continue to be successful. Thank you very much for participating in today's call. Have a great day.",

Bill Rhodes : Good morning and thank you for joining us today for AutoZone\u2019s 2022 third quarter conference call. With me today are Jamere Jackson, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax. Regarding the third quarter, I hope you have had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter\u2019s results. If not, the press release along with slides complementing our comments today, are available on our website, www.autozone.com under the Investor Relations link. Please click on quarterly earnings conference calls to see them. As we begin, we want to continue to stress that our highest priority remains the safety and well-being of our customers and AutoZoners, Everyone, everyone across the organization continues to take this responsibility seriously and I am very proud of how our team continues to respond to COVID-19 and subsequent variants. While mass mandates have abated, we continue to make sure the environments our AutoZoners are working in and our customers are shopping in are as safe as possible for these times. Since the start of the pandemic, we have consistently recognized our AutoZoners in our stores and distribution centers, especially for giving exceptional service in the face of all the challenges COVID-19 has meant for all of us. This quarter, we will start the same, by again thanking our AutoZoners for their dedication to providing exceptional customer service, while helping our customers with their automotive needs. This morning, we will review our overall same-store sales, DIY versus DIFM trends, our sales cadence over the 12 weeks of the quarter, merchandise categories that drove our performance and any regional discrepancies. We will also share how inflation is affecting our costs and retails and how we think they will impact our business for the remainder of the fiscal year. Our domestic same-store sales were a solid 2.6% this quarter, on top of last year\u2019s very strong 28.9%. On both a 2-year and 3-year stack comp sales basis, our trends accelerated. Our team, once again, executed at an exceptionally high level and delivered amazing results despite the difficult comparisons. Our growth rates for retail and commercial were both strong, with domestic commercial growth north of 26%. Commercial set a third quarter record with $1.044 billion in sales, an incredible accomplishment. We generated $216 million more in sales this quarter than in Q3 of just last year. On a trailing four-quarter basis, our commercial sales are just under $4 billion versus $3.1 billion a year ago, up 27%. We also set a record in average weekly sales per store for any quarter at $16,600 versus $13,500 last year. On a 2-year basis, our sales accelerated from last quarter. Domestic commercial sales represented 30% of our domestic auto parts sales, another record for us compared to just 24.8% last year. Our commercial sales growth continues to be driven by a host of key initiatives. We have been working on for the last several years, improved satellite store availability, massive improvements in hub and mega hub coverage, the strength of the Duralast brand, better technology to make us easier to do business with, improve delivery times, enhancing our sales force effectiveness and living consistent with our pledge by being priced right for the value proposition we deliver. We continue to execute very well in commercial and we are extremely proud of our team and their performance. We are also very proud of our organization\u2019s performance in domestic DIY. As a reminder, it was last year\u2019s Q3 that had the massive stimulus payments that were distributed to consumers in the U.S. We ran a negative 4.5% comp this quarter on top of last year\u2019s record positive comps of 24.8%. While our DIY 2-year comp decelerated slightly from Q2\u2019s 2-year DIY comp, perhaps the more relevant comp is the DIY 3-year comp, which did accelerate. We were very proud of our DIY results considering we had such a tough comparison to last year. From the data we have available to us, we continue to not only retain the enormous share gains in dollars and units we built during the initial stages of the pandemic, but modestly build on those gains. Our performance, considering the amount of time from the last stimulus and the ending of the enhanced unemployment benefits, has substantially exceeded our expectations and gives us continued conviction about the sustainability of the massive elevated sales levels we have experienced since the beginning of the pandemic. Now, let\u2019s focus on the sales cadence. Our quarter spans at 12-week period. Our same-store sales increased materially over the first 4 weeks, up 11.8%. Then they were down over the middle 4 weeks by 5.2%. But remember, we were comping against the stimulus payments made during this time last year and our same-store sales then accelerated over the last 4 weeks, up 3%. All of these year-over-year comparisons are really difficult to interpret us so much is going on last year and even the year before. For Q3, our 2-year comp was 31.5% and the 4-week periods for the quarter increased 23.4%, 65.4% and 17% respectively. But our 3-year comp was 30.5% and the 4-week periods for the quarter increased 29.7%, 44.7% and 29.8% respectively. What I want to stress is that our 2-year and 3-year comp accelerated for the quarter from Q2\u2019s 2 and 3-year comparison. We are encouraged by the sustainability of these enormous sales gains. Regarding weather, in February and March, we experienced normal weather trends across the country. April, however, was a little cooler and a little wetter than normal. Overall, we feel weather did not play a material role in our sales performance. As we look forward to the summer months, we anticipate normal weather patterns. As a reminder, historically, extreme weather, hot or cold, drives parts failure and accelerated maintenance. Regarding the quarter\u2019s traffic versus ticket growth in retail, our traffic was down roughly 8.5%, while our ticket was up 4%. Our transaction count decline was correlated to last year\u2019s Q3 meaningful 16% traffic count increase. While we had expected a decline in transactions this quarter, we were pleased to exceed our beginning of the quarter assumptions on transaction count declines. We are also quite pleased with the ongoing growth in unit share we are seeing in our market share data. We are very encouraged by the sales trends we continue to experience in commercial. Most of the sales growth is coming from transaction growth from new and existing customers. I have visited our stores and commercial customers extensively this quarter and find it very encouraging to hear the positive comments from our customers and AutoZoners on our comprehensive offerings. The tone of our sales calls has changed meaningfully over the last few years as we continue to implement and execute our commercial acceleration strategy. As we start our final quarter of the fiscal year, we continue to be pleased with the momentum we are seeing in both domestic businesses heading into the summer months. During the quarter, there were some geographic regions that did better than others as there always are. This quarter, we saw a 54 basis points difference between the Northeast and Midwest compared to the balance of the country, with the Northeast and Midwest performing lower. As the Northeast and Midwest were cooler and wetter in April, their sales were below last year\u2019s results. We do not believe there will be lasting effects on sales performance in the Northeast and Midwest due to the slightly cooler April weather. Heading into the fourth quarter, we continue to believe weather will have a minimal effect on summer sales. Now, let\u2019s move into more specifics on our performance for the quarter. Our same-store sales were up 2.6% versus last year\u2019s third quarter. Our net income was $593 million and our EPS was $29.03 a share, increasing 9.6%. Regarding our merchandise categories in the retail business, our hard parts outperformed our sales floor categories, but there was less than a 1% difference between them. As gas prices jumped recently, our sales results in certain hard parts categories performed below our plan. This is unlike the sales floor categories, which were on plan. We have been especially pleased with our growth rates in many of our categories like batteries that have successfully left very strong performance last year and easily exceeded our planned assumptions for the quarter. We believe our hard parts business will strengthen as our customers return to driving more. Let me also address inflation and pricing. This quarter, we saw our sales increase by 7.8% from inflation, in line with the cost of goods inflation, which was up similarly at 7.2% on a like-for-like basis. We believe both numbers for the fourth quarter could be slightly higher than this past quarter\u2019s increases. As rising raw material pricing, labor and transportation costs are all impacting us and our suppliers, inflation has been prevalent in the aftermarket space. We have no way to say how long this will last, but our industry has been disciplined about pricing for decades and we expect that to continue. It is also notable that following periods of higher inflation, our industry has historically not reduced pricing to reflect lower ultimate cost. While we continue to be encouraged with the current sales environment, it remains difficult for us to forecast near to mid-term sales. What I have previously said is that the past five quarter sales have all been consistent on both a 2-year stacked comp basis and a 3-year stacked comp basis. While it\u2019s difficult to predict absolute sales levels going forward, we are excited about our growth initiatives, our team\u2019s exceptional execution and the tremendous share gains we have achieved in both sectors. Currently, the macro environment, while uncertain, remains favorable for our industry. And even if these near-term trends fade, we believe that we are in an industry that is positioned for solid growth over the long-term. For our fourth quarter, we expect our sales performance to be led by the continued strength in our commercial business as we continue executing on our differentiating initiatives. We will, as always, be transparent about what we are seeing and provide color on our markets and outlook as trends emerge. Before handing the call over to Jamere, I\u2019d like to make sure the listeners know what our key business priorities are for the remainder of the fiscal year and give some color on those. First, we are focusing on our supply chain. We have two initiatives in place to drive improved availability. One is our expanded hub and mega hub rollouts. We believe intelligently placing more inventory in local markets will lead to our ability to continue to say yes to our customers more frequently and in turn continued to drive our sales performance. Secondly, we are expanding our distribution center footprint. We announced opening two new domestic DCs and one additional DC in Mexico. These DCs will allow us to not only reduced drive times to stores and markets serviced by the new DCs, but they, being larger than the previous DCs, will allow us to carry inventory that is slower turning yet in demand across the country. We previously relied on our vendor community to carry these SKUs and shipped them once ordered by our stores. Our DC strategy is focused on carrying more product in our supply chain that was not available previously. These SKUs will smartly expand our stocked inventory across all 50 states. And lastly, we plan on continuing to grow our Mexico business, while accelerating growth in Brazil and we are leveraging many of the learnings we have in the U.S. to refine our offerings in Mexico and Brazil. Now, I will turn the call over to Jamere Jackson. Jamere? Jamere Jackson : Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everyone. As Bill mentioned, we had a strong third quarter, stacked on top of a remarkable third quarter last year, with 2.6% comp growth, a 2% decline in EBIT and a 9.6% increase in EPS. Our results for the first three quarters of the fiscal year have been incredibly strong as our growth initiatives continue to deliver great results and the efforts of our AutoZoners in our stores and distribution centers have continued to enable us to take advantage of robust market conditions. To start this morning, let me take a few minutes to elaborate on the specifics in our P&L for Q3. For the quarter, total sales were just under $3.9 billion, up 5.9% and total auto parts sales, which includes our domestic Mexico and Brazil stores, were $3.8 billion, up 5.7%. Let me give a little more color on sales and our growth initiatives, starting with our commercial business for the third quarter. Our domestic DIFM sales increased 26% to over $1 billion and were up 70.4% on a 2-year stack basis. Sales to our DIFM customers represented 27% of our total company sales and 30% of our domestic auto parts sales. Our weekly sales per program were $16,600, up 23% as we averaged just over $87 million in total weekly commercial sales. Once again, growth at 26% exceeded our internal expectations and was broad-based as both national and local accounts performed very well for the quarter. Our results for the quarter represented the highest weekly sales volume for any quarter in the history of the chain. I want to reiterate that our execution on our commercial acceleration initiatives is delivering better than expected results as we grow share by winning new business and increasing our share of wallet with existing customers. We have our commercial program in approximately 86% of our domestic stores, which leverages our DIY infrastructure and we are building our business with national, regional and local accounts. This quarter, we opened 43 net new programs, finishing with 5,276 total programs. As I have said since the outset of the year, commercial growth will lead the way in FY \u201822 and our results in the third quarter and year-to-date reflect this dynamic. We remain confident in our strategy and execution and believe we will continue gaining share. Delivering quality parts, particularly with our Duralast brand, improved assortments, competitive pricing and providing exceptional service has enabled us to drive double-digit sales growth for the past seven quarters. Our core initiatives are accelerating our growth and position us well in the marketplace. And notably, our mega hub strategy is driving strong performance and positioning us for an even brighter future in our commercial and retail businesses. Let me add a little color on our progress here. As we have discussed over the last several quarters, our mega hub strategy has given us tremendous momentum. We now have 67 Mega-Hub locations and we expect to open approximately 11 more over the remainder of the fiscal year. While I mentioned a moment ago, the commercial weekly sales per program average was $16,600 per program, the 67 mega hubs averaged significantly higher sales and are growing much faster than the balance of the commercial footprint. As a reminder, our mega hubs typically carry over 100,000 SKUs and drive tremendous sales lift inside the store box as well as serve as an expanded assortment source for other stores. The expansion of coverage and parts availability continues to deliver a meaningful sales lift to both our commercial and DIY business. This quarter, I visited one of our key markets where we are testing greater mega hub density. And although it\u2019s early innings, I am thrilled with the results. What we are learning is that not only are these assets performing well individually, but the fulfillment capability for the surrounding AutoZone stores gives our customers access to thousands of additional parts and lifts the entire network. This strategy is working and we are doubling down by raising our near-term mega hub target from approximately 110 to 200 mega hubs, supplemented by our new objective of a total of 300 regular hubs. Yes, we plan to have 500 total locations, with significantly higher levels of expanded parts availability and soon. By leveraging sophisticated analytics, we are expanding our market reach, driving closer proximity to our customers and improving our product availability and delivery times. Our AutoZoners are excited, our customers are excited and we are building a meaningful competitive advantage. On the retail side of our business, our domestic retail business was down 4.5%, but up 20.3% on a 2-year stack. The business has been remarkably resilient as we have gained and maintained significant market share since the start of the pending. As Bill mentioned, we saw traffic down 8.5% from last year\u2019s record traffic levels that were fueled by government stimulus. However, we also saw a 4% ticket growth as we continue to methodically raise prices in an inflationary environment. Our DIY business has continued to strengthen behind our growth initiatives in a favorable macro environment. On a macro basis, the market is experiencing a growing and aging car park and a challenging new and used car sales market for our customers, which are providing a strong tailwind for our business. Our in-stock positions, while still below historic norms, continue to improve as our supply chain and merchandising teams have made great progress in a challenging supply chain environment. We\u2019ve been able to navigate supply and logistics constraints and have product available to meet our customers\u2019 needs. Our AutoZoners, who are taking care of our customers, give us a key competitive advantage that enables us to thrive in this market environment. We remain confident that the fundamentals of our DIY business remains strong, macro conditions are favorable for us, and we\u2019ve had great execution by our teams. Now I\u2019ll say a few words regarding our international business. We continue to be pleased with the progress we\u2019re making in Mexico and Brazil. During the quarter, we opened three new stores in Mexico to finish with 673 stores, and three new stores in Brazil, ending with 58. And on a constant currency basis, we saw accelerated sales growth in both countries, in fact, at higher growth rates than we saw overall. We remain committed to our store opening schedules in both markets and expect both countries to be significant contributors to sales and earnings growth in the future. With 12% of our total store base now outside the U.S., and our commitment to continue expansion in a disciplined way, international growth will be an attractive and meaningful contributor to AutoZone\u2019s future growth. Now let me spend a few minutes on the P&L and gross margins. For the quarter, our gross margin was down 54 basis points, driven primarily by the accelerated growth in our commercial business, where mix drove margin pressure, but increased our total gross profit dollars 4.8%, a welcome trade-off that is a net positive for our business. As Bill mentioned earlier in the call, we\u2019re continuing to see cost inflation in certain product categories, along with rising transportation and distribution center costs. We are continuing to take pricing actions to offset inflation, and consistent with prior inflationary cycles, the industry pricing remains rational. Moving to operating expenses. Our expenses were up 9.8% versus last year Q3 as SG&A, as a percentage of sales, deleveraged 114 basis points. The deleverage was driven by payroll as last year\u2019s historic DIY comp drove significant and more than appropriate leverage on SG&A, where we simply couldn\u2019t staff to the accelerated sales growth fast enough. We also continue to invest at an accelerated pace in IT to underpin our growth initiatives, and these investments will pay dividends and user experience, speed and productivity. We will continue to be disciplined on SG&A growth as we move forward and manage expenses in line with sales growth over time. Moving to the rest of the P&L. EBIT for the quarter was $786 million, down 2.2% and versus the prior year\u2019s quarter, driven by last year\u2019s strong sales performance in DIY. Interest expense for the quarter was $41.9 million, down 7% from Q3 a year ago, although our debt outstanding at the beginning of the quarter was $6.1 million versus $5.3 billion in Q3 last year. We\u2019re planning interest in the $61 million range for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 versus $58.1 million in last year\u2019s fourth quarter. For the quarter, our tax rate was 20.3% versus 21.4% in last year\u2019s third quarter. This quarter\u2019s rate benefited 284 basis points from stock options exercised, while last year, it benefited 211 basis points. For the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022, we suggest investors model us at approximately 23.5% before any assumptions on credits due to stock option exercises. Moving to net income and EPS. Net income for the quarter was $593 million, down 0.6% versus last year\u2019s third quarter. Our diluted share count of $20.4 million was 9.3% lower than last year\u2019s third quarter. The combination of lower net income offset by lower share count drove earnings per share for the quarter to $29.03, up 9.6% over the prior year\u2019s third quarter. Now let me talk about our free cash flow for Q3. For the third quarter, we generated $843 million of operating cash flow and spent $161 million in capital expenditures, allowing us to generate $682 million in free cash flow. Year-to-date, we\u2019ve generated $1.6 billion in free cash flow, down 13% versus the prior year. The primary reason for the decline in free cash flow versus last year is the timing of merchandise inventories and payments this year versus last year. We expect to continue being an incredibly strong free cash flow generator going forward. We remain committed to returning meaningful amounts of cash to our shareholders. Regarding our balance sheet, our liquidity position remains very strong and our leverage ratios remain below our historic norms. Our inventory per store was up 10.7% versus Q3 last year. Total inventory increased 13.9% over the same period last year, driven primarily by inflation and our growth initiatives. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable on a per store basis, was a negative $216,000 versus negative $167,000 last year and negative $198,000 last quarter. As a result, accounts payable, as a percent of gross inventory, finished the quarter at 127.9% versus last year\u2019s Q3 of 123.9%. Lastly, I\u2019ll spend a moment on capital allocation and our share repurchase program. We repurchased $900 million of AutoZone stock in the quarter. At quarter end, we had just under $2.1 billion remaining under our share buyback authorization. The strong earnings, balance sheet and powerful free cash flow we generated this year has allowed us to buy back over 8% of the shares outstanding since the beginning of the fiscal year. We\u2019ve bought back over 90% of the shares outstanding of our stock since our buyback inception in 1998, while investing in our existing assets and growing our business. We remain committed to this disciplined capital allocation approach that will enable us to invest in the business and return meaningful amounts of cash to shareholders. We finished Q3 at 2.1x EBITDA, which is below our historical objective of 2.5x EBITDA. However, we remain committed to this objective, and we expect to return to the 2.5x target when appropriate. To wrap up, we had another very successful quarter. We\u2019re driving long-term shareholder value by investing in our growth initiatives, driving robust earnings and cash and returning excess cash to our shareholders. Our strategy continues to work. We\u2019re growing our market share and improving our competitive positioning in a disciplined way. I continue to have tremendous confidence in our ability to drive significant and ongoing value for our shareholders. Now I\u2019ll turn it back to Bill. Bill Rhodes : Thank you, Jamere. We had very solid results so far in fiscal \u201822, and we remain focused on superior execution and customer service. Our culture was built on providing exceptional service, and this is what we will continue to define our success well into the future. And looking to the future, it is still very difficult to predict the next 6 to 12 months. But our perspective has meaningfully morphed over the last two quarters. On last quarter\u2019s call, we discussed how most, if not all, of the growth in sales we experienced since the start of the pandemic was sustainable. We believed our competitive positioning was materially improved, as indicated by our significant retail share gains and rapidly accelerated commercial sales growth. We believe customer behavior may have permanently changed. We continue to believe all of this today. If this holds true, it will be the 4th time in the last 30 years that the economy and society have been through significant shocks, leading to material acceleration in our growth in sales and profits without a corresponding decline back to pre-recessionary or pre-pandemic levels. Our industry is unique and it has a very long track record of strong performance with high return and cash flow characteristics. As we have now lapped the second anniversary of the pandemic, some of the measurements we have all used recently to measure our performance will become skewed. Remember, at the beginning of the pandemic, our sales dropped radically. Our retail sales rebounded quickly with the April 2020 stimulus, but commercials rebound lagged and took several months. For Q4, in light of the amazing performance in the back half of 2020, the 2-year comparison for overall comps won\u2019t be comparable. We would encourage you to migrate to studying 3-year comps to gauge our fourth quarter performance. That said, soon, we look forward to returning to focusing solely on 1 year comparisons. We continue to be bullish on our industry and, in particular, on our own opportunities for 2022. We believe the macro backdrop is in our favor for near and long-term. Our customers across the Americas, they want to get out and drive, and we are here when they need helpful advice. Our team has worked diligently and collaboratively with our suppliers. And together, they have done a very good job dealing with the enormous supply chain challenges that exist for everyone. We continue to believe we are better in stock than most retailers, and I think our results obviously support that belief. I\u2019d like to share a few other points with you. It has been a rather noisy earnings season for retailers, and I want to be clear, crystal clear about our business and the environment. First, I believe AutoZone can manage effectively through this inflationary environment. Historically, our industry has been disciplined and rational about passing along cost increases with higher retails and that is true today. Second, we feel our store staffing levels are appropriate, and we can, and we will manage expenses appropriately for either stronger or weaker sales environment. Our business and our industry has been remarkably resilient and, frankly, robust. For the remainder of fiscal \u201822, we are focused on further growing share, but as always, doing so on a very profitable basis. Last quarter, we announced we would begin construction on three new distribution centers to fuel continued growth, two in the U.S. and one in Mexico. Expected to open in fiscal \u201824, these new distribution centers represent a meaningful acceleration in our historic investments in DCs as during the pandemic, we\u2019ve learned we need to have more excess capacity. Secondly, we are targeting to open 11 more new domestic mega hub in the U.S. in this quarter, Q4. These mega hubs will enhance our availability and support growth in both our retail and commercial businesses. As we have mentioned many times before, our mega hub strategy is at the core of materially improving our inventory availability, and our results show that they are working. For the fiscal year, we continue to expect to open more than 200 new stores throughout the Americas with notable acceleration in our Brazil business. Our fourth quarter will be a busy one from a store development standpoint. These capacity expansion investments reflect our bullishness on our industry and our own growth prospects. We are being disciplined, yet we are being aggressive. Lastly, I want to reiterate how proud I am of our AutoZoners across the stores and distribution centers, in particular, for their commitment to servicing our customers and doing so in a very safe manner. First and foremost, our focus will be on keeping our AutoZoners and customers safe while providing our customers with their automotive needs. And secondly, we must continuously challenge ourselves during these extraordinary times to position our company for even greater future success. We know that investors will ultimately measure us by what our future cash flows look like 3 to 5 years from now, and we very much welcome that challenge. I continue to be bullish on our industry and, in particular, on AutoZone. Now we\u2019d like to open up the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question for today is coming from Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Bret, you line is live. Bret Jordan : Good morning, guys. Bill Rhodes : Good morning, Bret. Bret Jordan : On the mega hubs, could you talk maybe about the geographic reach? You noted that the DIFM is accelerating in their markets. I mean how far can they support smaller stores geographically? Bill Rhodes : Well, frankly, Bret, they are supporting smaller and smaller radius of geography today than they did before because we were getting so many of them. When we first built them, it was not uncommon for them to be supporting stores that were 2, 3, maybe even 400 miles away. A lot of times, that would be on an overnight basis. The real crux of it is, how do we get the stores that are in, call it, 30 or 40 miles away from the mega hub, and how can we get them service 3x a day. That\u2019s when we really performed well. But the biggest part of the mega hub performance is the mega hub itself. The four walls of the mega hubs are just continuing. Every time we look at them, and every time we open some and open more, they continue to outperform our expectations. And one of the remarkable things is they are not cannibalizing close-in stores like we thought they would. So as we talked on the last call, remember when we first launched the mega hubs, we said we would have 25 to 40. We\u2019re now in the 60s, and we\u2019re headed to 200. That just goes to show you the power of these mega hubs. Bret Jordan : Great. And then one quick follow-up. You noted some impact on hard parts maybe correlated to higher fuel prices year-to-date. Are you seeing any trade down, whether it be in the Do-It-For-Me or the DIY space, given what\u2019s going on in inflationary to the consumer? Bill Rhodes : Sure. Yes. We\u2019re hearing a lot of questions about what\u2019s going on with the low-end consumer, are people trading down? Our hard parts business, I don\u2019t want to overstate that. I mean, I think I said it was off about 1% during that. It is very difficult right now to get clarity on the comparisons. Let\u2019s remember \u2013 some people are talking about weather. We\u2019re saying we don\u2019t think weather was a meaningful impact on our business. What was meaningful was, we went up against stimulus from March of last year that lasted for 4 to 6 weeks. That is really the story. And so it\u2019s hard to say the low-end consumer, sure their purchases are down versus last year, of course they are. They had a massive amount of stimulus in their pocket. I think it will be interesting to see what happens over the fourth quarter. Are we watching what happens with the low-end consumer? Absolutely. But I also want to remind you the comment that I made at the end. If you think about the \u2013 over the last 30 years, there is been four significant shocks to the economy. In all four of those shocks, our performance and our industry\u2019s performance has made a meaningful step up during those shocks, recessions and pandemics that our business has gone up, and it\u2019s never stepped back down. Bret Jordan : Great. Thank you. Bill Rhodes : Yes. Thank you, Bret. Operator : Your next question for today is coming from Christopher Hoover with JPMorgan. Christopher, your line is live. Christopher Hoover : Thank you. So a few questions on the gross margin front. As you look ahead, there\u2019re some headwinds that seem to be emerging on the fuel side. How do you think about pricing and fuel cost pressures in terms of product pricing? And then your success in commercial obviously has some expense on gross margin rate. So given those two factors, would you think that gross margin continues to see the type of year-over-year headwinds that you saw in the current quarter and the past couple of quarters? Jamere Jackson : Yes. On the first part of your question, I mean, there is no question, we\u2019re seeing cost inflation in certain categories. We\u2019re also seeing higher transportation costs. We\u2019re seeing higher fuel costs. However, as we reiterated on the call, the industry pricing is rational, and we\u2019re actually pricing to recover all of those inflationary impacts, just as we\u2019ve done in the past. So you\u2019ve seen us move retail prices up. As inflation has moved up mid-single digits, our pricing has moved. I think our entire industry has done that. And as I\u2019ve said before, inflation has been a little bit of our friend in terms of what we see in terms of retail pricing. Now as it relates to our commercial business, we want to be crystal clear. Our goal is to create a faster growing business with higher margin dollars. This is a much more sustainable way for us to grow our cash and, ultimately, shareholder value. Our domestic commercial business grew 26%. It\u2019s a mix headwind. We expect our domestic commercial business to continue to outgrow our DIY business, and that\u2019s a trade-off that we welcome. We will continue to run a very disciplined playbook on margin expansion opportunities across all of our business, which includes things that we\u2019re doing from a cost standpoint, raising our prices and managing our expenses accordingly. But we like the fact that we\u2019ve got a commercial business with very strong operating margins that is accretive to the overall business. Christopher Hoover : Understood. That\u2019s great. And then my other question is somewhat technical. As you think about the fuel impact of the trucks and the cars going from the store to the shops and the mechanics, where does that show up in your P&L? Is that an SG&A item? And how do you think about your \u2013 the ability to maybe price that in or offset that impact? Because clearly, diesel and gas accelerated over the quarter, and that impact should be bigger as you look forward. Jamere Jackson : Yes. If you look at diesel in particular, it\u2019s up probably 50% versus a year ago. That does show up in our SG&A expenses. So as we\u2019re running the cost playbook and we\u2019re running our pricing playbook, we have to take all of those things into account. And as I said before, when we look at our business in total, and look at all of the inflationary impacts, we\u2019re pricing our retails accordingly to make sure that we maintain our margin structure going forward. Bill Rhodes : Yes. Just for clarity, there is pressure in both gross margin and SG&A. The majority of the diesel is in the warehouse and distribution costs, which is in gross profit. And then our \u2013 we have one of the largest light-duty fleets in our commercial and field management folks. And so there is a lot of pressure in SG&A as well. Christopher Hoover : Right. And then the idea is you\u2019re going to manage pricing to help offset that the light-duty expense pressure in SG&A? Jamere Jackson : That\u2019s right. Bill Rhodes : Both of them, both the light-duty and the heavy-duty. Christopher Hoover : Got it. Thanks very much. Best of luck. Bill Rhodes : Thanks, Chris. Operator : Your next question for today is coming from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Simeon Gutman : Good morning everyone. My first question is on some of the margin and growth comments Jamere just made. Given the success you have in DIFM, are you making trade-offs between how much quicker you can grow and the margin dilution? And then meaning can you grow even quicker and maybe a bigger detriment to margin or are you seeing less detriment to margin as this expansion is happening in commercial? Bill Rhodes : I will say it crystal clear. No, we are not constraining our growth based upon the margin characteristics of the DIFM business. We set it for 1 million years. DIFM today operates at lower gross margins and lower operating margins. But it grows \u2013 it operates in operating margins the way we look at it on generally an incremental basis in the mid-teens. We will grow that business as fast as humanly possible. If we could add another $4 billion in sales and the corresponding operating income that comes with that tomorrow, with the limited amount of incremental capital that we have to deploy, we would do it tomorrow. We were very focused on operating profit dollars. And as we look forward, I would just encourage you all to look at our business from a gross margin point of view, how are we doing in DIY and how are we doing in commercial. Our goals will be to marginally increase those gross margins over time. If we do that and that puts \u2013 and the commercial business grows at 26% and it puts pressure on the overall gross margin, so be it. Simeon Gutman : Fair enough. And Bill, I was intrigued by some of the comments you made about some permanent changes to the industry. Were you underscoring how resilient the business is, or are you also thinking that maybe the business or the industry can grow at a faster rate than it has historically? Bill Rhodes : Yes. I don\u2019t know that I would say it can grow at a faster rate the industry itself. I clearly think that we can, and maybe some of our close-in competitors can grow faster in the commercial business because that is still so fragmented. But the bigger part of my point is this is the most remarkably resilient business I have ever seen. And I don\u2019t understand why, when we have a recession, our business goes up and we come out of it and our business never goes down. It seems to flat line and then grow from there. It\u2019s amazing to me. Simeon Gutman : Okay. Thanks. Good luck. Bill Rhodes : Yes. Thank you, Simeon. Operator : Your next question for today is coming from Michael Lasser with UBS. Michael Lasser : Good morning. Thank you all for taking my question. The roads on the topic of recessionary environments and the impact that it has on the auto aftermarket is one of the drivers during those periods that people shift away from buying new cars and are more interested and need to maintain their existing cars? And so the dynamic this time around could be influenced by the fact that new cars that might used car sales have been depressed because of the supply constraints, so the industry might not see as much of a countercyclical boost as it\u2019s seen in the past? Bill Rhodes : Yes. I think all of that makes perfect sense, Michael. I wish we had empirical evidence that could tell us that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happened. I will tell you, if you asked me a year ago if we were going to retain the kind of sales gains that we had grown over the first 2 years of the pandemic, I would have said I doubt it. But there has also been other pressures that have happened. Clearly, the lack of new cars and the elevation of pricing, the radical elevation of pricing of used cars has our customers view on how long they are going to have that vehicle changing to much longer than it normally is. When that happens, they seem to take better care of their cars. I think we also didn\u2019t envision the inflation impact that we are seeing. And clearly, that\u2019s \u2013 I talked about some traffic declines, some significant traffic declines, 8.5% in the retail business. That was up against 16% traffic growth last year. I will take a 2-year comp of 7.5% traffic all day long, but inflation and the ability to pass that inflation on has helped us. That\u2019s another key element of this industry is the inelasticity of demand in this sector of retail is probably unparalleled. And so as this inflation has come through, it\u2019s helped us get through that period of time as well. Michael Lasser : My follow-up question is, you have clearly gained market share. If we compare your results to a variety of indicators, that\u2019s pretty obvious. And your messaging is that it\u2019s as a result of many different factors, one of which does seem to be that you have made some price investments initially on the DIY side, more recently on the DIFM side. One of your competitors has been vocal about making similar price investments on \u2013 especially on the DIFM side. So, at this point, do you feel the need to make further price investments, either on the DIY side or on the commercial side, either \u2013 in an effort to either maintain or grow all the share that you have gained in the last couple of years? Thank you. Bill Rhodes : The short answer is absolutely no. The longer answer is, we made very marginal price investments on the retail business. We have far lapped those probably six months or so ago. They were very targeted to specific highly-visible commodity-related items, and we are focused on our comparisons versus mass. That\u2019s in the past. About this time last year, in fact, we have now annualized it. We completed rolling out the pricing changes that we made in our commercial business. Again, I want to be crystal clear. The growth that we saw in commercial over the last couple of years is not a result of pricing investments alone. They are an element. There is many other elements, the mega-hubs and hubs, the Duralast brand. We have rolled out \u2013 we had the single largest technology investment in the company\u2019s history focused on commercial and commercial deliveries. Our delivery times are dropping. So, we have done a lot of different things, and we lowered our pricings to make sure that we were focused on pricing versus a different competitive set. All that together has worked and has worked really, really well. At this point in time, we do not have any additional pricing actions being tested nor being considered. We believe we are very happy with our prices today in retail and commercial except that we need to pass inflation costs along as they come in. We will be very focused on trying to keep the same kinds of competitive positioning, but we need to pass on the inflation as it comes through us in costs. Michael Lasser : Thank you very much and good luck. Bill Rhodes : Yes. Thank you, Mike. Operator : Your next question for today is coming from Mike Baker with Davidson. Mike Baker : Okay. Thanks guys. I don\u2019t know if you can answer this, but just curious, why do you think weather didn\u2019t have an impact on your business? It had an impact on all your competitors\u2019 businesses and many other seasonal businesses. Why would your business be different, particularly as you over-index to DIY, which I think is probably a little bit more weather-sensitive than the commercial business? Bill Rhodes : It\u2019s a very fair question. The information we have was, it was, as I have said, slightly cooler and slightly wetter. The real question \u2013 or the real discussion for this quarter was not weather it was stimulus. And I don\u2019t know how you fared out a 0.5 point or 1 point change in weather dynamics when you are talking about 2-year comps of 30% that were driven by stimulus. So, we are trying to focus on the major elements and make sure we communicate to you what we think are the real drivers, and frankly, the drivers that will help you understand our long-term trends. The weather was marginally different and I can\u2019t ferret it out in a 30% 2-year comp. Mike Baker : Okay. That\u2019s fair enough. And then one other follow-up. You did say hard parts are down, you said only 100 basis points. So, you don\u2019t want to make too big of a deal of it, but you did say you thought it was because of gas prices. So, are you implying there \u2013 again, I don\u2019t want to make a big deal, but did you \u2013 do you think people are just driving less on the higher gas prices? And then you said that should get better, does it get better only when gas prices come back down, or should we\u2026? Bill Rhodes : I think you had two elements that happened. You had two elements that happened to miles driven. We are still rebounding from the pandemic decrease of miles driven. Now you have got the gas prices implications. What we have seen historically in the past, Mike, is when gas prices hit $4 a gallon, you can see a direct correlation with those prices and a decline in miles driven. What we said historically as we have seen people when it gets to those elevated levels, they change their behavior. They change where they live, they change where they work. Obviously, with remote work and those kind of things, there could be different nuances this time. A lot of people are saying, yes, but $4 a gallon back then would be the equivalent to $5 whatever today, that may be true. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the case or not. This has happened in pretty short order. And I think we need to watch what happens to miles driven over time. As we think about it, it will be a short-term phenomenon, just like it has been in the past. Our focus isn\u2019t about next quarter or even the quarter after that. And our focus, as I have said, is how do we think about driving this business to drive long-term cash flow at really high return rates and think out 3 years to 5 years. Gas prices will come and go, and it doesn\u2019t really impact how we manage the business day-to-day. Mike Baker : Fair enough. I appreciate the color. Thank you. Bill Rhodes : Yes. Thank you. Operator : Your next question for today is coming from Scot Ciccarelli with Truist Securities. Scot Ciccarelli : Good morning guys. So, you have mentioned, obviously, the mega-hubs quite a few times and the positive impact that you see on your sales. Is there a way to potentially quantify the sales lift that you experienced in a market when you open a mega-hub? Jamere Jackson : Yes. A couple of things stand out to us. As we said, as we have tested greater density, we are seeing two dynamics. One is the business plan that we build usually justifies the mega-hub based on what happens inside the four walls. And so we are seeing those sales be largely incremental, as Bill mentioned. We are not seeing the cannibalization. What we have tested is as we put more mega-hubs into the market and jam more parts in the market, those satellite stores are benefiting tremendously because they are leveraging the inventory and the availability from those mega-hubs, and they are seeing an overall lift as well. We haven\u2019t talked specifically about what the quantification is. But I can tell you that it\u2019s significant, and it is what\u2019s given us confidence to take our target from 110 to 200. And quite honestly, we will likely go beyond that as we continue to test and learn more in the future. Scot Ciccarelli : And Jim, as the mega-hubs kind of mature, do they follow a new store maturity type curve? Jamere Jackson : They do. But one of the things that we are experiencing right now, particularly with the growth in our commercial business, is that the ramp for the mega-hubs has been faster than what we have seen in the past. And that is because as we have put those additional parts into the marketplace, while we are doing all the work that Bill mentioned on our commercial acceleration initiatives, those mega-hubs are ramping up faster than we ever anticipated. Scot Ciccarelli : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question for today is coming from Daniel Imbro with Stephens. Daniel Imbro : Hey. Good morning guys and congrats on the quarter. Bill, I wanted to ask a higher-level question on the Do-It-For-Me side. So, obviously, you have been gaining share. But when you are not winning the business, from an operational standpoint, is there a consistent area of feedback you hear from customers where you need to improve, or any consistent learnings that you are seeing where you can still improve to gain more share when you are not winning that business? Bill Rhodes : Yes. It\u2019s a really great question. I mentioned it in the call, and I have been out in the field a whole lot in the last three months. And the tone of the conversations with our commercial customers, be that national accounts at the senior leader level or in our commercial shops, has just \u2013 the tenor of the conversations have changed. It\u2019s a question of how can I give you more business versus the, age old things of, it was about availability, it was about the Duralast brand. The Duralast brand conversation has turned from a significant negative to a positive. And now, with our availability, it has meaningfully changed. So, I am not really hearing that we always can get better on delivery times. And if anybody wants to tell you why they are not giving you business, that\u2019s a very easy one. Well, now we have actual data that says, you are right, we are delivering to you too slow. Your average deliveries are 31 minutes and 37 seconds, and we apologize for that. We are going to work to get that better. And so we have got new tools at our disposal. We have got much better inventory assortments. The Duralast brand is amazing. And so the tenor of those conversations is really radically different than they were just 3 years or 4 years ago. Daniel Imbro : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then Jamere, maybe more financial question, I know you just talked about the maturity curve of the new mega-hubs and DCs. But with three DCs coming online and 11 mega hubs, I guess in the near-term, what kind of SG&A pressure should we expect? I would assume there is inherent deleverage just from preopening costs and then as they ramp. So, kind of what kind of headwinds should we anticipate that puts on the SG&A line over the coming quarters? Jamere Jackson : I mean it will clearly be some pressure on SG&A, but what I will say is that we have been very disciplined about managing our SG&A expenses. And quite frankly, when we have to make these kind of investments, number one, they have great payoffs associated \u2013 paybacks associated with them. But number two, we look for bill payers elsewhere in the P&L to be able to go do that. But what we have done over time, and what we will continue to do is, we invest in a very disciplined way in growth, and we are not afraid to de-lever SG&A if we need to, to support that growth, because in the long-term, it\u2019s the right thing for our business. So, we have a plan over time to manage SG&A in line with our sales growth. But in the short-term, you may see us spike it up from time-to-time to support the investments in growth. And we have done that not only with the capacity investments that you talked about, we have done it with our IT expenses over time, and we will continue to do that going forward. Daniel Imbro : Got it. Thanks so much. Best of luck guys. Bill Rhodes : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is coming from Liz Suzuki with Bank of America. Liz Suzuki : Great. Thank you for taking my question. Regarding the comment you made about gross margin and just a hyper focus on mix and how that impacts your overall gross margin. How can we think about tracking improvements in margin in each of your categories? Like where will we see that show up in metrics? Jamere Jackson : Yes. I think two things you will see. Number one, we will continue to have mix pressure associated with our commercial business going forward. And we will be very transparent about what we see there. But all the playbook that we have historically run on managing gross margin, taking pricing actions in categories, driving down costs in certain categories, all those tactics will still be a play. And you will see us over time make positive improvements in gross margin. It\u2019s just that we are starting off in an environment where our commercial business is growing significantly faster than DIY, and that\u2019s going to be a margin pressure that we welcome because of the nature of the business and the fact that it\u2019s growing our overall gross profit dollars. So, we will be very transparent about it as we move forward, and it\u2019s a trade-off that we welcome. Liz Suzuki : Yes. That makes sense. And I mean is there a rule of thumb that we should think about as the differential in gross margin between commercial and retail in general? Jamere Jackson : Well, it will depend on how fast the commercial business actually grows. If you look at the differential this quarter, it was significant, which actually drove gross margin deleverage this quarter. What I would say that if you were on an apples-to-apples basis in terms of growth rate, we would have actually seen gross margin be positive this quarter. But you have got the mix headwind there. It\u2019s a welcome trade-off and we are delivering. Liz Suzuki : Got it. Thank you. Bill Rhodes : Thank you. Operator : Your next question for today is coming from Zach Fadem with Wells Fargo. Zach Fadem : Hey, good morning. With the elevated used vehicle pricing and lack of new cars available, just curious how you think that\u2019s impacted your addressable market? And to what extent scrap rates have declined out there with your customers? And as we inevitably go back to an environment where new cars come back on, or used vehicle prices start to come back down, to what extent do you think that would be a headwind for the industry? Jamere Jackson : Well, I think you have got a dynamic here where, clearly, the macro environment associated with used cars is \u2013 has a significant impact on what you are seeing in the car park. The dynamic associated with new cars is similar. I mean our \u2013 if you look at the data on used cars, they are up 23% year-over-year, up 50% pre-pandemic. If you look at what\u2019s happening with dealer lots right now, they are probably carrying about a third of the inventory that they were pre-pandemic. So, it is a significant driver. What you are seeing though is that the car park is actually aging. People are hanging on to the vehicles longer. In fact the data that came out this morning shows that it\u2019s now ticked up to 12.2 years is the average age of a vehicle on the road. And those things are all producing a tailwind for us. I think what we are focused on as a business is, one, managing our business associated with the vehicles that are in operations, making sure that we have the assortment to go deal with that. And as there are changes in the car park, there are changes in technology, there are changes in consumer behavior, we just manage our business accordingly, and we have done that historically over time, and it\u2019s been a good outcome for us. Zach Fadem : And then with the step-up in mega-hub density, is it fair to assume that double-digit commercial growth remains the norm for your business through fiscal \u201823? And do you view the opportunity ahead more about getting denser with existing customers or expanding your reach to newer customers that maybe you haven\u2019t been able to serve at this point? Jamere Jackson : We will continue to see our commercial business have very strong growth. And the initiatives that we have talked about, whether it\u2019s the things that we are doing with assortment, the things that we have done with technology, the things that we have done with pricing, all of those things are driving significant growth in our commercial business, and we expect that trend to continue for us. Zach Fadem : Thanks for the time. Bill Rhodes : Great. Thank you. Before we conclude the call, I want to take a moment to reiterate. We believe our industry is in a strong position and our business model is solid. We are excited about our growth prospects for the year, but we will take nothing for granted as we understand our customers have alternatives. We have exciting plans that should help us succeed for the future, but I want to stress that this is a marathon and not a sprint. As we continue to focus on the basics and strive to optimize shareholder value for the remainder of FY \u201822, we are confident AutoZone can continue to be successful. Lastly, as we celebrate Memorial Day next Monday, we should remember all of our country\u2019s heroes, both past and present. We owe these Americans, a tremendous debt of gratitude. Thank you for participating in today\u2019s call. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s conference call. You may disconnect your phone lines at this time, and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.",

Bill Rhodes : Good morning and thank you for joining us today for AutoZone's 2022 fourth quarter conference call. With me today are Jamere Jackson, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax. Regarding the fourth quarter, I hope you've had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not the press release, along with slides complementing our comments today, are available on our website, www.autozone.com under the Investor Relations link. Please click on quarterly earnings conference calls to see them. As we begin, we want to recognize our AutoZoners for their tremendous success this past year. They far exceeded our expectations from the beginning of the year and in a very challenging environment as our pledge states put our customers first, resulting in additional share gains and terrific sales performance on top of fantastic results in FY '21. We grew our overall sales of 11.1% on top of 15.8% growth last year, resulting in a two-year growth that is among the highest we've ever experienced. We could not have achieved this success without phenomenal contributions from across the organization. This year began with the resurgence of the pandemic, ongoing supply chain challenges, a very difficult staffing environment and finished with rising interest rates and inflation at its highest levels in decades, all as major storylines. Throughout the year, our team's incredible supply chain efforts to improve our in-stock position, likely at industry-leading levels, helped our sales growth. These efforts resulted in a positive retail comp and an exceptionally strong commercial comp for both the quarter and the year. Any way you evaluate our FY '22 performance, we had a terrific year. Congratulations AutoZoners, and thanks for always putting our customers first, which led to this success. This morning, we will review our Q4 overall same-store sales DIY versus DIFM trends, our sales cadence over the 16 weeks of the quarter, merchandise categories that drove our performance and any regional discrepancies. We will also share how inflation is affecting our cost and our retails and how we think inflation will impact our business for FY '23. Our domestic same-store sales were an impressive 6.2% this quarter on top of last year's 4.3%. On a two-year basis, we delivered 10.5% comp and on a three-year basis, a remarkable 32.3% stacked comp. Our team once again executed at an exceptionally high level and delivered amazing results despite the difficult comparisons and significant challenges I mentioned above. Our growth rates for commercial and retail were both strong, with domestic commercial growth north of 20%. This quarter was our sixth consecutive commercial growth above 20%. Additionally, Commercial set a fourth quarter record with $1.442 billion in sales, an impressive accomplishment. We generated $260 million more in sales this quarter than in Q4 last year. For the fiscal year, our commercial sales were $4.2 billion versus $3.3 billion just a year ago, up over 26%. Last fall, at our National Sales Meeting, our Senior VP of Commercial, Grant McGee, declared a stretched goal to achieve $4 billion in sales for FY '22. That lofty goal ultimately was a near lofty enough. We also set a record average weekly sales per store for any quarter at $17,000 per store versus $14,400 last year. Domestic commercial sales represented 30% of our domestic auto parts sales, another record for us compared to just 26% in last year's quarter. Our commercial sales growth continues to be driven by key initiatives we have been working on for the last several years. Improved satellite store inventory, massive improvements in hub and mega-hub coverage, the strength of the Duralast brand, better technology to make us easier to do business with, improve delivery times, enhancing our sales force effectiveness and living consistent with our pledge by being quote priced right for the value proposition we deliver. We continue to execute in commercial, and we are extremely proud of our team's performance. We're also very proud of our organization's performance in domestic DIY. We had a positive 1.1% comp this quarter. While our two-year comp decelerated from Q3's, we believe the more relevant comp is the three-year and we are higher than last year's quarter at 24.5% versus 21.6%. For the year, we were very proud of our DIY results considering we grew so much in FY '21. To level set, we had 11% DIY comp in FY '21. And for the full year '22, we were up 2.9%. These results are very strong, considering the difficult comparison, which was driven by the various forms of stimulus last year. From the data we have available to us, we continue to retain the vast majority of the enormous share gains in dollars and more importantly, in units that we built during the initial stages of the pandemic. And our recent performance gives us continued conviction about the sustainability into FY '23. Now let's focus on sales cadence. Our quarter spans 16 weeks, early May through the end of August. Our same-store sales increased materially over the first four weeks to high single digits, 8.4%. The next eight weeks, our growth was nearly halved, dropping to 4.9%. And then. it reaccelerated over the last four weeks, up 6.8%. All of these year-over-year comparisons are difficult to interpret as so much was going on last year and even the year before. However, for Q4, our two-year comp was 10.5% and the four-week periods of the quarter increased 10.4%, 9.4%, 7.9% and 14.4%, respectively. But our three-year comp was 32.3% and for the four-week periods of the quarter increased 35.2%, 33.5%, 30.1% and 31%, respectively. We have been encouraged by the sustainability of the enormous sales gains we generated since the beginning of the pandemic. Regarding weather in May and June, we experienced slightly cooler and wetter weather trends across the country. By July, however, it became very hot across most of the country, and it remained unseasonably warm for August. Overall, we feel weather had a small but slightly positive effect on our sales performance. As we look forward to the fall months, we anticipate normal weather patterns. As a reminder, historically extreme weather, cold or hot, drives parts failure and accelerated maintenance. Regarding this quarter's traffic versus ticket growth, in retail, our traffic was down roughly 7%, while our ticket was up about 8%. Our transaction count decline wasn't surprising and was driven by lower demand for discretionary sales floor items. However, we were pleased to be in line with last quarter's three-year transaction trends. We are also quite pleased with the ongoing growth in unit share we are seeing in our market share data. We're also very encouraged by the sales trends we continue to experience in commercial. Our sales growth is coming from transaction growth from new and existing customers, along with higher tickets as we price for inflation. I regularly visit our stores and commercial customers and find it very encouraging to hear the positive comments from our customers and AutoZoners on our offerings. The reception our AutoZoners are receiving from our customers and as importantly, our prospective customers has changed meaningfully over the last few years as we continue to implement and execute our commercial acceleration strategy. I'll say it now, but we're determined, determined to continue to grow meaningfully faster than the market, and we're focused on future growth opportunities to keep our momentum. Our goal stated simply, overtime is to become the industry leader in both sectors. As we start our new fiscal year, we continue to be pleased with the momentum we are seeing in both domestic businesses heading into the fall months. During the quarter, there were some geographic regions that did better than others as there always are. This quarter, we saw a 30 basis point difference between the Northeast and Midwest compared to the balance of the country with the Northeast and Midwest being higher. As the Northeast and Midwest were warmer in May and June, their sales accelerated. However, this trend reversed itself over the last eight weeks of the quarter. As the remainder of the country heated up, those regions grew their comp sales faster than the Northeast and Midwest markets. Heading into the first quarter of the new fiscal year, we continue to believe weather will have only a minimal impact on our sales. Now let's move into more specifics on performance for the quarter. While I said our same-store sales were up 6.2% versus last year's fourth quarter, our net income was $810 million and our EPS was $40.51 a share, increasing 13.4%. Regarding our merchandise categories in the retail business, our hot parts outperformed sales floor categories with approximately a 2.5% difference between them. As gas prices increased, our discretionary sales for merchandise categories certainly softened. The discretionary categories represent approximately 20% of our DIY sales in any one quarter. But this quarter, they were weaker at 19% of the retail mix. This category was down 6.5% in the quarter versus up 3.5% last year in Q4. More recently, as gas prices have abated, we are encouraged to see the discretionary categories bounce back a bit. In general, the categories that are driven by failure due to heat performed well, and we were encouraged to see our battery category successfully lapped very strong performance last year and exceed our expectations. We believe our hard parts business will continue to do well this fall as we expect miles driven to improve while our growth initiatives are delivering solid results. Let me also address inflation and pricing. This quarter, we saw our sales increase by 11% from inflation, in line with cost of goods, which was up about 10%. We believe both numbers for the first quarter will be similar. As rising raw material pricing, labor and transportation costs are all impacting us and our suppliers, inflation has been prevalent in the aftermarket space. We believe inflation is stabilizing. We are seeing transportation costs begin to moderate after reaching historic levels, but we are not seeing product cost deflation yet nor are we seeing any signs that labor wage growth is slowing. Importantly, I want to point out that our industry has been disciplined about pricing for decades, and we expect that to continue. Historically, as costs have increased, the industry has increased pricing commensurately to maintain margins. It is also notable that following periods of higher inflation, our industry has historically not reduced pricing to reflect lower cost. While we continue to be encouraged with the current sales environment, it remains difficult for us to forecast near to midterm sales. What I previously said is that the past five quarter sales have all been consistent on both a two- and three-year stacked comp basis. While it's difficult to predict sales going forward, we are excited about our growth initiatives, our team's execution and the tremendous share gains we've achieved in both sectors. Over the past 12 to 18 months, the overall macro environment has been favorable for our industry despite inflationary pressures for some of our customers. And even if these near-term trends fade, we believe that we are in an industry that is positioned for solid growth over the long term. For our first quarter of 2023, we expect our sales performance to be led by the continued strength in our commercial business as we execute on our differentiating initiatives. We will, as always, be transparent about what we are seeing and provide color on our markets and outlook as trends emerge. Before handing the call over to Jamere, I'd like to highlight and give some color on a few of our key business priorities for the new fiscal year. First, we are focusing on our supply chain with two initiatives that are in flight to drive improved availability. One is our expanded hub and mega-hub rollouts. We know intelligently placing more inventory in local markets will lead to our ability to continue to say yes to our customers more frequently and in turn, drive our sales. Secondly, we are expanding our distribution center footprint. We announced the development of two new distribution centers domestically and one additional DC in Mexico. These DCs will allow us to not only reduce drive times to stores, but they increase our capacity. We didn't expect to grow our business 30% in three years as we did, and that will allow us to carry inventory that is slower turning yet in demand across the country. I'm also excited to announce that we opened a new facility on the West Coast just this month to handle direct import product on a timelier basis. This facility will flow products ordered abroad and distribute them to our other DCs postponing the inventory allocation and therefore, reducing safety stock. Our supply chain strategy is focused on carrying more product closer and closer to the customer, and we believe it has been a significant contributor to our recent success, especially in commercial. Additionally, we plan on continuing to grow our Mexico and Brazilian businesses and almost 800 stores open internationally, these businesses had impressive performance this past fiscal year and should continue to grow in 2023 and beyond. We are leveraging many of the learnings we have in the U.S. to refine our offerings in Mexico and Brazil. Now, I'll turn the call over to Jamere Jackson. Jamere? Jamere Jackson : Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As Bill mentioned, we had a strong fourth quarter, stacked on top of a remarkable fourth quarter last year with 6.2% domestic comp growth, a 5.7% increase in EBIT and a 13.4% increase in EPS. Our results for the entire fiscal year were incredibly strong as our growth initiatives continue to deliver great results and the efforts of our AutoZoners in our stores and distribution centers have continued to enable us to take advantage of robust market conditions. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to elaborate on the specifics in our P&L for Q4. For the quarter, total sales were just over $5.3 billion, up 8.9%. For the year, our total sales were $16.3 billion, up 11.1% versus last fiscal year. I continue to marvel at the strength of our business since FY '19. Our sales are up an amazing 37% or nearly $4.4 billion since 2019. Let me give a little more color on sales and our growth initiatives, starting with our commercial business. For the fourth quarter, our domestic DIFM sales increased 22% to $1.4 billion and were up 43.2% on a two-year stack basis. Sales to our domestic DIFM customers represented 27% of our total company sales and 30% of our domestic auto part sales. Our weekly sales per program were $17,000, up 18.1% as we exceeded our internal expectations. Our growth was broad-based as both national and local accounts performed very well for the quarter. Our results for the quarter set another record for the highest weekly sales volume for any quarter in the history of the chain. I want to reiterate that our execution on our commercial acceleration initiatives is delivering better-than-expected results as we grow share by winning new business and increasing our share of wallet with existing customers. We have a commercial program in approximately 87% of our domestic stores, which leverages our DIY infrastructure and we're building our business with national, regional and local accounts. This quarter, we opened 66 net new programs finishing with 5,342 total programs. As I've said since the outset of the year, commercial growth led the way in FY '22 and our results in the fourth quarter and year reflected this dynamic. For FY '22, our commercial sales were $4.2 billion, up 26.5% versus last year. Importantly, we believe we have a lot of runway in front of us, and we're delivering on our goal of becoming a faster-growing business. We remain confident in our strategies and execution and believe we will continue gaining share, delivering quality parts, particularly with our Duralast brand, improved assortments, competitive pricing and providing an exceptional service has enabled us to deliver double-digit sales growth for the past eight quarters. Our core initiatives are accelerating our growth and position us well in the marketplace. And as I've noted on past calls, our mega-hub strategy is driving strong performance and positioning us for an even brighter future in our commercial and retail businesses. Let me add a little more color on our progress. As we've discussed over the last several quarters, our mega-hub strategy has given us tremendous momentum. We now have 78 mega-hub locations with 11 new stores opened in Q4. While I mentioned a moment ago, the commercial weekly sales per program average was $17,000 per program, the 78 mega-hubs averaged significantly higher sales and are growing much faster than the balance of the commercial front. In fact, our commercial mega-hub business grew at twice the rate of our overall commercial business in Q4. As a reminder, our mega-hubs typically carry over 100,000 SKUs and drive tremendous sales lift inside the store box as well as serve as an expanded assortment source for other stores. The expansion of coverage and parts availability continues to deliver a meaningful sales lift to both our commercial and DIY business. What we're learning is that not only are these assets performing well individually, but the fulfillment capability for the surrounding AutoZone stores gives our customers access to thousands of additional parts and lift the entire network. This strategy is working. We have an objective to reach 200 mega hubs supplemented by our objective of a total of 300 regular hubs. We're targeting up to 25 new mega-hubs in FY '23. By leveraging sophisticated analytics, we're expanding our market reach, driving closer proximity to our customers and improving our product availability and delivery times. Our AutoZoners and our customers are excited, and we're determined to build on our strong momentum. On the retail side of our business, our domestic retail business comp was up 1.1% in Q4. The business has been remarkably resilient as we have managed to continue to deliver positive comp growth despite underlying market headwinds. As Bill mentioned, we saw traffic down 7% from last year's traffic levels. However, we also saw 8% ticket growth as we continue to raise prices in an inflationary environment. For FY '22, our DIY comp grew 2.9% and 14.1% on a two-year stack basis. Our DIY business has continued to strengthen competitively behind our growth initiatives. In addition, on a macro basis, the market is experiencing a growing and aging car park and a challenging new and used car sales market for our customers, which continue to provide a tailwind for our business. These dynamics, pricing, growth initiatives and macro part tailwinds have driven a positive comp despite tough comparisons from last year's stimulus injections and consumer discretionary spending pressure from overall inflation in the economy. Our sales were steady throughout the quarter, and we're forecasting a resilient DIY business in FY '23. Now, I'll say a few words regarding our international business. We continue to be pleased with the progress we're making in Mexico and Brazil. During the quarter, we opened 30 new stores in Mexico to finish with 703 stores and 14 new stores in Brazil, ending with 72. On a constant currency basis, we saw accelerated sales growth in both countries, in fact, at higher growth rates than we saw overall. We remain committed to our store opening schedules in both markets and expect both countries to be significant contributors to sales and earnings growth in the future. With 11% of our total store base now outside the U.S. and our commitment to continue expansion in a disciplined way, international growth will be an attractive and meaningful contributor to AutoZone's future growth. Now let me spend a few minutes on the rest of the P&L and gross margins. For the quarter, our gross margin was down 73 basis points, driven primarily by the accelerated growth in our commercial business and a 28 basis points headwind stemming from a non-cash $15 million LIFO charge. I'd like to address the $50 million LIFO charge we took this past quarter, which came from the exhaustion of our reserve balance that occurred during the quarter. The level set, we went from a $335 million reserve balance in Q4 of last year to zero in Q4 this year, plus an additional $15 million charge. Said differently, we recognized $350 million in higher costs this past year. Basically, all the reduction in our reserves came from higher inventoriable freight costs. This charge does not show up in our cash flow statement this quarter because the accounting for LIFO will adjust the weighted average cost through the P&L to the last in higher-priced items. In a nutshell, it assumes everything you sold in the quarter was at the last and higher prices. We're still modeling for higher freight costs through the end of the calendar year, which in turn means we are modeling LIFO charges through the first half of the new fiscal year. In the first quarter, we anticipate up to $100 million in LIFO charges, and we're forecasting a similar amount for the second quarter. I will note that if freight costs abate as we expect them to, then we'll see these charges reverse and we'll begin to rebuild a LIFO reserve balance. Moving to operating expenses. Our expenses were up 8.4% versus last year's Q4 as SG&A as a percentage of sales leveraged 12 basis points driven by strong sales growth. The growth in SG&A has been purposeful as we continue to invest in an accelerated pace in IT and payroll to underpin our growth initiatives. These investments will pay dividends and customer experience, speed and productivity. We're committed to being disciplined on SG&A as we move forward, and we will manage expenses in line with sales growth over time. Moving to the rest of the P&L. EBIT for the quarter was $1.1 billion, up 5.7% versus the prior year's quarter driven by our strong sales growth. FY '22, EBIT was just under $3.3 billion, up 11.1% versus the prior year, also driven by strong top line growth. Interest expense for the quarter was $64 million, up 10.1% from Q4 a year ago as our debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $6.1 billion versus $5.3 billion at Q4 end last year. We're planning interest in the $55 million range for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 versus $43.3 million in this past year's first quarter. Higher debt levels and borrowing rates across the curve are driving this increase. For the quarter, our tax rate was 22.1% and flat with last year's fourth quarter. This quarter's rate benefited 70 basis points from stock options exercised, while last year, it benefited 215 basis points. For the first quarter of FY 2023, we suggest investors model us at approximately 23.5% before any assumption on credits due to stock option exercises. Moving to net income and EPS. Net income for the quarter was $810 million, up 3.1% versus last year's fourth quarter. Our diluted share count of $20 million was 9.1% lower than last year's fourth quarter. The combination of higher net income and lower share count drove earnings per share for the quarter to $40.51, up 13.4% over the prior year's fourth quarter. For FY '22, net income was $2.4 billion, up 11.9% and earnings per share was $117.19, up 23.1%. Now let me talk about our free cash flow for Q4. For the fourth quarter, we generated $1.2 billion of operating cash flow, spent $300 million in capital expenditures, allowing us to generate $900 million of free cash flow. For the year, we generated $2.5 million in free cash versus $2.9 million in the prior year. The decline in free cash flow versus last year was due to a change in working capital this year versus last year. We expect to continue being an incredibly strong free cash flow generator going forward, and we remain committed to returning meaningful amounts of cash to our shareholders. Regarding our balance sheet, our liquidity position remains very strong and our leverage ratios remain below our historic norms. Our inventory per store was up 18.4% versus Q4 last year and total inventory increased 21.5% over the same period last year, driven primarily by our growth initiatives and inflation. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable on a per store basis, was a negative $240,000 versus negative $203,000 last year and negative $216,000 last quarter. As a result, accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 129.5% versus last year's Q4 of 129.6%. Lastly, I'll spend a moment on capital allocation and our share repurchase program. We repurchased $1 billion of AutoZone stock in the quarter. And at quarter end, we had just under $1.1 billion remaining under our share buyback authorization. The strong earnings, balance sheet and powerful free cash we generated this year has allowed us to buy back over 10% of the shares outstanding since the beginning of the year. We have bought back over 90% of the shares outstanding of our stock since our buyback inception in 1998, while investing in our existing assets and growing our business. We remain committed to this disciplined capital allocation approach that will enable us to invest in the business and return meaningful amounts of cash to shareholders. Our leverage metric finished Q4 at 2.1x EBITDAR, which is below our historical objective of 2.5x EBITDAR. However, we remain committed to this objective, and we expect to return to the 2.5x target during FY '23. So to wrap up, we remain committed to driving long-term shareholder value by investing in our growth initiatives, driving robust earnings and cash and returning excess cash to our shareholders. Our strategy continues to work. We're growing our market share and improving our competitive position in a disciplined way. And as we look forward to FY '23, we're bullish on our growth prospects behind a resilient DIY business and a fast-growing commercial business that is continuing to grow share. I continue to have tremendous confidence in our ability to drive significant and ongoing value for our shareholders. And with that, I'll turn it back to Bill. Bill Rhodes : Thank you, Jamere. As we start a new fiscal year, I'd like to take a moment to discuss our operating theme for the new year. Last night, we kicked off our National Sales meeting with our amazing President's Club winners, our very best store managers. This week, we will embrace our theme for the year, Accelerate Together. We are very excited to have our field leadership team in Memphis for the next four days and I cannot wait to congratulate everyone on their year and thank them for their phenomenal results. They delivered exceptional results in fiscal '22, and we remain focused on superior execution and customer service heading into fiscal '23. Our culture was built on providing exceptional service and this is what will continue to define our success well into the future. As we've accelerated our top line, our competitive positioning has materially improved and customer behavior may have permanently changed post-pandemic. If this holds true, it will be the fourth time in the last 30 years that the economy and society have had significant shocks leading to material acceleration in our growth in sales and profits without a corresponding decline back to pre-recessionary or pandemic levels. Our industry is unique, and it is a very long track record of strong performance with high returns and consistent cash flows. We would also encourage you to migrate to studying our performance on a one-year comp to gauge our performance as we believe the business is steady enough to talk about year-over-year comps going forward. This time of year, I always enjoy reflecting on the past. This year, in particular, is a rewarding experience. Our team delivered some really impressive milestones, $16.3 billion in sales racing past the $15 billion milestone. DIY comps of 2.9%, most impressively, 21.6% on a three-year basis. Commercial sales blew past $4 billion, ending at $4.23 billion. Average weekly sales domestically of $46,300 per store per week equating to over $2.4 million per store annually. Our Mexico and ALLDATA teams both broke numerous records, and Brazil is poised for significant growth in store count. We bought back a record-breaking $4.4 billion in AutoZone stock, and our team has grown our EBIT by roughly 50% in three years. Yes, that's five-zero, and that is remarkable. But we can't rest on our laurels, and we aren't without our challenges. That's for sure. Our greatest challenge, which we will spend time discussing this week with the team, is \"exiting pandemic mode.\" In addition to our fanatical customer focus and our phenomenal culture, a huge part of our historical success has been flawless execution. In all Candor, we haven't been flawlessly executing. In the depths of the pandemic, it was impossible and our teams appropriately made trade-offs. We have ensured that some of those trade-offs do not result in \"new norms or worse, numbness or bad habits.\" Those new norms can't and won't be tolerated. We have to make sure our in-stock levels finally recover to our historic levels and they recover soon. Our vendors must return to providing us with the right amount of merchandise at the right time. Every store has to be staffed right every hour of every day. Our processes need to function correctly always. We have to meet our store opening goals and time lines. Simply put, we have to remain the execution machine we have always been an exit pandemic mode. I've had the honor of being part of this team for nearly 28 years now, and it has been one of the great privileges of my life. I could not be more proud of our AutoZoners across the organization for their commitment to passionately serving our customers. We must continuously challenge ourselves during these extraordinary times to position our company for even greater future success and rest assured, we are doing just that. We know that investors will ultimately measure us by what our future cash flows look like three to five years from now, and we very much welcome that challenge. I continue to be bullish on our industry and, in particular, on our team at AutoZone. Now, we'd like to open up the call for questions. Operator : Thank you, Bill. Ladies and gentlemen, the floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from Bret Jordan of Jefferies. Bret, please ask your question. Bret Jordan : On the supply chain comment, could you maybe give us an update where we are as far as fill rates go and the cadence of improvement? It does seem to some commercial customers finding parts is still a bit of a challenge. Bill Rhodes : Thank you, Bret. It's still quite challenging. And it's moved. I've talked about it over time. It moves from one category to another one. Most of our hard part categories, we're in pretty good shape on. We have some challenges in areas like filtration. But generally, we're in pretty good shape, but we are still a couple of points behind our overall in-stock rate that we had before the pandemic. It's been very stubborn, frankly. We're looking to push through it. But every time we think we've got it solved in other category rears its ugly head. Bret Jordan : And then in the prepared remarks, you mentioned price right and obviously, a big topic this year. Are you seeing anything in the market pricing, whether it be in the DIY against the non-traditionals? Is anything changing in pricing cadence? Jamere Jackson : No, we're not seeing anything changed in terms of pricing cadence. We've been very disciplined about the pricing that we put in the marketplace. Again, we've been pricing to recover inflation and been doing that pretty consistently. And as I've said before, our industry has been very disciplined over time as it relates to this, and we're not seeing anything that throws us out of whack there. Operator : Thank you very much. Your next question is coming from Steven Zaccone of Citi. Steven, please ask your question. Steven Zaccone : So our question was on the DIY side of the business. You cited resilient expectations for this year and thinking about the business on a one-year basis. Do you see the potential to comp positive again in fiscal '23? And within that context, you cited some weakness on the discretionary side. How do you expect that to perform over the balance of the year now that gas prices have come down a bit? Bill Rhodes : Sure. Well, first, on the latter part of the question, we addressed it a little bit in our prepared remarks that when gas prices were $5.50 a gallon on average across the country, we saw an immediate reduction in our discretionary products. As those gas prices have come back down, we've seen discretionary products improve. You have to be careful because it's such a small part of our business, but we've certainly seen it improve. As for whether or not we can see positive comps in DIY for FY '23, as you know, we don't give guidance. There's a lot of uncertainty in the marketplace with inflation, with rising interest rates and the like. But I will tell you -- I'll answer it this way. This latter part of the fourth quarter was much stronger than we were expecting it to be in June and July. And so that gives us some confidence that at least for now, the DIY business is really quite strong. And frankly, as strong if not stronger than we thought it would be back in the early months of the summer. Steven Zaccone : The follow-up I had was just thinking about the commercial business from a higher level. You said you've grown past the $4 billion sales target that you had. How should we think about the multiyear path for that business? And I guess, what are the strategies you're focused on for the next chapter of growth? Bill Rhodes : I think the strategies that we're focused on for the next chapter of growth are the same ones that we've been working on for about five years. We're going to continue to make sure that we've got the best coverage in the marketplace. That considers being in the best situation in the local store. It also means expansion of hubs and mega-hubs. We've talked about growing our mega-hubs from today's 78 to 200. So, we're just over -- just under 40% of the way there, and we're moving pretty quickly. Same kind of trajectory on the hub stores, we're around 200. We want to get to 300 of those. So we have lots of growth still in front of us on hubs and mega-hubs, and we're continuing to test new philosophies and new coverage even in those. We're going to continue to focus on the Duralast brand. We're leveraging technology to make our people more efficient and to reduce our delivery times. We're always making sure that we're priced strike. We've got a lot of different strategies, and that's the thing to me that's most encouraging is it's not one single thing that's making this happen. It's a holistic substantial improvement in our competitive positioning in the marketplace. At the end of the day, we got around 4% share in commercial. I said on the call today, the first time we've ever said it. We want to win and be the largest in both sectors. And it's going to take us a while, but that's our goal. And I'm very pleased with the progress that we've had with 20% growth over six consecutive quarters, that's pretty phenomenal regardless of how the industry is growing. Operator : Your next question is coming from Simeon Gutman of Morgan Stanley. Simeon, please ask your question. Simeon Gutman : I'll be the LIFO person for the call. So the LIFO charges because of freight, non-cash. If you look out 12 to 18 months, do you get back all the charges to earnings either freight subsides or you take credits? Or you actually just raise price when over time to recoup this? Jamere Jackson : Yes, Simeon. So what we're modeling right now, as we said, is up to $100 million in the first quarter due primarily to higher freight. We are starting to see freight moderate some in the spot markets. However, what I'll remind you is that when we were in this environment of trying to make sure that we had capacity, we were incurring higher freight charges just so that we could secure capacity. So as those short-term contracted capacity dynamics happen from freight start to roll off, we'll start to see the benefits of what we're starting to see in the marketplace, which is a moderating freight market. You could see this in the back half get better, barring any disruptions. But right now, from a forecast standpoint, we're modeling somewhere in the neighborhood of close to $100 million in the first quarter and something similar in the second quarter. From a pricing standpoint, what we've said is that when there's hyperinflation on things like freight, where, for example, container costs went up 7x what we normally pay and then spike back down over time, you typically don't price to recover those kinds of spikes. What you do is you wait for the market to sort of moderate and your price accordingly to what you see the long-term impacts are going to be. So, we're continuing to price in a disciplined way. We're monitoring what's happening in the freight markets. It will come back. It's already starting to come back. And what you'll see is that we'll get credits coming back through the P&L to offset the charges that I've talked about for the first and the second quarter. And then as we get back to our normal market conditions, you'll see us rebuild that reserve balance over time. Simeon Gutman : I'll ask something different for the follow-up. If you look at the units in DIY, they're probably negative. So, can you talk about the stacks there whether it's stabilizing and thinking about reversion or even elasticity, does the DIY units, do they stay negative or they work back to flat through fiscal '23? Bill Rhodes : Simeon, you followed us for a lot of years, and you've heard me say many times that the dirty little secret of our industry is that there's downward pressure on units and have been for decades. So oftentimes, we'll be down 3% or 4% in units and customer count. A lot of that is driven by improvements in automobile technology. So easy example is spark bugs. He used to buy spark bugs and they were copper spark bugs and they would last for 30,000 miles. Now you buy Iridium spark bugs and they last 100,000 miles. Now the old copper spark bugs used to cost $0.59. Now Iridium's are oftentimes over $10. So, there's an upward pressure on cost or peaks -- price per piece and a downward pressure on units. I think our downward pressure in the fourth quarter was more exaggerated than it typically is, mainly because of the incredible performance that we've seen over the last three years. I think there's been some moderation. There was also a little bit of moderation as we said, because of the discretionary items, accessories and the like. Is that helpful? Simeon Gutman : Yes. That's helpful. Operator : Your next question is coming from Michael Lasser of UBS. Michael, please ask your question. Michael Lasser : Understanding that you don't provide guidance, but in light of the $100 million LIFO charge this quarter and next quarter, coupled with rising interest expense and what looks to be a slightly higher tax rate year-over-year, is it best that we assume this is going to be a sub algorithm year even if you comp in the traditional 3% to 4% range and buy back a similar amount of stock that you have been buying back? Jamere Jackson : From an operating standpoint, we will be spot on the algorithm that we've typically had. You do have some dynamics associated with LIFO this year where if you model in a couple of quarters of LIFO charges in the $100 million range, it will have a non-operating impact on our gross margins. So if you're thinking about modeling it that way, then certainly, that's potentially the case. But we'll come back to you. We'll be very transparent about what we're seeing. As we said, we're starting to see some moderation in the dynamics that are causing us to take a LIFO charge. As we get through the first and the second quarter, we could see some moderation there and that could change how you ultimately end up for the fiscal year. But what I want to make sure that people understand is that this certainly is an operational deficiency. It's simply non-cash LIFO accounting. And we're continuing to run the business in a very disciplined way, which means that as we've seen pricing impacts on our product costs, we're continuing to take pricing. We'll continue to drive our growth initiatives. We're going to be a very strong cash flow generator. And the most important part of the operating model in our mind is that cash is going to mean that we're going to invest in our business, and we're going to return a meaningful amount of that to shareholders this year. Bill Rhodes : Jamere, let me jump in and amplify a couple of points, too. First of all, I've been involved with this company since before we went public in 1991. This is the first time we've ever had a LIFO charge period. These are uncertain times or unique dynamics, especially with the level of inflation that we've seen in cargo freight going from $1,800 to over $20,000 per container. Those numbers have moderated significantly now, but we do have some long term -- or some midterm contracts, call them 6 to 12 months where we had to secure capacity. It is our full expectation -- and I don't know if it will happen this year or not. It's going to depend on freight costs. It is our full anticipation whatever charges we take in Q1 and Q2 ultimately will be reversed, and we will go back to zero and then we'll start building a LIFO reserve that we don't record. So, we think this $100 million to $200 million charge will be temporary, and it will reverse and it could be -- the back half of this year, could be next year, but that is fully our expectation. Michael Lasser : So just to clarify, your point being, yes, for maybe this year on a GAAP basis, your EPS algorithm might be a little bit lower than it's been historically, but that's just a GAAP reporting number, the cash flow characteristics of the business aren't changing. And so, if that's the correct interpretation, is it fair to assume that eventually the gross margin can get back to 52% or better over time as this accounting situation reverses and perhaps you start to see the benefits of deflation in your product cost while you keep your retails flat or growing? Bill Rhodes : Yes. I don't want to specifically say 52% gross margins is what the future is going to look like. As you've seen, there are pressures on gross margin as we continue to grow this commercial business at such an accelerated rate. That pressure is likely going to continue. But just like you said, the GAAP charge, let's just say, it was $200 million for the first half of the year. A year from now or 18 months from now, you're also going to have to think about when that $200 million comes back through the P&L. And so, we would encourage you to look at it, excluding the LIFO charges, both as it's a penalty for us now and when it's a benefit for us whenever that happens. Operator : Your next question is coming from Scott Catarelli from Truist Securities. Scott, please ask your question. Scot Ciccarelli : So, I guess I have another question on kind of the same SKU inflation outlook. I mean while you guys are still seeing double-digit same SKU inflation, year-over-year comparisons do start to become much more difficult over the next few quarters. So, how should we think about the comp cadence as those comparisons start to become difficult? Jamere Jackson : Well, from a comp cadence standpoint, a couple of things I'll point you to is, remember, the first two quarters of last year, we have well over 13% domestic comps. And those are toughest two quarters from a comp standpoint and then you start to see that comp sort of moderate in the back half of the year. And we encourage you for the full year to look at our comps on a year-over-year basis. And the things that we've talked about is, again, we have a resilient DIY business, albeit in a marketplace that has some volatility and some uncertainty associated with it. We've been very disciplined and our growth initiatives are delivered. And then probably the most important part of our story is the commercial story where we're continuing to see accelerated growth in commercial, driven by all the initiatives that Bill talked about and the fact that we're a four or five share in a large and growing market. So, that's how you should think about our comps. And again, the first half comps obviously are going to be a little bit tougher just given the fact that we printed over 13% in the first two quarters of last year. Scot Ciccarelli : And then just a quick follow-up here. Does the increase in interest rates and higher interest costs change your expectations at all for your debt-to-EBITDAR targets? Or maybe how aggressive you plan to be on your buyback program? Jamere Jackson : They don't. A couple of things I'll point you to. One is we've been at roughly a 2.1x metric. So, we have a lot of dry powder to get back to our 2.5x metric. We continue to stress that as we move through this period where our business has grown on an accelerated basis, and we have confidence in our growth prospects going forward. And we're going to move back closer to or at that 2.5x target. So that gives us a lot of financial firepower to, first of all, invest in our existing assets and grow our business, but also to give meaningful amounts back to our shareholders. So you'll see us continue to drive free cash flow and get our leverage metrics back to the 2.5x. And that means that we'll be able to do some exciting things for shareholders in the future. Operator : Your next question is coming from Kate McShane of Goldman Sachs. Kate, please ask your question. Kate McShane : We wondered within DIFM, if you're seeing similar demand trends from national accounts and independents? And also in DIFM, how is private label playing a role in this expanded business? Is it becoming a higher percentage of your mix? Bill Rhodes : Yes. Terrific questions, Kate. I'll take the last one first. Duralast continues to perform exceptionally well in the DIFM sector. We've rolled it into more categories. In the last few years, we've rolled it into shocks and struts. We've rolled out a Duralast Gold type performance chassis program, and we've rolled out Duralast elite brake pads. Each of these have been well received in both the retail and the commercial market, where 10 years ago, everybody would say, we couldn't be successful in commercial because of the Duralast brand. I think, the exact opposite is true. It has become a real strength for us. Remind me the first part of your question, sorry. Kate McShane : Just demand trends from national accounts and independents. Bill Rhodes : Yes, sorry. I think they're very, very similar. Both are doing very well. There's not a discernible difference between the two right now. Operator : Your next question is coming from Daniel Imbro of Stephens Inc. Daniel, please ask your question. Daniel Imbro : Bill, you discussed your new supply chain investment, I think it's on the West Coast for direct importing. Obviously, direct importing is tough especially with fill rates are so important. There's been some changes on your merchandising management internally. So can you just walk through the pros and cons, I mean, growing the direct import business, maybe how you manage that risk in the supply chain backdrop? Bill Rhodes : Yes. First of all, we've been -- thanks for the question. Terrific. We've been direct importing for years. We've got a strong team of people in China today and import from China and Taiwan and Vietnam and Turkey and India. We've got a very robust direct import program that will continue to grow, and it's been a very important part of us managing our product cost over long periods of time. What we're doing today is we're going to make it more efficient for us. So, we've opened in the beginning stages of opening a direct import facility in California. We also announced that we're going to be opening a new distribution center in New Kent, Virginia and attached to that new distribution center will also be a direct import facility. What this is going to allow us to do is continue to import, but instead of having to buy in quantities that are going to ship from China or Turkey or India by distribution center, we're going to flow them into this direct import facility and it allows us to do postponement on the allocation of the inventory by probably 45 days, which will make us be able to reduce our safety stock in a significant way and make us more efficient. I'm really excited about this new program. Daniel Imbro : And Jamere, I want to follow up on the SG&A side. I think Do-It-For-Me or commercial delivery costs are actually in that line. So can you talk about maybe on a store level basis, what the SG&A initiatives are that you're implementing, just impressed you're able to leverage that despite the growth in commercial? So trying to understand what's happening on the non-commercial delivery, kind of the core SG&A side of the business? Jamere Jackson : We've continued to run the playbook that we've always run inside the Company on SG&A, where we're very disciplined about cost. We tend to try to run our SG&A line to be somewhat close to what we're seeing from a sales standpoint. And so, there's a laundry list of tactics that we run every single year to make sure that we're delivering productivity from an SG&A standpoint. Every function is involved in that. So it isn't just the store functions that are a part of that. And those are the things that are, quite frankly, give us a lot of confidence that we're able to manage that line item in line with what we're seeing on the top line over time. Naturally, from a payroll standpoint, we continue to invest in the payroll line to deliver on the customer experience that our customers expect. And as the sales growth has been accelerated, we've tried to make sure that we put the hours in and the labor into our stores to be able to deliver on that promise and that experience, and it's been successful for us. And quite frankly, it's driving our top line growth. Operator : Your next question is coming from Greg Melich of Evercore. Greg, please ask your question. Greg Melich : Congrats on a great year and quarter, guys. The inflation number of 11% for this company in DIY, you said ticket was up eight. Is it fair to say that the difference between the 11 and the eight is all just items in the basket at DIY? Or is there some -- there's inflation that's less in retail Jamere Jackson : It's basket and mix that are driving the difference there. Greg Melich : Okay. So I should assume inflation is the same in DIY? Jamere Jackson : That's right. Greg Melich : And then the second question is, and maybe it ties a little bit into the margins in LIFO. Any thoughts in terms of how far AP inventory can go? Any changes in terms there? If you did, would that help you get some more of these products in certain categories? How should we think about the AP inventory ratio? Jamere Jackson : We have a strong program that are driving the AP to inventory numbers. The other thing I'll point to is that our turns are elevated relative to where we've been historically, 1.5x versus probably being somewhere in the 1.2x to 1.3x. And that's given us some goodness there in terms of the AP inventory ratio. It may move around a few points or so, but we're going to continue to be aggressive on the programs that we've put in place. Greg Melich : And my last one would be trade down. Is there any sign of that? You talked a lot about the strength in commercial in Duralast Gold and Elite, but if you look across the box, including DIY, are we seeing consumers starting to shift anywhere? Bill Rhodes : Yes, it's a great question, Greg. It's something that we have been studying really since probably May. We have seen it at times on the margin. But really -- I mean, we've really looked for it hard. We have not seen it in mass by any stretch of the imagination at this point in time. Operator : Okay. I'm going to hand back over to Bill now. We have finished the question-and-answer section. Bill, over to you. Bill Rhodes : Okay. Well, before we conclude the call, I just want to take a moment to reiterate that we believe our industry is in a strong position, and our business model we know is solid. We are excited about our growth prospects for the year, but we will take nothing for granted as we understand our customers have alternatives. We have exciting plans that should help us succeed for the future, but I want to stress again that it's a marathon and not a sprint. As we continue to focus on the basics and strive to optimize shareholder value for the future, we are confident AutoZone will continue to be very successful. Thank you for participating in today's call. Have a great day.",

Bill Rhodes : Good morning and thank you for joining us today for AutoZone\u2019s 2023 first quarter conference call. With me today are Jamere Jackson, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Text. Regarding the first quarter, I hope you have had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter\u2019s results. If not, the press release along with slides complementing our comments today is available on our website www.autozone.com under the Investor Relations link. Please click on quarterly earnings conference calls to see them. As we begin, we\u2019d like to thank and congratulate our AutoZoners across the enterprise for their commitment to taking care of our customers, which led to the strong results they continue to deliver. It has been a busy first quarter of our new fiscal year, as every day we strive to get back to normal and exit \u2018\u2018pandemic mode\u2019\u2019. This quarter, we opened our new direct import distribution center on the West Coast, continued to improve our in-stock position, and we had our first full national sales meeting since the pandemic began. In fact, we returned to having national sales meetings in every country where we operate and at ALLDATA. These meetings, they are critical to our success, where we celebrate our past accomplishments and lay the groundwork for our future success. Most importantly, they allow us to inspire each other and grow and nurture our unique and powerful culture. For the quarter, as our teams delivered exceptional service, their efforts led to our overall sales growing 8.6% on top of 16.3% last year. Our two-year growth rate marks some of the highest ever. We could not have achieved this success without phenomenal contributions from across the organization. Our AutoZoners\u2019 efforts generated a positive and accelerating retail same-store sales comp along with another strong commercial comp for the quarter. Thank you, AutoZoners, for always putting customers first which led to this success. This morning, we will review our Q1 same-store sales, DIY versus the DIFM trends, our sales cadence over the 12-week quarter, merchandise categories that drove our performance and any regional discrepancies. We\u2019ll also share how inflation is affecting our costs and our retails and how we think inflation will impact our business for the remainder of FY \u201823. Our domestic same-store sales comp was a solid 5.6% this quarter, on top of last year\u2019s 13.6%. On a two-year basis, we delivered a 19.2% comp, and on a three-year basis, a 31.5% stacked comp. Our team once again delivered amazing results, despite these difficult comparisons. Let me spend a few moments on growth dynamics in the quarter. Our growth rates for retail and commercial were both strong with domestic commercial growth of 15%. We set a first quarter commercial sales record and over $1 billion in sales, another impressive quarter as we generated $138 million more in sales than in Q1 last year. On a trailing four quarter basis, we delivered just under $4.4 billion in annual commercial sales, up an amazing $820 million over last year. We also set a Q1 record for average weekly sales per store at $16,000 versus 14,400 just last year. Domestic commercial sales represented 29% of our domestic auto parts sales versus 27% last year. Our sales growth in the quarter was driven by transaction growth from new and existing customers along with higher tickets as we price for inflation. Our commercial growth of 15%, while still very impressive, and well ahead of industry growth did slow. And unfortunately, we broke our streak of six straight quarters of 20% plus sales growth. While we could easily explain this resulted from a difficult comparison to last year\u2019s Q1 amazing growth of 29.4%, we also saw our transaction counts decline nearly 4 points from the pace we were growing in Q4 of fiscal \u201822. That said, we continue to be pleased with the results from the key initiatives we have been working on for the last several years. Improved satellite store availability, hub and mega hub openings and improvements in coverage, the strength of the Duralast brand, better technology to make us easier to do business with reduced delivery times, enhancing our sales force effectiveness and living consistent with our pledge by being priced right for the value proposition we deliver. We believe our offering to our customers is better than ever, and we continue to hear great things from our customers and prospective customers about the strength of our value proposition as we continue to execute our commercial acceleration strategy. Our goal remains, over time, to become the industry leader in both, DIY and commercial in every geography where we operate. Our strategy, execution and market momentum give us tremendous confidence as we move forward. We\u2019re also very proud of our organization\u2019s performance in domestic DIY. Our growth in retail since the beginning of the pandemic has been remarkable, representing the highest three-year growth we have experienced in my 28-year tenure with the Company. We delivered a positive 2.6% comp this quarter on top of last year\u2019s 9%. And versus last year\u2019s -- quarter\u2019s growth, DIY grew on a two-year basis and on a three-year basis. While our ticket growth was similar to last quarter, of just over 7%, we are encouraged that our transaction count trends improved, decreasing by 4%. These results are very strong considering the difficult comparison, driven by the lingering effects of stimulus last year. From the data we have available, we continue to retain the vast majority of the enormous dollar share gains we built during the initial stages of the pandemic. And more importantly, we continue to grow unit share, a critical measurement of success for us. And our recent performance gives us continued conviction about the sustainability for our fiscal year. In terms of sales cadence, our total same-store sales trends were very consistent, increasing in the mid-single-digit range for each of the four-week periods. In addition, for Q1, our two-year comp was 19.2% and our three-year comp was 31.5% and relatively consistent over the four-week periods. We are incredibly pleased with the sustainability of the very large sales and share gains we generated since the beginning of the pandemic. Weather did not have a material impact on our sales this quarter. On a national basis, weather trends were very similar to last year. Regionally, we saw less rainfall in the West and Southeast than last year. But overall, we didn\u2019t feel this drove our results materially. This winter\u2019s weather forecast calls for a slightly colder winter with, as we\u2019ve recently experienced, cooler weather beginning sooner. As a reminder, historically, extreme weather, cold or hot drives parts failures and accelerated maintenance. During the quarter, there was geographic regions that did better than others as there always are. This quarter, we saw comp sales in the Northeastern and Midwestern markets underperform the balance of the country by about 260 basis points. We believe that our underperformance in these markets was driven by milder and wetter weather this year. Four our second quarter, winter weather is likely to meaningfully influence our results. As a reminder, our Q2 is historically by far and away the most volatile sales quarter as weather patterns can greatly vary week-to-week. And we have key holidays that fall on different days of the week. At the moment, our forecasting team is telling us winter will likely be colder than last year\u2019s Q2. And if that happens, that would be a positive for our outlook. Now, let\u2019s move into more specifics on our performance. Same-store sales were up 5.6%, our net income was $539 million, and our EPS was $27.45 a share increase$0.45 a share, increasing 6.9%. Regarding our merchandise categories in the retail business, our hard parts outperformed sales floor categories, with approximately 1% difference between them. With elevated gas prices, our discretionary categories remain soft. The discretionary categories represented approximately 18% of our DIY sales and were down 2.5% versus up 8% last year. In general, the categories that are driven by failures performed well and we were encouraged to see our battery category successfully lap very strong performance last year and again exceed our expectations. We believe our hard parts business will continue to do well this winter as we expect miles driven to improve, while our growth initiatives are delivering solid results. Let me also address inflation and pricing. In Q1, we experienced 11% pricing inflation, in line with cost of goods, which was also up 11%. We believe both numbers will decrease slightly in the current quarter, as we begin to lap the onset of high inflation last year. But, to be clear, we do not believe inflation is going away, especially wage inflation, but expect it to slow a bit as the economy slows. I want to highlight that our industry has been disciplined about pricing for decades and we expect that to continue. Most of the parts and products we sell in this industry have low price elasticity, because purchases are driven by failure or routine maintenance. Historically, as costs have increased, the industry has increased pricing commensurately to maintain margin rates, thereby increasing margin dollars. It\u2019s also notable that following period\u2019s higher inflation, our industry has historically not meaningfully reduced pricing to reflect lower costs. While we continue to be encouraged with the current sales environment, it still remains challenging for us to forecast near to mid-term sales as the economy impacts our customers. What I previously said on the past six quarterly calls is sales have been consistent on both a two-year and three-year stack comp basis. While it\u2019s difficult to predict sales going forward, we are excited about our growth initiatives, our team\u2019s execution and the tremendous share gains we have achieved in both sectors. Over the past year and a half, the overall macro environment has been a favorable for our industry despite inflationary pressures for our customers. And even if these near-term trends fade, we believe that we are in an industry that is positioned for solid growth over the long term. For our second quarter of 2023, we expect our sales performance to be led by the continued strength in our commercial business, as we execute on our differentiating initiatives combined with the resilient DIY business. We will as always be transparent about what we are seeing and provide color on our markets and performance as trends emerge. Before handing the call over to Jamere, I\u2019d like to give a brief update on a few of our key business priorities for the new fiscal year. First, we continue focusing on our supply chain with two initiatives that are in flight to drive improved availability. One is our expanded hub and mega hub rollouts. We know intelligently placing more inventory in local markets will lead to our ability to continue to say yes to our customers more frequently and in turn drive sales. Secondly, we are expanding our distribution center footprint. We announced the development of two new domestic DCs and one additional DC in Mexico. These DCs will allow us to not only reduce drive times to stores, but also increase our capacity. Note that we didn\u2019t expect to grow our business 30%-plus in three years as we have, and the additional capacity will enable us to carry more slower turning inventory that is not yet in high demand. I\u2019m also excited to announce that we opened a facility on the West Coast to handle direct import product on a timelier basis. This facility will flow products ordered abroad and distribute them to our other DCs to reduce safety stock and drive productivity. Our supply chain strategy is focused on carrying more products closer to the customer. And we believe it has been a significant contributor to our recent success, especially in commercial. And we have initiatives in place to continue our growth trajectories in both, our domestic retail and commercial businesses. Additionally, we plan on continuing to grow our Mexico and Brazilian businesses. At almost 800 stores combined, these businesses have had impressive performance again this quarter and should continue to be key contributors to sales and profit growth for decades to come. We are leveraging many of the learnings we have in the U.S. to refine our offerings in Mexico and Brazil. In Brazil in particular, we are targeting to significantly and aggressively expand our store footprint over the next five years. We are very excited about our growth prospects internationally. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jamere Jackson. Jamere? Jamere Jackson : Thanks Bill. Good morning, everyone. As Bill mentioned, from a sales perspective, we had a strong first quarter stacked on top of an exceptionally strong first quarter last year with 5.6% domestic comp growth. We also had a 4.2% decrease in EBIT and a 6.9% increase in EPS. To start this morning, let me take a few minutes to elaborate on the specifics in our P&L for Q1. For the quarter, total sales were just under $4 billion, up 8.6%, reflecting continued strength in our industry and solid execution of our growth initiatives. Let me give a little more color on some of our growth initiatives, starting with our commercial business. For the first quarter, our domestic DIFM sales increased nearly 15% to $1 billion and were up 44.3% on a two-year stack basis. Sales to our domestic DIFM customers represented 29% of our domestic auto parts sales. Our weekly sales per program were $16,000, up 11.1%. And our growth was broad based as both national and local accounts performed well for the quarter. Our results for the quarter set a record for the highest first quarter weekly sales volume in the history of the chain. I want to reiterate that our execution on our commercial acceleration initiatives continues to deliver exceptionally strong results as we grow share by winning new business and increasing our share of wallet with existing customers. We have a commercial program and approximately 88% of our domestic stores, which leverages our DIY infrastructure. And we\u2019re building our business with national, regional and local accounts. This quarter, we opened 117 net new programs finishing with 5,459 total programs. As I have said previously, commercial growth will lead the way in FY23. And we continue to deliver on our goal of becoming a faster growing business. Our strategy and execution continue to drive share gains and position us well in the marketplace. Delivering quality parts, particularly with our Duralast brand, improved assortments and local market availability, competitive pricing and providing exceptional service has enabled us to drive double-digit sales growth for the past nine quarters. In addition, we are increasing the penetration of our market leading ALLDATA shop management, diagnostic and repair software suite to new and existing commercial customers, which gives us yet another key competitive advantage. And as I\u2019ve noted on past calls, our mega hub strategy is driving strong performance and position us for an even brighter future in our commercial and retail businesses. Let me add a little more color on our progress. As we\u2019ve discussed over the last several quarters, our mega hub strategy has given us tremendous momentum. We now have 80 mega hub locations with two new ones open in Q1. While I mentioned a moment ago, the commercial weekly sales per program average was $16,000, the 80 mega hubs averaged significantly higher sales and are growing much faster than the balance of the commercial footprint. As a reminder, our mega hubs typically carry 80,000 to 110,000 SKUs and drive tremendous sales lift inside the store box as well as surge as an expanded assortment source for other stores. The expansion of coverage and parts availability continues to deliver a meaningful sales lift to both, our commercial and DIY business. What we\u2019re learning is that not only are these assets performing well individually, but the fulfillment capability for the surrounding AutoZone stores gives our customers access to thousands of additional parts and list the entire network. This strategy is working. And we remain committed to our objective to reach 200 mega hubs supplemented by 300 regular hubs. We\u2019re targeting at least 25 new mega hubs in FY23. We continue to leverage sophisticated data analytics to expand our market reach, placing more parts closer to our customers, and improving our delivery times. We\u2019re determined to build on our strong momentum. Our domestic retail business count was 2.6% in Q1. The business has been remarkably resilient as growth rates accelerated from Q4 and we have managed to continue to deliver positive comp growth despite underlying market headwinds. As Bill mentioned, we saw traffic down 4% from last year\u2019s levels. However, they improved sequentially from Q4, where traffic was down 7%. We also saw 7% ticket growth as we continue to raise prices in an inflationary environment. Our DIY businesses continue to strengthen competitively behind our growth initiatives. In addition, on a macro basis, the market is experiencing a growing and ageing car part and is still challenging, new and used car sales market for our customers. These dynamics, pricing, growth initiatives and macro car part tailwinds have driven a positive comp despite tough comparisons from last year\u2019s stimulus injection, and consumer discretionary spending pressure from overall inflation in the economy. Our sales were steady through the quarter, and we\u2019re forecasting a resilient DIY business in FY23. Now, I\u2019ll say a few words regarding our international businesses. We continue to be pleased with the progress we\u2019re making in Mexico and Brazil. During the quarter, we opened three new stores in Mexico to finish with 706 stores and 4 new stores in Brazil ending with 76. On a constant currency basis, we saw accelerated sales growth in both countries, in fact at higher growth rates than we saw overall. We remain committed to our store opening schedules in both markets and expect both countries to be significant contributors to sales and earnings growth in the future. With 11% of our total store base currently outside the U.S. and a commitment to continue expansion in a disciplined way, international growth will be an attractive and meaningful contributor to AutoZone\u2019s future growth. As Bill mentioned earlier, we expect significant growth in store count internationally over the next five years. And we\u2019re excited about the future. In the spirit of our growth in store count outside of the U.S. we will celebrate our chain\u2019s 7,000th store opening this week in Leon, Mexico. I know Bill looks forward to being there to celebrate this historic event with our AutoZoners. We couldn\u2019t be more proud to celebrate this occasion with our Mexico team. Now, let me spend a few minutes on the rest of the P&L and gross margins. For the quarter, our gross margin was down 242 basis points, driven primarily by a 203 basis-point headwind, stemming from a noncash $81 million LIFO charge. The difference for the quarter, a decline of 39 basis points in gross margin was primarily driven by our faster-growing lower gross margin commercial business. With this quarter\u2019s LIFO charge, we have taken our LIFO credit balance to $96 million. As I mentioned last quarter, hyperinflation and freight costs are the primary driver for the charges. We are still modeling for higher freight costs through the end of the calendar year, and we anticipate approximately $40 million in LIFO charges during the second quarter. Both the first quarter actuals and our second quarter outlook are below the outlook we gave last quarter, as freight costs have continued to abate over the past few months. As spot rates have come down, we have also renegotiated some of our long-term contracts and the lower costs are reflected in our outlook. We expect freight costs to continue to abate, and I want to remind everyone that at some point we expect to see these quarterly charges reverse, and we will begin to rebuild our LIFO reserve balance. We plan to take P&L gains only to the extent of the charges we have taken thus far, and after we have taken P&L gains that fully reverse the charges we have incurred, we expect to rebuild our LIFO reserve balances we have done historically. Moving on to operating expenses. Our expenses were up 8.6% versus last year\u2019s Q1 as SG&A as a percentage of sales were flat with last year. Our operating expense growth has been purposeful, as we continue to invest at an accelerated pace in IT and payroll to underpin our growth initiatives. These investments are expected to pay dividends in customer experience, speed and productivity. We are committed to being disciplined on SG&A growth as we move forward, and we will manage expenses in line with sales growth over time. Moving to the rest of the P&L, EBIT for the quarter was $723 million, down 4.2% versus the prior year\u2019s quarter. Excluding the $81 million LIFO charge, EBIT would have been up 6.6% over last year\u2019s quarter. Interest expense for the quarter was $57.7 million, up 33.4% from Q1 a year ago as our debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $6.3 billion versus $5.3 billion at Q1 in last year, and our variable rates have increased significantly. We are planning interest in the $60 million range for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 versus $42.5 million in last year\u2019s second quarter. Higher debt levels and expected higher borrowing costs across the curve are driving this increase. For the quarter, our tax rate was 18.9% and below last year\u2019s first quarter rate of 21.9%. This quarter\u2019s rate benefited 446 basis points from stock options exercised, while last year benefited 159 basis points. For the second quarter of FY 2023, we suggest investors model us at approximately 23.4% before any assumption on credits due to stock option exercises. Moving to net income and EPS. Net income for the quarter was $539 million, down 2.9% versus last year\u2019s first quarter. Our diluted share count of 19.6 million was 9.1% lower than last year\u2019s first quarter. The combination of lower net income, offset by lower share count drove earnings per share for the quarter to $27.45, up 6.9% over the prior year\u2019s first quarter. Excluding the LIFO charge, our net income would have increased 8.3% and our EPS growth would have been 19.2%. Now, let me talk about our free cash flow for Q1. For the fourth quarter, we generated $794 million of operating cash flow, and spent $114 million in CapEx, allowing us to generate $680 million in free cash flow versus $676 million a year ago. We expect to continue being an incredibly strong cash flow generator going forward, and we remain committed to returning meaningful amounts of cash to our shareholders. Regarding our balance sheet, our liquidity position remains very strong and our leverage ratios remain below our historic norms. Our inventory per store was up 14.4% versus Q1 last year, and total inventory increased 17.6% over the same period last year, driven primarily by inflation, our growth initiatives and in-stock recoveries. Net inventory defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable on a per store basis was a negative $249,000 versus negative $207,000 last year, and negative $240,000 last quarter. As a result, accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 131% versus last year\u2019s Q1 of 129.4%. Lastly, I\u2019ll spend a moment on capital allocation and our share repurchase program. We repurchased $900 million of AutoZone stock in the quarter and at quarter end, we had just under $2.7 billion remaining under our share buyback authorization. The strong earnings, balance sheet and powerful free cash we generated this year has allowed us to buyback almost 2% of the shares outstanding at the start of the fiscal year. We have bought back well over 90% of the shares outstanding of our stock since our buyback inception in 1998, while investing in our existing assets and growing our business. We remain committed to this disciplined capital allocation approach that will enable us to invest in the business and return meaningful amounts of cash to shareholders. We finished Q1 at 2.2 times EBITDAR, which is below our historical objective of 2.5 times. However, we remain committed to this objective, and we expect to return to the 2.5 times target during FY \u201823. To wrap up, we remain committed to driving long-term shareholder value by investing in our growth initiatives, driving robust earnings and cash and returning excess cash to our shareholders. Our strategy continues to work. We\u2019re growing our market share and improving our competitive positioning in a disciplined way. And as we look forward to FY \u201823, we\u2019re bullish on our growth prospects behind a resilient DIY business and fast growing commercial and international businesses that are growing considerable share. I continue to have tremendous confidence in our industry, our business, and the opportunity to drive long-term shareholder value. Before I turn it back to Bill, on December 5th, we celebrated Bill\u2019s 28th year anniversary with the Company. And I want to say congratulations to you, Bill. And it\u2019s been a remarkable ride. Bill Rhodes : Thanks, Jamere. Fiscal 2023 is off to a solid start. But we must continue to be focused on superior customer service and flawless execution. Execution and our culture, a culture of always putting the customer first is what defines us. As Jamere said a moment ago, we continue to be bullish on our industry and in particular on our own opportunities for the New Year. Our team continues to work collaboratively with our suppliers. And together, we\u2019ve done a good job improving our in-stock position. But we still are a couple of hundred basis points below our historical norms. We\u2019re also being smart about adding new inventory coverage. We\u2019re meeting the ever-growing needs of our customers, especially our commercial customers, by being able to say, yes, we\u2019ve got it. It\u2019s a requirement. For the remainder of fiscal \u201823, we are launching some very exciting initiatives. Not only will we be opening roughly 200 stores across the U.S., Mexico and Brazil, but we\u2019ll be opening more mega hubs and hub stores. And we\u2019re focused on initiatives in place to continue driving strong performance in both, our retail and commercial businesses. For the remainder of fiscal 2023, we are keenly focused on relentless execution. We will not accept shortcuts. Our vendors must return to providing us the right amount of merchandise at the right time. Every store has to be staffed right, every hour of every day, and our processes need to function correctly, always. We have to meet our store opening goals and timelines. Simply put, we have to focus on exceptional execution. It has made a difference for us for decades. We know that investors will ultimately measure us by what our future cash flows look like three to five years from now, and we very much welcome that challenge. I continue to be bullish on our industry and in particular on AutoZone. Now, we\u2019d like to open up the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And the first question this morning is coming from Brian Nagel from Oppenheimer. Brian, your line is live. Please go ahead. Brian Nagel : Hi. Good morning. Nice quarter. So, the first question I have, just with respect to freight costs, and Jamere you talked about this in your comments, and you mentioned the LIFO issues. But I guess the question I have is as we think about your freight costs now and what you\u2019re seeing, where are you now tracking say, versus pre-pandemic? And then, even maybe putting some of the accounting noise aside, at what point could this become a tailwind to gross margins, as it really starts to work through the P&L? Jamere Jackson : Yes. Thanks, Brian. International freight rates are back at pre-pandemic levels. And one of the things that we discussed on last quarter\u2019s call was this notion that during the height of the pandemic to secure capacity, we entered into some longer-term contracts. We\u2019re now in a position where as the spot rates have come down, we\u2019ve renegotiated some of those contracts. We have a pretty bullish outlook on where international freight rates are going to be for the balance of the year. Domestically, rates are still a little bit high. And as we work our way through the year, we expect those to start to abate a little bit. But domestically, the rates are still a little bit higher than what we would have anticipated. As it relates to LIFO, as you saw in the second quarter, we have lowered our outlook to be about a $40 million charge. And you could see in the back half of the year that abating completely. I won\u2019t be date certain about when we\u2019ll see this flip to gains rolling back through the P&L. But as we said last quarter, it could take the equivalent of three or four quarters before it all rolls through. And we see the gains come back through the P&L that offset the charges that we\u2019ve taken. So, our outlook is positive, and we\u2019re managing the business accordingly. Bill Rhodes : Can I jump in and add a little color on one other element, not on LIFO, but on our normal product cost? Many of those freight costs are being capitalized as part of the inventory cost. So, we\u2019re going to have elevated product cost outside of LIFO for -- in a business that\u2019s turning 1.5 times a year for nine months or a year, whatever the case may be, once those freight costs abate. So, we\u2019ll continue to have pressure on product cost for foreseeable -- for an extended period of time. Brian Nagel : That\u2019s very helpful. I appreciate the color there. And then as a quick follow-up, with respect to traffic, and also going back to the comments you made, so it\u2019s -- I think what you said was that the traffic in the stores, while still down in Q1, had improved from Q4, any comments on maybe the trajectory through the quarter? And then how are you thinking about traffic as we move into -- continue to progress through \u201823 here? Bill Rhodes : Yes, Brian. So, when we\u2019re talking about traffic, we\u2019re predominantly talking about -- we are talking about our DIY business. I will be first to tell you that our DIY strength in Q1 was stronger than we expected, considerably stronger than we expected. And yes, our traffic counts are down 4%, but that was meaningfully better than -- I believe it was 8% in Q4. Remember -- and you\u2019ve been following this industry for a long time, there is a natural drag on DIY traffic counts that have been happening for 25-years. As you know, technology has gotten better and better on the products that we sell, and so they last longer. But there\u2019s also inherent inflation in those product costs as technologies are added to the products. So, a 4% traffic decline in the DIY business is not abnormal in normal times. And to see it down 4% after the growth that we\u2019ve seen over the last three years was very encouraging to us. Operator : Your next question is coming from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. Simeon Gutman : Good morning, everyone, and Bill, congratulations on the anniversary. My question is actually a follow-up to what you just mentioned, Bill. The traffic or I guess we will look at -- we try to call it units, I don\u2019t know if you would say that they\u2019re synonymous. It did look like it improved sequentially on a single-year basis. We don\u2019t see what the stacks have looked like, I think, on traffic or units. And curious if underlying stacks are also improving such that this is the rebasing and we are in the all clear in terms of units probably done reverting and the negative numbers are normalizing back to that negative 4% that you mentioned. Bill Rhodes : Well, that\u2019s a strong statement, Simeon, in the all clear. I think we still have a level of anxiety on what the next year or so is going to look like coming off of unprecedented growth over the last three years. If we were on this call last year, we had expectations that our sales -- our same-store sales would decline, and they didn\u2019t. They were up considerably, and they were positive in DIY. Here we are again, comping off a positive DIY number with another positive DIY number. So, I think the farther we get away from the pandemic and the more resiliency we see in the DIY business, the more confidence we have that the gains that we picked up during the pandemic are sustainable. That said, I wouldn\u2019t characterize it as \u201call clear\u201d. Jamere Jackson : Yes. The only thing I\u2019d add to that is when we look at our business in our bread and butter failure and maintenance categories, our volume trends have been strong, as Bill mentioned in his prepared comments. The relative inelasticity of demand there gives us a lot of confidence about that business. But in our discretionary categories, we were down 2.5%. And if you think about where consumers are feeling the most pressure today and where that pressure actually manifests itself, it manifests itself in discretionary purchases. And so, the fact that our discretionary business trends actually improved quarter-over-quarter, give us a lot of confidence about the future. That being said, there\u2019s still a lot of volatility and uncertainty, as Bill mentioned. We\u2019ll continue to manage our business accordingly. Simeon Gutman : And then my follow-up is on used car prices. The empirical evidence tied to the industry\u2019s growth isn\u2019t great, statistically speaking. But it certainly has been a benefit. And it still feels like the industry is benefiting from the surge that we\u2019ve seen. Are you finding there\u2019s sensitivity now on the way down? Do you feel like we\u2019re still benefiting from the surge? And then, if so, when does that tail off? And I don\u2019t know if it becomes a headwind or not in your minds? Jamere Jackson : Yes. I look at the macro in a pretty broad way. You\u2019ve got a couple of dynamics going. One, you have an ageing and growing car part. And used car prices, while they\u2019ve started to abate, they\u2019re still up almost 30% over the last two years. New car prices are up closer to 20%. And you\u2019re in an environment where you have rising interest rates that have made financing more challenging. So we do believe that it is still a little bit of a tailwind for our business. And more importantly, we\u2019ve been managing our business to take advantage of all of the robust market opportunities that we have, and this is just one portion of that. I think as we\u2019ve talked about our business and the growth that we\u2019re seeing, it\u2019s not just that macro strength, but inflation has been our friend to some extent, driving higher prices, volumes held up under those dynamics. And our growth initiatives have helped us create a faster-growing business in both DIY and DIFM. So, when you take the combination of what you\u2019re seeing from inflation, from our growth initiatives, from the work that we\u2019ve done with hubs and mega-hubs and this macro strength, those are all the things that are in the soup, if you will, in terms of how our business is growing. Operator : Your next question is coming from Kate McShane from Goldman Sachs. Kate McShane : You had mentioned at the beginning of the call about your improving in-stock position. I wondered if you could talk a little bit more about that and where you see yourself by the end of \u201823 from an in-stock position? And then, I\u2019ll follow up with my second question. Thank you. Bill Rhodes : Sure, Kate. Yes. Our in-stock position today is meaningfully better than it was at this time last year -- well, 18 months ago. It\u2019s up a little bit from this time last year. It\u2019s up a little bit from Q4, but we\u2019re still about 200 basis points below our historical expectations and experiences. When will it resolve? It still -- frankly, Kate, I would have thought it had been resolved by now. But there are certain product categories that are still a challenge, and we\u2019re looking to continue to find new sources in some of those categories and new geographies in some of those categories to help us get past it. But we feel pretty good about where we are. We feel very good about where we are competitively. Kate McShane : And is there an expectation that you\u2019ll want to do better than the 200 basis points where you are below those expectations? And in terms of how much your sourcing has changed, has it been meaningful since where you used to source pre-pandemic? Bill Rhodes : Yes. Our sourcing has not changed a significant amount at this point in time. We do have some objectives to diversify the geographies with which we source in basically every category. As far as having higher expectations for in-stock, right before the pandemic, we\u2019d reached an all-time high, which was 100 basis points ahead of where we were historically. So, our supply chain team -- need to remind them that we need to break our old high, which was 100 basis points higher. So, that would be about 300 basis points ahead of where we are right now. And I think they\u2019ll get there. It may take a little more time. Operator : Your next question is coming from Chris Horvers from JP Morgan. Chris Horvers : So, my first question is just to check the math, on the LIFO the headwinds being halved in the second quarter. So I guess, directionally, should we think about your gross margin headwind in the second quarter being roughly half of what you experienced in the first quarter? Jamere Jackson : Yes. I mean, we expect LIFO charge in the second quarter to be somewhere in the $40 millionish range, if you will. And so that will be significantly less pressure from a gross margin standpoint. Chris Horvers : Got it. And then, is -- as a follow-up to that and then a question on the SG&A side, I mean, is there -- other than the mix headwinds of Do-It-For-Me in gross margin, is there anything else to consider? And then on the SG&A side, SG&A dollar growth year-over-year has been running in this 8% to 10% range over the past four quarters. How much of that is wage and benefit cost inflation versus investing during the good times? And then going forward, how are you thinking about inflation and wages and SG&A in the context of your overall leverage point? Jamere Jackson : Yes. So, from an SG&A standpoint, I mean, we\u2019re going to continue to grow SG&A in a disciplined way as we create a faster-growing business. As I said, we were flat as a percentage of sales this past quarter. But we\u2019ve been investing, and we\u2019ve been investing to maintain high levels of customer service. And we\u2019ve been investing because many of our growth initiatives, both on the retail and the commercial side of our business, are underpinned by investments in IT. So IT investments, in particular, are an enabler to what we\u2019re doing from a growth standpoint. As you know, wage pressure is a macro labor market issue, and we certainly haven\u2019t been immune to those dynamics. Historically, our wages have run in the, call it, the 2% ZIP code. It\u2019s been running closer to 5%. And so that\u2019s put some pressure on us. But what I\u2019ll say about SG&A over time is that we will continue to manage it in line with the top line. We\u2019ve been opportunistic as our business has grown to invest at an accelerated pace in some areas to support the growth in our business and to maintain great levels of customer service, and we\u2019ll continue to be very-disciplined about it going forward. And I\u2019m sorry, what was the first part of your question again? Chris Horvers : Other than the mix of commercial versus DIY, is there any other variables that are different here in the second quarter in the context of that LIFO headwind being halved? Jamere Jackson : No. We\u2019ve said that our faster-growing commercial business is likely going to put 35 basis points to 45 basis points of pressure on our gross margins. You saw that in this quarter. And we continue to expect our commercial business to grow significantly faster than our DIY business. And those are the kinds of headwinds that you\u2019ll see from a margin standpoint as we move forward. Operator : Your next question is coming from Michael Lasser from UBS. Michael Lasser : Bill, your tax in the commercial business remains quite consistent, but it did slow on a one-year basis. Do you think that\u2019s more related to something happening out of AutoZone where the log diminishing returns are taking over such that you\u2019re still generating similar amount of incremental sales, but it\u2019s just on a larger base, or is there something happening in the underlying trend of the commercial segment itself? Bill Rhodes : It\u2019s a great question, Michael and one that, frankly, I\u2019m not sure that I can factually answer. I will start with 15% growth in our commercial business, we are all excited about that, especially coming off of the growth that we\u2019ve had in the last couple of years. So, we are pleased with the performance in our commercial business. It\u2019s widespread. The slowdown, the slight slowdown that we\u2019ve experienced is across the board. It\u2019s not national accounts. It\u2019s not up and down the street. It\u2019s not our ProVantage customers. We\u2019ve seen a general slowdown across different customer bases and across geographies. So, I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s anything that we\u2019ve done at AutoZone. I think it\u2019s -- we\u2019ve grown very fast, and we grew 15% on top of it, and we\u2019re pleased with that. Michael Lasser : And is this now a more realistic run rate? It will still grow double digits? Is it hard to maintain that 20% that you have been achieving? And my follow-up is one of your competitors recently announced that they\u2019re going to make some price investments. This comes on the heels of another competitor emulating what you had done and make price investments. At what point should we call this a trend, and increased price transparency is just leading to a little bit more price competition within the commercial segment of the auto part retail sector? Bill Rhodes : Yes, I\u2019ll leave it to you guys to define the trends that you want to do. What I can tell you is our pricing investments that we made about 18 months ago we had nothing to do with our close in competitors. They were focused on looking at our value proposition versus the 80% of the market that\u2019s outside of our close in competitors, and trying to make sure that we were priced right for the value proposition that we were delivering. We\u2019ve been very pleased with that and pleased with we\u2019re believing that our outside growth over the last couple of years has been driven not by taking share from our close in competitors by taking share from the broader market. And so I\u2019m not seeing anything by any indications based upon either of our close in competitors pricing that we see anything very different. Operator : Your next question is coming from Daniel Imbro from Stephens. Daniel Imbro : I wanted to start on the commercial side. Bill, in your prepared remarks, you talked more about some tech investments you\u2019re making to make it easier -- I think you said easier to do business with you guys. Could you provide more detail on what those initiatives are? And then where are we -- what inning are we in, in terms of the rollout of these different tech programs on the commercial side? Bill Rhodes : Sure, Daniel. Thank you. One of the things that we\u2019ve rolled out over the last couple of years is handheld devices for everybody that\u2019s in the store picking the products and everybody that\u2019s delivering to a commercial customer. And that helps us ensure that we have the exact right product, and it helps us manage delivery times, which we have brought our delivery times down about 20% since we deployed that technology. The other big part of it -- and there\u2019s a lot of different technology things that we\u2019re doing along the way. But the other big one that we\u2019ve done is really how we interact digitally with our commercial customers and -- from providing them access to invoices to making us more seamless to operate together, just trying to take the pressure points out and make a frictionless transaction with us. The handheld pieces have been deployed. We\u2019re continuing to refine the technology. And I suspect that those refinements will probably take up to another year or so. I think the digital integration is less far along. We have more newer ideas that we have yet to embark on, on the digital integration with our customers. And so, that\u2019s got to probably have two or three years of legs to it. Daniel Imbro : And then I want to follow up on Chris\u2019 question earlier on LIFO. So, Jamere, you provided a helpful color on 2Q. But I think in your prepared remarks, you said you expected to recognize some LIFO benefits in the back half of this year that would offset it. So if we just think about the $40 million you\u2019re now guiding for 2Q and a LIFO headwind, should we assume there\u2019s about $120 million of a LIFO benefit that\u2019s going to flow through the gross margin line in the back half of the year? And then, what would the cadence be that you\u2019d expect to recognize that $120 million benefit? Jamere Jackson : Yes. Well, there are lots of things that will impact when we actually see the reversal of the charges that we take. The biggest one, as we mentioned, is the pace with which freight comes down and we get out of some of the contracts that we\u2019re in. And as I said before, we won\u2019t be date certain about when that actually happens, but we do anticipate that happens. So, it\u2019s moving in the right direction for us. And given that our inventory turns at, call it, 1.5 times, you should expect it to take two or three quarters potentially for us to have all of those costs worked their way through and us to see it turn the other way. So, we\u2019ll give a more fulsome update on our next quarter call. And as I said before, we\u2019ll be very transparent about what we\u2019re seeing. Operator : Your next question is coming from David Bellinger from MKM Partners. David Bellinger : The first one on commercial. It seems like the transaction counts maybe have been a bit slower this quarter. So, is there anything to read into that? And what type of consumer or customer activity are you seeing? Is there some type of deferral coming into play? Just any other details around the commercial counts would be helpful? Bill Rhodes : Yes. We\u2019re doing a lot of studying on both our retail and commercial customers because if you think about it, this is a pretty unprecedented environment. I know I\u2019ve never seen inflation rates in the upper single digits and lower double digits. So, we\u2019re paying particular attention to what customer behaviors are happening. As a reminder -- and we certainly have more experience in the DIY business than we do in the commercial business, in the last economic shocks, the last four economic shocks in the U.S., our business has significantly outperformed normal periods of time. So, we\u2019re monitoring that to make sure we understand, particularly what\u2019s going on with the low-end consumer. And then, I think the expectation -- and we don\u2019t have near the evidence here at this point in time, but I believe that there\u2019s an expectation that some commercial customers or some jobs that a commercial customer would normally be done DIFM, can trade down into the DIY sector. And so, we\u2019re watching those kind of trends, but we don\u2019t see anything yet that is alarming to us. We continue to monitor it. And again, we\u2019re pretty darn pleased with the 15% growth in our commercial business. David Bellinger : Got it. And then, just on the commercial program growth, that seemed to step up a little in Q1. It was about 5% year-over-year. Can you give us an update on how those programs are maturing? Is it still something like three to five years for those units to gain some material traction, or are you now seeing an accelerated pace in ramp-up, just given all the progress in the commercial business and the mega hub strategy? Bill Rhodes : Sure. Well, we certainly stepped up openings in the first quarter. But remember, we\u2019re at about 88% of our stores have the commercial program today. There\u2019s no vision that we\u2019re going to be 100% or anywhere close to that. As you would imagine, the per store and per program economics of our commercial business over the last couple of years have changed pretty meaningfully. So, there are programs that now make sense to be open that two years ago, we might want to service them from another program. So, that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing. We may open another 100 or so, but I wouldn\u2019t expect for massive growth rates in commercial openings. And you\u2019re exactly right. It typically takes four or five years for those programs to mature. I think as we\u2019ve gotten stronger, they come out of the box higher than they did before. And we\u2019ll see what -- if the maturity lasts as long as it used to. The one place that is very different, they mature -- we don\u2019t know how long it takes for them to mature, but they come out of the gates much higher our mega hubs. It\u2019s amazing to see the volumes that we do almost day one coming out of a mega hub. David Bellinger : Thank, Bill. Enjoy the trip to Mexico. Bill Rhodes : All right. Thanks. I look forward to it. Operator : The next question is coming from Mike Baker at D.A. Davidson. Mike Baker : Okay. Thanks, guys. A couple of questions. The spread between the ticket growth and inflation widened a little bit. It\u2019s now -- I think it was 4 percentage points in retail versus 3 last quarter. Remind us, is that -- are you seeing -- is it fewer units per transaction? Is it a trade down to less expensive items? Just any color on what\u2019s going on there? Jamere Jackson : Yes. It\u2019s primarily basket mix that\u2019s impacting that. One of the things we\u2019ve been very disciplined about is moving retails, as we see cost and we\u2019ve been very transparent about what we\u2019re seeing there and been very disciplined about what we\u2019re doing. This is the entire industry. Mike Baker : So, when you say basket mix, does that mean people trading down to lower more entry-level price points or private label? Just what exactly do you mean by basket mix? Jamere Jackson : It could actually mean the types of products that are being purchased relative to what we saw in the previous period. Mike Baker : Okay. And do you see that as any kind of sign of the consumer being strapped, or is it just sort of a random situation? What would cause that, I guess? Jamere Jackson : Again, as we talked about the consumer, if you think about it from a macro standpoint, I mean, clearly, the consumer is feeling the pinch of inflation on multiple fronts. And quite frankly, inflation is going to erode consumer spending overall. But in our business, where we see the primary pressures in our discretionary categories and our bread and butter failure and maintenance categories, the demand has been there. And the actions that we\u2019ve taken from a pricing standpoint have not impacted volume in a meaningful way, so. The other thing I\u2019ll say about just the consumer in general is it\u2019s clearly a two-speed world. The middle and upper end consumers have stronger balance sheets, and they\u2019re continuing to spend in a meaningful way and the lower end consumer is pitched. So, what we\u2019re seeing from our business standpoint is quite frankly consumers, when they have an opportunity, as Bill mentioned, to potentially trade into DIY from DIFM for certain things, they will do that. And these are the kinds of things that we\u2019d expect consumers to do over time. But I wouldn\u2019t read anything into the fact that tickets are 1 point or 2 below what we\u2019ve seen historically, most of that again is mix related. Mike Baker : Well, if I could ask one more, how about the opposite now? Gas prices, believe it or not, are now lower than they were prior to the Russia-Ukraine situation and essentially flat year-over-year. Historically, can you remind us how much relief does that provide to your customers? And can that help offset some of those pressures that you just talked about? Bill Rhodes : For sure, Mike. No question about it. If you recall -- you followed us for a year. So, one thing that we said that really does matter to our customer is gas prices, and particularly when they get over $4 a gallon. We\u2019ve said that for the last 15 years, there just seems to be something special about that $4 a gallon. Obviously, we\u2019re below that level now. But there\u2019s a lot of puts and takes that are going on with the customer today. We\u2019ve never seen this kind of combination. You got near double-digit inflation. You\u2019ve got low-end wage inflation that\u2019s up 5%, 6% across the marketplace. You\u2019ve got gas prices that went up exponentially and then quickly came back down. So, we\u2019re spending a lot of time looking at different stratus of our customer bases, particularly on the DIY side. And while we see some people trading down into -- on the good, better, best spectrum, we\u2019re not seeing any significant moves at this point in time. But we\u2019re obviously paying a lot of attention to it because these are kind of unprecedented underlying factors that are going into it. Operator : And that is all the time we have for questions today. I would now like to turn the floor back to Mr. Bill Rhodes for closing remarks. Bill Rhodes : Great. Thank you. Before we conclude the call, I want to take a moment to reiterate, we believe our industry is strong, and our business model in particular is solid. We will take nothing for granted as we understand our customers have alternatives to shopping with us. We have exciting plans that should help us succeed for the future. But I want to stress again that this is a marathon and not a sprint. As we continue to focus on the basics and strive to optimize shareholder value for the future, we are confident AutoZone will continue to be very successful. I want to wish everyone a happy and healthy holiday season. And thank you for participating in today\u2019s call and for your interest in our company. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today\u2019s conference call. You may disconnect your phone lines at this time, and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.",

And thank you for joining us today for AutoZone\u2019s 2023 second quarter conference call. With me today are Jamere Jackson, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax. Regarding the first quarter, I hope you have had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter\u2019s results. If not, the press release, along with slides complementing our comments today, are available on our website www.autozone.com under the Investor Relations link. Please click on Quarterly Earnings Conference Calls to see them. As we begin, we would like to thank and congratulate our AutoZoners across the company for their commitment to delivering exceptional customer service. For the second quarter, our team delivered total sales growth of 9.5% versus 8.6% in the first quarter, in line with our expectations. We were pleased with this performance as we were up against 15.8% total sales growth in last year\u2019s second quarter. We could not have achieved these results without phenomenal contributions from across the organization. Once again, our AutoZoners\u2019 efforts generated double-digit domestic commercial growth and single-digit domestic retail same-store sales growth. As we move further and further away from the societal impacts experienced as a result of the pandemic, we are very pleased with our team\u2019s ability to not only retain the tremendous growth we experienced over the last three years, but continue to grow on top of those phenomenal levels. Our team is relentlessly focused on getting back to normal or, as I call it, quote-unquote, exiting pandemic mode. We must get back to our well-known and highly regarded flawless execution. In all candor, we still aren\u2019t there yet. But we also have to reignite our innovation engine. We have some very good initiatives in development in both retail and commercial, and we have some significant improvements underway in our supply chain, as we modernize and expand it for the next decade of growth and beyond. We are halfway through our fiscal year and we are pleased with our performance so far. More encouraging, we feel good about the balance of the year and know our AutoZoners are keenly focused on delivering great service and terrific performance. This morning, we will review our second quarter same-store sales, DIY versus DIFM trends, our sales cadence over the 12-week quarter, merchandise categories that drove our performance and some regional call-outs. We will also share how inflation is affecting our cost and retails, and how we think inflation will impact our business for the remainder of our fiscal year. Let\u2019s now move into more specifics on our performance. Domestic same-store sales were up 5.3%, our net income was $477 million and our EPS was $24.64 a share, increasing 10.5%. Our domestic same-store sales comp was on top of last year\u2019s 13.8% and in line with last quarter\u2019s 5.6% comp. On a two-year basis, we delivered a 19.1% comp, and get this, on a three-year basis, a 34.3% stacked comp. Our team once again delivered amazing results despite the comparison to the last couple of years being the hardest quarterly compare for the entire fiscal year. Now let me spend a few moments on growth, our growth dynamics in the quarter. Our growth rates for retail and commercial were both strong, with domestic retail sales up nearly 5% and domestic commercial growth north of 13%. We continue to set commercial quarterly records with $955 million in sales, another impressive quarter as we generated $111 million more in sales than in Q2 last year. On a trailing four-quarter basis, we delivered just under $4.5 billion in annual commercial sales, up an amazing 19% over last year. We also set another Q2 record for average weekly sales per store at $14,500 versus $13,500 last year. Domestic commercial sales represented 30% of our domestic auto parts sales versus 28% this time last year. It was encouraging to see our transaction trends improving from last quarter. Our retail transactions meaningfully improved and were down just 2.2% for the quarter, while our commercial transactions were up mid-single digits and improving. Our average ticket in both retail and commercial experienced solid mid single-digit growth. Ticket growth decelerated from Q1 as we began to lap the acceleration in inflation we experienced this time last year. We are beginning to see signs of product cost and freight inflation slowing, and we expect to see these begin to return to historical norms over time. We are continuing to see -- to experience substantially higher wage inflation than historically in the mid single-digit range, more than double our historical experience. While the staffing environment is substantially improved versus this time last year, we don\u2019t envision wage inflation abating soon as there continues to be regulatory and market pressures. While we have to manage through these external forces, our focus continues to be on driving profitable market share growth, particularly in units and transactions. Our growth initiatives are doing just that and include, new store unit growth, improved satellite store availability, hub and mega-hub openings, improvements in coverage, leveraging the strength of the Duralast brand, enhanced technology to make us easier to do business with and more efficient, reducing delivery times, enhancing our sales force effectiveness and living consistent with our pledge by being priced right for the value proposition we deliver. Our goal remains over time to become the industry leader in both DIY and commercial. Our strategy, execution and market momentum give us confidence as we move forward. Digging deeper into our domestic DIY business this past quarter, we delivered a positive 2.7% comp on top of last year\u2019s 8.4%. Our DIY results were similar to last quarter\u2019s results on a one-year and two-year basis and accelerated on a three-year basis. As previously said, our ticket growth was up 5% versus last year. We are pleased with our transaction count trends improving as we reported transactions down just 2%. These results are very strong, considering the difficult comparison to last year. From the data we have available, we continued to retain the majority of the dollar share gains we have built during the pandemic and we continue to grow unit share, a critical measurement of our success. Our performance gives us continued conviction about the sustainability of our sales growth for the remainder of the year. As we have shared forever, our second quarter is always the most volatile sales quarter due to the holidays, their timing shifts, and more importantly, weather, specifically extreme temperatures, which all can have a tremendous impact on our weekly sales. This quarter was no different, with softer sales at the beginning of the quarter when the weather was mild and wet, followed by a large spike around Christmas with the very cold temperatures the country experienced. We exited the quarter with normalized growth rates. We do believe we had enough harsh winter weather that we won\u2019t be talking about the lingering effects of a mild winter weather or mild winter for the next several months. Our attention has now turned to tax rebate season, which historically drives enormous demand in our category. Regarding our retail merchandise categories, our sales floor outperformed hard parts with approximately a 1.5% difference between them. Our relative outperformance in sales for categories is attributable to the discretionary categories improvement. As gas prices naturally have come down and consumer has shown surprising resiliency, our discretionary categories performed better. The discretionary categories represented approximately 18% of our DIY sales in the quarter. We were encouraged to see our battery, oil and wiper categories performed well and successfully lapped very strong performance last year. These categories have exceeded our expectations all year. Our friction category for both DIY and commercial performed below our expectations for much of the quarter. However, it bounced back late and we are encouraged by our recent trends. We believe both our sales floor and hard parts businesses will continue to do well this spring, as we expect miles driven to continue improving, while our growth initiatives continued delivering solid results. Let me also address pricing. In Q2, we experienced high single-digit pricing inflation in line with cost of goods. We believe both numbers will decrease in the current quarter as we begin to lap the onset of high inflation last year. To be clear, we do not believe inflation is going away, especially wage inflation, but expect it to slow a bit as the economy slows. I want to highlight that our industry has been disciplined about pricing for decades, and we expect that to continue. Most of the parts and products we sell in this industry have low price elasticity, because purchases are driven by failure or routine maintenance. Historically, as costs have increased, the industry has increased pricing commensurately to maintain margin rates, increasing margin dollars. It is also notable that following periods of higher inflation, our industry has historically not meaningfully reduced pricing to reflect lower cost. Over the last three years, we have encouraged investors to keep a keen focus on our two-year and three-year comparisons. As we return to normal, we believe our year-over-year comparisons will be more and more relevant. While it\u2019s difficult to predict sales, we are excited about our growth initiatives. Our team is improving execution and the tremendous share gains we have achieved in both sectors. For our third quarter 2023, we expect our sales performance to be led by the continued strength in our commercial business as we execute on our differentiating initiatives, combined with the resilient DIY business. We will as always be transparent about what we are seeing and provide color on our markets and performance as trends emerge. Before handing the call to Jamere, I\u2019d like to give a brief update on our supply chain initiatives. I will start with our in-stock position. I spent several quarters talking about how we were not back to where we were pre-pandemic. I am pleased to report, we are continuing to improve and are very close to our targets. Our merchandising and supply chain teams have worked diligently and creatively to get our levels back up, and we have made enormous progress. There are still a few categories where we are not where we want to be, but we will -- we have line of sight to putting this behind us. This has taken a lot of effort by our vendor community, and I\u2019d like to publicly thank them for their tremendous efforts as well. We know this will pay future dividends. Second, our supply chain initiatives that are in flight to drive improved availability are on track. One we have often highlighted is our expanded hub and mega-hub rollouts. We know intelligently placing more inventory in local markets closer to the customer will lead to our ability to continue to say, yes, to our customers more frequently and in turn drive sales. Additionally, we have previously announced the development of two new domestic distribution centers and additional capacity in Mexico. All three efforts are under construction and are expected to be completed by early fiscal 2025. These distribution centers will allow us to not only reduce drive times to stores but also increase our capacity. With the tremendous sales growth we have experienced since 2020, the additional capacity will enable us to carry more slower turning inventory that is not yet in high demand. I am excited that -- I am also excited we opened a facility on the West Coast recently to handle direct import product on a timelier and more effective and efficient basis. This new West Coast facility is already paying dividends by allowing products ordered abroad to be distributed to our other DCs to reduce safety stock and drive productivity. Our supply chain strategy is focused on carrying more products closer to the customer and we believe it has been a significant contributor to our recent sales success, especially in commercial. Simply put, every time we intelligently add inventory to our network our sales grow. Lastly, we plan on continuing to grow our business in Mexico and Brazil at almost 800 stores combined across the two markets. These businesses had impressive performance again this quarter and they should continue to be key contributors to sales and profit growth for decades to come. We are leveraging many of the learnings we have in the U.S. to refine our offerings in Mexico and Brazil. In Brazil, in particular, we are targeting to expand our store footprint significantly and aggressively over the next five years. We are very excited about our growth prospects internationally. We are dedicated to growing our business in a disciplined and profitable manner well into the future, and we know, with our AutoZoners leading the charge, we will continue to be very successful. Now I will turn the call over to Jamere Jackson. Jamere? Jamere Jackson : Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As Bill mentioned, we had a strong second quarter stacked on top of exceptionally strong comps from last year. This quarter we delivered 5.3% domestic comp growth, a 6.9% increase in EBIT and a 10.5% increase in EPS. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to elaborate on the specifics in our P&L for Q2. For the quarter, total sales were just under $3.7 billion, up 9.5%, reflecting continued strength in our industry and solid execution of our growth initiatives and let me give a little more color on those growth initiatives. Starting with our commercial business for the second quarter. Our domestic DIFM sales increased just over 13% to $955 million and were up just over 45% on a two-year stack basis. Sales to our domestic DIFM customers represented 30% of our domestic auto part sales. Our weekly sales per program were $14,500, up 7.4% and our growth was broad-based as both national and local accounts performed well for the quarter. Our results for the quarter set another record for the highest second quarter weekly sales volume in the history of the chain. I want to reiterate that our execution on our commercial acceleration initiatives continues to deliver exceptionally strong results, as we grow share by winning new business and increasing our share of wallet with existing customers. We have a commercial program in approximately 88% of our domestic stores, which leverages our DIY infrastructure and we are building our business with national, regional and local accounts. This quarter we opened 41 net new programs, finishing with 5,500 total programs. As expected, commercial growth is leading the way in FY 2023 and we continue to deliver on our goal of becoming a faster-growing business. Our strategy and execution continue to drive share gains and position us well in the marketplace. We have delivered double-digit sales growth for the past 10 quarters. In addition, we are increasing the penetration of our market leading ALLDATA shop management, diagnostic and repair software suite to new and existing commercial customers, which gives us yet another key competitive advantage. And as I have noted on past calls, our mega-hub strategy is driving strong performance and positioning us for an even brighter future in our commercial and retail businesses. Once again, I will add some color on our progress. As we have discussed over the last several quarters, our mega-hub strategy has given us tremendous momentum. We now have 81 mega-hub locations with one new one opened in Q2. While I mentioned a moment ago, the commercial weekly sales per program average was $14,500, the 81 mega-hubs averaged significantly higher sales than the balance of the commercial footprint and grew significantly faster than our overall commercial business in Q2. As a reminder, our mega-hubs typically carry 80,000 to 100,000 SKUs and more in certain cases and drive tremendous sales lift inside the store box, as well as serve as an expanded assortment source for other stores. The expansion of coverage and parts availability continues to deliver a meaningful sales lift to both our commercial and DIY business. These assets are not only performing well individually, but the fulfillment capability for the surrounding AutoZone stores is giving our customers access to thousands of additional parks and lifting the entire network. This strategy is working. We are targeting 25 new mega-hubs for FY 2023 and we remain committed to our objective to reach 200 mega-hubs, supplemented by 300 regular hubs. We continue to leverage sophisticated data analytics to expand our market reach, placing more parts closer to our customers and improving our delivery times. We will build on our strong momentum over the remainder of the fiscal year. Our domestic retail comp was up 2.7% in Q2. This business has been remarkably resilient as growth rates remain solid and we have managed to continue to deliver positive comp growth despite underlying market headwinds. As Bill mentioned, we saw our traffic down 2.2% from last year\u2019s levels. However, they improved sequentially from Q1 where traffic was down 4%. We also saw 5% ticket growth as we continue to raise prices in an inflationary environment. Our DIY business has continued to strengthen competitively behind our growth initiatives. In addition, on a macro basis, the market is still experiencing a growing and aging car park, and a still challenging new and used car sales market for our customers. These dynamics, pricing growth initiatives and macro car park tailwinds have driven a positive comp despite tough comparisons from last year\u2019s stimulus injection and consumer discretionary spending pressure from overall inflation in the economy. We are forecasting a resilient DIY business for the remainder of FY 2023. Now I will say a few words regarding our international businesses. We continue to be pleased with the progress we are making in Mexico and Brazil. During the quarter, we opened one new store in Mexico to finish with 707 stores and five new stores in Brazil ending with 81. On a constant currency basis, we meaningfully accelerated our sales growth in both countries at higher growth rates than we saw in the overall business. We remain committed to our store opening schedules in both markets and expect both countries to be significant contributors to sales and earnings growth in the future. With 11% of our total store base currently outside the U.S. and a commitment to continued expansion in a disciplined way, international growth will be an attractive and meaningful contributor to AutoZone\u2019s future growth. We are bullish on international growth, and as Bill mentioned earlier, we are adding distribution center capacity in Mexico to improve our competitive positioning in the market. Now let me spend a few minutes on the rest of the P&L and gross margins. For the quarter, our gross margin was down 69 basis points and included a 27-basis-point headwind stemming from a noncash $10 million LIFO charge. The difference for the quarter, a decline of 42 basis points in gross margin was driven by supply chain costs and our faster growing lower gross margin commercial business. With this quarter\u2019s LIFO charge, we have taken our LIFO credit balance to $106 million. As I mentioned last quarter, hyperinflation and freight cost is the primary driver for the charges. Both the first quarter and second quarter actuals are below the outlook we gave at the start of each quarter as freight costs have continued to abate over the past few months and we expect this trend to continue. As such, we anticipate having minimal if any LIFO charges during the third quarter. As spot rates have come down, we have renegotiated some of our long-term contracts and the lower costs are reflected in our outlook. We expect freight costs to continue to abate. We expect to see these quarterly charges start to reverse during FY 2024, and quite possibly, as early as Q4. We plan to take P&L gains only to the extent of the charges we have taken thus far and after we have taken P&L gains that fully reverse the charges we have incurred, we expect to rebuild our unrecorded LIFO reserve balance as we have done historically. Now moving to operating expenses. Our expenses were up 8.8% versus last year\u2019s Q2 as SG&A levered 24 basis points versus last year. Our operating expense growth has been purposeful as we continue to invest at an accelerated pace in IT and payroll to underpin our growth initiatives. These investments are expected to pay dividends and customer experience, speed and productivity. We are committed to being disciplined on SG&A growth as we move forward and we will manage expenses in line with sales growth over time. Moving to the rest of the P&L. EBIT for the quarter was $670 million, up 6.9% versus the prior year\u2019s quarter. Excluding the $10 million LIFO charge, EBIT would have been up 8.5% over last year. Interest expense for the quarter was $65.6 million, up 54.5% from Q2 a year ago, as our debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $7 billion versus $5.8 billion at Q2 end last year. We are planning interest in the $72 million range for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 versus $42 million in last year\u2019s third quarter. Higher debt levels and expected continuing higher borrowing costs are driving this increase. For the quarter, our tax rate was 21.2% and above last year\u2019s second quarter rate of 19.3%. This quarter\u2019s rate benefited 222 basis points from stock options exercised, while last year\u2019s benefit was 401 basis points. For the third quarter of FY 2023, we suggest investors model us at approximately 23.4% before any assumption on credits due to stock option exercises. Now moving to net income and EPS. Net income for the quarter was $476.5 million, up 1% versus last year\u2019s second quarter. Our diluted share count of 19.3 million was 8.6% lower than last year\u2019s second quarter. The combination of higher net income and lower share count drove earnings per share for the quarter to $24.64, up 10.5% versus a year ago. Excluding the LIFO charge, our net income would have increased 2.6% and our EPS growth would have increased 12.3%. Now let me talk about our free cash flow for Q2. For the second quarter, we generated $210 million in free cash flow versus $260 million a year ago. Year-to-date, we have generated $900 million versus $930 million a year ago. We expect to be an incredibly strong cash flow generator going forward and we remain committed to returning meaningful amounts of cash to our shareholders. Regarding our balance sheet, our liquidity position remains very strong and our leverage ratios remain below our historic norms. Our inventory per store was up 10.7% versus Q2 last year and total inventory increased 13.9% over the same period, driven primarily by inflation, our growth initiatives and in-stock recoveries. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable on a per store basis was a negative $227,000 versus negative $198,000 last year and negative $249,000 last quarter. As a result, accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 127.7% versus last year\u2019s Q2 of 126.8%. Lastly, I will spend a moment on capital allocation and our share repurchase program. We repurchased 906 million of AutoZone stock in the quarter, and at quarter end, we had just under $1.8 billion remaining under our share buyback authorization. Our strong earnings, balance sheet and powerful free cash generated this year have allowed us to buy back 4% of the company\u2019s total shares outstanding since the start of the fiscal year. We bought back well over 90% of the shares outstanding of our stock since our buyback inception in 1998, while investing in our existing assets and growing our business. We remain committed to our disciplined capital allocation approach that enables us to invest in the business, while returning meaningful amounts of cash to shareholders. Our leverage ratio finished Q2 at 2.3 times EBITDAR and we remain committed to return to the 2.5 times area during FY 2023. So to wrap up, we continue to drive long-term shareholder value by investing in our growth initiatives, driving robust earnings and cash, and returning excess cash to our shareholders. We are growing our market share, and we are improving our competitive positioning in a disciplined way. Our strategy continues to work. As we look forward to the back half of FY 2023, we are bullish on our growth prospects behind a resilient DIY business and fast growing commercial and international businesses that are growing considerable share. I continue to have tremendous confidence in our industry, our business and the opportunity to drive long-term shareholder value. And now I will turn it back to Bill. Bill Rhodes : Thank you, Jamere. We are proud of the results our team delivered in the second quarter. But we must, we must continue to be focused on superior customer service and flawless execution. Execution and our culture of always putting the customer first is what defines us. As Jamere said a moment ago, we continue to be bullish on our industry, and in particular, on our own opportunities for the remainder of the year. We will continue to invest in initiatives that drive an appropriate return on capital and we continue investing where our returns are the highest. For the remainder of fiscal 2023, we are launching some very exciting initiatives. This year not only we would be opening roughly 200 stores across the U.S., Mexico and Brazil, but we will be opening many more mega-hub and hub stores, and we are focused on initiatives to continue driving strong performance in both our retail and commercial businesses. For the remainder of 2023, we are keenly focused on relentless execution. We will not accept shortcuts. We remain focused on achieving our store opening goals, both domestically and internationally. We are working diligently to expand and enhance our supply chain and we have to achieve this growth, all while managing our costs appropriately. Simply said, we have to focus on exceptional execution in order to drive continued share gains. We know that investors will ultimately measure us by what our future cash flows look like in three to four years from now and we welcome and accept that challenge. I continue to be bullish on our industry, and in particular, on AutoZone, which is led by AutoZoners. Now we would like to open up the call for questions. Operator : Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Your first question for today is coming from Bret Jordan at Jefferies. Bret Jordan : Hey. Good morning, guys. Bill Rhodes : Good morning, Bret. Jamere Jackson : Hi, Bret. Bret Jordan : On the talk of lower transportation, supply chain costs but higher wage inflation, in this environment, where some of your inputs are going to come down and maybe you have got the opportunity to capture margin as customer prices stay firm, are we less likely to see this over for excess margin, because we have got either price investment from peers or wage inflation that might offset some of the cost of good benefit? Bill Rhodes : Yeah. It\u2019s a fantastic question, Bret. I will start, and Jamere, you are welcome to build on it if you want to. First of all, I think, it\u2019s important for you all to understand, as we saw these enormous spikes in the freight cost, we did not pass all those costs along. I will use brake rotors, for instance. I mean the cost of shipping brake rotors from China to the U.S. were astronomical for a period of time. We couldn\u2019t pass all that costs on to the industry. So some of this is we will recoup some gross margin percentages that we didn\u2019t get in the midst of the freight issue. As we look forward, I think, you have to separate the gross margin piece from the labor piece. We are going to continue to see elevated wage growth. We have seen it now for probably five years, Bret. We will continue to monitor that. Our pricing is really more focused on what our product costs are and what those freight costs are. We will be mindful of labor costs. But generally, that\u2019s not a big driver of what we do with our pricing to the customer. What we need to do is make sure that we are finding ways to be as efficient as possible with the labor that we have, and over time, I think, wage rates will go back to more normalized growth rates. Jamere Jackson : Yeah. And we haven\u2019t seen the moves and actions by our nearing competitors impact our business, really at all. Most of those moves, quite frankly, were targeted in much the same manner as our moves were a couple of years ago, which was how do we all improve our competitive hand relative to the warehouse distributors. So we haven\u2019t seen much of an impact there, and as a result of that, we don\u2019t see a need to make pricing actions to sort of counter what\u2019s being done in the marketplace by some of our newer competitors. Bret Jordan : Okay. Great. And then a quick question on ALLDATA. I think you would mentioned expanding the user base. Is there a way to make that a product selling tool as they use your shop management software, is there a way to link it to your inventory or make it more transactional? Bill Rhodes : Yeah. First of all, at ALLDATA, we are very focused on providing value via our ALLDATA offerings to our customers at ALLDATA. We also look for ways that we can enhance our commercial relationship at AutoZone with their customers. We have done a lot of that by cross-selling, leveraging our two sales teams to generate leads for each other. So far, we haven\u2019t really integrated a lot with the, call it, up and down the street customer, but we have made some really meaningful progress with some of our national accounts and have some exciting things underway right now that helps integrate us more and more with them. Over time, that\u2019s certainly the vision that we have, is how can we be on their desktop as both ALLDATA and AutoZone in a seamless way, but we got to make sure that we don\u2019t drive the customer to that, that instead we have a product offering that the customer wants to adopt. Bret Jordan : Great. Thank you. Bill Rhodes : Yeah. Thank you. Operator : Your next question for today is coming from Seth Sigman at Barclays. Seth Sigman : Hey, everybody. Good morning. My first question is just around the improvement in transactions or ticket count. I guess that coincides with less average ticket growth. But, Bill, to your point, there really shouldn\u2019t be a lot of elasticity in this business since it\u2019s more need based, right? So is there something else that you would point to that\u2019s driving that acceleration in transactions? Thank you. Bill Rhodes : It\u2019s a great question. Frankly, I don\u2019t have a great answer for you. As you know, you have been following this industry for a long time, one of the dirty little secrets of the industry is that for decades and basically for the 28 years that I have been in this business, there has been transaction count declines and they have gone down over time, because the technology that has gone into the parts and products that we sell have increased, and therefore, the price of those products have increased. I often used the example of spark plugs. When I got in this business, we only sold copper clad spark bugs and they were $0.59 and they would last 30,000 miles. Today we sell Iridium spark plugs, it costs $11.99 and they will last 100,000 miles. There\u2019s many, many, many examples like that, 2.2% decline in retail transaction counts is historically very good. I just -- I would caution everybody, as I have mentioned in my prepared remarks, Q2 is our most volatile quarter every year and it is really driven by weather patterns. And so I don\u2019t want to read too much into an improvement in Q2, we were very excited to see it. Let\u2019s see how we do in Q2 and Q3. We are also still going up against the massive surge in growth that we had since 2019 as a result of COVID. So what we are focused on is, we thought for a period of time, that some of the sales growth that we experienced during COVID, we would give back. We are sitting here and have been for the last year saying, I don\u2019t think we are going to give it back, and now we are saying, look, we think we can grow from here and maybe have normalized growth rates and maybe even accelerated slightly growth rates to what we experienced historically, because of our growth initiatives. That\u2019s the way we are thinking about it. Does that make sense? Seth Sigman : Yeah. That\u2019s helpful. I appreciate that. Maybe just one follow-up is on the cost side. You did discuss some external cost pressures. I think you are probably referring to wages and some of your competitors have also talked about wage investments. I guess when we look at your SG&A growth up high-single digits, is it fair to assume that, that already reflects AutoZone investing in its people, investing in its infrastructure, does that already reflect some of those cost pressures that you are referring to? Jamere Jackson : Certainly does. I mean one of the things that we have been really clear about is that we are going to grow SG&A in a disciplined way as we create a faster growing business and the two ways that we have done that. One, is investing in labor to maintain high levels of customer service. You saw us do that throughout the pandemic and it paid great dividends for us during that timeframe. The other thing we have talked about is investing in a disciplined way in IT, which is enabling growth in both our DIY and our commercial business. Every one of our growth initiatives, whether it\u2019s on the retail side of the business or the commercial side of the business, includes some element of improving the customer experience and those things have required us to accelerate some of our investments in IT. We like those investments. They are improving the customer experience. They are also improving the experience for our AutoZoners, and quite frankly, we think we will get benefits in terms of productivity in the future. Seth Sigman : Okay. Great. Thanks very much. Bill Rhodes : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is coming from Zach Fadem at Wells Fargo. Zach Fadem : Hey. Good morning. Could you walk us through the sequential performance for commercial in a little bit more detail as last quarter stepped down a touch on a multiyear basis, while this quarter bounced back nicely. So the question is, could you walk us through what you think could be driving the fluctuation in the do-it-for-me transactions from Q1 to Q2? And then with the three-year commercial compare looking a bit tougher, is it fair to assume that double-digit growth can sustain in the second half of the year? Jamere Jackson : Yeah. Great question. So a couple of things I will highlight. As I have mentioned, we have had 10 straight quarters of double-digit sales growth, and quite frankly, six of the last eight have been above 20%. We like the competitive dynamics in the marketplace today. We also like the fact that we are underpenetrated. We are a four to five share in a huge market that\u2019s approaching $100 billion. So there\u2019s a tremendous opportunity for us to create a faster-growing business. If we look at our business on a two-year basis -- on a two-year stack basis, we are over 45%. So we like where we are from a commercial standpoint and all the initiatives that we have in place, improving the quality of our Duralast brand, expanding our assortments with our mega-hubs, improving our delivery times, leveraging technology and the competitive pricing dynamics that we saw in the marketplace a couple of years ago that we addressed give us a lot of confidence about it. So we have been comfortably double digits. You have heard us say that our goal is to continue to grow that share and growing that share means that we aspire to have a business that\u2019s growing double digits really as far as the eye can see. Zach Fadem : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And Jamere, just to clarify your gross margin commentary, you mentioned no negative LIFO impact in Q3. Does that mean your LIFO balance of $106 million remained stable in Q3 and Q4 or is it fair to expect that line to gradually or maybe more drastically shrink sequentially? And then big picture, is it fair to say that 52% gross margin is a fair run rate for the business going forward? Jamere Jackson : Yeah. So first, on LIFO, what we said is that, we anticipate minimal if any LIFO charges in 3Q and by the fourth quarter and certainly into FY 2024, we could potentially see that $106 million balance start to burn down, which means we would actually take gains through the P&L. It will take several quarters for us to work our way through $106 million based on our current forecast today. But we will be very transparent about what we are seeing and what gives us this confidence, quite frankly, is that as I mentioned before, we are seeing freight moderate. And as such, in the back half of this fiscal year, barring any disruptions like we have seen in the past, we are not expecting to take any charges and again, possibly see us flipping back to gains. In terms of our gross margin run rate, we have said that our commercial business is going to grow faster than our DIY business and that\u2019s going to put, let\u2019s call it, 35 basis points to 40 basis points of headwind on our gross margins going forward. Now that doesn\u2019t mean that you can expect our gross margins to deteriorate in the perpetuity. We are still running the same play with intensity inside the company to drive margin improvement that will mute some of that, if not offset all of it. So we feel pretty good about those initiatives. Our merchants and our supply chain teams are doing a tremendous job, as Bill mentioned before, not only working on in-stocks, but driving margin improvement. And as some of the cost pressures ease in the marketplace and some of the cost pressures that our vendors and suppliers have been seeing, it gives us an opportunity to go work on margins in a more fulsome way going forward. Zach Fadem : Got it. Thanks for the time. Jamere Jackson : Yeah. Operator : Your next question for today is coming from Scot Ciccarelli at Truist Securities. Scot Ciccarelli : Hi, guys. I just had a quick question on your outlook for same SKU inflation for the rest of the year. I know you have said you think it\u2019s going to moderate somewhat. Just wondering do you think that would get to like the mid-single digits or low single-digit range? Bill Rhodes : Yeah. That\u2019s a great question. I wish I could answer. There\u2019s just so many pushes and pulls right now in the economy with our cost that I am not sure we can answer that. That seems like a reasonable assessment, but we are just going to manage through it just like we have. We have gone through some pretty big cycles over the last 24 months and we are going to manage our business appropriately, whether it\u2019s 5% or 7%, we are just going to manage through it. Scot Ciccarelli : Got you. That makes a lot of sense. And then just a follow-up on an earlier question, I know you mentioned transactions kind of accelerated in the quarter kind of and it really kind of offset some of the ticket decel. Do you think that could continue to happen or is there any data points that you think that, that might not happen again in the second half? Bill Rhodes : I think that\u2019s a reasonable assumption. We hope that we can continue to -- we want to grow transactions. I talked about the challenges that are related to that, but our goal is to grow transactions. I also mentioned in the prepared remarks that we are very focused on unit growth. We believe that\u2019s the lifeblood of this organization and we are focused on how do we grow units over the long term in both our retail and commercial business and we have been very pleased with the unit market share gains that we have had over the last three years and we are continuing to grow unit share even after the growth we have had over the last three years. Scot Ciccarelli : Great. Thank you. Bill Rhodes : Thank you. Operator : Your next question for today is coming from Brian Nagel at Oppenheimer. Brian Nagel : Hey, guys. Good morning. Jamere Jackson : Hi, Brian. Bill Rhodes : Good morning. Brian Nagel : So my first question, it\u2019s a bit of a follow-up to a prior question, but just with respect -- with regard to the commercial growth, we have seen substantial growth there for a while. As you move past the effects of the pandemic, the growth rates moderated, but still stayed very healthy. I guess how -- the question is how do you think about that longer term trajectory commercial growth and if you look at some of the markets that are maybe more mature for AutoZone, do they always give you insight into either from a market share perspective or more closer to a terminal type growth rate for that business? Bill Rhodes : Well, terrific questions. I want to be clear about one thing. I don\u2019t believe the vast majority of the growth that we have seen in the commercial business over the last three years was a result of the pandemic. There\u2019s no question. The outside growth in our DIY business was mainly attributable to the pandemic. I don\u2019t think that was the case with commercial. I am sure it had some positive effects. But I think what -- the strategy that we began to deploy about four years ago have really been the driver of our commercial performance. Now as we continue to further and further mature on that strategy, we have seen some deceleration in our commercial growth. It\u2019s still fantastic, but it\u2019s not growing in the 20s. Our goal now is what\u2019s next and we are working on that even as we speak. What are the next levers that we are going to pull to continue to grow in the commercial business? Now just a reminder, we have got mid-teens market share in the retail business and we have about 25% or about 4% total market share in the commercial business. So we have got a tremendous runway in front of us. When you talk about certain markets and what do we see, we certainly have some markets that are more mature than others. I would say the most encouraging thing to me is to see how broad-based the acceleration has been in our 61 regions that we have across the United States. But I was in a market last week, arguably our most mature market, I am not going to tell you where that is. And it has significant hub coverage and it has significant mega-hub coverage and in that market we continue to grow at very rapid rates. And so I am particularly optimistic, as we continue to deploy the strategy of mega-hubs, so we still have -- we have roughly a little over 80 mega-hubs today. We are going to 200, and hopefully, in short order and then we are going to get to 300 hub stores. So that will be 500 stores in the United States with materially different product assortments than we have had historically. To me, that is the biggest part of our strategy. Brian Nagel : Yeah. That\u2019s very, very helpful. I appreciate it. And then as a quick follow-up, a different topic, you have mentioned in the prepared comments that you think the winter, I guess, it was harsh enough to drive that typical spring type business, you made that comment. The question I have is, as you look at the weather and it seemed to be very variable across the United States this year, are you seeing it much in the way of as kind of spread your comps between those markets which have been weather impacted versus those that have been less impacted? Bill Rhodes : Yeah. I mean, we always see that. But what my point was, we have been through years where we just didn\u2019t have a winter and it\u2019s not just the spring, frankly, it\u2019s as much in the summertime where we just don\u2019t see the parts failures on the failure side of the business that we do historically and the maintenance side. It\u2019s snow and ice and cold or all put stress on automobiles and we generally see that over the next six months to eight months once the winter subsides. So that\u2019s what I was really getting at. I do have a bit of caution right now. I talked about tax rebates that are flowing right now. The one thing that I worry about a little bit is, we haven\u2019t had great weather in the last week or so. We need to get some good weather, so DIYers can crawl underneath their cars, while these tax rebates are flowing, because we see a massive surge during this time of the year when our customers have more discretionary dollars. Brian Nagel : Got it. Very helpful. Thank you. Bill Rhodes : Yeah. Thank you. Jamere Jackson : Thanks. Operator : Your next question for today is coming from Simeon Gutman at Morgan Stanley. Jackie Sussman : Hi. This is Jackie Sussman on for Simeon. Congrats on a good quarter. I guess, first, just on the used car cycle that kind of seems to be this ongoing tailwind for the industry. Is there any way to assess where we are in that cycle and I guess just lapping this higher mix of used cars or an older car fleet become a challenge at some point or do you guys expect a softer landing? Jamere Jackson : Yeah. So, clearly, used cars are still in tight supply and prices are up. We have seen prices moderate a little bit year-over-year, but they are still up 24% or so over a two-year basis. I think the second dynamic associated with that is, the fact that financing costs have gone up fairly significantly as well. So you have got interest rates that have made financing a vehicle, whether it\u2019s new or used, significantly more expensive. I think the combination of those two dynamics puts tremendous pressure on consumers and what we have seen historically is that when the consumer is under pressure, whether it\u2019s a recessionary cycle or it\u2019s a cycle where new and used car prices spike, they tend to hang on to their vehicles longer, invest in repairing those vehicles and ride to the other side of tougher market conditions and we certainly think that, that\u2019s going to be the case. So while the prices have come down, we still see a very tight market that\u2019s out there today, and quite frankly, a market that\u2019s significantly more expensive than what consumers experience prior to the pandemic. Jackie Sussman : Got it. That\u2019s really helpful. Thanks. And just quickly, another on the wage inflation, I guess, that kind of feels like the most stubborn cost pressure, as you mentioned in your prepared remarks. Is the way to think about it that the cost of business seems structurally higher as a result or are there efficiencies within the labor and fulfillment model you have that you could focus on as an offset? Bill Rhodes : There\u2019s no question that the cost of doing business are structurally higher. And I just want to make sure I amplify this point, our wage rates are up double, more than double what they normally are and that is stick to your ribs inflation. It will be with us forever. But that\u2019s going to continue. And it\u2019s been going on for five years, not at this level, but we had acceleration before the pandemic and once the pandemic hit, it went up significantly more. But we have been able to manage it. We are looking for creative ways like always to be more and more efficient. But we can\u2019t drive that level of efficiency in a 43-year-old business without some kind of structural change, which we will be looking for, but we haven\u2019t identified at this point in time. Jamere Jackson : And I just think from a macro standpoint, if you look at unemployment being at 3.4% or so and wage rates being in the -- with a five handle on them, I mean we are in a dynamic where the combination, as Bill said in his remarks, the combination of market pressures and regulatory pressures, which is an increasing push to raise minimum wage rates, this is an environment that we have to plan for in the future. The good news, again, about our industry is that, as we have seen inflationary impacts, whether it\u2019s product cost or it\u2019s wages or it\u2019s freight, I mean, we have typically seen this be an industry that is very disciplined about passing those costs along to consumers and given the relative inelasticity of the demand for our bread and butter products, we expect that to not cause our business to wobble at all. Operator : Your next question for today is coming from David Bellinger at Roth MKM. David Bellinger : Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. First one on the sequential improvement in discretionary categories. Why do you think that\u2019s happening now, was there anything unique within the Q2 period? And are you seeing differences across demographics, meaning is the discretionary improvement also occurring with your lower or, call it, the lowest income customer base as well? Jamere Jackson : Yeah. I mean what we have seen in total is that, our business has been remarkably resilient across both our upper income consumers, but also the lower end consumers. And again, that\u2019s because the lion\u2019s share of our business, our bread and butter categories, if you will or brake fix/failure, maintenance related sort of categories. The knock on effect of that is that to the extent that folks are making purchases for those bread and butter products if you will, then the discretionary categories tend to ride along with that as the basket gets built. So we have been fortunate in that regard. And the other thing that I don\u2019t want to underestimate and I actually want to underscore, is the fact that, we have been very focused on our growth initiatives and our growth initiatives are about driving more customers and more purchase occasions for AutoZone. And as a result of that, we are seeing the opportunity for us to continue to win some market share. So some of that sequential improvement that you are seeing in traffic is actually the impact of some of the things that we have been doing from a growth initiative to drive more customers into our store. David Bellinger : Thanks, Jamere. And my follow-up on the 4% market share you highlighted before in commercial, do you have a sense of where the more mature markets are tracking in terms of market share and should we think about that as potentially in the double digits at this point and a path to where some of these newer programs can get to in due time? Bill Rhodes : Yeah. We are definitely not in double digits in any markets that I am aware of. I would think maybe we are at 6% in that kind of ballpark. But look, if we have 16% or whatever share in retail, my thing is why can\u2019t we have that in commercial and that\u2019s the kind of thought process we need to have. I think one of our challenges is, sometimes we think about where we are and it limits what we think about the possibilities. We are trying to eliminate some of those glass ceilings, and say, why don\u2019t we have the same amount of share in both, which would mean the commercial business would be meaningfully larger than the retail business? Jamere Jackson : And the good news for us is it\u2019s not just focused on new customers, but it is increasing our share of wallet with our existing customers. And to Bill\u2019s point, that\u2019s where we are focused as a company at getting what we believe our fair share or what our entitlement should be. We are pretty excited about those initiatives going forward. David Bellinger : Great. Thank you. Bill Rhodes : Thank you. Operator : Your next question for today is coming from Michael Lasser at UBS. Atul Maheswari : Good morning. This is Atul Maheswari on for Michael Lasser. Thanks a lot for taking our questions. The first question is on the commercial business, compared to last year, when you were regularly doing 20%-plus to now growing in 13% to 15%. So what has changed, is it just fewer new customer additions or less ticket per customer? Bill Rhodes : Well, I think, as I said before, I think, part of what\u2019s changed is some of the massive improvements that we have made in our -- from our new strategy on commercial acceleration have matured more, but they are not mature. And so we are -- I would just say it this way, we are very pleased with the commercial growth that we have experienced over the last six months. And as I also said, we are looking for those next items that are in the next part of our strategy, they are going to drive accelerated growth. Jamere Jackson : Yeah. We are continuing to win market share. I mean, I would venture to say that the commercial market is not growing as fast as we are growing, which the knock on to that is that we are growing market share and we are pleased with our progress. Atul Maheswari : Got it. It makes sense. Thank you for that. And then as a quick follow-up, I know you talked about tax refunds, but how are you thinking about near-term trends given some of the data source that tax refunds are lower year-over-year and then there\u2019s potentially some headwinds from Snap as well? Bill Rhodes : Yeah. Look, we have never talked about Snap. I don\u2019t think that that\u2019s a big part driver for our business. The data we have available to us shows that tax refunds are remarkably similar to the way they were last year and are slightly up. We look at that data, it usually comes out on Mondays and we see where the big drops happened last week. Last week was a big drop as it was last year on tax refunds. So as far as we are concerned, we see everything on track, we are hoping that we get some great weather that\u2019s very conducive to DIY and that those customers come to us. Atul Maheswari : Thank you. Good luck to the rest of the year. Bill Rhodes : Thank you very much. Jamere Jackson : Thanks. Bill Rhodes : Well, before we conclude\u2026 Operator : Your next question\u2026 Bill Rhodes : Sorry, I thought you were -- I will go ahead. Before we conclude the call, I want to take a moment to reiterate, we believe 2023 will continue to be a solid year for our industry and our business model is working. We must take nothing for granted as we understand our customers have alternatives to shopping with us. We have exciting plans that should help us succeed for the future, but I want to stress that this is a marathon and not a sprint. As we continue to focus on the basics and strive to optimize shareholder value for the future, we are confident AutoZone will continue to be successful. Thank you for participating in today\u2019s call. Have a great day. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

Bill Rhodes : Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for AutoZone's 2023 third quarter conference call. With me today are Jamere Jackson, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax. Regarding the third quarter, I hope you've had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not, the press release, along with slides complementing our comments today, are available on our website, www.autozone.com, under the Investor Relations link. Please click on Quarterly Earnings Conference Calls to see them. As we begin, I would like to thank our AutoZoners across the company for their commitment to providing our customers with WOW! Customer Service, which has been the secret to our long-term, consistent success. For the third quarter, our team delivered total sales growth of 5.8%, which included a 1.9% domestic same store sales comp. While our topline results were below our expectations at the start of the quarter, our sales improved later in the quarter as we experienced improved weather. We were pleased to deliver operating profit growth north of 9% and EPS growth of 17.5%. Both our operating profit and EPS growth were the highest growth rates we've had in over a year. As many retailers have reported, March was a tough month, as cool, wet weather impacted customer traffic. In addition, snow accumulations were down significantly in February and March for much of the country, which also had some impact on our business. We mentioned in our last call that weather, particularly during tax refund season, really matters. Unfortunately, it was unfavorable this year, as our results reflect. We also, after rapid growth and extensive market share gains in commercial, experienced some headwinds this quarter and our growth was disappointing to us. We were lapping tremendous growth last year and had some internal and external factors that impacted our growth this quarter. We have had some sectors of this business that had been extremely challenged with rising interest rates and high used car prices. Additionally, during our rapid growth over the last couple of years, we also unintentionally de-emphasized some of our tried and true disciplines. As I've said for the last six months or so, as we exit pandemic mode, we must get back to our well-known and highly regarded flawless execution, which I believe will help us reignite topline growth. We have good initiatives in flight in both our retail and commercial businesses, and we are determined to move with urgency to reaccelerate our sales and share growth. Fortunately, as this difference between our domestic same store sales growth and our total sales growth implies, our international team, particularly in Mexico, delivered very strong sales growth for the quarter. Our teams in Mexico and Brazil continue to do a great job, offering differentiated customer experiences, which is leading to strong sales growth. This morning, we will review our third quarter same store sales DIY versus DIFM trends, our sales cadence over the 12-week quarter, merchandise categories that drove our performance and some regional callouts. We'll also share how inflation is, in fact, impacting our cost in retails and how we think inflation will impact our business for the remainder of FY '23. Moving to the specifics for the quarter, domestic same store sales were up 1.9%; our net income was $648 million; and our earnings per share was $34.12, increasing 17.5%. On a two-year basis, we delivered a 4.5% domestic same store sales comp; and on a three-year basis, a 33.4% stacked comp. Our three-year stacked comp was in line with what we've seen in the last three quarters. Domestic retail sales were up 2.2%, and our domestic commercial growth was 6.3%. We continue to set commercial quarterly records, with $1.11 billion in sales, as we generated an additional $66 million in sales than in Q3 last year. On a trailing four-quarter basis, we delivered $4.54 billion in annual commercial sales, up a strong 14.4% over last year. We also set another Q3 record for average weekly sales per store at $16,800. As I've mentioned earlier, March was a bit of an outlier in the quarter's domestic sales results. We had a greater than 3% comp in February, but fell to a negative 1% in March, before recovering back to just under 4% in April and early May. On a regional basis, we experienced slower growth in the Northeastern and Midwestern markets than the rest of the country. This held true for both our DIY and commercial businesses. Our business on the West Coast was in line with our remaining markets. Average ticket grew 4% in retail and commercial for the quarter, decreasing 1% from last year. After the most significant product cost inflation we have seen in decades, we are seeing those trends moderate and are negotiating some cost reductions from our vendors, as both product cost and freight inflation are slowing or have subsided. Additionally, while not anywhere close to historical norms, we saw wage inflation moderate to approximately 4%. While the staffing environment has substantially improved versus this time last year, we don't envision wage inflation pulling back much from these levels, as there continues to be regulatory and market pressures. While we've had to manage through external forces, our focus continues to be on driving profitable market share growth, particularly in units and transactions. Our growth initiatives did just that this past quarter and included new store unit growth, improved satellite store availability, hub and mega hub openings, improvements in coverage, leveraging the strength of the Duralast brand, enhanced technology to make us easier to do business with and more efficient, reducing delivery times, enhancing our sales force effectiveness and living consistent with our pledge by being priced right for the value proposition we deliver. While our sales moderated this past quarter, we remain focused on growing our share over time and becoming the industry leader in both DIY and commercial. Digging deeper into our domestic DIY business this quarter, we delivered a 0.6% comp. As previously said, our ticket growth was up 4% versus last year and our transaction count trends were down 3%. From the data we have available, we continued to gain both dollar and unit share during the quarter. Our sales floor outperformed hard parts, with approximately a 3% difference between them. Our relative outperformance in sales floor categories is attributable to both discretionary categories improving and the hard parts categories slowing. It was encouraging to see our sales floor items performing so well. Specifically, batteries, oil, and wiper categories performed well and successfully lapped very strong performance last year. These categories have exceeded our expectations all year. Our friction category for both DIY and commercial performed below our expectations. We believe both our sales floor and hard parts businesses will continue to do well this summer, as we expect miles driven improvements, while our growth initiatives continue delivering strong results. Let me also address our pricing strategies. In Q3, we continued experiencing mid-single digit pricing inflation, in line with cost of goods. We believe both numbers will decrease in the fourth quarter, as we are lapping the onset of high inflation last year. To be clear, we do not believe inflation is going away, especially wage inflation, but expect it to slow as the economy slows. I want to highlight that our industry has been disciplined about pricing for decades, and we expect that to continue. Most of the parts and products we sell in this industry have low price elasticity, because purchases are driven by failure or routine maintenance. Historically, as costs have increased, the industry has increased pricing commensurately to maintain margin rates, increasing margin dollars. It is also notable that following periods of higher inflation, our industry has historically not meaningfully reduced pricing to reflect lower costs. We remain excited about our growth initiatives, our team's focus on execution, and the tremendous share gains we have achieved in both our retail and commercial businesses over the last few years. For our fourth quarter, we expect our sales performance to be led by our commercial business, as we execute on opening additional hub and mega hub stores, have an improving in-stock position, and improve customer service. We also believe our DIY business will remain resilient, as the difficult macro environment is pointing customers to continue maintaining their vehicles. We will, as always, be transparent about what we're seeing and provide color on our markets and performance as trends emerge. Before handing the call to Jamere, I'd like to reiterate our plan on continuing to grow our business in Mexico and Brazil, with almost 800 stores combined across these two markets. As previously noted, these businesses had impressive performance again this quarter and they should continue to be key contributors to sales and profit growth for decades to come. We are leveraging many of the learnings we have in the US to refine our offerings in Mexico and Brazil. In Brazil, in particular, we are targeting to expand our store footprint significantly and aggressively over the next five years. We continue to be excited about our growth prospects internationally. We are dedicated to growing our business in a disciplined and profitable manner well into the future and we know, with our AutoZoners leading the charge, we will continue to be successful. Now, I'll turn the call over to Jamere Jackson. Jamere? Jamere Jackson : Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As Bill mentioned, we had solid results for our third quarter. This quarter, we delivered a 1.9% domestic comp growth, a 9.3% increase in EBIT, and a 17.5% increase in EPS. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to elaborate on the specifics in our P&L for Q3. For the quarter, total sales were just under $4.1 billion, up 5.8%, reflecting continued strength in our industry, solid execution of our growth initiatives. Let me give a little more color on our growth initiatives, starting with our commercial business for the third quarter. Our domestic DIFM sales increased 6.3% to just over $1.1 billion and were up just over 32% on a two-year stack basis. Sales to our domestic DIFM customers represented 31% of our domestic auto part sales. Our weekly sales per program were $16,786, up 1.2%. We experienced growth across both our local customer base and national accounts, with local being the stronger of the two categories. Our results for the quarter set another record for highest weekly sales volume in the history of the chain at $92.5 million. I want to reiterate that our commercial business is strong and we believe we grew share despite a deceleration in our growth rates this quarter. We have a commercial program in approximately 88% of our domestic stores, which leverages our DIY infrastructure, and we're building our business with national, regional, and local accounts. This quarter, we opened 26 net new programs, finishing with 5,526 total programs. As expected, commercial growth continues to lead the way in FY '23, and we continue to focus on growing our business faster. Our strategy remains intact, as we continue to gain share in the industry. And as I have noted on past calls, our mega hub strategy is driving strong performance and positioning us for an even brighter future in our commercial and retail businesses. Once again, I'll add some color on our progress. We now have 85 mega hub locations, with four new ones opened in Q3. While I mentioned a moment ago, the commercial weekly sales per program average was roughly $16,800, the 84 mega hubs averaged significantly higher sales than the balance of the commercial footprint and continued to grow significantly faster than our overall commercial business in Q3. These assets are not only performing well individually, but the fulfillment capability for the surrounding AutoZone stores is giving our customers access to tens of thousands of additional parts and lifting the entire network for both DIY and commercial. This strategy is working. We will open 22 to 25 new mega hubs in FY '23, and we remain committed to our objective to reach 200 mega hubs, supplemented by 300 regular hubs. Many of you've heard me say that in the near term, our commercial business should grow double digits as far as the eye can see, and we maintain that conviction despite this quarter's results. We are significantly underpenetrated with a four to five share in an addressable market that is approaching $100 billion. The investments that we have made in our Duralast brand, expanding our coverage and assortment, adding more hubs and mega hubs, building technologies and improving our customer service continue to pay significant dividends and have a long runway. Nothing has changed in our views on what we can accomplish going forward, although we still have work to do to get back to this performance. Moving to our domestic retail business, we delivered a 0.6% comp in Q3. Like our domestic commercial business, retail has been resilient and we continue to grow share and deliver positive comp growth despite a dismal March. We exited the quarter much stronger and we're focused on execution in Q4. We saw a 4% ticket growth, as Bill mentioned, and we saw traffic down 3% from last year's levels. However, excluding the middle four weeks of the quarter, traffic was in line with last quarter, when we were down only 2%. This past quarter, we continued to gain unit and dollar share across the retail segment, a reflection of the relative strength of our business. Our DIY business has continued to strengthen competitively behind our growth initiatives. In addition, on a macro basis, the market is still experiencing a growing and aging car park, with both the new and used car markets posing significant challenges for our customers. We expect these markets to remain challenged for a longer period of time than we originally assumed, which should be a tailwind for DIY. These dynamics, growth initiatives, and macro car park tailwinds have driven a positive comp despite consumer discretionary spending pressure from overall inflation in the economy. We are forecasting a resilient DIY business for the remainder of 2023. Now, I'll say a few words regarding our international businesses. We continue to be pleased with the progress we're making in Mexico and Brazil. During the quarter, we opened six new stores in Mexico to finish with 713 stores and two new stores in Brazil, ending with 83. On a constant currency basis, we continue to accelerate our sales growth in both countries at higher growth rates than we saw in the overall business. We remain committed to our store opening schedules in both markets and expect both countries to be significant contributors to sales and earnings growth in the future. With just over 11% of our total store base currently outside the US and a commitment to continued expansion in a disciplined way, we are bullish on international growth and we're adding stores and supply chain capacity in Mexico to improve our competitive positioning. Now, let me spend a few minutes on the rest of the P&L and gross margins. For the quarter, our gross margin was up 56 basis points, including a $17 million LIFO credit, which drove 42 basis points of improvement. Excluding the LIFO benefit, our gross margin increase over last year's quarter was driven by higher merchandise margins, which more than offset a drag from the commercial business mix. With this quarter's LIFO gain, we have taken our remaining LIFO balance to $89 million. And as I mentioned over the last few quarters, hyperinflation and freight cost was the primary driver for the charges we took in the P&L. Freight costs have continued to abate over the past several months, and we expect this trend to continue and drive a similar LIFO benefit in the fourth quarter. As a reminder, we plan to take P&L gains only to the extent of the charges we have taken thus far and after we have taken P&L gains that fully reverse the charges that we've incurred, we expect to rebuild our unrecorded LIFO reserve balance, as we have done historically. Moving to operating expenses. Our expenses were up 5.5% versus last year's Q3, as SG&A levered 10 basis points versus last year. As we've said previously, we are committed to being disciplined on SG&A growth as we move forward, and we will continue to manage expenses in line with sales growth over time. Now, moving to the rest of the P&L. EBIT for the quarter was $858 million, up 9.3% versus the prior year's quarter. Excluding the $17 million LIFO credit, EBIT would have been up 7.1% over last year. Interest expense for the quarter was $74.3 million, up 77% from Q3 a year ago, as our debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $7.3 billion versus $6.1 billion at Q3-end last year. We are planning Interest expense in the $105 million area for the fourth quarter versus $64 million in last year's fourth quarter. Higher debt levels and higher borrowing rates, especially at the short end of the borrowing curve, are driving the increase in interest expense. For the quarter, our tax rate was 17.4%, below last year's third quarter rate of 20.3%. This quarter's rate benefited 595 basis points from stock options exercised, while last year's benefit was 284 basis points. For the fourth quarter, we suggest investors model us at approximately 23.4% before any assumption on credits due to stock option exercises. Moving to net income and EPS. Net income for the quarter was $648 million, up 9.3% versus last year's third quarter. Our diluted share count of 19 million was 7% lower than last year's third quarter. The combination of higher net income and lower share count drove earnings per share for the quarter to $34.12, up 17.5% versus a year ago. Excluding the LIFO credit, our net income would have increased 7.1% and our EPS growth would have been 15.2%. Now, let me talk about our free cash flow for Q3. For the third quarter, we generated $554 million in free cash flow versus $682 million a year ago. Year-to-date, we've generated just over $1.4 billion versus just over $1.6 billion a year ago. We expect to be an incredibly strong cash flow generator going forward, and we remain committed to returning meaningful amounts of cash to our shareholders. Regarding our balance sheet, our liquidity position remains very strong and our leverage ratios remain below our historic norms. Our inventory per store was up 4.3% versus Q3 last year, and total inventory increased 7.4%, driven primarily by inflation, our growth initiatives, and in-stock recoveries. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable on a per store basis, was a negative $215,000 versus negative $216,000 last year and negative $227,000 last quarter. As a result, accounts payable, as a percent of gross inventory, finished the quarter at 126.5% versus last year's Q3 of 127.9%. Lastly, I'll spend a moment on capital allocation and our share repurchase program. We repurchased $908 million of AutoZone stock in the quarter and at quarter-end, we had just under $850 million remaining under our share buyback authorization. Our strong earnings, balance sheet, and powerful free cash generated this year have allowed us to buy back 6% of the company's total shares outstanding since the start of the fiscal year. We remain committed to our disciplined capital allocation approach that enables us to invest in the business, while returning meaningful amounts of cash to shareholders. Our leverage ratio finished Q3 at 2.3 times EBITDAR, and we remain committed to return to the 2.5 times area. To wrap up, we continue to drive long-term shareholder value by investing in our growth initiatives, driving robust earnings and cash, and returning excess cash to our shareholders. We're growing our market share and improving our competitive positioning in a disciplined way. Our strategy continues to work. As we look forward to the remainder of our fiscal 2023, we're bullish on our growth prospects behind a resilient DIY business and growing commercial and international businesses. I continue to have tremendous confidence in our industry, our business, and the opportunity to drive long-term shareholder value. And now, I'll turn it back to Bill. Bill Rhodes : Thank you, Jamere. We are proud of the results our team delivered this past quarter. We remain on track to deliver a solid 2023. But we must continue to be focused on superior customer service and flawless execution. Execution and our culture of always putting the customer first are what define us. As Jamere said a moment ago, we continue to be bullish on our industry and, in particular, on our own opportunities for the remainder of the year. We will continue to invest in initiatives that drive an appropriate return on capital and we continue investing where our returns are the highest. This upcoming quarter will be very busy for us. We'll be opening over 100 stores in the Americas. We'll also remain focused on those initiatives that we have underway to grow sales in both our retail and commercial businesses. As we have mentioned previously, we are doubling down on execution and are focused on driving share gains. We know that investors will ultimately measure us by what our future cash flows look like three to five years from now, and we accept that challenge. I continue to be bullish on our industry and, in particular, on AutoZone and AutoZoners. Now we'd like to open up the call for questions. Operator : Thank you [Operator Instructions] Our first question this morning is coming from Bret Jordan from Jefferies. Please go ahead, Bret. Bret Jordan : Hi, good morning guys. Bill Rhodes : Hi Bret. Bret Jordan : Could you talk a little bit more about the internal factors that impacted growth? I think you said you'd deemphasized some internal disciplines in the prepared remarks. Could you maybe give us some more color there and maybe what the turnaround time on those disciplines might be? Bill Rhodes : Yes, it's a great question, Bret. Thank you for it - yes, I would - I want to make - be very careful how I say this. We unintentionally deemphasize some of the processes and procedures that we have in place, and that's not to be surprising. During the pandemic, we had to do a lot of things differently. And also in the commercial business, in particular, we were growing very, very rapidly. And we just got away from some of the process, procedures that we have in place. And we are going back to those and reemphasizing those. But to your point, that's not going to turn around in a day. It's going to turn around in months, not days or weeks. And we're working very diligently on it today. But - it's some simple things like periodic - how are we deploying our sales force, what our national account focus is? And just things like that, that we have very disciplined processes that just in the midst of the pandemic, we kind of turned our back on a little bit. Bret Jordan : Okay. And then a question on the Q4 outlook, just given the call out of the weather impact in March, if we go back to past years like '17 or maybe 2012, where real mild winter negatively impacted the early summer. Are you seeing any of that as we go into the fourth quarter or was it really just sort of a one quarter event with the weather? Bill Rhodes : I think that's a great question, too, Bret. And you're exactly right. We've seen it in the past. The one-time that's different this year is, we did have winter in December. So in 2017, we never had a winter. I also talked about that our brakes category has been a little bit softer. That can be a place where we see some lingering effects. I don't think it's going to be anywhere on the order of magnitude of what we saw in '17, but it might be a little bit softer. Bret Jordan : Okay, great. Thank you. Bill Rhodes : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Christopher Horvers from JPMorgan. Christopher, your line is life. Please go ahead. Christopher Horvers : Thanks, good morning everybody. Bill Rhodes : Good morning. Christopher Horvers : So a couple of questions on the top line, the rebound that you saw in April and May, can you talk about how DIY and Do-It-For-Me performed in that rebound? And Jamere, you talked about the low double-digit as far as the eye can see is your expectation that you can get back to that low double-digit pace in Do-It-For-Me in the fourth quarter? Bill Rhodes : Chris, I'm going to let Jamere answer that second part if you don't mind. It was his statement. I think he's ready for that, too and I am as well. I think - the businesses trended very similarly. I think one of the things that I also pointed out, it was not just that the weather was poor. The weather hit us at the worst time of the year for us during the all-important tax refund season. You all have seen tax refunds were down a little bit this year. But to us, the bigger implication was the weather was just pretty awful. It was cold and wet and mild during that period of time. And so, we saw both businesses trend down and they both have improved at some level, like I called out in the prepared remarks. Jamere? Jamere Jackson : Yes. So listen, as I said in my remarks, I mean, we're still committed to being a double-digit grower over time. We're underpenetrated; we have roughly a, four to five share and that gives us an opportunity to create a faster growing business. We're executing our growth playbook and that growth playbook, quite frankly, still has a lot of runway associated with it, and we saw significant share gains over the past three years. So things like improving the quality of our parts and our Duralast offerings, expanding our assortments with Mega-hubs, improving our delivery times, leveraging technology, the competitive pricing that we've done, all of those things still have a lot of legs associated with them. So when I think about what Bill talked about as it relates to execution, first, we believe that we grew share in commercial despite the growth rate deceleration. And secondly, we believe that those growth initiatives still have a lot of runway. And we have other initiatives in flight, as Bill mentioned, that we'll execute in Q4 and during FY '24 that we believe will accelerate growth. So nothing's changed in our strategy. Nothing has changed in our outlook as we move forward. Bill Rhodes : I don't think anything has changed in our commitment. We need to be a double-digit grower in commercial. And we weren't this quarter. Christopher Horvers : Got it. And then on the gross margin line, so - a two-part question. So as input and freight costs come down from your vendors, how are you thinking about maybe passing along some of that back to the consumer? Is that different from prior cycles? And then understandably, you're not - you're only going to get the LIFO back? But then ultimately, we get the turn of that inventory, and I know you're working hard to sort of leverage or increased scale with these vendors given the growth and Do-It-For-Me. So shouldn't we see have line of sight gross margin expansion beyond, just recapturing the LIFO headwinds? Bill Rhodes : Yes, I'll take the first part and turn it back to Jamere to talk about LIFO. As far as - first of all, we have not seen meaningful reductions in product costs at this point in time. We have seen meaningful reductions in freight cost. But if you recall, we did not even attempt to pass on all the freight costs to our customers, because we knew it was somewhat of an anomaly, and would reverse course at some order of magnitude. So as we are beginning to see some product costs reductions, I don't anticipate that we will reduce pricing as a result of those. And for one really strong reason, our wage inflation has been more than double what we've experienced in my 28 years here. We have to somehow get paid for that wage inflation, too, in the P&L. And so, if we get some reduction in product costs, I will anticipate that those will be used to offset some of that wage inflation. Jamere, you want to talk about LIFO? Jamere Jackson : Yes. So as I mentioned, we were up 56 basis points and 42 basis points of that was a LIFO tailwind. The remaining margin was driven by, as I said, merchandising margin actions, which more than offset the natural mix drag that we had from commercial. So as we continue to see those freight costs abate, we'll see those gains come back through to the P&L. And then as Bill said, what that means for us going forward is all of the things that we're working on in terms of merchandise margin actions will actually be accretive to the business, if you will, and we'll get back to our normal state of running the margin intensity playbook that we've run in the past. So, we feel pretty good about that. We've seen some inflation cool off in the supply chain. But as Bill said, the stickiest portion of that are wages and wages, we don't anticipate going down. So, there'll still be some cost pressures there. But it's good to actually be in a position to have some deflationary conversations, now versus where we were when we were in the heart of the pandemic when quite frankly, everything was moving with red arrows in terms of inflation. So, we think we have some opportunity there, and that should give us some margin tailwind as we move forward. Christopher Horvers : Thanks very much. Have a great rest of spring. Jamere Jackson : Yes, you too. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. Simeon, your line is live. Please go ahead. Simeon Gutman : Hi, good morning, everyone. Kind of a follow-up to the prior question. I wanted to ask what the commercial run rate looks like. It's going through some normalization. You both have said double-digit. I assume that's comp, not just total sales? And that's going to be at least two-x what the industry grows at in theory, if we take the historic run rate. So why is that, call it, high single, even low double why shouldn't that be the normalized run rate? Or - how else are you thinking about it, yes, so I'll leave it at that? Bill Rhodes : First of all, you said same-store I don't think we said same-store maybe Jamere did in his remarks. I just think, Simeon, we've got less than a 5% market share. We have over 15% in the retail business. We have a very fragmented industry in commercial with some competitors that, frankly, don't have a lot of the strengths that we have. I would anticipate us to grow meaningfully ahead of the market. And the market over long periods of time, you know DIFM is running 4%, 4.5%. So we - to me, growing double that, seems like it makes sense. Frankly, we didn't do it this quarter. We've got some work to do to reaccelerate our growth, but we also were celebrating some 25% and 27% growth over this period of time. The other thing that Jamere worked on is, we're not sitting here and sitting on our hands either. We're also working on - what are, the next generation of initiatives that we're going to deploy to make us provide better customer service for our commercial customers and be a better partner with them. I'm excited about some of the things that we're working on. They're not even in test yet. And as you know, we will go off and test them. But we're committed not to a quarter's growth rate in commercial. We're committed to being the largest player in the commercial business over the long run. Simeon Gutman : Yes. And my follow-up is, are you seeing anything with regard to price in terms of competitive posture? Is anything visible on the street? And then thinking about it yourself I know we talked about not engaging in it again, but it seems like the industry could go through another nice wave here with credit crunch and continued aging of the vehicle population? Bill Rhodes : Yes, great question. Yes. Have we seen things in the pricing environment in the commercial sector different than before? The answer is absolutely yes. One of our competitors well-advertised that they had changed their pricing posture. But I want to back up and I want to remind everybody, we did something similar about two years ago. And when we did it, first of all, we had tested it in six markets and then 14 markets before we rolled it to the other 40 some odd markets. We knew what was going to work. And it had nothing to do with our pricing posture versus our close-end competitors. It had everything to do with trying to optimize our value proposition versus the warehouse distributors who hold the vast majority of share in this industry. As we've seen a competitor move their pricing, we see no indications that, that competitor has - is lower than us on pricing. I think that they seem to have reduced that gap similar to what we did. We don't have perfect visibility to it, but that's what we're seeing at this point in time. Jamere Jackson : And the other thing I'll remind you, just in terms of our initiatives, pricing was a leg of the stool, if you will. And pricing is a pretty dynamic environment. And what we've always said is we're going to be priced right in the marketplace. So if indeed, there was some action there that suggested we needed to go to something, we would certainly do that to continue on this journey, as Bill mentioned before, of growing our market share and growing our gross margin dollars. That's been a winning playbook for us. Simeon Gutman : Thank you both. Bill Rhodes : Yes, thank you Simeon. Operator : Your next question is coming from Zach Fadem from Wells Fargo. Zach, your line is live. Please go ahead. Zach Fadem : Hi, good morning, and thank you. Is there a way to size up the impact of internal factors versus external factors on the comp this quarter? And as you think about all the moving parts around tax refunds and weather and perhaps some deferred maintenance from a gradually slowing consumer, to what extent do you view these Q3 headwinds as a one-off or transitory versus the beginning of perhaps a bigger change in trend for the industry? Bill Rhodes : I don't necessarily know that the industry changed. We'll have to see as we get more visibility to what happened across the industry. Certainly, our results changed. I can't go through and parse it piece-by-piece clearly, the weather implications from March or an anomaly that should not repeat themselves. I don't anticipate in the summer-time, they're using not a lot of weather impacts in the summer or fall. They generally have more pronounced in winter and spring, when the weather is more volatile. I think some of these internal things that we're talking about, as I said a minute ago, they're going to take us a little time, because we can start doing the processes again. But the ramifications and the outcomes that come along with those processes and as I said, they're going to take months, but we'll get there. Again, we're playing for the long game. Zach Fadem : Got you. And then on your SG&A per store, it stepped back down to that 2.5% range. To what extent was this planned versus a pivot from slowing sales? And then as we look forward, is it fair to say that we've now returned to a more normalized lower single-digit run rate from here or would you expect it to step back up as sales perhaps recover? Jamere Jackson : Well, I think what we've said historically is we've been very disciplined on SG&A growth, and we've grown SG&A sort of in line with the top line. And you saw this quarter that as sales were a little bit lighter, we were able to deliver upon that. But what I'll also reiterate is that we're going to invest in SG&A in a disciplined way for the things that we need to do to create a faster growing business. One of the areas that I've talked about in the past is the investments that we're making in IT, for example, to improve our speed, to improve our productivity, to improve the way that we're doing business in our stores and improve the experience that our customers have with us. And so to the extent that we need to lean in and invest a little bit more in SG&A to deliver upon that, we will. But this is a business that has been very, very disciplined about managing the SG&A line. And when we need to manage it to deliver a certain result, we'll do that, but we're not going to do that at the expense of our growth initiatives. Zach Fadem : Got it, appreciate the time guys. Bill Rhodes : Yes, thank you, Zach. Operator : Your next question is coming from Steven Forbes from Guggenheim Securities. Steven, your line is live. Please go ahead. Steven Forbes : Good morning. Bill Rhodes : Good morning. Steven Forbes : I wanted to focus on the domestic Mega-hub initiative. So can you first just confirm the year-end target? I think you said '22 to '25 new Mega-hubs versus seven year-to-date. But I just want confirmation on that? And then, can you speak to any bottlenecks or limitations that would potentially prevent a more accelerated ramp in 2024 and beyond or just any comment on how the Mega-hub real estate pipeline looks today? Jamere Jackson : Yes, we've talked about our growth initiatives still having a lot of runways. And quite frankly, the Mega-hub is one of those. Candidly, Bill talked about execution. We would like to open more, and we would like to open them sooner. And this is a matter of execution versus a macro or competitive issue. So we've got a big quarter plan for Q4. And the teams are working on all the things that we need to work on from site identification to streamlining our processes to get more open faster. But this very clearly is an execution point. I want store development inside our company. And when we talk about places where we need to exit pandemic mode and have better execution, this is certainly one of them. Steven Forbes : And then maybe just a follow-up, staying on the footprint opportunities, you talked about international, but curious maybe if you could expand on how you sort of expect the footprint in both Brazil and Mexico to grow over the coming years? And then you also mentioned ROIC, so curious if you could just update us on how the return profile of the international location compares to the company average today? Bill Rhodes : Sure. So in Mexico, excluding the pandemic, we've opened 40 stores a year for a very long period of time. We didn't open as many in the pandemic. Our team down there owes us a few of those openings. So hopefully, we will grow at a little bit faster rate on a store count basis in Mexico going forward. A little over a year ago, we defined our test in Brazil as over and made Brazil a part of our ongoing strategic growth plan. And so, they are now moving forward very rapidly. We're going to open 20 some odd stores this fiscal year and hopefully, we'll grow from there. So, it will become a bigger and bigger part of our organic - sorry, of our organic growth. On Brazil, the ROIC is negative. We've said it several times as - until we get to scale, some level of scale, we are continuing to lose money in Brazil because of the overhead infrastructure and warehouse and delivery infrastructure. We clearly see - a line of sight to profitability, and we see a line of sight to good returns. In Mexico, our returns are better than they are in the United States. It's been a very good performing market for us for 25 years now. And the most exciting part is as we get further and further in the growth spectrum, we see more and more growth in front of us in Mexico. So, we don't see any slowing down anytime soon. Steven Forbes : Thank you. Bill Rhodes : Yes, thank you. Operator : Your next question is coming from Scot Ciccarelli from Truist Securities. Scot, your line is live. Please go ahead. Scot Ciccarelli : Good morning guys. It makes sense that some of these execution issues can't be fixed in days or weeks, but it would also imply that they've been going on for a while. So I guess my question is like why would the slowdown show up so starkly this quarter? I guess I would have expected more of a trend line rather than a step function change in, let's call it stack growth trends? Thanks. Bill Rhodes : I think it's a fair question. And I want to be careful and not to say that all of this was due to those processes. I think that that's an element. We talked about weather. And there's, other things that are happening in the marketplace. So, I don't want to pin at all on that. And you're right. Those things have been going on for probably a year to two years. They're just going to take some - it's not putting those processes back in place. It's going to change it. It's the outcomes that come along with those processes weeks and months later. Jamere Jackson : Yes. And I think what you're hearing from our tone here is that, number one, we believe that the industry is healthy, and they're very healthy industry dynamics. Number two, we're continuing to grow share, but we have set a very ambitious goal to grow our business faster, particularly in commercial, where we said our business should grow double-digits. And as we look at the path forward, while we don't see an immediate snap back to that potentially. We think all the growth initiatives that we have in place, all the new things that we have in flight, give us a lot of confidence that we'll be able to go do that. So these are not things to Bill's point, where we're saying - we're pinning everything on some macro issue or pinning everything on execution. But we control our own destiny and the things that we've talked about from an execution standpoint, are things that will help us drive better performance as we move forward. Bill Rhodes : And the only thing I'd add further, we're playing the long game. Yes, we're disappointed with a 6% growth. That's not going to deter us. With in fact it makes us hungrier and work harder, so we're looking at this over the very long-term. Scot Ciccarelli : That's helpful. And then just a quickie, hopefully, how big of a sales gap in sales performance did you see in different markets that may help us better kind of gauge the impact of weather in the quarter? Thanks guys. Jamere Jackson : Yes. I mean, we saw mixed results. We talked a little bit about - the comments about the Northeast and the Midwest that clearly where we underperformed and those are markets that, quite frankly, if we get some decent weather here over the next quarter or so, we could see that rebound and produce a better result. But those are probably two areas regionally where we saw slightly lower performance than we saw across the rest of the chain. Scot Ciccarelli : Thank you. Bill Rhodes : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is coming from Michael Lasser from UBS. Michael, your line is live. Please go ahead. Michael Lasser : Good morning, thank you all for taking my question. So Rhodes, your commercial business decelerated at the same time there was a meaningful acceleration in the performance of the commercial businesses of one of your peers. What does that tell you about structural limitation in terms of your commercial business's ability to gain market share? Bill Rhodes : It's an interesting way to put it, Michael. Yes, I'll be crystal clear. That is not lost on us what you just pointed out. I'll also point out that, as I mentioned in the pricing discussion, they embarked on a - pivot in their strategy a little over a year ago and not dissimilar to what happened to us two years ago was they changed their competitiveness versus other sets of customers - competitors in the marketplace. And obviously, that strategy has worked. And it - so happened to coincide with the slowdown for us. I don't necessarily pin those two things together. Jamere Jackson : From my vantage point, Michael, I mean, again, as we've said before, they grew share, and those results were very impressive, but we also grew share as well. And our focus, again, is on how do we grow faster and win even larger shares than what we've grown over the past quarter or so. And that focus hasn't changed. Michael Lasser : And a follow-up on your prior statement, Jamere, in order to get back to the double-digit growth for your commercial business, does that mean even to see an improvement in sales per existing customers or an increase in your total customer count to get to that level? Jamere Jackson : Well, we clearly, as we've talked about, we're a four or five share in what's approaching a $100 billion market. So - and that opportunity for us is to grow our share of wallet with our existing customers. And it's also to grow new business both in national and with locals are up and down the street as we affectionately call them in-house. And we believe that opportunity is still in front of us. So, as we look at our commercial business going forward, what gives us a tremendous amount of confidence, the things that we put in place have worked. We know that we have some things that are in flight today that are very, very promising that we're launching in Q4 and over the next year or so. And we think those things are going to pay dividends for us as well, but it's clearly an opportunity for us to go deeper in the wallets of our existing customers and grow new customers at the same time. Michael Lasser : Thanks very much. Bill Rhodes : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is coming from David Bellinger from ROTH MKM. David, your line is live. Please go ahead. David Bellinger : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. So if we look back at this quarter, 3% comp in February, close to 4% in April and May as you move past some of these weather and tax refund fluctuations. So is that a good sustainable run rate to think about for comp sales growth from here and as you hold on to price and continue to make these underlying investments in the business? Bill Rhodes : As you know, David, we \"don't give guidance\" but we pointed out and called out March as the anomaly. So your supposition is generally in line with that thinking. David Bellinger : Got it. And then - just a follow-up on your prepared remarks, you talked about the sales floor and some discretionary categories, believe improving, I believe, is what you said. So that seems that odds with some of the other retailer comments out there. So anything to read into that, is there more of a trade-down benefit behind it? And maybe a positive for those types of categories, if we see more indications of just a broader spending slowdown, just how do you think about those specific categories? Bill Rhodes : Yes. If you recall, the categories that I called out were not necessarily discretionary. They're sales floor categories, but batteries, oil and wipers, none of those are discretionary. I don't think we've seen a big rebound in our discretionary business, except we've seen it a little bit improved at times as we've gotten back into in-stock. Those are some places we didn't have the in-stock levels that we would have liked. But generally, the places where we've seen the sales floor recover were more maintenance-oriented categories. David Bellinger : Great, thank you. Bill Rhodes : Yes, thank you. Operator : Your next question is coming from Greg Melich from Evercore ISI. Greg, your line is live. Please go ahead. Greg Melich : Thanks. My first question is on inflation. Thanks for giving us the ticket up 4% and traffic down 2% for the company. Was it fair to say that inflation might be up six and that the difference might be items of basket or trade down or mix if we look at average ticket? Jamere Jackson : Yes, that's the right ZIP code. We saw inflation up kind of in the mid-single digit-ish range, if you will. And then there's, always things in the basket and mix that can cause you to have a slightly different ticket print than that. Bill Rhodes : Greg, I'd also like to remind you that historically for a long time, this industry has a trajectory that has pressure on customer count and growth in average ticket, because of the technological innovations that are happening in components on a vehicle. So, we've seen our ticket growth 3%, 3.5%, 4% basically since I've been in this business with generally a drag on transaction counts. So the gap between where we are today and where we are historically is closed considerably. Greg Melich : Got it. And then my second question is, you went through weather and geographies. Is there any difference on how the more urban or densely populated stores are performing versus rural? I'm just thinking that's one thing we've seen from de-densification over COVID and with shrink, particularly impacting some retailers, a lot of retailers. Bill Rhodes : I think shrink would be a different story than sales. We don't see any big significant difference in our sales trajectory in rural versus urban environments. Clearly, it's a tough environment out there on the shrink front. Our team is managing shrink okay. We have some trends that are a little bit worse than what they have been, and we're focused on that. But as you know, a lot of retailers are talking about organized retail crime and it's a real problem. Fortunately for us, there are a lot of times focused on more consumable items, which are not necessarily available in an AutoZone store. Greg Melich : And in certain areas, you haven't like chain store hours to sort of either protect employees or anything you have to go to that extreme? Bill Rhodes : Absolutely not, no we do put guards in certain stores to make sure that we do control the environment. Greg Melich : Right thanks, and good luck. Bill Rhodes : Yes, thank you. Jamere Jackson : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our final question this morning is coming from Steven Zaccone from Citi. Steven, your line is live. Please go ahead. Steven Zaccone : Great, good morning, everyone thank you for squeezing me in. I wanted to ask on pricing. If we think about mid-single digits in the third quarter, what will it be in the fourth quarter? And as we look to next year, would you still expect it to be a slight tailwind to comps or could it, in fact, be flattish? Jamere Jackson : We expect the fourth quarter to be generally in the same ZIP code as what we saw in Q3. And then as we look to next year, there are several things that are at play here. But the ones that I think you ought to spend the most time thinking about as you're looking to correlate that to what you see in pricing is what we've talked about in the wage environment where wages are still stubbornly high. Let's call it, in the 4% to 5%-ish kind of ZIP code. And I think that sort of translates to at a minimum, what you see - you ought to see from a pricing environment. And there are puts and takes, obviously, from pricing. As Bill mentioned, there will be some categories where we'll see some deflation, some that will see some inflation. But generally speaking, we're fading more to the historical norms than we have in the past. Steven Zaccone : Okay, great, thank you. And then I hate to go back to commercial, but I did want to clarify something and just given your commentary about some of these internal factors, is it fair to think the time line to return to double-digit commercial growth may take a couple quarters? Anything you can say on the time line would be helpful for us as we assess our models? Bill Rhodes : Yes, I think we'll stick with what we've already said. This is not going to turn around in the weeks. It's going to take months. Is that four? Is that eight? I don't know until we get into it. Steven Zaccone : Thank you. Bill Rhodes : Yes, thank you very much. Okay. Before we conclude the call, I want to take a moment to reiterate we believe 2023 will continue to be a solid year for our industry, and our business model is working. We must take nothing for granted as we understand our customers have alternatives to shopping with us. We have exciting plans that should help us continue to succeed, but I want to stress that this is a marathon and not a sprint. As we continue to focus on the basics and strive to optimize shareholder value, we are confident AutoZone will continue to be successful. Lastly, as we celebrate Memorial Day next Monday, we should all remember our countries, heroes both past and present. We owe these Americans a tremendous debt of gratitude. Thank you for participating in today's call. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's conference call. You may disconnect your phone lines at this time, and have a wonderful day. Thank you once again for your participation.",

Operator : It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mr. Bill Rhodes, CEO, Chairman and President. Sir, the floor is yours. Bill Rhodes : Good morning. And thank you for joining us today for AutoZone's 2023 fourth quarter conference call. With me today are Phil Danielle, our CEO-Elect; Jamere Jackson, Chief Financial Officer and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax.  Regarding the fourth quarter, hope you've had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not, the press release, along with slides complementing our comments today are available on our website, www.autozone.com, under the investor relations link. Please click on quarterly earnings conference calls to see them. As we begin, we want to thank our AutoZoners for their incredible contributions during fiscal 2023 that resulted in our solid performance. As our pledge states they continued putting our customers first, which resulted in total sales growth of 7.4% for the fiscal year, while earnings per share increased 12.9%. It's important to remember that these results build on the phenomenal three year performance from the pandemic years of 2020 to 2022.  Candidly, Phil, Jamere, Tom Newbern, and I felt at some point we would see our sales per store migrate closer to pre-pandemic levels. That hasn't happened. And at this stage, we do not expect it will. To put it in perspective, our domestic average weekly sales per store are 33% higher than in 2019, growing from $35,600 a week to $47,300 a week. This level of growth and sales also drove enormous growth in operating profit, where this year's $3.474 billion was 61% above 2019, when adjusted for the 2,019, 53 week. That is remarkable growth, especially for a 44-year old enterprise. We could not have achieved this success without exceptional efforts across the entire organization.  We have several updates for you this morning. First, I'm sure you've noticed the new table in our press release. We are now presenting our same store sales results for domestic, international and total company. We're also reporting our international same store sales, which includes both Mexico and Brazil, on both an actual and constant currency basis.  Why the change? The answer is International is becoming a larger and larger part of our business, and we are investing a sizable amount of our growth capital in those countries. As we evaluate important growth metrics, we think it is important to assess it in total. As we know this is a change we are committed to providing you with each component individually for at least five quarters, as our objective is to enhance your visibility.  Next, our domestic same store sales were 1.7% this quarter compared to 1.9% last quarter, and about half of our fiscal 2023 growth of 3.1%. Our performance in retail was respectable and generally in line with our expectations. But as was well documented last quarter, our commercial sales performance in the second half of our fiscal year declined meaningfully and to us unacceptably. We ended with 3.9% growth in domestic commercial sales. Our performance in both retail and commercial in the first half of the quarter was disappointing, but during this period we experienced very mild weather. As we reached the second half of the quarter, and temperatures escalated materially, so did our sales. Specifically for the first eight weeks of the quarter our retail comps were flat, but increased 3.4% in the second half. Commercial experienced a similar trajectory, ending particularly strong in the last four weeks of the quarter, up over 7%.  Regarding regional results, we saw a material performance gap between the Northeast and Midwestern markets versus the rest of the country. The total comp difference was well over 300 basis points and over 450 basis points for commercial. We attribute this to the lack of winter weather and snowfall in the latter part of last winter in that region. This has led to lower growth trends in undercar categories. Both those are things that \"happened to us, not what we did to enhance and improve our performance.\"  Last quarter, we highlighted that we were not executing at our peak levels. We have made many changes since then, and are pleased with the improvements in execution we are seeing. We aren't there yet. But we're on a really good path. We also recently completed another strategic review of our commercial business. We have validated our direction and have some exciting new enhancements that we will be testing over the next few quarters. We also made significant improvements in the information technology that we use to operate our commercial business, and we opened many more commercial programs, reaching 90% domestic penetration for the first time in our history. Even more encouraging is how strong those new openings are starting and how many -- many weeks -- or they're just a few weeks old. Ultimately we will operate in a favorable and unfavorable macro and weather environment. We want to share our perspectives with you so you can understand our performance. But ultimately, it is our actions that will determine our long term success. And we're encouraged by the actions we're taking. Finally, our strategy supporting our store operations and commercial teams includes several other key elements. Global new store growth, where we disappointingly didn't achieve our goals in FY23, more on that later; continued growth with our hubs and in particular, mega hubs, where we are nearing the halfway point of our ultimate goal of having 200 mega hubs and 300 hubs.  It's important to reinforce the continued, very strong performance of these stores, especially the mega hubs, and particularly in commercial; reconfiguring our global supply chain to efficiently process the enhanced sales we have achieved and expect to achieve over the next decade, while optimizing our processes for handling more direct import products from many countries, and more challenging slow turning parts assortments that are critical to our success; and finally continuing to lean in hard on technology improvements to make our AutoZoners more knowledgeable, efficient and effective.  I've given you the high level sound bites on the quarter's results. Now I'd like to introduce Phil Daniele to give more in-depth color on the quarter. Phil? Philip Daniele : Thanks, Bill. And good morning, everyone. I'm honored to be participating in my first earnings release conference call.  I will start by reviewing our Q4 overall same store sales, DIY versus DIFM trends, our sales cadence over the 16 weeks of the quarter, and merchandise categories that drove our performance as well as any regional disparities. We will also share how inflation is affecting our costs and retails and how we think inflation will impact our business in FY24. Our domestic same store sales were 1.7% this quarter, on top of last year's exceptionally strong 6.2% growth. I do want to reiterate what Bill said a moment ago, our execution improved materially over the quarter. And that execution, which is a hallmark of our success will ultimately deliver better results as we move forward. Our domestic commercial business grew 3.9%. Despite lower than anticipated, we believe we grew share and set another fourth quarter record with $1.5 billion in sales. For the full year, we generated nearly $4.6 billion up 8.7% from last year. Domestic commercial sales represented 30% of our domestic auto parts sales, which is identical to last year. Our commercial sales growth continues to be driven by the key initiatives we have been working on for the last several years, improved satellite store availability, material improvements and hub and mega hub coverage, in addition to aggressive growth in the number of those types of stores.  We continue to strengthen the Duralast brand with an intense focus on high quality products. And we continue to deliver technological enhancements to make us easier to do business with. We are also operating more efficiently with improvements in delivery time and enhanced sales force effectiveness. In Q4, we opened 156 net new commercial programs, opening the majority of them late in the quarter, which had minimal impact on sales, but positions us well for FY24 and beyond.  With these moves, we now have commercial in over 90% of our domestic stores. We continue to see tremendous opportunity for commercial sales growth in FY24 and beyond. We're also very proud of our performance in domestic DIY. We had a positive 1.4% comp this quarter on top of last year's comp of 1.1%. Additionally for the year, we delivered 1.8% DIY on top of a 2.9% DIY comp last fiscal year, and 11.2% comp in FY21. These results are very solid considering the outsized growth we saw during the pandemic.  The fact that we continue to retain the vast majority of the share we built during the pandemic, and our recent performance gives us continued conviction about the sustainability into FY24.  Now let's focus on the sales cadence. Over the quarter, which spanned 16 weeks, early May through the end of August, as Bill mentioned, our same store sales were flat over the first weeks, but increased to 3.4% over the last eight weeks. We were encouraged by the trends we saw as the quarter ended.  Regarding weather, in May and June we experienced cooler and wetter weather trends across the country which negatively impacted our sales trends. By July however, it became very hot across much of the country, and it remained very hot through August. The heat and the associated rebound in sales helped us partially overcome a relatively mild winter, particularly in the Midwest and the Northeast, where weather sensitive hard part categories underperformed our expectation. We anticipate that the summer heat will give us some positive momentum as we head into fall. As a reminder, historically extreme weather, either hot or cold drives parts failures and accelerated maintenance.  Regarding the quarter's traffic versus ticket growth, in retail, our traffic was down 0.8% while our ticket was up 2%. Our transaction count improved as the quarter went along, and in fact, turned positive over the last eight weeks of the quarter. However, the average ticket being up only 2% was the weakest quarterly increase we've seen since FY 2000, as we lapped significantly higher inflation a year ago, where the ticket was up 8%. Regarding commercial trends, we continue to see traffic and ticket growth, but our commercial ticket growth, just like retail, has shown a marked deceleration compared to recent history as hyperinflation begins to abate. For perspective, our ticket growth was 11% in Q4 last year, versus roughly 2% this year. As expected, some of our commercial customers are experiencing trade down and lower car count as the consumer comes under economic pressure.  In order to continue to grow our comps in '24 we will have to continue to increase share of wallet with our customers. The share data we see continues to encourage us that we are gaining share in the industry despite the macro trends, but recently, not in line with our aspirations, which we intend to change. During the quarter there were some geographic regions that did perform differently than others as there always are. This quarter we saw a material 315 basis point difference between the Northeast and the Midwest compared to the balance of the country, with the Northeast and the Midwest performing lower.  As the Northeast in the Midwest experienced a very mild, mild winter, with below average snowfall, we've seen less weather sensitive hard parts in this part of the country. Headed into the first quarter of the new fiscal year, we are not anticipating that weather will have a significant impact on sales.  Regarding our merchandise categories in the retail business, our sales floor categories outperformed our hard part categories. And our hard part business was essentially flat for the quarter. As I said previously, weather sensitive hard parts were clearly impacted by the milder winter weather, particularly in the Midwest and the Northeast.  Let me also address inflation in pricing. This quarter, we saw low single-digit inflation and as a result, our ticket average was up roughly 2%. We believe inflation for the first quarter will be similar to the fourth quarter as the industry is migrating back to pre-pandemic inflation levels and lapping high inflation from a year ago. I want to reiterate that our industry has been very disciplined about pricing for decades, and we expect that to continue.  Historically, as costs have increased the industry has increased pricing commensurately to maintain margins. It is also notable that following periods of higher inflation, our industry historically has not reduced pricing to reflect lower cost and we believe we have entered one of those periods. For the first quarter of 2024 we expect our DIY sales to be resilient and our commercial trends to improve. We will, as always, be transparent about what we are seeing and provide color on our markets and outlook as trends emerge. Before handing the call to Jamere, I'd like to highlight and give some color on a few of our key business priorities for the new fiscal year. First, we continue to focus on our supply chain with two initiatives that are in flight to drive improved availability. One is our expanded hub and mega hub rollouts. And secondly, we are making good progress on transforming our supply chain. Our strategy is focused on leveraging the entire network to carry more inventory closer to the customer to drive sales growth with speed to customer and expanded availability. Additionally, we plan on continuing to grow our Mexican and Brazilian businesses. With 804 stores open internationally or 12% of our store base these businesses had impressive performance last fiscal year and should continue to grow in 2024. We are leveraging many of the learnings we have in the U.S. to refine our offerings in Mexico and Brazil.  Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jamere Jackson. Jamere Jackson : Thanks, Phil. And good morning everyone. As both Bill and Phil had previously discussed we had a solid fourth quarter, stacked on top of an impressive fourth quarter last year. 6.4% total company sales growth, 1.7% domestic comp, a 14.9% international comp on a constant currency basis, a 10.8% increase in EBIT, and a 14.7% increase in EPS. In addition, our results for the entire fiscal year were very strong as total sales grew 7.4% and EPS grew 12.9%. We continue to deliver great results and the efforts of our AutoZoners in our stores and distribution centers have continued to enable us to grow our business and our earnings in a meaningful way.  To start this morning, let me take a few minutes to elaborate on the specifics in our P&L for Q4. For the quarter total sales were just under $5.7 billion, up 6.4%. For the year our total sales were $17.5 billion, up 7.4% versus last fiscal year. I continue to marvel at the strength of our business since FY19. Our sales are up an amazing 47% or nearly $5.6 billion since 2019.  Let me give a little more color on sales and our growth initiatives starting with our domestic commercial business. For the fourth quarter our domestic DIFM sales increased 3.9% to $1.5 billion and up 25.9% on a two year stack basis. Sales to our domestic DIFM customers represented 26% of our total company sales and 30% of our domestic auto parts sales.  Our average weekly sales per program were approximately $16,700, down 1.8%. Now it's important to point out that our sales per program productivity was impacted materially by the late in quarter openings of approximately 120 new programs. While these openings depressed the point in time productivity metric, we're encouraged by the growth prospects of these programs and their early contribution to our commercial business. These openings are part of our efforts to open more stores with commercial in response to the tremendous opportunity to grow our market share.  Our commercial acceleration initiatives are delivering the expected results, as we grow share by winning new business, and increasing our share of wallet with existing customers. We now have our commercial program and approximately 90% of our domestic stores, which leverages our DIY infrastructure. And we're building our business with national, regional and local accounts. This quarter we opened 156 net new programs, finishing with 5,682 total programs. As I've said since the outset of the year, commercial growth led the way in FY23, and we feel good about our prospects heading into the New Year.  For FY23, our commercial sales were $4.6 billion, up 8.7% versus last year, and up 37% from two years ago. Importantly, we have a lot of runway in front of us, and we expect to deliver on our goal of becoming a faster growing business. To support our commercial growth we now have 98 mega hub locations with 13 new stores opened in Q4. While I mentioned a moment ago, the commercial weekly sales per program average was $16,700 per program, the 98 mega hubs averaged significantly higher sales and are growing much faster than the balance of the commercial footprint. In fact, our commercial mega hub business grew twice as fast as our overall commercial business in Q4.  As a reminder, our mega hubs typically carry over 100,000 SKUs and drive tremendous sales lift inside the store box as well as serve as an expanded assortment source for other stores. The expansion of coverage and parts availability continues to deliver a meaningful sales lift to both our commercial and DIY business. These assets are performing well individually, and the fulfillment capability for the surrounding AutoZone stores is giving our customers access to thousands of additional parts and lifting the entire network.  We have an objective to reach 200 mega hubs supplemented by 300 regular hubs in the near term. Our AutoZoners and our customers are excited and we're determined to build on our strong momentum.  On the domestic retail side of our business, our DIY comp was up 1.4% for the quarter. For FY23 our DIY crop grew 1.8% and 4.7% on a two year stack basis. The business continues to be remarkably resilient as we've managed to deliver positive comp growth through the cycle. As Bill mentioned, we saw traffic down slightly and 2% ticket growth. As we move forward, we would expect to see slightly declining traffic counts offset by low to mid-single digit ticket growth, in line with the long term historical trends for the business driven by changes in technology and the durability of new parts.  Importantly, our DIY business has continued to strengthen competitively behind our growth initiatives. In addition, the market is experiencing a growing and ageing car part and a challenging new and used car sales market for our customers which continues to provide a tailwind for our business. These dynamics, ticket growth, growth initiatives and macro car part tailwind have driven a positive comp. We're forecasting a consistent and resilient DIY business environment for FY24.  Now I'll say a few words regarding our international business. As you may have noticed, we changed our disclosure on our international business, and we will continue to do so going forward. With 12% of our total store base outside of the U.S., the current revenue contribution and the growth prospects moving forward, we simply have to share more about international. We continue to be pleased with the progress we're making in Mexico and Brazil. During the quarter, we opened 27 new stores in Mexico to finish with 740 stores, and 17 new stores in Brazil ending with 100.  Our same store sales grew 34.1% on a reported basis and 14.9% on a constant currency basis. We remain committed to Mexico and Brazil, and given our success in these markets, we will accelerate the store opening pace going forward. By 2028, after a robust strategic review of the market and ultimate store comp potential, we revised our strategy and anticipate opening as many as 200 stores annually in these markets in a disciplined fashion, making this an attractive and meaningful contributor to AutoZone's future growth. Now let me spend a few minutes on the rest of the P&L and gross margin. For the quarter our gross margin was 52.7%, up 118 basis points, driven primarily by a non-cash $30 million LIFO. credit this quarter. For Q4 last year, we had a $15 million LIFO charge. Excluding LIFO from both years, we had a 37 basis point improvement in gross margin. I will point out that we now have $59 million in LIFO charges yet to be reversed through our P&L and we expect these to largely reverse over FY24. We're currently modeling $15 million in LIFO credits in Q1 as inflation continues to abate, and we turn our inventory. And as I've said previously, once we credit back the $59 million through the P&L, we will not take any more credits and we will begin to rebuild our unrecorded LIFO reserve.  Moving to operating expenses, our expenses were up 7.6% versus last year's Q4 as SG&A as a percentage of sales deleveraged 34 basis points. The accelerated growth in SG&A has been purposeful as we continue to invest in an accelerated pace in IT and payroll to underpin our growth initiatives. These investments will pay dividends in customer experience, speed and productivity. We are committed to being disciplined on SG&A growth as we move forward, and we will manage expenses in line with sales growth over time.  Moving to the rest of the P&L, EBIT for the quarter was $1.2 billion, up 10.8% versus the prior year, driven by our positive same store sales growth and gross margin improvements including the LIFO year-over-year benefit. EBIT for FY23 was just under $3.5 billion up 6.2% versus the prior year, also driven by strong top line growth. Interest expense for the quarter was $108.7 million, up 70% from Q4 a year ago as our debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $7.7 billion versus $6.1 billion at Q4 and last year. We're planning interest in the $88 million range for the first quarter of FY24 versus $57.7 million in this past year's first quarter. Higher debt levels and borrowing rates across the curve are driving this increase. For the quarter, our tax rate was 22.4% and up from last year's fourth quarter of 22.1%. This quarter's rate benefited 22 basis points from stock options exercised while last year had benefited 70 basis points. For the first quarter of FY24 we suggest investors model us at approximately 23.4% before any assumption on credits due to stock option exercises. Moving to net income and EPS, net income for the quarter was $865 million, up 6.8% versus last year. Our diluted share count of 18.6 million was 6.9% lower than last year's fourth quarter. The combination of higher net income and lower share count drove earnings per share for the quarter to $46.46, up 14.7% for the quarter. For FY23 net income was $2.5 million, up 4.1% and earnings per share was $132.36, up 12.9%.  Now let me talk about our free cash flow for Q4. For the fourth quarter we generated $1.1 billion of operating cash and $701 million in free cash flow. For the year we generated $2.1 billion in free cash. We expect to continue being an incredibly strong cash flow generator going forward, and we remain committed to returning meaningful amounts of cash to our shareholders.  Regarding our balance sheet, our liquidity position remains very strong. And our leverage ratios remain below our historic norms. Our inventory per store was down 0.6% versus Q4 last year while total inventory increased 2.2% over the same period last year driven by new store growth. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventory less accounts payable on a per store basis was a negative $201,000 versus negative $240,000 last year, and negative $215,000 last quarter. As a result, accounts payable, as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 124.9% versus last year's Q4 of 129.5%.  Lastly, I'll spend a moment on capital allocation and our share repurchase program. We repurchased $1 billion of AutoZone stock in the quarter, and at quarter end we had just over $1.8 billion remaining under our share buyback authorization. The strong earnings, balance sheet and powerful free cash we generated this year has allowed us to buy back 8% of the shares outstanding since the beginning of the fiscal year. We have bought back over 100% of the then outstanding shares of stock since our buyback inception in 1998, while investing in our existing assets and growing our business.  We remain committed to this disciplined capital allocation approach that will enable us to invest in the business and return meaningful amounts to cash to shareholders. We finished Q4 2.3 times EBITDAR, which is below our historical objective of 2.5 times EBITDAR. However, we remain committed to our leverage objectives, and we expect to return to the 2.5 times target in FY24. To wrap up, we remain committed to driving long term shareholder value by investing in our growth initiatives, driving robust earnings and cash and returning excess cash to our shareholders. Our strategy continues to work. We're growing our market share and improving our competitive position in a disciplined way. As we look forward to FY24, we're bullish on our growth prospects behind a resilient DIY business, a fast growing international business and a domestic commercial business that is continuing to grow share.  I continue to have tremendous confidence in our ability to drive significant and ongoing value for our shareholders driven by a high degree of confidence in our strategy, and our exceptional team of AutoZoners. One last housekeeping point, I'd like to remind you that in FY24, we will have a 53rd week in our financial results. This extra week will be added to our Q4 results. As a result, our fiscal year will now end August 31, 2024. In order to model that extra week, I encourage you to look at our financial breakouts of both our fiscal 2019 and 2,013 fourth quarters, which were the last two years we had the extra week and we show breakouts of the full P&L accordingly.  And now I'll turn it back to Bill. Bill Rhodes : Thank you, Jamere. As we start a new fiscal year, I'd like to take a moment to discuss our operating theme for the New Year, live the pledge. I know this sounds like a very consistent theme for AutoZone. In fact, it was the theme we used in my first full year as CEO in 2006.  I'm asked frequently, what differentiates AutoZone from others. My answer goes back to the same point over and over, the culture. I, our Board and our leadership team believe we can never emphasize the culture enough. The culture is defined by helping solve our customers' challenges and optimizing the performance of their vehicles. It's based on a team-based approach recognizing everyone's contributions and performance and putting team goals ahead of personal goals. It sets the standard at exceptional performance, not mediocrity. It's about the AutoZone family. Calling yourself a family comes with great responsibility. And it is so much more. The pledge and our values summarize our operating strategies succinctly. As we've accelerated our top line since the onset of the pandemic, our competitive positioning has also materially improved. Our efforts for 2024 will be focused on execution. We have a lot of projects in flight, and we did get them completed. Supply chain improvements will remain a key focus in FY24.  We will continue with our additions of mega hub and hub stores, new distribution centers and international store growth. As you noticed our international teams posted same store sales comps on a constant currency basis of 14.9%, much higher than our domestic comp. International has been strong for a few years now.  This morning, I'm excited to share after an extensive strategic review of the ultimate number of locations we can have in the U.S., Mexico and Brazil. We are announcing our plans for a much more aggressive global store development plan. Over the last five years we've averaged 140 domestic store openings and 50 international openings for a total of roughly 190 new stores a year in the Americas. We plan on accelerating this pace and aspire to open as many as 500 stores five years from now. So by FY28 we are modeling 500 store openings with the split being 300 in the U.S., 200 internationally. FY24 we will remain around 200, but we will ramp from there. You may be asking why this change of strategy and why now? The answer is our profitability per store is materially higher since the beginning of the pandemic. We continue to find new trade areas even in our more mature U.S. markets. Our growth in commercial has materially changed the economics on a per-store basis. We believe this is just the beginning on commercial, and our ROIC, one of the most important metrics we track is over 50%.  Also our international markets are immature. So we continue to see expansion opportunities in Mexico and Brazil, along with putting a toehold at some point in other new markets. I want to stress that we will be diligent and disciplined. We have a long track record of performance with high returns and strong cash flow generation. We have no plans on changing that strategy and approach, where we believe in evolution over revolution. We believe in continuous improvement and we believe in test and learn.  We have been, and remain anchored on our capital allocation strategy. While I spent time talking about our store development strategies for the future, that is not the key focus for us in FY24. The number one focus will be on growing share in our domestic commercial business. We believe we have a solid plan in place for growth over the next 12 months. We know our focus on parts availability and better customer service will lead to sales growth. We're excited as we start 2020.  This time of year, I always enjoy reflecting on the past. Our team achieved some impressive milestones this year, $17.5 billion in sales, racing past the $17 billion milestone. DIY comps are 1.8%, most impressively 15.9% on a three year basis. Commercial sales are now $4.6 billion. I personally distinctly remember a goal of $1 billion not that long ago. Average weekly sales domestically of $47,600, equating to just under $2.5 million per store annually. Our Mexico and all data [ph] teams both broke multiple records, and Brazil is poised for significant growth in store count, and getting to profitability breakeven on the path to substantial profitability in the future. We bought back 3.7 billion in AutoZone stock, the second highest ever, only behind last year's 4.4 billion. And our team has grown our EBIT by 61% in four years. That's remarkable. But we can't rest on our laurels. And we aren't without our challenges. That's for sure.  As I've said on several occasions, we have to exit pandemic mode. We had to get back to taking care of the customer. And this requires as close to flawless execution as possible. We have to make sure every store is staffed right, every hour of every day, our processes need to function correctly, always. We have to meet our store opening goals and timelines. Simply put, we have to remain the execution machine that we have always been.  On June 26, we announced our leadership transition plan. And yesterday we announced the next evolution of AutoZone's senior most leadership team. I've had the honor and privilege of being part of this team for nearly 29 years now. And it has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my life. We, as part of that leadership transition plan, announced that I would step away from the President and CEO roles, but remain Executive Chairman in January.  As a Board we've been contemplating this transition for many, many years, and began a very robust well-defined disciplined process nearly three years ago. Our goal was to identify a successor and ensure that successor had a fabulous team with them. I think we've accomplished that goal. The company will be in fantastic hands with Phil Danielle leading it. He loves this business, is a car fanatic, and has been here for 30 years, and in the industry for nearly 40 years. With Jamere Jackson leading the finance and store development teams and Tom Newbern now serving as our Chief Operating Officer, in addition to the balance of our talented executive team, our company is in terrific hands.  While it will be bittersweet for me, I'm excited that Phil and the Board have asked me to continue to be very involved for the foreseeable future. Ultimately, I know Phil, Jamere, Tom and I all know, this is a team sport and ultimately it's not about the senior most leaders in this organization. It's about in our case, the pledge, our values, and most importantly, our culture, which at its core is all about having the best most passionate AutoZoners taking care of customers, and the organization prioritizing AutoZoners and their development, or we say -- as we say, caring about others.  Yesterday, we announced another organization changes with the promotion, Bill Hackney to Executive Vice President, Merchandising, Marketing and Supply Chain. I congratulate Bill, a 38 year AutoZoner who knows this business exceptionally well and has always been a top performer. We also announced that three terrific long term leaders will be retiring around the end of the calendar year. I thank and congratulate Grant McGee, Charlie Pleas and Al Saltiel, for their partnership, leadership and friendship for all these years. They leave AutoZone a massively better organization than they found it many years ago.  So changes in the air, frankly, it always is. It's amazing to me to see how much our leadership has changed over my near 30 year tenure at AutoZone. To me, that's why the culture. It's why the culture is so important in this organization. With a phenomenal culture, it's not about individuals. It's about the team. It's about the goals, and it's about performance. As we begin this transition, Phil and I both shared that not only do we both feel we embody the culture, both of us believe we are products of this culture. We've learned extraordinary lessons from our three decades at AutoZone. Most importantly, always put the customer first, execution wins. People want to play on winning teams and be recognized for their performance. Details matter. Listen to those closest to the customer, and so much more. Phil and I, both continue to say, and it may sound like a clich\u00e9, but we believe it. AutoZone's best days lie ahead of us.  Now we'd like to open up the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. Our first question is coming from Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Your line is live. Bret Jordan : Hey, good morning, guys. Bill Rhodes : Good morning, Bret. Philip Daniele : Hey, Bret. Bret Jordan : You called out market share gain in the commercial space in the fourth quarter. Then you said, not in line with your aspirations. But then also said that pricing is rational. What do you think is happening in the space? Are there peers that are showing relatively better in-stocks? Or really was it just your regional footprint and exposure to some of those softer markets that made the difference? Bill Rhodes : It's a terrific question, Bret. And there's a lot of different elements as you would expect. Again, we are not satisfied with our commercial growth at this level. And we're going to change that, and we're encouraged about the direction that we're heading. I think part of it Bret is a comparison versus last year. You mentioned in-stocks. Last year, 18 months ago, we got very aggressive with some key categories and a lot of merchandise, when frankly a lot of our less sophisticated competitors were not in great in-stock positions.  As we're beginning to lap that significant outsized growth last year, that's certainly a challenge for us. And we're beginning to get past that point in time. We also mentioned that we've had some challenges in the Midwest and Northeast, particularly with under cart categories, and particularly in commercial where we just didn't have that winner that we so desperately want and need. And we've suffered in those under cart categories. Bret Jordan : Okay, great. And a big picture question, I guess on the international. When you look at the, obviously different vehicle demographic and economy, but how do you see the underlying growth rates in the DIY and the DIFM segments in Brazil and Mexico, sort of on a longer term basis? Bill Rhodes : That's a great question. We've been in Mexico for nearly 25 years now. There's just not great data there, Bret. And so you don't have the terrific kind of information that we get from the Auto Care Association. So we don't have great data down there. We're working to try to see if we can get some better data. But what we know is we've been in Mexico now, as I said, almost 25 years and we continue to grow significantly and think that we have a lot of growth left in front of us, not just in new stores but on same store sales.  There are still categories where we are massively under penetrated, there are still categories we don't participate in at all. And as we learn more about that business, we're continuing to grow. Same things happened in Brazil. We're just much earlier in Brazil. Bret Jordan : But fair to think an older car base that drives a better underlying growth than U.S. Bill Rhodes : I think in Mexico, clearly the car basis is older, and there's a lot of U.S. cars, there's also a lot of Mexico manufactured vehicles. Brazil is very different in that the size of the vehicles and in particularly, the engine sizes in Brazil are massively smaller. I mean, if you have a two liter engine in Brazil, that's a big car. Many of them are 1.4 liters and the like. So we still got a lot to learn in Brazil. But we're excited about where we are. We believe we see a path to great success, but we're still losing money there. We got to fix that over the next couple of years. Bret Jordan : Great. Thank you. Bill Rhodes : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Your line is live. Simeon Gutman : Good morning, everyone, and congratulations to the retirees and promotees. My first question is, I may have missed, is double digits still the goal for commercial? And if so what's the -- how should we think about the timeframe to getting there? Bill Rhodes : Absolutely is still the goal. Keep in mind, we still have pretty low share in that, 4.5% range or so. So we're under share. And we think there's still tremendous opportunity for us to gain share. Like we said, we're not happy with our performance in the Q4 timeframe. We do feel like we're exiting the quarter at a higher rate, and we believe will continue to improve from this point forward. But we're not back to where we want to be. But we do see line of sight to getting back to that double digit growth over time. Simeon Gutman : And then maybe the follow up, the way you've built the business in commercial, it's been methodical, and you've had some periods of faster growth. But it's been cumulative. And my question is now that you're focused on it, again, how do we get comfortable with timing that, prescriptively, your business really accelerates, call it in the next few quarters versus why not take the year to get some of the traction from the things that you're working on? Bill Rhodes : Well, like I said, we talked, in Q3 or Q4 that our execution in the commercial arena wasn't where we expected it to be. And we've been working on that. We saw that performance and the execution levels improve as we worked through Q4. We're not finished yet. We'll frankly, never be finished. Execution is a long term strategy. But we continue to get better. And we think we continue to improve our business model. Like we said, we've opened up more hubs, more mega hubs. We continue to strengthen our store side assortments. And we're also continuing to leverage the technology enhancements that we've made over the last couple of years.  And those will continue to mature. And we're not standing still. That technology enhancements will continue as we move through this next year. Simeon Gutman : Thank you. Good luck. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Seth Sigman with Barclays. Your line is live. Seth Sigman : Hey, good morning, everyone. And I'll add my congrats as well on all the new roles. Hey, want to follow up on the commercial business. And that last point, if you could maybe just elaborate on the execution shortfalls that you've seen. What are we talking about here, is that availability? Is it something more sales-related? Just any more context on that and how you're fixing that and the response so far? And then I'll add a follow up. Thank you. Bill Rhodes : Now on the execution -- thanks for the question. On the execution, I think if you go back to the pandemic, and some of the challenges of the pandemic, we obviously struggled with in-stock. We struggled with staffing, as everybody did. And we struggled with store level execution. Our primary objectives were keep our AutoZoners safe, take care of the customers, keep our stores in-stock. Nothing, there wasn't any -- this big one area that got broken. It was a lot of little things. And at AutoZone, we expect to operate executionally solid every single day. We didn't achieve that. We're continuing to work on that. And we're taking off the execution marks to get back to flawless execution day in and day out. That frankly, takes time and it will continue to improve. We liked the improvements we saw in Q4. I wouldn't say we're done. We think there's still opportunities to improve and we'll continue down that path. It's just part of our culture. Execute flawlessly. Seth Sigman : Got it. Okay, that's helpful. And then I wanted to follow-up on another point made earlier about traffic and volume improving through the quarter, and I think that coincides with inflation moderating. Can you just give us a little bit more perspective on what you've seen historically, as it relates to elasticity? And then just in general, how are you thinking about inflation for this coming fiscal year? Thanks. Bill Rhodes : Yeah. So the first point I'll make on inflation is that, we've been comping hyperinflation relative to our store industry trends for quite some time now. And so as inflation has sort of moderated and faded to sort of the normal rates, those are the dynamics that we've been experiencing. As it relates to our business moving forward, we expect inflation to be in the low-to-mid single digit range that will impact our tickets. On the DIY side, as we've said, we've historically seen transaction counts decline kind of low single digits, if you will.  And so we expect to be operating our business closer to historic norms moving forward. In terms of the macro environment, and how that's played out from an inflation standpoint. We haven't seen to this point, sort of a wobble from the consumer. We think it's been a two-speed world for a while where the low end consumer has been under some pressure, but consumers that have higher incomes have been doing well. And the net result of that is our business on the DIY side has been very, very resilient. Seth Sigman : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Elizabeth Suzuki with Bank of America. Your line is live. Elizabeth Suzuki : Great, thank you. I just, a question on expansion and store growth. I mean, just given that the cost of construction and the cost of capital has gone up quite a bit in the last couple of years, how are you thinking about capital allocation? Just it seems like store growth is a pretty big part of your long term plans. But just thinking about where that capital can be best deployed, in which areas, maybe rural areas, or international, where you think you're going to get the best return? Bill Rhodes : Yeah, thank you, Liz. We think we're going t o get a great return basically, in all three countries, whether that be urban environments or rural environments. And I go back to when you're running a ROIC of 50%, that shows that we can get really good returns. Yes, we're making this announcement when construction costs are higher, interest rates are higher and on and on. We're making decisions that are 40-year decisions. And we believe we've got a long runway for opening significant amounts of new stores. And once we finished that strategic review back in June, we made the decision that we're going to accelerate and get back to 500 stores a year.  Now remember, that'll be between 3% and 3.5% organic store growth. So it's not like we're talking about going to 10% growth. We think having something that's growing in that range makes a lot of sense for the long term. Jamere Jackson : Now the only thing I'll add, Liz, is that, to your point around capital allocation, this doesn't change our long term capital allocation framework. Managing our leverage target at 2.5 times EBITDAR gives us a tremendous amount of financial firepower, to invest in our existing assets, to invest in this growth profile that Bill's talking about, but also to give meaningful amounts of cash back to shareholders. So doesn't change our long term capital allocation framework as we move forward. Elizabeth Suzuki : Great, thank you. And then, you talked about Mexico and Brazil. Now in Brazil, you're still losing some money there. What does the profit profile look like in Mexico or just for the international operations in total? And how should we think about the impact on the total company margin profile as those stores grow as a percentage of AutoZone's total? Bill Rhodes : Well, it's certainly a tale of two countries. We are losing money in Brazil. We haven't disclosed specifics in Mexico, but I'll just say that we are very pleased with the profitability profile, and particularly the return profile in Mexico. Elizabeth Suzuki : Great, thank you. Bill Rhodes : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. Your line is live. Christopher Horvers : Thanks. Good morning. Also wanted to follow up on the commercial side. You talked about 7% in the last four weeks. So to clarify was that comped, and as we look forward, clearly August was hot, and you got a weather bump there. So you talked about improving from what you've seen. I guess, what's the right trend line to think about of the 7% versus the 2.5% that you actually did for the quarter? Bill Rhodes : Yeah, the 7%, just to be clear, was a total growth in those last four weeks of the quarter. So it improved over the quarter timeframe. I'd like to forecast that we're going to improve from there. It could be bumpy. Nothing's a straight line. I'll tell you, if you think about the weather performance over the quarter, like we said, the beginning parts of the quarter, the first month of May and June, were particularly cool and wet. And although that had probably a more material impact on the DIY side of the business, it impacts commercial as well.  And as it got hot, you see those bigger ticket categories, like per se, air conditioning, for example. Those are big categories and big jobs. And as you get those failures due to heat, it helps the comps and the total growth. So we think that weather story will help us a little bit. The hot summer will help us as we move through the beginning of Q4. And then we'll move into a normal weather pattern as we as we go through Q2 and the rest of the year. Christopher Horvers : Got it? And then -- okay, got it. So the 7% was total. So the comp side of it [ph] for me was more like a 5%, I guess. Is that right? And then as you think about '24, any other high level comments? I know you don't guide. Jamere, you talked about some LIFO tailwinds that, persist early, and then probably turn to some year-over-year headwinds. Anything else to think about in the P&L in terms of SG&A per store, or other comments on gross margin and so forth? Thank you. Jamere Jackson : Yeah. So as we think about FY24, I think there are a handful of dynamics that you need to sort of wrap your mind around as you build your models. Number one, we're forecasting a very consistent and resilient DIY business. And Phil and Bill talked about some of those dynamics as part of their prepared comments.  The second dynamic that we're focused on, as Phil alluded to, is an improving growth profile in our commercial business, again, we were very pleased with where we exited the fourth quarter. I believe we got the momentum going into the first quarter and next year. I think the third dynamic that you mentioned is around LIFO. We've got $59 million of LIFO that we expect to largely get back through the P&L. So as you're working your way through your modeling, you can expect most, if not all of that, to come back to us this year.  And then from an expense profile standpoint we said longer term SG&A will grow in line with sales. We are an investment mode, particularly in IT in some of the areas that are underpinning some of the growth initiatives that we're talking about. So that's how I focus. And then the last one I just mentioned is just on -- from an international standpoint. You've seen us post our international numbers. This morning, we've got two years, quite frankly, where the business has been on fire. And we're very excited about the growth profile in our international business. So as you think about where we are, we feel good about the growth prospects going forward. We think, from a margin standpoint, we've made tremendous strides in gross margin excluding LIFO. And we've got a consistent, resilient domestic DIY business, which still is the lion's share of our businesses as we move forward. Christopher Horvers : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Michael Lasser with UBS. Your line is live. Henry Carr : Hi, this is Henry Carr on behalf of Michael Lasser. Good morning, and thanks for taking our question. We've been hearing about elevated levels of deferred maintenance and weak car counts in the industry. When thinking about returning to a sustainable high single digit or low double digit growth in commercial, how are you factoring in this occurrence, is it a reaffirmed goal? And is there any way to quantify it? Bill Rhodes : Yeah, we don't have terrific data on that. Obviously, we're in our commercial customer shops all the time. And we're hearing the same things. Frankly, we've been hearing it since about February that car counts are down, particularly for people that are in the tire business. And as you know, when a technician takes off a tire, it provides a whole another opportunity for sales. You get a chance to see what's going on with the braking systems and chassis systems and the like. So we don't have a great history on what are the exact members, but we think it is -- has been a softer environment. I think some of that has to do with the economic challenges that we're seeing. We haven't operated in the commercial business at this level for a long period of time. So we don't know the cycles like we do in the DIY business. But I think our belief is when economic pressures happen we get trade down from DIY to DIFM or sorry, from DIFM to DIY in certain cases. And I suspect that's what we're experiencing now.  How long will that last? You tell me what the economic cycle is going to look like. And again, we have a lot of discussions about short term sales performance. Our focus is not on the short term sales performance. Our focus is on what are we doing in our business to make our business better competitively? And how are we going to grow sales and share profitably over the long term? Henry Carr : Thank you. And just as a quick follow up, I believe the mega hubs came in at 13 in fourth quarter, and if I'm not mistaken that might be a little bit short of where you were targeting for '22 to '25 for full year, fiscal year '23. Are most of these openings just going to roll into 2023? Is there another way we should think about it? Thank you. Bill Rhodes : You want me to do Jamere's performance review in public? Jamere Jackson : I was just going to say, did he pay you to ask that question? So obviously, store development falls under my purview. We are short of where we need to be and when Phil and Bill talked about things that we need to execute better on, certainly what we're doing from a store development standpoint, fits squarely in that category. As I said, last quarter, we got 20 open this past fiscal year. We would have liked that number to be closer to 25. But what I'll tell you is that our pipeline is very strong as we move into FY24. And we're committed to get to the 200 number. So you'll see us start to accelerate that mega hub target.  And it's important for our business. It's important not just for the commercial business, but also for the DIY business, because of the outsized growth that we see in our mega hubs. So we're working our way through it, and we'll get better as we move forward. Henry Carr : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Your line is live. Seth Basham : Thanks a lot, and good morning. My question is also on the commercial business, just in terms of where you're not getting as much share, as you expected. Is it in more in the national accounts versus [indiscernible] security accounts? Are there any specific regions that are underperforming your expectations? Philip Daniele : Yeah, I mean, there's -- the national account versus what we call the UDS account or the general repair shop down the street, the business growth between the two has been pretty consistent. Frankly, I will say within some of those national accounts, I think it's been more around two segments that have not performed as well for us recently. One is the used car market, kind of the buy-here, pay-here, growth has not been as good and the used car markets that are sold within new car dealerships, those markets haven't been as good for us.  And like Bill mentioned earlier, the groups that deal with tires have been softer. We didn't have a great winter. Those tire changes, going from a summer tire to a winter tire and vice versa, didn't happen like you would normally expect. And as Bill mentioned, when you pull that tire off, and you get to see that the brakes are rusted and the calipers frozen and the suspension parts aren't working as well as they should be, or maybe something's broken, that opportunity to get the wheel off, just generates a bigger repair. Now the other thing is, as people push maintenance off, there becomes more failures in the repair cycle. So longer term, pushing that deferred maintenance off is good for us. But those have been the pressure points over the last couple of months. Seth Basham : Understand those being the pressure points, but would you assess those are also the areas where you're not getting as much share as you expected? Philip Daniele : Yeah, I don't know that we're not gaining share in those categories. I think, over the last couple of years, we know we've grown a significant share in some of those categories. I believe everybody would be down pretty commensurately. And some of those categories aren't going to return to a more normal cycle until you go through another winter cycle of snow. So I think they will be depressed. We'll see those categories, be under a little bit of pressure until we get through another normal winter cycle. Bill Rhodes : So I'll add that I do think, like we said earlier, we have -- we grew share exponentially over a couple of years. And part of that was because our in-stock position was massively better, certainly than our WD competitors. I think we've ceded some of that share back to them as they've gotten back in-stock. Seth Basham : Yeah, that's exactly my follow up is going to be Bill, just thinking about that in-stock position, when we start to cycle that improvement by your competitors, is that here into the fiscal first quarter, or is it going to take another couple of quarters? Bill Rhodes : I think we're beginning to cycle it now. But as you said, it's going to take some time not every category was the same, not everyone competitor was the same. So we'll probably be dealing with it for six more months but we probably past the height of it. Seth Basham : Great. Thanks, guys. Bill Rhodes : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our final question today will be coming from Scot Ciccarelli with Truist. Your line is live. Scot Ciccarelli : Good morning, everyone. Thank you for the time. So I guess I'm still confused, outside of whether what has the main execution challenge has been on the commercial segment? Part one. And then part two, kind of related to that is, what specific changes are you making to the business to help accelerate growth as we kind of roll here into -- further into '24? Thank you. Bill Rhodes : Thanks, Scot. I think the answer is there's not one single thing. I think we tried to make that clear. We -- as we've said, for the last two quarters, we were operating differently during the pandemic. Everybody had to operate differently. Because we were having to make decisions on the fly every day. As we've come out of the pandemic, we've lost a few of our disciplines. These are things like writing the right schedule. We've experienced exceptionally high turnover. We don't have the same level of, of experience in our stores that we had then. And we've just got to get back to making sure that we're dotting the I's and crossing the t's. And we're delivering parts on time, that we've got the right hand stock levels, and on and on and on. There is not one major thing. These are thousand paper cuts. That has been the hallmark of this organization. I put our execution up against anybody. And we weren't as sharp as we needed to be, and we're making those improvements today. Scot Ciccarelli : And then specific changes you're making. Is it just better blocking and tackling for lack of a better term Bill? Bill Rhodes : I think that that is the biggest change that we're making. But that's not the sole thing that we're doing. Phil mentioned that we got a lot of technology that we've deployed in the commercial business. Over the last six months we've really refined that technology. And we're excited about what it means. We have two or three major technological enhancements that are coming in the first quarter or two this year, specifically in the commercial business that are all focused on how do we execute better? How do we decrease delivery times? How do we make sure that we're delivering the right parts at the right time? And we're excited about that. Scot Ciccarelli : Got it. Thank you. Bill Rhodes : All right. Thank you. All right. Before we conclude the call, I want to take a moment to reiterate we believe our industry is in a strong position. And our business model is solid. We're excited about our growth prospects for the year but we will take nothing for granted as we understand our customers have alternatives. We have exciting plans that should help us succeed for the future. But I want to stress that this is a marathon and not a sprint.  As we continue to focus on the basics and strive to optimize shareholder value for the future, we are confident AutoZone will continue to be very successful. Thank you for participating in today's call. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time and we thank you for your participation.",

Operator : Thank you. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Bill Rhodes, Chairman and CEO of AutoZone. Sir, the floor is yours. Bill Rhodes : Good morning. And thank you for joining us today for AutoZone\u2019s 2024 first quarter conference call. With me today are Phil Daniele, CEO-Elect; Jamere Jackson, Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax. Regarding the first quarter, hope you had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter\u2019s results. If not, the press release along with slides complementing our comments today are available on our website, www.autozone.com, under the Investor Relations link. Please click on Quarterly Earnings Conference Calls to see them. As we begin this morning, we want to thank our AutoZoners for their contributions during the quarter that resulted in our solid performance. As our pledge states, we lead with putting customers first, which allowed us to grow our total sales by 5.1% while both are operating profit and earnings per share, grew by very impressive high-teens rates. As we have previously said, we have been able to continually build on the phenomenal performance from the pandemic years of 2020 to 2023. Our leadership team and I continue to be impressed with our post-pandemic sales performance. To put this in perspective, our FY 2019 sales were $11.6 billion and now our trailing four quarter sales are $17.7 billion, a 50% plus increase over a four-year time horizon. Congratulations AutoZoners everywhere who made that enormous success possible. For the first quarter, our total company same-store sales were 3.4% and 2.1% on a constant currency basis. As international has become a more important part of our growth story and an area where we are increasingly deploying capital, last quarter we began disclosing our global sales comp. We encourage you to focus on the constant currency number where international again had a strong quarter of 10.9%. Both our Mexican and Brazilian same-store sales had double-digit growth. We are very excited about the short- and long-term growth prospects of international. Our expectations are we will continue to grow both mature store volumes both in DIY and DIFM and we plan to accelerate new store openings over the next several years, ultimately getting to a minimum of 200 international new stores by 2028. Next, our domestic same-store sales were up 1.2% this quarter compared to 1.7% last quarter and 5.6% in Q1 of last year. Our performance in retail was slightly below our expectations, but still, still resilient in the current environment. Breaking our sales into three, four-week segments, our DIY same-store sales were roughly 1% for both the first and last four-week segments, but were negative 2% in the middle four weeks or October. Commercial sales on the other hand accelerated for the quarter, but we started stronger than we finished. As you know some of the comparisons over the last few years were distorted. And on a three-year basis, the performance of each of the businesses this quarter was remarkably similar. Our commercial business grew 5.7% against exceptionally strong comps last year. Importantly, we continue to be encouraged by the new initiatives we have in place to accelerate top-line growth in commercial, and those efforts are having a positive impact on our performance. And as we further analyzed our DIY and DIFM results and specifically our second period sales slowdown, our retail business was clearly impacted on a regional basis as we saw a 70 basis-point performance gap between the Northeast and Midwestern markets versus the rest of the country. We continue to attribute this gap in performance to the lack of winter weather last year and lack of snowfall. But enough about what happened to us. While not satisfied with our sales performance, we are encouraged as we enjoyed both, dollar and unit share gains in our domestic and retail businesses -- domestic retail and commercial businesses. We previously highlighted that we were not executing at peak levels, and we are encouraged to share that we are seeing steady progress. Our in-stock levels are nearing pre-pandemic levels. Turnover, while still elevated is beginning to decline. Productivity levels in our distribution centers have improved. The technology we deployed to improve service levels to commercial customers is seeing much higher adoption rates, leading to decreased delivery times and we have opened a significant number of new commercial programs, reaching 92% domestic penetration for the first time in our history. Even more encouraging is the continued strength in sales we are seeing from those new program openings as many are only weeks old. Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Phil Daniele to give more in-depth color on the quarter. Phil? Phil Daniele : Thank you, Bill. Good morning, everyone. Our domestic same store sales were 1.2% this quarter on top of last year\u2019s 5.6% growth. While we were up against exceptionally strong same-store sales from a year ago, particularly in commercial, we believe we are making progress with more room for improvement. I want to reiterate what Bill said a moment ago that we\u2019ve made many changes across the organization from reinstituting many of our long-term processes to placing share of voice in vitally important areas, ensuring we are hiring the right AutoZoners, and execution is improving meaningfully. Our domestic commercial business grew 5.7%. We still have work to do, but we were pleased with the improvements we saw in this business. As the business began improving, we believe we grew share and set another record for the quarter with $1.1 billion in commercial sales. Domestic commercial sales represented 30% of our domestic auto parts sales for quarter one. Our commercial sales growth continues to be driven by the key initiatives we have been working on for the last several years : improved satellite store inventory availability, material improvements in hub and mega hub coverage, adding new hubs and mega hubs, the strength of the Duralast brand with an intense focus on high-quality products, and technological enhancements that make us easier to do business with. We are also operating more efficiently, with improvements in delivery times and enhanced sales force effectiveness. In Q1, we opened 121 net new commercial programs, opening the majority of them in the back half of the quarter. 69 of those 121 programs opened in weeks 7 through 12 of the quarter. While programs that opened late in the quarter have minimal sales impact on the quarter, they do position us for sales growth for the remainder of FY24 and beyond. As Bill previously shared, I want to reiterate, we now have commercial in approximately 92% of our domestic stores. When I was SVP of Commercial, we didn\u2019t have line of sight to reaching that level of penetration. It really is a great sign of the progress that we\u2019ve made over the last five years or so. We believe our commercial business will get stronger and growth rate should improve as we move through the year as comps get easier and our execution will continue to improve. Regarding domestic DIY, we had flat comps this quarter on top of last year\u2019s comp of 2.6%. While the data we have available to us indicates we continue to gain share in both dollars and units, our comp is below our expectations, but in line with what we are seeing across the industry. Regarding weather, it was quite mild this quarter. It is this time of year when our sales will fade as the summer sales slow down into winter. This year, October was warmer than last year, and sales in weather sensitive hard part categories in the Midwest and the Northeast underperformed the remainder of the country. While our retail comp was flat for the quarter, we saw the first four weeks comp up 1%, the second four weeks comp down 2%, and the last four weeks comp up 0.7%. While our performance clearly improved over the last four weeks of the quarter, we fell short of our own expectations for retail for the full quarter. As a reminder, historically, extreme weather, either hot or cold, drives part failures and accelerated maintenance. Regarding this quarter\u2019s traffic versus ticket growth, in retail, our traffic was down 1.6%, while our ticket was up similarly. We expect our ticket growth will return to more normalized levels in the 3% to 4% range as we get further removed from the large increases from last year due to significant inflation, particularly due to freight costs. Regarding our commercial trends, we continue to see higher growth rates for traffic relative to ticket. During the quarter, there were some geographic regions that did better than others as there always are. This quarter, we saw a 230 basis-point worse performance between the Northeast and the Midwest compared to the balance of the country. As the Northeast and the Midwest experienced a very mild winter last year with below average snowfall, we sold less weather-sensitive hard parts in this part of the country. Heading into the second quarter, we are planning for a more normal weather pattern. But as a reminder, the Q2 is always our most volatile quarter as weather fluctuations can be extreme, meaningfully impacting our short-term sales performance, either positively or negatively. Regarding our merchandise categories in the retail business, our sales floor categories underperformed hard parts as we saw more discretionary pullback from customers. We do feel the low-end consumer started pulling back on discretionary purchases. Let me also address inflation and pricing. This quarter, we saw low-single-digit inflation and as a result our ticket was up roughly 1.5%. We believe inflation for the second quarter will be similar as the industry is migrating back to pre-pandemic inflation levels, lapping very high inflation from a year ago. I want to reiterate that our industry has been very-disciplined about pricing for decades, and we expect that to continue. Historically, as costs have increased, the industry has increased pricing commensurately to maintain margins. It is also notable that following periods of higher inflation, our industry has historically not reduced pricing to reflect lower cost, and we believe we have entered into one of those periods. For the second quarter, we expect our DIY sales to remain more difficult and our commercial sales trends to improve. We will, as always, be transparent about what we are seeing and provide color on our markets and outlook as trends emerge. Before handing the call to Jamere, I\u2019d like to highlight and give some color on a few of our other key business priorities for the new fiscal year. First, we continue to focus on our supply chain with two initiatives that are in flight to drive improved availability : one is our expanded hub and mega hub rollouts, and secondly, we are making good progress on transforming our distribution network. Along with having two domestic distribution centers currently under construction, our strategy is focused on leveraging the entire network to carry more inventory closer to the customer to drive growth with speed and expanded availability and efficiency. Additionally, we plan to continue to grow internationally. At 840 store -- 849 stores opened internationally, or 12% of our total store base, these businesses had impressive performance last quarter and should continue to grow at a robust pace for the remainder of fiscal 2024. We are leveraging many of the learnings we have in the U.S. to refine our offerings in Mexico and Brazil. Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Jamere Jackson. Jamere Jackson : Thanks, Phil, and good morning, everyone. As both Bill and Phil have previously discussed, we had a solid first quarter stacked on top of an impressive first quarter last year with 5.1% total company sales growth, 1.2% domestic comp growth, 10.9% international comp on a constant currency basis, a 17.4% increase in EBIT, and an 18.6% increase in EPS. We continue to deliver solid results, and the efforts of our AutoZoners in our storage and distribution centers have continued to enable us to drive earnings growth in a meaningful way. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to elaborate on the specifics in our P&L for Q1. For the quarter, total sales were $4.2 billion, up 5.1%, and let me give a little more color on sales and our growth initiatives. Starting with our domestic commercial business, our domestic DIFM sales increased 5.7% to $1.1 billion and were up 20.6% on a two-year stack basis. Sales to our domestic DIFM customers represented 26% of our total company sales and 30% of our domestic auto part sales. Our average weekly sales per program were $15,900, down 0.6%. It\u2019s important to point out that our sales per program productivity was again impacted by a large number of immature programs that have opened over the last five quarters. While these openings depress the point in time productivity metric, we\u2019re encouraged by the growth prospects of these programs and their early contribution to our commercial business. We have intentionally opened more stores with commercial programs in response to the tremendous opportunity we see to grow our market share. We now have a commercial program in approximately 92% of our domestic stores, which leverages our DIY infrastructure and we\u2019re building our business with national, regional, and local accounts. This quarter, we opened 121 net new programs, finishing with 5,803 total programs. Our commercial acceleration initiatives continue to make progress as we grow share by winning new business and increasing our share of wallet with existing customers. Importantly, we continue to have a lot of runway in front of us and we will continue to aggressively pursue growth opportunities in commercial, which we believe is our single largest growth opportunity. To support our commercial growth, we now have 100 mega hub locations with 2 new mega hubs open in Q1. The 100 mega hubs averaged significantly higher sales than the balance of commercial programs and grew more than 2 times the rate of our overall commercial business in Q1. As a reminder, our mega hubs typically carry roughly 100,000 SKUs and drive tremendous sales lift inside the store box as well as serve as an expanded assortment source for other stores. The expansion of coverage and parts availability continued to deliver a meaningful sales lift to both our commercial and DIY business. These assets are performing well individually and the fulfillment capability for the surrounding AutoZone stores is giving our customers access to thousands of additional parts and lifting the entire network. We will continue to aggressively open mega hubs for the foreseeable future, and we expect to have north of 200 mega hubs at full build out. These are difficult to find boxes in the right locations, but we are keenly focused on rapid expansion and have 45 currently in the pipeline and growing. On the domestic retail side of our business, our comp was essentially flat for the quarter. As mentioned, we saw traffic down 1.6%, offset by 1.5% ticket growth. As we move forward, we would expect to see slightly declining transaction counts offset by low to mid single digit ticket growth, in line with the long-term historical trends for the business, driven by changes in technology and the durability of new parts. While DIY discretionary purchases were challenged in Q1, we continue to see a growing and aging car park, a challenging new and used car sales market and a consumer that is likely to continue to invest in their existing vehicles. As such, we believe our DIY business will remain resilient for the balance of FY24. I\u2019ll now say a few words regarding our international business. We continue to be pleased with the progress we\u2019re making internationally. Our same-store sales grew 25.1% on an actual basis and 10.9% on a constant currency basis. During the quarter, we opened 5 stores in Mexico to finish with 745 stores and 4 stores in Brazil ending with 104. We remain committed to international and given our success, we\u2019re bullish on international being an attractive and meaningful contributor to AutoZone\u2019s future growth. Now, let me spend a few minutes on the rest of the P&L and gross margins. For the quarter, our gross margin was 52.8%, up 279 basis points, driven primarily by a noncash $81 million LIFO charge in last year\u2019s quarter versus a $2 million LIFO credit this year. Excluding LIFO from both years, we had a very strong 70 basis-point improvement in gross margin, which increased from last quarter\u2019s 37 basis-point improvement. We\u2019ve had exceptional gross margin improvement and in fact, we\u2019re at the highest gross margin rate we\u2019ve had since FY 2021. I will point out that we now have $57 million in cumulative LIFO charges yet to be reversed through our P&L, and we expect this credit balance to reverse over time. We\u2019re currently modeling $5 million in LIFO credits for Q2 based on the deflation experienced in Q1. And as I\u2019ve said previously, once we credit back the $57 million through the P&L, we will not take any more credits and we will begin to rebuild an unrecorded LIFO reserve. Moving to operating expenses, our expenses were up 7.4% versus last year\u2019s Q1 as SG&A as a percentage of sales deleveraged 68 basis points. The increase in SG&A has been purposeful as we continue to invest in store payroll and IT to underpin our growth initiatives. These investments are paying dividends in customer experience, speed and productivity. We\u2019re committed to being disciplined on SG&A growth as we move forward and we will manage expenses in line with sales growth over time. Moving to the rest of the P&L. EBIT for the quarter was $849 million, up 17.4% versus the prior year, driven by our positive same-store sales growth and gross margin improvements including the LIFO year-over-year favorable comparison. Interest expense for the quarter was $91.4 million, up 58% from Q1 a year ago as our debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $8.6 billion versus $6.3 billion at Q1 end last year. We\u2019re planning interest expense in the $98 million range for the second quarter of FY24 versus $65.6 million last year. Higher debt levels and borrowing rates across the curve are driving this increase. For the quarter, our tax rate was 21.6% and up from last year\u2019s first quarter of 18.9%. This quarter\u2019s rate benefited 147 basis points from stock options exercised, while last year it benefited 446 basis points. For the second quarter of FY24, we suggest investors model us at approximately 23.4% before any assumption on credits due to stock option exercises. Moving to net income and EPS. Net income for the quarter was $593 million, up 10% versus last year. Our diluted share count of 18.2 million was 7.2% lower than last year\u2019s first quarter. The combination of higher net income and lower share count drove earnings per share for the quarter to $32.55, up 18.6% for the quarter. Now let me talk about our free cash flow for Q1. For the first quarter, we generated $600 million in free cash flow. We expect to continue being an incredibly strong cash flow generator going forward, and we remain committed to returning meaningful amounts of cash to our shareholders. Regarding our balance sheet, our liquidity position remains very strong and our leverage ratio finished Q1 at 2.5 times EBITDAR, returning to our long-term target. Our inventory per store was up 0.3% versus last year while total inventory increased 3%, driven by new store growth. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventory less accounts payable on a per store basis, was a negative $197,000 versus negative $249,000 last year, and negative $201,000 last quarter. As a result, accounts payable as a percent of inventory finished the quarter at 124.4% versus last year\u2019s 131%. Lastly, I\u2019ll spend a moment on capital allocation and our share repurchase program. We repurchased $1.5 billion of AutoZone stock in the quarter, and at quarter end we had just over $300 million remaining under our share buyback authorization. The strong earnings, balance sheet and powerful free cash we generated this year has allowed us to buy back 3% of the shares outstanding in the quarter. We have bought back over 100% of the then outstanding shares of stock since our buyback inception in 1998, while investing in our existing assets and growing our business. We remain committed to this disciplined capital allocation approach that will enable us to invest in the business and return meaningful amounts of cash to shareholders. To wrap up, we remain committed to driving long-term shareholder value by investing in our growth initiatives, driving robust earnings and cash, and returning excess cash to our shareholders. We\u2019re growing our market share, expanding our margins, and improving our competitive positioning in a disciplined way. And as we look forward to the remainder of FY24, we\u2019re bullish on our growth prospects behind a resilient DIY business, a fast growing international business, and a domestic commercial business that is reaccelerating. I continue to have tremendous confidence in our strategy and our ability to drive significant and ongoing value for our shareholders. And now I\u2019ll turn it back to Phil. Phil Daniele : Thank you, Jamere. During the quarter, we launched our new fiscal year, and I\u2019d like to take a moment to discuss the key takeaways from our national sales meeting in September. At the meeting, we launched our operating theme for the New Year, Live the Pledge. While we have used this theme previously, it continues to deeply resonate with our AutoZoners. Simply put, it differentiates us from everyone else. The energy at the event has never been higher. The pledge is the core of our culture, and I, our Board and our leadership team believe we can never overemphasize our culture. It is defined by helping solve our customers\u2019 challenges and optimizing the performance of their vehicles. It is based on a team-based approach of recognizing everyone\u2019s contributions and performance, putting team goals ahead of personal goals. It sets the standard at exceptional performance, not mediocrity. And it\u2019s about caring about people, both our customers and our AutoZoners. It\u2019s about providing unparalleled career opportunities to a diverse population of AutoZoners. And it\u2019s about the AutoZone family. Calling yourself a family comes with great responsibility, and it\u2019s so much more. The pledge and our values summarize our operating strategy succinctly. Fiscal 2024\u2019s top priority is enhanced execution. Additionally, we have many strategic projects in varying stages of completion. We will continue opening new mega hubs and hubs. Construction on our new distribution centers and the optimization of our new direct import facility are a focus, as we are also ramping up our domestic and international store growth to achieve 500 annual new store openings by 2028. As you noticed, our international teams posted same-store sales comps on a constant currency basis of 10.9%, much higher than our domestic comp. International has been strong for a few years now. While I mentioned all of these investments in FY24, the number one focus for the remainder of the year will be on growing share in our domestic commercial business. We believe we have a solid plan in place for growth over the next 12 months. We know our focus on parts availability and better customer service will lead to additional sales growth. We are excited about what we can accomplish for the remainder of this year. Finally, I\u2019d like to update you on our leadership transition plan. Next month, Bill will become Executive Chair and I will become President and CEO. It will be one of the greatest honors of my life to move into that role. And while that role will come with new opportunities and challenges, I continue to be very bullish about the prospects because I know we have an extraordinary culture and a terrific industry and as you have seen, an ever-evolving but exceptional team. As Bill and I both continue to say, and it may sound a little bit clich\u00e9, and we both believe it. AutoZone\u2019s best days lie ahead of us. I want to thank Bill for his wonderful nearly 19-year tenure leading this company and thank him for his leadership. I\u2019m excited about the opportunity to continue to leverage him and his experiences in this new role as Executive Chair. I also want to thank three other long-term senior leaders for their amazing contributions to our success Grant McGee, Charlie Pleas and Al Saltiel with their respective 34, 27, and 10 years of service to AutoZone. They have had an enormous contributions, and their legacies will be evident in the teams they have built and the contributions those teams will make over the coming decades. I congratulate each of them and wish Grant and Bonnie, Charlie and Doris, and Al and Sue well earned happiness in their next chapters. Now, we\u2019d like to open up the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from Bret Jordan from Jefferies. Bret Jordan : Can we talk a bit more about the international margins, since that\u2019s going to be more impactful, how it compares to what you see in the U.S.? And I guess Brazil versus Mexico, is there much difference? And is there, I guess, an investment phase that is going to be required to ramp that? Jamere Jackson : Yes. I mean from a margin standpoint, we\u2019re very pleased with the progress that we\u2019re making on margins, both gross margins and total operating margins. In our business in Mexico, which is much more mature than obviously what we have in Brazil, we\u2019ve been very pleased with the actions we\u2019ve been able to take on the merchandising side of the business, and that\u2019s given us a very healthy gross margin in that business. And then, if you also think about the inherent advantages that you have from a cost structure standpoint, particularly with wage rates and labor, it\u2019s a very attractive operating margin structure in Mexico. And we believe as our business in Brazil matures and scales over time that we\u2019ll see similar advantages in Brazil. So net-net, what we\u2019re doing on the international side, while it\u2019s a fast-growing business, it\u2019s also going to have a lot of margin calories that come along with it. Bill Rhodes : Yes. I think I would also add, we continue to say that in Brazil, we\u2019re still losing money there. So we\u2019re in an investment phase. We\u2019re ramping up our store count very aggressively. But with that comes some operating losses that are kind of consistent with what we\u2019ve been seeing over the last five or six years. Bret Jordan : I guess, what kind of scale do you need to tip Brazil into profitability? I mean the incremental margin would seem to be very high in that case. Bill Rhodes : I think that\u2019s right, Bret. But frankly, we have a lot of -- a whole lot of very new stores that are in very new markets as we\u2019re expanding. I mean, we\u2019ve opened 40 stores or so in the last 18 months. And those stores are very immature. So, we\u2019ve got to see how those new stores and new markets mature. Right now, they\u2019re causing a pretty good headwind but not unanticipated. Bret Jordan : Okay. Quick follow-up. The U.S. Do-It-For-Me, any channel dispersion, national account, tire service chains versus independents performance? Phil Daniele : Yes, there is. If you kind of looked at the business, and talking about the big traditional nationals and the up and down the street or the local shop, those folks have performed pretty well. The national accounts, particularly the ones that are focused on tires, have been where we\u2019ve struggled the most. And this really goes back to a lot of the weather conversations we had from last year, those tire organizations just aren\u2019t getting the tires off at the same rate. They take the tire off, they see the calipers frozen or lots of rust on those parts in there and they get the job. That\u2019s just not happening at the same rate it has previously. Operator : Your next question is coming from Michael Lasser from UBS. Michael Lasser : Given the performance of the domestic commercial business this quarter, while there was an acceleration, it did fall short of that double-digit level that you had anticipated over the long run. Do you still think this is an achievable goal eventually? And is it more dependent on the performance of the industry to be stronger in order for AutoZone to achieve that goal? Phil Daniele : Yes. Thanks. It\u2019s great question. I think as we said, we\u2019re slightly disappointed with our commercial growth for this particular quarter. We\u2019re happy to accelerate it, but we frankly thought it would accelerate a little bit faster. We\u2019re happy with the progress that we\u2019re making. And to your question about double-digit long term, yes, we think we can get back to those types of growth numbers over time, particularly because we have such low share percent on the commercial side of the business in that 4% to 5% range. So over a long time, we believe we will be able to continue to expand our market share. And as we continue to have these newer stores that we\u2019ve opened over the last five quarters continue to mature and we continue to improve our execution, we believe we will continue to grow our comps in the DIFM space. Michael Lasser : My follow-up question is on the gross margin. It seems like there is a benefit right now from costs coming down, retail is remaining stable. How long is that sustainable? And is there a case where it might make sense to roll back some prices in certain areas in order to drive the retail business to grow a bit faster in the coming quarters? Thank you. Jamere Jackson : Yes. We\u2019re pleased with the progress that we\u2019ve made on gross margins, and it\u2019s really comprised of two pieces. Number one, from a merchandising margin standpoint, we\u2019ve done a great job inside our merchandising organization of finding cost opportunities and pricing opportunities that have given us accretive gross margins, and we\u2019re doing a tremendous job there. Second element of that, quite frankly, has been the work that we\u2019ve done inside the supply chain. If you recall, our supply chain was under tremendous pressure over the last couple of years or so from a cost standpoint, and we\u2019re now starting to see some benefits as some of those pressures have abated. But if you look at this business over the long term, I mean, we have historically been able to churn out positive gross margin improvements in a very-disciplined fashion over time. And that has enabled us to grow our earnings very predictably as we move forward. And when we think about the pricing environment, as we\u2019ve said and we continue to reiterate, pricing is a pretty dynamic environment. We don\u2019t feel like we need to make any pricing investments at this point to be able to operate the business and grow share. But if we do have to make those moves, we\u2019ll certainly do those, if it results in us improving units and ultimately growing EBIT. But at this point, we\u2019re in pretty good shape in terms of where we are from a pricing standpoint and feel that we\u2019re very competitive in the marketplace. Operator : Your next question is coming from Max Rakhlenko from TD Cowen. Max Rakhlenko : So first, can you speak to the competitive environment and if you\u2019re seeing any changes there? And then how would you frame the level of competition today from the WDs compared to both a couple of quarters ago as well as pre-pandemic? Phil Daniele : Yes. I\u2019ll break that up into two parts. If you think about the DIY competition, we\u2019ve had a very stable base of competitors there for a very long period of time. That business is pretty stable, and there\u2019s not a whole lot of new or changing strategies that appears from the competition. On the DIFM side, if you kind of think about our -- what we call our close-in competitors or the public folks, not a lot of changes there other than what O\u2019Reilly did 1.5-year ago or so on their pricing strategy. On the WD side, I think you kind of have to look at pandemic time versus today, one of the things that we believe is they really struggled with some in-stock in some key categories over the pandemic. Over the last, say, a year or so, it appears that they have become more in-stock on those key categories, like everybody has, but they were probably more acutely impacted than a lot of the public players, and they\u2019ve returned to more normal levels. As a reminder, we are still not back to our pre-pandemic levels of in-stock, but we\u2019re pretty darn close. Max Rakhlenko : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then you guys touched on delivery times improving a few times throughout the prepared remarks. So, can you speak to what your average delivery times are now in the markets where you\u2019ve got the megas? And then how much more room do you have to improve? And then just the cadence we should think about in order to get there? Phil Daniele : Yes. Yes, just delivery times can be wildly different depending on proximity of the part and how close that shop may be to a given store or a hub or mega hub. And the delivery times on mega hub inventory or what we call expanded parts can differ wildly if it has to be relayed through a store or delivered directly. Our average delivery times, you\u2019re kind of thinking in that 30-minute range. So, a 10% improvement in delivery times is pretty meaningful, but it may be 3 to 5 minutes, and that matters when a customer is sitting there trying to turn their bay. So we believe we\u2019ll continue to leverage and improve our delivery times. And that\u2019s a key strategy for us because it\u2019s a measure of customer service. Operator : Your next question is coming from Chris Horvers from JPMorgan. Chris Horvers : Congratulations to everybody. So I wanted to follow up on the question more broadly about the consumer. You talked about some of the tire businesses remaining weak. You talked about some discretionary front-room pressure in DIY. I guess, how much of this do you think is just a deferral that\u2019s building that you typically see as a category and as you start to see the slowdown in the consumer front, consumer starts to defer? Are you seeing evidence of that? And do you think we\u2019re still in the point of that sort of getting worse before ultimately that demand potentially releases? Bill Rhodes : That\u2019s a terrific question, Chris. Let\u2019s step back and talk about this on a long-term basis first. If you think about the retail business, which we have much more experience in the retail business and you think about it over long periods of time, we don\u2019t spend a lot of time talking about the strength of the consumer, much more so when tough times happen, i.e., recessions, those have been the periods where we\u2019ve outperformed more so than any other periods of time. So, we don\u2019t spend a whole lot of time on the consumer. We certainly see in the retail business, there\u2019s some trading down going down the good, better, best product assortments. I think in the commercial side, we have suppositions that we haven\u2019t yet proven because we haven\u2019t been in that business at this level for an extended period of time. I believe we think that there may be some consumers that are trading from DIFM into DIY in certain jobs as they\u2019re trying to save money. The thing I would encourage us all to focus on more so than minor fluctuations in consumer sentiment. As we enter the second quarter, the one thing I always worry about is the weather patterns in the second quarter are extremely volatile, and they can have big impacts on our performance, both positive and negative. And as we\u2019ve said, those impacts of the weather, particularly in the Rust Belt, can have ongoing implications as we get into the spring and summer and even the fall months. If we get significant snow and ice, particularly in the Rust Belt in the Northeast, that bodes well for us. If we don\u2019t, then we\u2019re going to have a little bit of a challenge. To me, that is the more impactful thing that\u2019s going to happen in the near term than consumer sentiment. Chris Horvers : And so as a follow-up to that, I think last year, December was pretty good in terms of the weather impact, right? So, it would seem like as you look past today, the comparison gets tough, but it was a record warm winter last year. So, I guess, as you look into your crystal ball, do you think there\u2019s sort of -- ends up being a bit of a weaker start and stronger finish to the second quarter? Bill Rhodes : Yes. It\u2019s interesting, Chris, because the beginning of the quarter last year, there was no weather. We had significant weather around the holidays for a couple of weeks and thought, okay, here we go on, our business responded really, really well. And then the January, February, into March, particularly in the Rust Belt, it was lack of snow and ice and fairly moderate temperatures. Unfortunately, we don\u2019t have a meteorologist on staff either. And at the end of the day, we\u2019re running this business for not quarters, not years, but for decades. And the weather implications, they\u2019re going to even out. I just always try to make sure and caution everybody at the beginning of the second quarter that we could have really strong performance and we can have really weak performances driven by weather, and that doesn\u2019t need to change how we approach our strategy over the long term. Operator : Your next question is coming from Seth Sigman from Barclays. Seth Sigman : I wanted to follow up on commercial. It seems like you\u2019ve really accelerated the rollout of new programs over the last few quarters, obviously, at a time when sales growth on a comp basis has been lower. So, can you just help us better understand what driving that decision right now, particularly as we think about your comment around in-stock levels improving, but not necessarily where you want it to be. So, how do we think about that thought process around accelerating right now? Phil Daniele : Yes. That\u2019s a great question. If you -- and I even mentioned it in the prepared remarks, if we go back to when I was SVP of Commercial, the facts are, our per store performance has improved on a per store basis, the productivity of those individual stores. Looking back over a decade\u2019s worth of time, we went through this phase where we had less than 50% of our stores or around 50% of our stores had commercial. And we slowly -- not slowly, we ramped up to roughly 70 -- high-70s, low-80% of our stores in commercial. Then, we had a period of time where we really focused on per store productivity. And that\u2019s been going on for the last several years, say, 5 to 7 years. Today, we\u2019re at a spot where we\u2019ve had stores that previously didn\u2019t have commercial in them, and we\u2019ve looked at the market differently with a much different share ownership, where we believe those stores are now productive and we\u2019re opening them. If you kind of forecasted that out into the future, we think we\u2019ve probably opened the vast majority of those stores that previously didn\u2019t have commercial. There\u2019ll probably be some, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll see this large opening of previously opened stores that didn\u2019t have commercial programs that do today. But we think those stores over time will be as productive as the stores we have that have been open for a long period of time, and we like that productivity model going into the future. Seth Sigman : Okay. And then just a follow-up would be around thinking about the investments that may be required to drive that improvement in commercial. And I think this was talked about in a few different ways, including around pricing, but I\u2019m thinking more from an OpEx, from an SG&A perspective. It\u2019s been growing at a relatively steady 4% rate per store. That seems reasonable. But I\u2019m curious how you\u2019re thinking about that? How you\u2019re planning for that throughout this year? And whether you need to start to see a pickup in your SG&A growth? Jamere Jackson : We like the investment profile that we have today. And we have been very, very clear that we\u2019re investing in SG&A at a pretty accelerated pace and have done so over the last couple of years or so, and that\u2019s come in the form of store payroll, particularly around our commercial program, but also IT. And these are the kinds of things that are enabling us to drive the growth initiative in commercial. For example, Phil mentioned what we\u2019re doing on delivery times. The work that we\u2019re doing to improve our delivery times is all underpinned by investments that we\u2019ve made in technology that make it easier for us to deploy drivers and, quite frankly, give us a better opportunity to tell our customers exactly where our drivers are in the route and how fast they\u2019re going to get the parts. So, those are some of the examples of things that we\u2019ve invested in, and we\u2019re going to continue to do that. And that investment profile is going to pay dividends for us, in terms of speed, in terms of productivity and in terms of better results, in terms of customer service. Phil Daniele : You also -- you mentioned price, specifically on the DIFM side. And although we made a price investment several years ago, today, we like our pricing strategy. Now, the pricing is always a pretty dynamic point of our business, and we\u2019ll continue to monitor that. But we like where we are from a pricing strategy today. So we don\u2019t see any major or deviation from our current pricing strategy. Operator : Your next question is coming from Zach Fadem from Wells Fargo. Zach Fadem : So when you look at the sequential uptick in your commercial business, but also a sequential downtick in DIY, can you help us parse out the impact of broader industry trends versus your own idiosyncratic factors? And as you put these together, is it fair to say that you expect Q2 and fiscal \u201824 as a whole to look a lot like Q1, or are there factors that give you confidence in both DIY and commercial acceleration as we move through the year, even if the industry is slowing? Bill Rhodes : Yes. I\u2019ll separate the two. First of all, we\u2019ve been in the retail business for a very long time. We\u2019ve had lots of periods of time where we grow in the 0% to 2% kind of range. We\u2019re coming off a period of time in the pandemic where our retail volumes went up 25% to 30%. And we are, frankly, tickled to death to still be holding on to those retail volumes, and we believe we\u2019ve retained about 85% of the share that we gained during that three-year period of time. So we\u2019re very pleased with that. We always want to grow faster. We\u2019re basically flat this quarter. We\u2019re trying new things, but we\u2019re pleased with where we are in the retail business. We aren\u2019t pleased with where we are in the commercial business. But let\u2019s don\u2019t forget, this quarter\u2019s comp of 5.7% is comping against about a 15% comp last year. So while we didn\u2019t meet our goals or aspirations in the quarter, 5% or 2%, we\u2019re not disappointed. We\u2019re not discouraged. We know we have a long runway to go in the commercial business. Again, we\u2019re going to play this in decades, not quarters and years. We feel like that depending on the weather in the second quarter, it\u2019s probably going to look similar to plus or minus 1% or 2%, similar to what we\u2019ve seen in the first quarter. Our hope and our plan is to accelerate, particularly on the commercial side of the business as we enter the second half of the year and we continue to improve our execution. Zach Fadem : Got it. And then for Jamere, I just wanted to follow up on the gross margin, up about 280 basis points. I think you said about 208 basis points of that was LIFO. So first question is, how do you expect the LIFO impact to trend in Q2 and going forward? And then, if we look at the other 70 basis points of benefit from the supply chain and merch margins, is it possible to talk a little more about the impact of these two individually going forward as well as the impact of mix? Jamere Jackson : Yes. So, if you think about LIFO, we\u2019ve got about $57 million or so that we still need to get back through the P&L before we sort of wrap up that piece of our discussions, hopefully. We expect this quarter to be in the 5 to -- call it, 5 to 10-ish ZIP code, depending on what we see in terms of deflation. And the cadence going forward is likely going to be in that ZIP code. If it changes, as we\u2019ve done in the last few quarters or so, we\u2019ll give you our latest update and our latest guidance. And if you think about what we\u2019re doing from a gross margin standpoint, again, if you look at our business over the long term, we typically have driven gross margin improvement from a merchandising standpoint in that, call it, 30 to 35 bps range. And what we said after we came out of the pricing changes that we made a couple of years or so ago that we would continue to run that play with discipline and intensity and be able to drive that. From a supply chain standpoint, again, we are improving in supply chain, but it is largely because our supply chain was under tremendous pressure for a couple of years or so. So I wouldn\u2019t expect that portion to be 40 bps every single quarter, but we\u2019re making steady improvements there. And last quarter, in particular, was a tough quarter from a supply chain standpoint, and our teams have done a great job of turning that around. Operator : Your next question is coming from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. Simeon Gutman : Can you hear me now? Bill Rhodes : Yes, we can. Simeon Gutman : Okay. Sorry about that. I guess the AirPods don\u2019t work. I wanted to ask about gross margin and get your temperature on this that the input cost environment is somewhat unique, forward pricing is coming in a little bit, freight costs are coming down. Is it a unique moment? You mentioned you\u2019re not going to -- you don\u2019t see a need to reinvest in price. What happens to any excess because this industry has pretty good pricing power, do prices come down or is that potential benefit to the gross margin? Jamere Jackson : Well, I think what we\u2019ve said historically, and you\u2019ve seen us certainly behave this way is that as we saw inflation in the business, we took pricing accordingly. And as we come out of that, particularly with things like freight starting to come down, that is an opportunity for us to improve the gross margin profile of the business. The pricing environment has been incredibly rational, has been for decades, and it\u2019s certainly behaving rationally today. And so, we don\u2019t see a need to go deliberately invest gross margin improvements and the pricing to drive demand. But if the case was that we thought that the pricing bands which we\u2019ve established that have helped us grow our market share sort of got out of line, then we would not hesitate to go invest gross margin and be able to go do that to drive units and to drive market share growth. But the environment that we\u2019re operating in today is very, very rational, and we believe that the gross margin improvements that we\u2019re seeing today are an opportunity for us to expand margins and ultimately add more calories to the bottom line. Simeon Gutman : Yes. And then, my follow-up, just on the health of the business. In any way do you think that the DIY softness is a lead or could preclude the progress that you\u2019d like to make on commercial? I heard Bill Rhodes comment regarding it could take a little bit longer, but how do you think about the connectivity of both of these businesses? Bill Rhodes : I think I\u2019ll go back to what I said, Simeon. I think we understand the retail business very well. As we\u2019ve ramped so significantly in the commercial business, I don\u2019t think we know what the cyclical nature of that business is. We have, as I said, a supposition that there are certain people that in difficult recessionary periods of time will trade down into DIY to do a brake job or a battery job where they might have taken it to a shop before. But remember, the last time we saw a real recession, our commercial business was $1 billion. We should surpass $5 billion this year. So, I just don\u2019t think we have the deep insights that we do in the retail business. Operator : Your next question is coming from Daniel Imbro from Stephens Inc. Daniel Imbro : I want to start on the domestic DIFM growth. I guess, you mentioned, Jamere, in your comments, the recent openings are creating an optical headwind just with more immature programs. What is the expected maturity curve or normal maturity curve for a new commercial program? And is it different in a new build versus when you\u2019re retrofitting and adding commercial to an existing store? Phil Daniele : That\u2019s a great question. Yes, it\u2019s not necessarily different between a net new store and one that\u2019s -- a store that\u2019s been open for some number of years and then you add the program later. But those maturity curves, as you would probably imagine, they ramp pretty quick on the very front end, and then it has a hockey stick over those first couple of years, and then they tend to grow consistently after that. Keep in mind, and I\u2019ll go back to one of the things we said earlier, we think an individual store should grow for a pretty long period of time based on the fact that we continue to improve execution and oh, by the way, we only have 4% to 5% market share. And that market share, although it may be slightly different depending on the size of the city or the market that we\u2019re competing in, we\u2019re still at a pretty low share, specifically relative to the WD space who owns the vast majority of that share. Bill Rhodes : I think I\u2019d just add also, you can\u2019t think about these new stores as if they\u2019re in isolation. Many of those customers were servicing already from another store and will take 40% of the projected volume from another store because we can service them so much better because we\u2019re in a much closer proximity. So, every one of them is a little bit different. If they\u2019re in a rural area, we really don\u2019t service those customers, so they start from the ground zero. But many of the urban and suburban markets, we have a little bit of a head start already. Phil Daniele : So net opportunity to help service them better, therefore, you get more share of wallet. Daniel Imbro : Understood. Helpful color. And then my follow-up, just a question on the private label. How is the Duralast penetration trended in recent quarters? If I\u2019m remembering right, you invested a lot in parts quality in the last couple of years. I would think as the consumer becomes more price sensitive or just earning the value of private label should go up? So I\u2019m curious how that penetration is trending? And are we seeing that trade into that either on the DIFM or the DIY side? Phil Daniele : Yes. Keep in mind, so the Duralast investment in product quality and brand perception has been going on for decades, frankly. But I think we really accelerated that probably 10 years ago, maybe a little more. As we think about our family of brands, Duralast has essentially a couple of tiers, Duralast, Duralast Gold, Platinum, and we have some other private labels. But for the most part, we are -- generally speaking, we go for coverage first over choice. So, we don\u2019t have a whole lot of good, better, best up and down. We do in some categories like batteries and brakes and things of that nature. But for the most part, we may have a Duralast brand, and that\u2019s what we have. In some cases, we have a total pro brand, which would be an opening price point. But we don\u2019t have a whole lot of choice in our stores. We\u2019re generally speaking, coverage first, except in key categories, brakes, batteries being the best example. Operator : Your next question is coming from Seth Basham from Wedbush Securities. Seth Basham : Just wanted to follow-up on the DIY business. Weather aside, it seems like you expect the DIY business to not only remain resilient but also potentially improve a little bit, if you\u2019re anticipating a slight decline in transactions and low- to mid-single-digit to ticket growth. Is that an accurate read? Bill Rhodes : I think that\u2019s absolutely accurate, Seth. As we\u2019ve said for many years, the quote unquote, I\u2019ve said the dirty little secret about the retail side of this business is that the transactions have been challenged, and they\u2019ve been challenged for over 25 years. They\u2019re challenged for a lot of reasons because the OE manufacturers are making vehicles and their components much better. Used to, you\u2019d had a lot more frequency of failures on those components. Today, they\u2019re not. They don\u2019t fail as much because they have a lot of technology involved in those components. So, what has happened over a very long periods of time is you have this 2% to 4% drag on transactions, but you have an equivalent amount on the average price per piece because the cost of the technology that\u2019s going into those parts. We didn\u2019t see -- we eliminated that transaction drag during the pandemic and, frankly, grew upper single digits in transactions. Today, our transaction count is starting to look a lot more similar to the way it has been in the past. One of the challenges that we\u2019re still dealing with in the retail business is, last year, we had hyperinflation, double-digit inflation. And so, our ticket isn\u2019t up as much as it normally would be. And I think that\u2019s because we\u2019re normalizing getting past that super high inflation from last year. As we think about the DIY business thinking out 3 or 4 or 5 years, first of all, we\u2019re going to have to continue to improve it, and we have efforts underway to do that. But we believe it\u2019s a 3% kind of ticket drag and hopefully more than -- or sorry, transaction drag on a same-store basis and more than offset that from the average unit retail. Seth Basham : That\u2019s helpful. And just thinking about calendar 2024, if you look at the growth rate expectations for DIY versus DIFM on an industry basis, which one would you expect to accelerate more from \u201823? Bill Rhodes : I think everybody thinks that DIFM is going to grow at these very rapid rates and DIY is going to decline. What we\u2019ve seen over a very significant periods of time is DIY usually grows 3% to 4%, and commercial grows 0.5 point to 1 point faster. I think if you rolled out the next three years, unless there\u2019s some big economic shock or something like COVID, that will probably continue to be the case. Phil Daniele : Seems appropriate, Seth that you got to ask Bill the last question that he probably gets to answer on these calls. So, before we conclude the call, I\u2019d like to take a moment to reiterate we believe that our industry is in a strong position and our business model is solid. We are excited about our growth prospects for the year, but we will take nothing for granted as we understand that our customers have alternatives. We have exciting plans that should help us succeed for the future, but I want to stress that this is a marathon and not a sprint. As we continue to focus on the basics and strive to optimize shareholder value for the future, we are confident AutoZone will be successful. Lastly, I want to wish everyone a happy and healthy holiday season, and thank you for participating in today\u2019s call. Operator : Thank you, everyone. This concludes today\u2019s event. You may disconnect at this time, and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.",

Phil Daniele : Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for AutoZone's 2024 second quarter conference call. With me today are Jamere Jackson, Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax. Regarding the second quarter, I hope you had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not, the press release, along with the slides complementing our comments today, are available on our website at www.autozone.com under the Investor Relations link. Please click on the quarterly earnings conference call to see them. As we begin this morning, I'd like to say how honored I am to talk with you on behalf of our more than 120,000 AutoZoners. As today marks my first conference call as AutoZone\u2019s, President and Chief Executive Officer. At AutoZone, our first priority is to provide what we call WOW! Customer Service. This quarter, the efforts of our AutoZoners increased our total sales by 4.6% and total company same-store sales by 1.5% on a constant currency basis. Both our operating profit and earnings per share grew by a very impressive double-digit rates We continue to build on the phenomenal performance we had over the last several years. Congratulations to our AutoZoners everywhere, who helped us achieve this amazing growth. Before I begin my comments regarding our second quarter sales, as a reminder, this is always our most volatile quarter to predict as the timing and severity of winter weather is both meaningful and variable. It is also our lowest sales volume quarter. This year, the Christmas and New Year's Day holidays fell on a Monday compared to Sunday last year. For commercial sales, this really mattered. Sunday is a very low sales day while Monday is one of the best. While weather across the US was very mild for the first 8 weeks of the quarter, we experienced a polar vortex and snow in the last four weeks. This extreme weather helped to propel us to stronger results in DIY, but muted our sales in commercial as snow in much of the Eastern United States, stayed on the ground for an extended period of time. Again, weather extremes either hot or cold, drive hard part failures and accelerate maintenance over time. For the second quarter, our total company same-store sales were 1.5% on a constant currency basis. As international has become a more important part of our growth story in an area where we are increasingly deploying capital, we will continue reporting on our international performance. We encourage you to focus on the same-store sales, constant currency number where International, again, had a strong quarter, up 10.6%. We are very excited about the short and long-term growth prospects internationally, and we plan to accelerate new store openings over the next several years. Our domestic same-store sales were up 0.3% this quarter compared to 1.2% last quarter and 5.3% in Q2 of last year. Breaking our 12 weeks of sales into the first eight weeks and then the last four weeks, you can see the impact of the holiday shift and the weather volatility. Domestically, we ran a negative 1.8% comp across the first eight weeks and a positive 4.4% comp in the last four weeks. This was even more pronounced when splitting these time frames up between commercial and DIY. Our commercial business grew 2.7% against very strong sales last year of 13.1%. Although our commercial business finished stronger than we started, our results were below our expectations. Across the 12-week quarter, we were up 4.1% for the first four weeks, then down 0.7% over the second four-week segment and up 4.4% over the last four weeks. Although better in the last four weeks segment, of the quarter, our sales were depressed due to the winter storms shutting down many commercial customers, particularly in the mid-south. The holiday shift combined with weather negatively impacted our sales by roughly 2% for the quarter. Despite all this volatility in commercial sales, we are encouraged that we finished the quarter stronger. Commercial sales growth continues to be driven by the key initiatives we have been working on over time. Improved satellite and store inventory availability, material improvements in hub and mega hub coverage, the strength of the Duralast brand with an intense focus on high-quality products, and technology enhancements to make us easier to do business with. We recently launched initiatives focused on improving customer service with faster delivery times in commercial, while very early, we are encouraged by the initial results. In commercial, we continue to see higher growth rates for traffic relative to ticket. In Q2, we opened 20 net new commercial programs. We now have commercial programs in 92% of our domestic stores. Domestic commercial sales represented 30% of our domestic auto part sales for Q2. We believe our commercial business will get stronger and growth rates will improve as we move through the year. Sales growth comparisons get easier in the back half of the year and our execution, customer delivery times, in-stock levels, and parts availability continue to improve. Regarding domestic DIY, we had a negative 0.3% comp this quarter versus last year's comp of positive 2.7%. DIY ran 0.7% across the first four weeks of the quarter, a negative 6.2% across the second four-week segment and a positive 4.8% comp over the last four weeks. The last four-week time segment was accelerated due to the winter weather, as a reminder, last year, the polar vortex hit in the second four-week segment. I'd like to add some color on our regional performance as well. The Northeast and the Midwest markets underperformed the remainder of the country by 500 basis points in the middle four-week segment, only to swing to a positive 1,250 basis points overperformance for the last four-week segment. For the quarter, we saw a 270 basis point favorable performance in the Northeast and the Midwest versus the remainder of the country. Although the Midwest had some extreme cold, we frankly would like to see more winter weather along the East Coast markets, where the winter has been persistently mild for more than two years now. Overall, for the quarter, the West performed least favorably. Headed into the third quarter, we are planning for a more normal weather pattern, meaning we feel weather will not play a big story, one way or the other. Our Q3 performance is always contingent on a normalized tax refund season and we expect this year to be similar to last year. Regarding our merchandise categories and DIY business, our sales floor categories underperformed hard parts as we saw more discretionary pullback, particularly from the low-end consumer. Regarding this quarter's traffic versus ticket growth, our DIY traffic was down 2.2%, while our ticket average was up 1.7%. We expect our ticket growth will return to more normalized levels in the 2% to 4% range as we get further removed from higher inflation last year. We attribute our share gains to improve customer service levels in our store, and our in-stock nearing pre-pandemic levels driven by improved productivity in our distribution centers. While we are up against exceptionally strong same-store sales from a year ago, particularly in commercial, we believe we are making progress. We've made many changes across the organization. From doubling down on many of our long-term execution processes, ensuring that we are hiring the best AutoZoners and reducing turnover, our execution is improving, and we're making steady progress. Before handing the call to Jamere, I'd like to highlight and give some color on our international business. At 859 stores opened internationally or 12% of our total store base, the business had impressive performance last quarter and should continue to grow at a robust pace for the remainder of fiscal 2024. We are leveraging many of the learnings we have in the US to refine our offerings in our international markets. And finally, before Jamere discusses our financial results, I'd like to remind you of our overarching objectives for fiscal 2024. We are focused on growing our domestic commercial business and believe our improved service levels will lead to continued sales growth. We also continue to focus on our supply chain with two initiatives that are in flight and drive improved availability. First is our expanded hub and mega hub rollouts. And secondly, we're making good progress on transforming our distribution network. We have two domestic distribution centers currently under construction in the US, Chowchilla, California and New Kent, Virginia. We are also nearing the completion of our expanded Tepeji, Mexico distribution center. Additionally, we have broken ground on a larger facility that will house our relocated Monterrey distribution center. Our strategy is focusing on leveraging the entire network to carry more inventory closer to the customer, driving sales growth with improved speed and expanded parts availability and improved efficiency. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jamere Jackson. Jamere Jackson : Thanks, Phil, and good morning, everyone. As Phil has previously discussed, we had a solid second quarter, marking our fifth sequential quarter of double-digit EPS growth. This quarter, we delivered 4.6% total company sales growth with a 0.3% domestic comp, a 10.6% international comp on a constant currency basis, a 10.9% increase in EBIT and a 17.2% increase in EPS. We continue to deliver solid results and the efforts of our AutoZoners in our stores and distribution centers continue to enable us to drive growth in a meaningful way. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to elaborate on the specifics in our P&L for Q2. For the quarter, total sales were up -- were $3.9 billion, up 4.6% and let me give a little color on our sales and our growth initiatives, starting with our domestic commercial business. Our domestic DIFM sales increased 2.7% to $980 million and were up 15.8% on a two-year stack basis. Sales to our domestic DIFM customers represented 25% of our total company sales and 30% of our domestic auto part sales. Our average weekly sales per program were $14,051, down 2.8% versus last year. Once again, the weekly sales averages were impacted by the addition of a significant number of immature programs over the last couple of quarters. I'll also remind you that Q1 and Q2 are our toughest comparisons this fiscal year and we expect our year-over-year comparisons to be somewhat easier in the back half of our fiscal year. We now have our commercial program in approximately 92% of our domestic stores, which leverages our DIY infrastructure and we're building our business with national, regional and local accounts. This quarter, we opened 20 net new programs finishing with 5,823 total programs. Our commercial acceleration initiatives continue to make progress as we seek to grow share by winning new business and increasing our share of wallet with existing customers. Importantly, we have a lot of runway in front of us and we will continue to aggressively pursue growth opportunities in commercial, which we believe is our single largest growth opportunity. To support our commercial growth, we now have 101 Mega Hub locations. Our Mega Hubs continue to average significantly higher sales than the balance of the commercial programs and grew more than three times the rate of our overall commercial business in Q2. Our Mega Hubs typically carry roughly 100,000 SKUs drive tremendous sales lift inside the store box and serve as an expanded fulfillment source for other stores. These assets are performing well individually, and the fulfillment capability for the surrounding AutoZone stores is giving our customers access to tens of thousands of additional parts and lifting the entire network. We will continue to aggressively open Mega Hubs for the foreseeable future, and we expect to have north of 200 Mega Hubs at full buildout. On the domestic retail side of our business, our comp was negative 0.3% for the quarter, as Phil mentioned, we saw traffic down 2.2%, offset by 1.7% ticket growth. As we move forward, we would expect to see slightly declining transaction counts, offset by low to mid-single-digit ticket growth in line with the long-term historical trends for the business, driven by changes in technology and the durability of new parts. While DIY discretionary purchases were challenged in Q2, we continue to see a growing and aging car park, a challenging new and used car sales market and a consumer that is likely to continue to invest in their existing vehicles. In addition, miles driven are back to pre-pandemic levels. As such, we believe our DIY business will remain resilient for the remainder of FY 2024. Now I'll say a few words regarding our international business. We continue to be pleased with the progress we're making internationally, our same-store sales grew an impressive 23.9% on an actual basis and 10.6% on a constant currency basis. During the quarter, we opened six stores in Mexico to finish with 751 stores and four stores in Brazil, ending with 108. We remain committed to international and given our success, we're bullish on international being an attractive and meaningful contributor to AutoZone's future growth. Now let me spend a few minutes on the rest of the P&L and gross margins. For the quarter, our gross margin was 53.9%, up 160 basis points, driven primarily by a significant improvement in our core business gross margins and 63 basis points from a non-cash $10 million LIFO charge in last year's quarter versus a $14 million LIFO credit this year. Excluding LIFO from both years, we had a very strong 97 basis points improvement in gross margin, which increased from last quarter's 70 basis point improvement. We've had exceptional gross margin improvement. And in fact, Q2's gross margin was at the highest gross margin rate we've had since Q2 of FY 2021. I'll point out that we now have $43 million in cumulative LIFO charges yet to be reversed through our P&L, and we expect this credit balance to reverse over time. We're currently modeling $15 million of LIFO credits for Q3 based on the deflation experienced in Q1 and Q2. This compares to the $17 million LIFO credit we had in Q3 last year, which means we'll have a $2 million net LIFO headwind in gross profit in Q3. As I've said previously, once we credit back to $43 million through the P&L, we will not take any more credits, and we will begin to rebuild an unrecorded LIFO reserve. Moving to operating expenses. Our expenses were up 6.1% versus last year's Q2 as SG&A as a percentage of sales deleveraged 49 basis points. The accelerated growth in SG&A has been purposeful as we continue to invest in store payroll and IT to underpin our growth initiatives. These investments are paying dividends and customer experience, speed, and productivity. We're committed to being disciplined on SG&A growth as we move forward, and we will manage expenses in line with sales growth over time. Moving to the rest of the P&L. EBIT for the quarter was $743 million, up 10.9% versus the prior year, driven by our positive same-store sales growth and gross margin improvements. Interest expense for the quarter was $102.6 million, up 56% from Q2 a year ago as our debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $8.6 billion versus $7 billion at Q2 end last year. We're planning interest in the $105 million range for the third quarter of FY 2024 versus $74.3 million last year. Higher debt levels and borrowing rates across the curve are driving this increase. For the quarter, our tax rate was 19.6% and down from last year's second quarter of 21.2%, this quarter's rate benefited 360 basis points from stock options exercised, while last year, it benefited 222 basis points. For the second quarter of FY 2024, we suggest investors model us at approximately 23.4% before any assumption on credits due to stock option exercises. Moving to net income and EPS. Net income for the quarter was $515 million, up 8.1% versus last year. Our diluted share count of 17.8 million was 7.8% lower than last year's second quarter. The combination of higher net income and lower share count drove earnings per share for the quarter to $28.89, up 17.2% for the quarter. Now, let me talk about our free cash flow for Q2. For the second quarter, we generated $179 million in free cash flow. We had higher CapEx spending this quarter versus a year ago and we expect to spend close to $1.1 billion in CapEx this fiscal year as we complete the addition of our distribution center capacity expansion ahead of schedule. I'll also remind you that we generate a majority of our free cash flow in the back half of our fiscal year. We expect to continue to be an incredibly strong cash flow generator going forward and we remain committed to returning meaningful amounts of cash to our shareholders. Regarding our balance sheet, our liquidity position remains very strong and our leverage ratio finished Q2 at 2.4 times EBITDA. Our inventory per store was up 1.6% versus last year, while total inventory increased 4.2% driven by new store growth. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable on a per store basis was a negative $164,000 versus negative $227,000 last year and negative $197,000 last quarter. As a result, accounts payable as a percentage of inventory finished the quarter at 119.8% versus last year's 127.7%. Lastly, I'll spend a moment on capital allocation and our share repurchase program. We repurchased $224 million of AutoZone stock in the quarter. And at quarter end, we had just over $2.1 billion remaining under our share buyback authorization. We've bought back over 100% of the then outstanding shares of stock since our buyback inception in 1998, while investing in our existing assets and growing our business. We remain committed to a leverage target in the 2.5 times area and a disciplined capital allocation approach that will enable us to invest in the business and return meaningful amounts of cash to shareholders. So to wrap up, we remain committed to driving long-term shareholder value by investing in our growth initiatives, driving robust earnings and cash and returning excess cash to our shareholders. We're growing our market share, expanding our margins and improving our competitive positioning in a disciplined way. And as we look forward to the remainder of FY 2024, we remain bullish on our initiatives to grow sales behind a resilient DIY business, a fast growing international business and a domestic commercial business that remains underpenetrated and should accelerate in the back half of the fiscal year. I continue to have tremendous confidence in our strategy and our ability to drive significant and ongoing value for our shareholders. And now I'll turn it back to Phil. Phil Daniele : Thank you, Jamere. I want to stress how proud I am to represent the company as only the fifth CEO over the almost 45 years we have been in business. As you've heard, we have a lot of initiatives in flight and we have a great team of AutoZoners in place to take us to the next level. We truly believe we will continue to improve from here. We are well-positioned to grow sales across our domestic and international store bases with both our retail and commercial customers. Our gross margin margins are solid, and our operating expense structure is appropriate for future growth. We are putting our capital expenditures where it matters most. Our stores, our distribution centers and leveraging technology to build a superior customer experience where we are able to say yes to our customers' needs. Fiscal 2024's top priority is enhanced execution. Additionally, we have many strategic projects in various stages of completion. We will continue opening new mega hub and hubs, completing construction on the new distribution centers and optimizing our new direct import facility. We are also in the early stages of ramping up our domestic and international store growth. As you noticed, our international teams posted same-store sales comps on a constant currency basis of 10.6%, much higher than our domestic comps. International has been strong for several years now. While I mentioned all these investments in FY 2024, AutoZone's biggest opportunity remains growing share in our domestic commercial business. While Q2 was below our expectations, we believe we have a solid plan in place for growth over the remainder of the year. We know our focus on parts availability and wow customer service will lead to additional sales growth. We are excited about what we can accomplish and our AutoZoners are committed to delivering results. Now I'd like to open up the call for questions. Operator : Certainly. At this time, we will be conducing a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question for today is from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. Phil Daniele : Good morning, Chris. Chris Horvers : Good morning. Thanks for all the information. My first question for you is, on the domestic Pro business, what's your sense of what the market is actually growing, especially in light of your mix? Obviously, your largest and most relevant competitor has a much smaller mix of national accounts. So I don't think that's obvious to us from the outside. So how are you seeing the performance of national accounts? Are you seeing that start to get better? Do we have to wait to lap that starting in June and July? And how do you think that you're growing relative to the market on the Pro side? Phil Daniele : Yes. So if you kind of segmented the business, I think an area of customer growth on the commercial side that's been more challenged has been the folks that are more focused on under car. So think brakes, suspension, those types of areas related to the tire, one of the four corners of the car, those have probably been the areas that have been more challenged. So for us, that's categories like brakes and suspension, which we talked quite extensively about that over the last year. And that's probably been where we've been most challenged, but I'll go back to the growth opportunities we have in the commercial. At the end of the day, we still have pretty low share and there's a big opportunity for us to continue to grow share in both terms of share of wallet for the customer as well as new customers. Chris Horvers : So does that mean that -- I mean, I guess, if you were going to isolate more of the up and down the street account? Or are you seeing better relative performance? And I know you're reluctant to give too much detail in breaking out more detail, but like any commentary of like what the performance gap between like a national account business versus and up and down the street account would be really helpful. Thank you. Phil Daniele : I would say the national accounts, depending on who they are, they can be wildly positive or negative depending on as you pick up business or your mature business, et cetera. I probably should have mentioned another area that's been challenged for us really for the last 18 months has been the Buy here, Pay here segment in the used car segment. Those have been pretty challenged as well, as they've struggled with inventory. They had incredible sales coming out of the pandemic, and that's probably been a pretty challenged segment as well. Chris Horvers : Got it. And then on the -- you mentioned tax refund is expected to be normal this year. I mean, based on the data that we track, it does seem to be lagging year-over-year. So can you talk about what you mean in terms of the expectation on tax refunds, it would seem like it actually plays out a little more inverted where you get benefit later this quarter versus some headwinds at the start of the quarter? Thank you. Phil Daniele : We're effectively two weeks into our quarter, a couple of weeks into our quarter. And the taxes may be pushed back a week or two. But I think over the 12-week quarter, we expect them to be pretty similar to last year and it's -- the vast majority of the taxes should land well within our 12-week time frame. So maybe slightly moved back a little bit, but not meaningful to the quarter. We expect it to be normal. Chris Horvers : Got it. Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question is from Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Bret Jordan : Hey, good morning, guys. Phil Daniele : Good morning, Bret. Bret Jordan : I guess a question on the competitive landscape as it relates to WDs, they seem to get better after maybe 2022 into 2023 could you talk about the up and down The Street business? Is that a pretty stable competitive environment? Do they still improve? Or are they sort of plateauing? Phil Daniele : Well, on the -- sorry, just to make sure I'm clear on your question. Questions relative to the WDs or to the actual-- Bret Jordan : Yes, WD competitors. It seemed like they were raising their game for a bit after the pandemic and whether they're kind of stable where they are. Are they still -- are they becoming more competitive still? Phil Daniele : Yes, I think it's hard to tell exactly what's going on in their business. But from my sense -- and we see it in our business as well. The vast majority of the supply chain constraints that you had in the latter half of the pandemic have resolved themselves, for the most part, we'll still continue to improve. In stocks are not quite back to where they were previous to the pandemic. I suspect they will continue to improve slightly. And I would also think that the vast majority of the WDs that had the inventory issues in the latter half of the pandemic have probably recovered for the most part. So, I think they're better, but I don't think they're going to have -- they're not going to materially get better over the next short period of time. I would say everybody is pretty much back to slightly lower than pre-pandemic levels. Bret Jordan : Great. And then I guess a question on international. O'Reilly has gone and acquired batt, and it seems like there's some Carquest assets for sale out there. Is Canada a market that you think about is -- or are really focused in Mexico and sort of secondarily Brazil? Phil Daniele : Yes, I would say we have -- I mean, we've got two markets that we're trying to expand in today, which are obviously Mexico and Brazil. And we like where we are in our international footprint. Canada is interesting. I would say -- I would never say we would not look at Canada, but it does have a pretty solid competitive base up there. And we just think there's better opportunities for us at the moment in the current markets that we have. We've got plenty of expansion opportunities in both markets, and we like our performance internationally. It doesn't mean we never go to Canada, but it's not a focus for us at the moment. Bret Jordan : Not in 2024? Phil Daniele : No. You got six months left in 2024. In our 2024 anyway. Bret Jordan : Thank you. Phil Daniele : Thanks Bret. Jamere Jackson : Thanks Bret. Operator : Your next question for today is from Michael Lasser with UBS. Michael Lasser : Good morning. Thank you so much for taking my question. You still see an opportunity to return the commercial business back to a double-digit growth rate over time? Why or why not? Phil Daniele : Hey Michael, great question, and thanks for the question. At the end of the day, we have -- let me go back to our comment on share. We have very low share in this marketplace. I think we will improve from here. Can I tell you exactly when we're going to get back to double-digit growth? No. I would expect that we would grow faster. We have initiatives in place that we'll think we will accelerate our sales growth, particularly in the back half of this year, and it will continue. To nail the date when I think we get back to a positive double-digit number is frankly tough to do. There's a lot of variables in there. I think we'll see consistent share growth and consistent same-store sales and total growth in the commercial market for a long time to come, probably because we have -- we're better than we were as we continue to expand our hubs and mega hubs, improve our assortments and take share, we see a long-term growth trajectory for the commercial side of the business. Michael Lasser : Got you. That's helpful, Phil. Thank you so much. My follow-up question is that AutoZone's gross margin has really been growing nicely for some time now. But at what point does the gross margin get too high such that they invite more competition within the sector, especially on the commercial side? Jamere Jackson : Yeah, I don't think we're over-earning from a gross margin standpoint. We've been very disciplined about gross margin expansion. We've been very disciplined about pricing. And what we're actually seeing in our gross margins today is we come out of the period where we had very high freight costs. We had a supply base that was very challenged from a cost standpoint when you looked at what was happening with transportation costs, wages and just overall inflation in general. As we've moved past those periods, it gives us an opportunity now to start to negotiate deflation with our supply base. And at the same time, as we took pricing during those higher inflationary periods, we're not giving back retails. So what you're actually seeing is a natural evolution of gross margins, if you will. The other thing I'll remind you is that our supply chain was particularly challenged during this time frame. And as our supply chain has improved its cost performance and its efficiencies, we're seeing some gross margin improvement in the from our supply chain. So this industry has been very, very disciplined for decades. We'll continue to be disciplined for decades. We don't believe that we're over earning and it's been a very disciplined approach to gross margin expansion and growing market share over time. Michael Lasser : Thank you so much, Phil, Jamere and Brian, and good luck. Phil Daniele : Thank you. Appreciate it. Operator : Your next question is from Scot Ciccarelli with Truist. Scot Ciccarelli : Good morning guys. Jamere, can I follow up on something you just said. So you're trying to negotiate deflation. So the idea to drive down procurement costs, but fully hold retails? Jamere Jackson : Yeah. I mean, if you look at what's happened in this industry literally for decades is during periods where we have high inflation or even hyperinflation, we've raised retails to basically cover those additions and cost. And then as those cost pressures abate, this industry typically does not lower retails. So what you're seeing is the natural progression that we've seen from a gross margin standpoint as we're now in a period where things are becoming a little bit more deflationary, it gives us an opportunity to expand our margins, if you will. And we've been very disciplined about doing that as has the entire industry over this time period. Philip Daniele : Let me -- can I add just another comment on that. I think if you go back and look at some of the gross margin pressures we had in the -- specifically in the latter half of the pandemic where the supply chain was most stressed. Some of those costs that we had in logistics, either overseas or internal in the US, not all of those costs got pushed on to the consumer, because we didn't want to kill unit demand. So we've hurdled some of that. To Jamere's point, we took those prices up and as the underlying logistics cost basis comes down, that margin is what you're seeing today. We don't think we'll give the pricing back because this industry has been very price rational over to Jamere's point, decades. We just don't see that retail pricing having to come back down. Scot Ciccarelli : So just to clarify. So unless we see a spike in logistics or freight costs, the assumption should be where your current run rate of gross margin is, should be kind of the forward number we should be thinking of? Jamere Jackson : Yes. And the only thing that I would add to that is that we do expect our commercial business to grow faster as we move forward. And so that naturally will put some drag on the gross margin percentage, if you will, we'll take that trade-off because it will give us an opportunity to have more gross margin dollars. So there'll likely be a mix pressure as we move forward with a faster growing commercial business. But the underlying fundamentals of what we're seeing in gross margin in terms of deflation, in terms of improving supply chain profile is something that is sustainable as we move forward. Scot Ciccarelli : Super helpful. Thanks, guys. Operator : Your next question is from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Simeon Gutman : Hey, good morning, everyone. Hey, Phil, I know it's tricky to prescribe when the commercial comps get back to double-digit. Can you give us a sense, I don't know if innings is the right way to think about it, where your efforts are in totality you mentioned faster delivery times, labor normalizing. There's some supply chain investments. So the collective of those, where you are on that journey to where you want to get to? Phil Daniele : Yes. The part of your question there is what are we doing that have helped stabilize our business and get it back on a more stable footing. Our in-stocks have come back to very close to pre-pandemic levels. We've expanded our hubs and our Mega Hubs. We have a long way to go to get to our ultimate goals of North of 200 Mega Hubs. And significantly more hubs as well. Those put hard-to-find parts in the market where we can get those parts to our commercial customers, in particular, faster. It also helps DIY. It will take us quite a few innings, if you will, to get to more than 200 of those hubs. They just take longer to set up and get in place. But that is improving our efforts on delivery times. We've put in -- we've invested in technology. We've been talking about this for quite some time. We continue to leverage the technology we put in the hands of our commercial AutoZoners, and we've got some tests in place in some early innings where we're able to show better delivery times by enabling better technology and leveraging that technology. So that will take time to roll out and it will take time for our AutoZoners to digest the change management. So in the quarter of -- in the number of innings, if we're going to play baseball, which starts pretty soon this year, we'll -- maybe we're in the third or the fourth inning. But hopefully, we'll have a rally in the ninth inning. Simeon Gutman : Good. I wanted to ask you, I think we asked Jamere when he joined, but since you've taken over, I wanted to ask about the EBIT dollar growth question versus margin. And part of it is timely because one of your competitors has been leading into SG&A, and it seems to be working and you're having a bifurcation in performance now in the sector. So your thought process on that balance and then leaning into SG&A over a longer period of time to take advantage of some displacement. Phil Daniele : Yes. On the SG&A front, I would we have investments that are some in CapEx, some obviously in SG&A. To the degree we can invest and grow sales and EBIT dollars, we'll make those investments all day every day. I think over time, you should see us get our EBIT -- our SG&A growth should start to bend down slightly. I wouldn't expect a radical change, but we've had a lot of investments as we continue to improve our operational efficiencies in our distribution centers, in our stores, as our AutoZoners get longer tenured and we hold on and reduce turnover things of that nature, they will obviously start bringing down some of the SG&A on the margins. But we would invest in a kind of -- I think maybe part of your question is, would we take lower margin rates in commercial as a mix of sales like Jamere mentioned to get higher gross profit dollars? Absolutely. I think we can slightly expand our margins on both DIY and commercial over time? Yes. And in an effort to increase EBIT dollars, we'll do that all day long. Those are good exchanges for us. Simeon Gutman : Thanks. Good luck. Phil Daniele : Thanks Simeon. Operator : Your next question for today is from Seth Sigman with Barclays. Seth Sigman : Hey good morning everyone. I wanted to follow up on a couple of those points around the commercial. A lot of noise this quarter, if you step back, there was a lot of momentum in this business pre-2020 and then you clearly outperformed very significantly for multiple years, right? And then the business has slowed, reverting back to maybe more like industry growth, I'm not sure. But I guess the real question is what gives you confidence that this is the right go-forward strategy, particularly from a supply chain perspective? As you think about the next leg of growth, mega hubs has been the central part of that strategy. Is that right? Are there other options that you've thought about? I'd love to get some perspective on that. Thank you. Phil Daniele : Yes. We're extremely excited about both of our -- both our hub and our mega hub strategy. And I'll use the previous comments around innings. We think we'll have well north of 200 mega hub and significantly larger growth of hubs. We're roughly in the third inning or so in hub growth -- mega hub growth. If you kind of said that, that strategy works for us. We see significantly higher growth in those stores -- those types of stores, and they help feed harder to find inventory to what we call our satellite stores, the markets that are close to those hubs. So, yes, we believe that is the right strategy. We will continue to modify and enhance our assortment strategies in both our satellite stores and our mega hubs and hubs to get more relevant inventory closer to the customer. The faster we can get those hard-to-find parts into the shop, the better we will grow market share. And by the way, all of that inventory we add for the commercial customer also finds its way to sales on the DIY customer. Seth Sigman : Okay. Thank you for that. I guess just thinking about the programs that you've added over the last year or so. You've talked about the drag from some of these newer programs. Just any perspective on how the new programs are ramping and if that's any different than what you've seen in the past? Thanks. Jamere Jackson : Yes, I mean the math on that is we've added over the last couple of years or so, almost 600 new programs. So, we went back and retrofitted several stores that didn't have commercial programs. If you remember, historically, we ran sort of 80% to 85% of our stores have a commercial program. That number is now up over 92%. We really accelerated that over the last several quarters. So right now, we've got probably 300 to 400 immature commercial programs that are ramping up in terms of sales and efficiency and performance. And as those programs mature, it will certainly provide a tailwind to our business. So when Phil talks about this notion of our commercial business improving from an execution standpoint, we not only have that working in our favor, but we also have these maturing programs that have only been in operation for the last couple of quarters. And so if we think about the commercial business very broadly, I just keep grounding us back to this notion that we're underpenetrated. We have a four or five share in what's approaching a $100 billion market. We've put a number of things in place that are delivering and have delivered exceedingly well for us. And as we move forward, we like the competitive hand that we have with growing mega hub footprints, improving execution and adding more commercial programs it\u2019s our number one growth priority inside the company and we\u2019re all hands on deck there. And the last thing, I\u2019ll just say is as you think about commercial as you think about the back half of this year, the front half of this year, we had \u2013 we\u2019re up against 15 comp and then a 13 comp, the back half of the year, the comps get a little bit easier. So the comments that we made earlier in our prepared comments are just along the notion that the comparisons get a little bit easier. And as we have all of these things from an initiative standpoint, working in our favor, it gives us a lot of confidence about our back half execution. Phil Daniele : In fact, let me add a little bit on to that, too, specifically around new stores, and I'll maybe take a little bit of a history lesson here. If you go back to FY 2017 or those types of number of years, our productivity per store, we have been on a pretty heavy diet of opening up new programs. And then we decided, from a strategy perspective, we would slow down our new store openings for commercial and really start trying to drive per store productivity. Back then, our per store productivity was in the $7,000 to $8,000 range. Today, as Jamere quoted earlier in the prepared comments, we're significantly higher than that. The other thing that's happened is as we open up new programs in today's environment versus years ago, they are maturing at a faster rate and get to a higher, more plateaued rate. So we like that math. We're probably not going to open up 60 or 600 stores in the next two years or so like we have over the recent history. That will probably slow a little bit. But we like the way the new stores come out of the box and the maturity curves that we get versus, frankly, 2017 or 2018. Seth Sigman : Thank you both. Appreciate it. Phil Daniele : Thanks. Operator : The next question is from Steven Forbes with Guggenheim Securities. Steven Forbes : Good morning. Maybe just a follow-up on Seth's question. And just a way to maybe contextualize the mega hub strategy for us. Is there any way to think through or maybe discuss the contribution to growth, or how ROI is trending behind these investments versus what the potential should be as we look out a couple of few years? Like any numeric contextualization of where we are in the maturity curve of the initiatives? Jamere Jackson : Yeah. I think a couple of things stand out to us. The first is that the mega hubs are growing from a commercial perspective and from an overall perspective, significantly faster than our satellite stores. And it's over 3x what we see on a total domestic business basis. So we've been very pleased with the tremendous sales lift that we're getting inside of the box, both on the DIY and the commercial side. I think the second thing that gives us a lot of confidence is we talked about this notion of testing multiple mega hubs in major metro markets. And we've done that over the last few years or so. And the idea there was to jam more Mega Hubs in a market and jam more parts closer to the customer to see really how high is high. And what we experienced in that time frame was the fact that we didn't see the kind of cannibalization that we would have anticipated, which suggested that the number of Mega Hubs that we could actually operate was significantly higher. And if you'll recall, we had Mega Hub targets that went from 100 to North of 200 over a very short period of time. So we like what we see from a sales standpoint. We like what we see from an earnings standpoint. And we -- and it's not only what we're seeing inside the four walls, but it's also the fact that these Mega Hubs are an important fulfillment source for the surrounding satellite stores. So when you put all that together in the mix, I mean, it's a pretty attractive story for us both in terms of sales and earnings and return on investments. And we're going to go as fast as we possibly can to accelerate. Steven Forbes : Thank you for that. Maybe just a quick follow-up on the outlook for expense growth. I think you mentioned how it should \u2013 should curve downward. But obviously, we also have the store growth acceleration plan, looking at the 2026 and beyond. And so maybe just help provide additional clarity on why there's sort of no disconnect in maybe sort of leaning into the investment cycle ahead of a ramp in store growth? I mean is there any risk that EBIT margin could or should take a step back as you sort of ramp the business for a more accelerated growth period? Jamere Jackson : Yes. I mean we've invested in SG&A in a very disciplined fashion over the last several years or so. And what we've always said is that over time, SG&A growth should be in line with what we see in terms of the top line. Now in the near-term, to your point, we've invested at an accelerated pace behind technology, behind store payroll, all of those things to drive near-term growth for us. And we won't hesitate to go do that. To the extent that there are opportunities for us to invest in SG&A to drive our growth initiatives, we will do that as we've done historically. As we move out and look to accelerate our store growth, there will be some drag on SG&A, but we should be able to manage that within that framework that I talked about. Steven Forbes : Thank you. Phil Daniele : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Greg Melich : Hi, Thanks. Congrats as a nice quarter. I would just like to follow-up on inflation. So if ticket was up 1.7%, is it fair to say that same SKU inflation was sort of near that number and that -- how did items of basket and mix, et cetera, out in the quarter? Jamere Jackson : Yes. So what we've seen on ticket growth was something in the low single-digits right now. And we're seeing same SKU inflation somewhere in that same ZIP code, Greg. I think the important thing to recognize from an inflation standpoint is we came off a period of significantly higher inflation. That's tempered some. Most of that inflation was driven by freight. So, as freight costs have come down, we've seen some of that inflation start to come down as well. And I think the overarching point is that we're continuing to be very disciplined about pricing, where there are opportunity for us to take retail as we will do so and where there's an opportunity for us to get deflation in our cost to drive gross margin, we'll do that as well. We're not expecting sort of the same levels of inflation to drive ticket growth that we have in the last year or so. And so you should expect ticket at some point to normalize back in that low to mid-single-digit range to offset the decline that we naturally see on the DIY side from transactions. Greg Melich : Got it. But presumably, that -- a little bit of acceleration in ticket comes from mix and items of basket rather than inflation ticking up, same SKU? Jamere Jackson : I think that's right. And as we move forward, I mean, it's a pretty dynamic environment out there even from an inflation standpoint. We'll stay very close to and be disciplined about how we manage our business. Phil Daniele : Go back over long periods of time, decades, I mean, this industry has had a slight decline in transactions and units and an increase in ticket average and average unit retails in that somewhere between 2% to 4% range on average, predominantly because of changes in technology, better parts, and some -- it's great to think about belts on a car. Used to -- the average car used to have belts on it today, they have one. And the belt used to be $4 or $5 today about maybe $60 or $70. So that technology change is probably going to continue. And that's been -- it's been a pretty understandable decline in units and a change in average unit retail and we generally have pretty good line of sight to this because the product development takes years and an item may stay in our stores for 20 years. It's the beauty of having a -- frankly, a lower term business that's very predictable. Greg Melich : I'd love to follow up on SG&A and investment there. Jamere, maybe could you level set us on just what wage inflation is running now and what you're looking at for the next few quarters? And if you think about these pilots that you're doing on the faster delivery, it sounds like it's a lot of tech investment. But is there -- are there delivery people as well? Just help us understand that a little bit more, the reacceleration of commercial there? Jamere Jackson : Yes. So, from an average wage standpoint, we're thrilled that we're starting to see average wages now with a two handle versus a three or four that we've seen over the last few years or so. So, as things have cooled down, we've seen some of the hyperinflation go away in the labor markets. We're now back to more normalized sort of wage inflation, if you will. Now, in terms of the investments that we're making, nearly every investment that we have from a growth initiative standpoint is underpinned by some changes in technology. Whether that's on the commercial side with what we're looking to do with some of our commercial acceleration initiatives are on the retail side, nearly all of those growth initiatives are underpinned by some changes that we're making in technology. Our technology teams have done a tremendous job doing that in a very cost-efficient way. And we -- and as we move forward, we'll continue to invest in a very disciplined way as we move forward. In terms of the commercial business and how we improve delivery. I mean we've been very efficient in terms of how we've deployed our physical assets in terms of vehicles and our people assets in terms of labor to manage that commercial business over time, and there hasn't been a meaningful change in what we're doing there. Greg Melich : Great. Thanks and good luck. Phil Daniele : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Max Rakhlenko with TD Cowen. Max Rakhlenko : Great. Thanks a lot guys. So in the stores where you're piloting the initiatives to improve DIFM services and speed levels, just how is that going versus your own internal expectations? And then how are you thinking about scaling these initiatives over the coming quarters? Just curious how early those are and when you think that they could be ready to go lighter? Phil Daniele : Yeah. It's -- thank you for the question. And it's early innings in that. We've been testing some stuff, how to use the data we've had our -- if you think about our handhelds and a lot of technology enhancements that we made over the last couple of years, and now we've got a pretty robust set of data where we can look and figure out what are the best and most efficient ways to use our assets, both human assets, our great AutoZoners and our trucks and where the inventory is, how do we get the part to the customer the fastest to improve customer service? It is early innings, but we like what we see, and we're in the process of rolling that out. There's some change management that we have to work through. There's some changes in technology that our AutoZoners need to be comfortable with and some changes in operations in the stores. But we like what we see, and we've had some pauses and evaluate and then move a little further, pause and evaluate and move a little further, but we're happy with what we see, and we think it will improve customer service to the shop, and we'll get the parts faster to the customer without having to drive the car any faster because we want to be safe. Max Rakhlenko : Got it. It's very helpful. And then can you just speak to your in-store staff retention rates? How are those trending, and if that's translating into improvements in pro satisfaction? And then ultimately, better demand trends in those stores. Phil Daniele : I'll say two things have happened. One is -- and we've mentioned it a couple of different times. We've if you think about staffing in whole, it's not back to pre-pandemic levels, but it's better than it was during the pandemic. We still have work to do to get retention and turnover back down to pre-pandemic levels, both in our stores and in our distribution centers, but improving, and we like the trends that we're seeing, although we'd love it to be faster. The other thing we did on commercial, and Jamere has mentioned it a couple of times, we've opened up roughly 600 stores in slightly over two years. As we did that, obviously, that takes your -- the commercial specialists and the TSMs and things of that nature, those really high caliber of people that were concentrated in some stores, we expanded pretty quickly. So you got new promotions and people got to learn their job and learn those new shops and get really ingrained with those long-term relationships, and that will continue to get better as we move forward. So it's kind of two elements. Max Rakhlenko : Great. Thanks. Best regards. Jamere Jackson : Thanks. Phil Daniele : Thank you. Appreciate the question. I think we have time for one last call. Operator : The next question is from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Brian Nagel : Hi, good morning. Thanks for slipping me in. Phil Daniele : Hi, Brian. Brian Nagel : So with my first question, I know there's been a lot of questions on commercial, and we recognize this has been an ongoing conversation. There's a lot of moving parts here as we look at the kind of the near-term trends. But I guess not at the risk of being too simplistic. We for a long time have talked about a key measure of success in commercial, so to say, climbing that list. In each individual store climbing that list of the \u2013 your mechanic customer. So the question I have is, as you pull and talk to your stores, are you seeing any indications that you're falling further down those lists or maybe the climb up some of these lists stalled? Phil Daniele : Yes. I mean, to say we're falling down the list. I don't think that would be a good characterization. Is there always opportunities to improve? The answer is yes. Go back to our share comments that we've made several times we still have under 5% share, we believe. And as we get better and mature in relationships, open up new stores, get better in new stores and drive parts availability and what we call internally time to shop. The quicker we can get those parts to the shop, the better we'll be. And this -- I think there's a bit of a misnomer that a customer has a first call. They all -- nobody has every part that's needed in a particular shop. So a customer will have multiple people they call. we think we will continually move up the call list and gain a larger share of wallet for each customer, but to say that you're always first call with any particular customers, that's pretty rare for a customer to put all of their eggs in one basket because nobody's got all the parts. It's virtually impossible. There's too many SKUs. So I think we will continue to get better. I think we've gotten better from where we were, and we've got a long road in front of us to continue to take market share and gain new customers. Brian Nagel : That's very helpful. And then a quick follow-up just on weather. And in your prepared comments, you talked about some of the sales volatility we saw through the fiscal Q2. and obviously, weather was a key component of that. But I guess the question I have is as you look at the weather, maybe we're not even through winter yet, but as you look at the weather, has it been enough -- has there been enough winter weather, so to say, give you that normal driver business as we head into spring and even in the summer? Phil Daniele : Yes. Great question, and time will tell. We're not completely through winter weather, as you said. I think if I could lay out the weather calendar that I'd love to have, like I said, I would love to have more really cold winter in the big cities on the eastern seaboard. I mean if you're in New York, you've got a little bit of snow this year and it was gone within 24 hours. It's a heck of a lot more than you got last year. But New York, Philadelphia, D.C., those areas really haven't had a lot of really extreme cold weather. The Midwest did and the eastern half of the Northeast or the western half. I'm sorry, I got some pretty cold weather. But the big metro cities along the East Coast just really haven't for more than two years now. So I would love to have had more there, but that's something that we can't control. We're going to do our best to go grow market share in those company -- in those areas of the country, no matter what. So thanks for the follow-up question. Brian Nagel : Thanks, guys. Thank you. Phil Daniele : Thank you. All right. So before we conclude the call, I'd like to take a moment and reiterate we believe that our industry is in a strong position, and our business model is solid. We are excited about our growth prospects for the year, but we will take nothing for granted as we understand our customers do have alternatives. We have exciting plans that should help us succeed in the future, but I want to stress that this is a marathon and not a sprint. As we continue to focus on the basics and drive to optimize shareholder value for the future, we are confident, AutoZone will be successful. Thank you for participating in today's call. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

If not, the press release, along with the slides complementing our comments today, are available on our Web site www.autozone.com under the Investor Relations link. Please click on the quarterly earnings conference calls to see them. As we begin the call, I want to say thank you to our more than 120,000 AutoZoners across all of our businesses for delivering solid earnings results in the face of a difficult macro environment. With our continued focus on providing what we call WOW! Customer Service, our AutoZoners delivered our total sales increase of 3.5%, total company same store sales up 1.9% and on a constant currency basis, total company same store sales of 0.9%. Also, our operating profit grew 4.9% while our earnings per share grew 7.5%. In spite of our lower than planned sales, we managed our business well and we were able to deliver bottom line results that continued to build on the phenomenal results we've had over the last several years. Congratulations to our AutoZoners everywhere who helped us achieve this quarter's growth. Your dedication to delivering on our commitment of WOW! Customer Service is always inspiring. Before I begin my comments on our third quarter sales, as a reminder, the backdrop to this quarter and every third quarter of our fiscal year includes tax refund season. It is roughly a $300 billion influx of cash to our customers. It begins around Valentine's Day and generally last four to six weeks. These dollars matter to our customers and meaningfully impact their shopping patterns in our stores. This year, refund dollars ended up slightly versus the previous year. However, February refund flows were lower than expected and negatively impacted the first three weeks of the quarter's domestic same store sales. While the refund flows did catch up later in the later weeks, we felt the delayed refunds were a drag on our sales results through February and early March, similar to what you may have heard from other retailers. Secondly, the weather was unfortunately cooler and wetter than we had expected and planned, especially in the Northeast and the Midwest markets. As a result, sales in these markets were noticeably below the remaining markets with this pattern more pronounced over the last eight weeks of our 12 week quarter. Again, extreme weather, either hot or cold, drives hard part failures and accelerates maintenance over time, thereby driving higher sales. So on balance, we believe this quarter's sales were impacted negatively by the late start of the tax refund season, while the last eight weeks were impacted by cooler than weather -- than we had planned. Despite these headwinds, we also had many successes. We gained share in our retail business, and we believe we continue to gain share in commercial. We continue to be encouraged by our supply chain initiatives. The construction of our two new domestic DCs are on track for Q2 FY25 opening as well as our continued forward deployment of inventory across both our hubs and our mega hubs. We continue to see progress on our initiatives within our domestic commercial business that give us confidence about accelerated growth. While it is prudent for us to remain cautious on our outlook for the remainder of the year, we believe sales will accelerate over time. We are excited about our commercial initiatives that are providing deeper parts coverage closer to the customer with faster delivery times, improving customer service and thereby, driving sales. For the third quarter, our total company same store sales were 0.9% on a constant currency basis. As we have mentioned, international has become a more important part of our growth story in this quarter. We delivered another strong quarter, up over 9.3% on a constant currency basis. We continue to be very encouraged with both our short term and long term growth prospects we have internationally and we plan to accelerate new store openings and drive operational improvements in these markets over the next several years. Our domestic same store sales were flat this quarter compared to up 0.3% last quarter and up 1.9% in Q3 of last year. As I mentioned previously, we believe our sales were impacted in the first four weeks of the quarter by the delayed tax refund season and the last eight weeks by the mild wet weather pattern across much of the US. Domestically, we ran a negative 0.7% comp across the first four weeks and collectively across the last eight weeks of plus 0.3% comp. Our commercial business grew 3.3% against last year's Q3 growth of 6.3%. Our commercial results were higher in the first eight weeks and relatively consistent, but slightly lower the last four weeks. The last four weeks comparison were the most difficult of the quarter. Weather impact was more pronounced in the last eight weeks of the quarter and it was during this time that the regional performance disparities became more apparent. The Northeast and the Midwest underperformed the remainder of the country by close to 200 basis points over the last eight weeks of the quarter. Commercial transaction counts were up and were partially offset by slightly negative ticket growth, which was attributable to similarly negative inflation on a same SKU basis. We opened 20 net new commercial programs and now have commercial in 92% of our domestic stores. Domestic commercial sales represented 31% of our domestic auto part sales for Q3. Despite the choppiness in our commercial sales results this quarter, we are planning for a stronger growth rate in Q4 behind continued execution of our growth initiatives and somewhat easier comparisons. Commercial sales growth continues to be driven by the key initiatives we've been working on over time, improved satellite store inventory availability, material improvements in hub and mega hub coverage, the strength of the Duralast brand with an intense focus on high quality parts and products and technology enhancements that make us easier to do business with. We are encouraged by our recently launched initiatives focused on improving customer service with faster delivery times. As we roll these initiatives to the majority of the chain, we are anticipating faster growth and accelerated share gains. Regarding domestic DIY, we had a negative 1% comp this quarter versus last year's comp of 0.6%. DIY ran negative 2% across the first four weeks of the quarter, positive 0.1% the second four week segment and negative 0.1% comp over the last four weeks. Regionally, the Northeast and the Midwestern markets underperformed the remainder of the country by approximately 100 basis points over the last eight weeks of the quarter similar to our commercial business. Heading into the fourth quarter, we feel weather should be less volatile and we are planning accordingly. Regarding our merchandise categories in the DIY business, our sales floor categories, and particularly discretionary categories, underperformed hard parts. We also saw several seasonal merchandise categories and weather sensitive hard part categories being off our planned results due to the cooler than expected weather. Regarding this quarter's traffic versus ticket growth, our DIY traffic was down approximately 2% while our ticket average was up only 1%. We expect our average ticket growth will return to more normalized levels in the 2% to 4% range as we get further removed from the higher inflation from the last couple of years. We attribute our previously mentioned DIY share gains to improve customer service levels in our stores and our in-stock nearing pre-pandemic levels, driven by most of our vendor partners returning to more normalized operations, meaning recovering from the pandemic sales surge and supply chain disruptions. As we look forward, we are continuing to focus on flawless execution and delivering WOW! Customer Service will drive our accelerated sales growth in our domestic business. Before handing the call to Jamere, I'd like to highlight and give some color on our international business. At 872 stores opened internationally or 12% of our store base, this business had yet again impressive performance last quarter and should continue to grow at a robust pace for the remainder of fiscal year 2024 and beyond. We are leveraging many of the learnings we have in the US to refine our offerings in our international markets. And before Jamere discusses our financial results, I'd like to remind you of our key objectives for fiscal year 2024. We are focused on growing our domestic commercial business and we believe our improved customer service levels will lead to continued sales growth. We are also focused on our supply chain with two initiatives that are in flight to drive improved availability versus our expanded hub and mega hub rollouts. And secondly, we are making good progress on adding capacity to our distribution network. We have two distribution centers that are nearing completion in the US, one in Chao Chilla, California, and the other in New Kent, Virginia. We are also very close to completing the expansion of our Tapeje Mexico DC. And last quarter, we broke ground on a larger facility that will house our relocated Monterrey, Mexico DC. Our strategy is focused on leveraging the entire network to carry more inventory closer to the customer, driving sales growth with improved speed, expanded parts availability and improved efficiencies. These capacity expansions will underpin our future growth. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jamere Jackson. Jamere Jackson : Thanks, Phil. And good morning, everyone. As Phil has previously discussed, we had a solid third quarter with 3.5% total company sales growth, flat domestic comp growth, a 9.3% international comp on a constant currency basis, a 4.9% increase in EBIT and a 7.5% increase in EPS. We continue to deliver solid results and the efforts of our AutoZoners in our stores and distribution centers continue to enable us to drive earnings growth in a meaningful way. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to elaborate on the specifics in our P&L for Q3. For the quarter, total sales were $4.2 billion, up 3.5%. And let me give a little more color on sales and our growth initiatives. Starting with our domestic commercial business. Our domestic DIFM sales increased 3.3% to just under $1.2 billion and were up 9.6% on a two year stack basis. Sales to our domestic DIFM customers represented 31% of our domestic auto part sales. Our average weekly sales per program were $16,400, down 2.4% versus last year's $16,800. Now as a reminder, we have added over 300 new programs over the last 12 months and these new programs are diluting the overall sales per program. We are, however, extremely pleased that these programs are maturing significantly faster than our historical performance and position us well for the future. We now have our commercial program in approximately 92% of our domestic stores, which leverages our DIY infrastructure and we\u2019re building our business with national, regional and local accounts. This quarter we opened 20 net new programs, finishing with 5,843 total programs. Our commercial acceleration initiatives continue to make progress as we grow share by winning new business and look to gain share of wallet with existing customers. Importantly, we have a lot of opportunity in front of us and we will continue to aggressively pursue growth in the highly fragmented commercial market, which we believe is our single largest growth opportunity. To support our commercial growth, we now have 103 mega hub locations with two net new mega hub opened in Q3. Our mega hub continue to average significantly higher sales than the balance of the commercial programs, and grew more than 3 times the rate of our overall commercial business in Q3. Our mega hub typically carry roughly 100,000 SKUs, drive tremendous sales lift inside the store box and serve as an expanded fulfillment source for other stores. These assets are performing well individually and the fulfillment capability for the surrounding AutoZone store is giving our customers access to tens of thousands of additional parts and lifting the entire network. We will continue to aggressively open mega hub for the foreseeable future, and we expect to open well north of 200 mega hub at full build-out. These assets are key to our growth plans. On the domestic retail side of our business, our comp was down 1% for the quarter. As Phil mentioned, we saw traffic down approximately 2%, offset by approximately 1% ticket growth. Overt time, we would expect to see slightly declining transaction counts offset by low to mid single digit ticket growth, in line with the long term historical trends for the business, driven by changes in technology and the durability of new parts. While DIY discretionary purchases were challenged in Q3, we continue to see a growing and aging car park, miles driven back to prepandemic levels, a challenging new and used car sales market and a consumer that is likely to continue to invest in their existing vehicles. As such, we believe our DIY business will remain resilient. Now I'll say a few words regarding our international business. We continue to be pleased with the progress we're making internationally. Our same store sales grew an impressive 18.1% on an actual basis and 9.3% on a constant currency basis. During the quarter, we opened 12 stores in Mexico to finish with 763 stores, and one store in Brazil ending with 109. We remain committed to international. And given our success, we're bullish on international being an attractive and meaningful contributor to AutoZone's future growth. Now let me spend a few moments on the rest of the P&L and gross margins. For the quarter, our gross margin was 53.5%, up 102 basis points, driven by a significant improvement in our core business gross margins and 15 basis points from a noncash $24 million LIFO credit in this quarter versus a $17 million LIFO credit in Q3 of last year. Excluding LIFO from both years, we had a very strong 87 basis point improvement in gross margin. Our merchandising and supply chain teams have done an exceptional job of driving gross margin improvement this year. I will point out that we now have $19 million in cumulative LIFO charges yet to be reversed through our P&L and we expect this credit balance to reverse over the next couple of quarters. We're currently modeling approximately $10 million in LIFO credits for Q4 based on the deflation experienced this past year. This compares to $30 million LIFO credit we had in Q4 last year, which means we would have a $20 million net headwind from LIFO in gross profit. As I've said previously, once we credit back the $19 million through the P&L, we will not take any more credits and we will begin to rebuild an unrecorded LIFO reserve. Moving to operating expenses. Our expenses were up 6% versus last year\u2019s Q3 as SG&A as a percentage of sales deleveraged 76 basis points. On a same store basis, SG&A grew 3.3% as we continue to invest in initiatives that drive speed, productivity and improve customer service. We are committed to being disciplined on SG&A growth as we move forward and we will manage expenses in line with sales growth over time. Moving to the rest of the P&L. EBIT for the quarter was $900 million, up 4.9% versus the prior year, driven by our positive same store sales growth and gross margin improvements. Interest expense for the quarter was $104 million, up 41% from Q3 a year ago as our debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $9 billion versus $7.3 billion in Q3 last year. We are planning interest in the $148 million range for the fourth quarter versus $109 million last year. Higher debt levels and borrowing rates across the curb are driving this increase, along with the extra week that we will have in this year's fourth quarter. For the quarter, our tax rate was 18.1% and up from last year's third quarter of 17.4%. This quarter's rate benefited 479 basis points from stock options exercised, while last year it benefited 595 basis points. For the fourth quarter, we suggest investors model us at approximately 23.2% before any assumptions on credits due to stock option exercises. Moving to net income and EPS. Net income for the quarter was $652 million, up 0.6% versus last year. Our diluted share count of $17.8 million was 6.4% lower than last year's third quarter. The combination of slightly higher net income and lower share count drove earnings per share for the quarter to $36.69, up 7.5% for the quarter. Now let me talk about our free cash flow. For the third quarter, we generated $434 million in free cash flow. We had higher CapEx spending this quarter versus a year ago and we expect to spend close to $1.1 billion in CapEx this fiscal year as we complete the addition of our distribution center capacity expansion ahead of schedule. I will also remind you that we generate a majority of our free cash flow in the back half of each of our fiscal years. We expect to continue being an incredibly strong cash flow generator going forward and we remain committed to returning meaningful amounts of cash to our shareholders. Regarding our balance sheet, our liquidity position remains very strong and our leverage ratio finished Q3 at 2.5 times EBITDAR. Our inventory was up 7.9%, driven by a combination of inventory per store growth to support our growth initiatives, improvements in in-stock levels along with new store growth. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable on a per store basis, was $168,000 negative versus $215,000 negative last year and negative $164,000 negative last quarter. As a result, accounts payable as a percent of inventory finished the quarter at 119.7% versus last year's 126.5%. Lastly, I'll spend a moment on capital allocation and our share repurchase program. We repurchased $735 million of AutoZone stock in the quarter. And at quarter end, we had $1.4 billion remaining under our share buyback authorization. We have bought back over 100% of the then outstanding shares of stock since our buyback inception in 1998, while investing in our existing assets and growing our business. We remain committed to a leverage target of 2.5 times and a disciplined capital allocation approach that will enable us to invest in the business and return meaningful amounts of cash to shareholders. So to wrap up, we remain committed to driving long term shareholder value by investing in our growth initiatives, driving robust earnings and free cash flow and returning excess cash to our shareholders. We're growing our market share, expanding our margins and improving our competitive positioning in a disciplined way. And as we look forward to Q4, we remain bullish on our initiatives to grow sales behind a steady DIY business, a fast growing international business and a domestic commercial business that remains underpenetrated. I continue to have tremendous confidence in our strategy and our ability to drive significant and ongoing value for our shareholders. And with that, I'll turn it back to Phil. Phil Daniele : Thank you, Jamere. We are proud of the results our team delivered this last quarter. We remain on track to deliver a solid 2024, but we must continue to focus on superior customer service and flawless execution. Execution and our culture of always putting customer first are what defines us. We are well positioned to grow sales across our domestic and international store bases with both our retail and commercial customers. Our gross margins are solid and our operating expense structure is appropriate for future growth. We are putting our capital investments where they matter most, our stores, distribution centers, and leveraging technology to build a superior customer service experience where we are able to say yes to our customers' needs. Fiscal 2024's top priority has been enhanced execution. We are making good progress. Additionally, we have many strategic projects in varying stages of completion. We will continue opening new mega hub and hubs, completing construction on our new distribution centers and optimizing our new direct import facility. We are also in the early stages of ramping up our domestic and international store growth. As discussed, our international teams posted same store sales comps on a constant currency basis of plus 9.3%, continuing several years of strong growth. While I mentioned all these investments in FY24, AutoZone's biggest opportunity remains growing share in our domestic commercial business. We continue to believe we have a solid plan in place for growth for the foreseeable future. We know our focus on parts availability and WOW! Customer Service will lead to additional sales growth. We are excited about what we can accomplish, and our AutoZoners are committed to delivering the results. Now I'd like to open up the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question for today is from Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Bret Jordan : Could you talk a little bit about the cadence? You commented at the end of the quarter in the commercial business ended a bit softer and obviously very early in Q4, but could you give us any color sort of as we've trended sequentially into the fourth? Phil Daniele : The commercial business, like we said, has been choppy. The last four weeks were the more difficult compares for the quarter. And as we said several times, I hate being the weatherman, but this particular spring has been challenging for us from a wet and cooler season. And typically, in the latter half of the quarter, we start seeing some improved performance around the hot weather categories like AC chemicals and AC hard parts and battery sales, et cetera, and we just didn't get that through the last several weeks of the quarter. Bret Jordan : And then I guess on a calendar year basis, could you just maybe give us some color where you see inflation in pricing for your mix as the compares, I guess, gets\u2026 Phil Daniele : On the inflation front, that has definitely been challenging as we've come off several years of hyperinflation, if you will, at our average unit retail on both the DIY side and the commercial side, frankly. I suspect the average unit retail same-SKU inflation would get back to more normal growth levels as we move further and further away from the inflation that we had over the previous years. Now those inflation numbers start to come back as we get in the later quarters of the calendar year, and I suspect they'll return to more normalized levels over time. Operator : Your next question is from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. Christian Carlino : It's Christian Carlino on for Chris. First question on gross margin. Supply chain crisis aside, you've grown the commercial business pretty considerably over the past couple of years. So could you speak to, I guess, the degree of vendor rebates you've yet to receive and how long you should benefit from this catch-up period for all the growth that you've had since prior to the pandemic? Jamere Jackson : Certainly, our gross margins, as it relates to our relationship with vendors, has an opportunity improved. As Phil mentioned previously, we are coming off a period of significant hyperinflation, particularly in the areas like flat -- freight. Quite frankly, we saw snarls across the majority of the supply chain. And it impacted them from the standpoint of having higher labor costs, higher input costs in total. So we're starting to see that abate and that's given us an opportunity to go and negotiate for some deflation as we move forward. We're still in early innings there. And I wouldn't say that all of the inflationary pressures have abated but we're certainly in a much better position today than we were a year ago. Christian Carlino : And then now that you're starting to lap some of the earlier signs of maintenance deferral at some of the tire centers, are you starting to see trends improve with that cohort of customers? And just broadly, could you speak to the performance at like the national accounts, the tire centers, the buy here, pay here dealers and then the up and down the [indiscernible]? Phil Daniele : I would say if you kind of broke apart those segments that you just talked about, probably the most challenged group of customers or customers that are -- drive their repair revenue from tires. Tires have definitely been a pressure point. I think that downward trend on tires has probably flattened out a little bit. But I still think the tire segment, in particular, is under some pressure and has been for quite a while. On your other segment of customers, the buy here, pay here lot and used car centers, those have been more challenged as well. You think about there was tons of used cars that were sold over the last two years or so, and I think that's just been slower. Also, as the consumers under a little bit more economic pressure due to inflation, not just in our category but across all of retail and across life at the moment, I think there's more pressure on some of those bigger ticket items like tires. New tires is a pretty big purchase for a customer. Operator : Your next question for today is from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Simeon Gutman : My first question is on mega hubs. Can you share some math on them? What -- you mentioned 200 over time, can you tell us year-over-year how many should we see per year? And then can you frame the one year lift from them, please? Jamere Jackson : So certainly, from a mega hub standpoint, we're pretty excited about our future there. As we've announced, we'll likely have over 200 mega hubs at full build-out. Last year, we opened 20, we're likely going to open less than that this year. And we've got work to do. But our pipeline is very strong and our pipeline is robust as we look into FY25. So we're going to go as fast as we possibly can. These are big boxes and difficult to find places. But we've done a really good job and worked really hard to fill up that pipeline and you'll start to see that accelerate as we move into FY25 and beyond. Phil Daniele : Hubs are up -- I'll just add on. Hubs are -- these have been great stores for us. I think looking over history, we thought we'd have 30 to 40 of these things in various markets. And now we see line of sight to, like Jamere said, well north of 200 mega hubs. And the hubs are still an important part of our strategy as well, which has slightly less SKU count -- well, 30,000 to 40,000 less SKUs than a mega hub, but both of those store bases are great for us. They help significantly on the commercial side of the business and they lift the DIY market as well. So they're great assets for us and performed better than our normal stores. Simeon Gutman : And then can I ask -- I know you don't give forward guidance, in thinking about fiscal '25, the first half and the second half. Are you -- is it fair to think that there's -- not a hockey stick, but it will be second half weighted? In other words, the top line backdrop improves mildly, hopefully from weather, but you are going to lap some big gross margin gains core, non-LIFO while you'll need the top line to lever the expenses. So it looks like you could see some second half weighting in next year. Curious if that's -- some thoughts on sequencing for next year. Phil Daniele : Yes, like you said, we don't give guidance, but here's some things that I'll tell you that I'm excited about. One is weather has been challenging. And we -- I think over summer -- summer is going to heat up, we should get some -- the merchandise categories and mix and things of that nature will help our sales as we move a little bit forward. And although slower than we'd like, our commercial initiatives are working and we think those will continue to mature over time. And in a segment where we're underpenetrated in share, below 5% share on the commercial business, we think we have ample opportunity to continue to grow over time with improved service, improved hard part and expanded part availability and better service and delivery on the -- based on the things we talked about, parts investments, mega hub investments and technology investments that will grow our sales. But it won't be -- it's not going to be a hockey stick that turns around in six weeks or something, it's going to take time. Operator : Your next question is from Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Greg Melich : I wanted to follow up on inflation, because it sounds like it was still across the box slightly positive in the quarter. And -- but I think I heard in commercial that it was same SKU, slightly negative. So could you just give us a little more of the detail on that? Jamere Jackson : I think two things from an inflation standpoint. Number one, the backdrop is we're coming off a period of significantly more inflation last year. So as we look at this year and look at that impact on our ticket growth, our ticket growth is lower than it's been historically. And quite frankly, that's had an impact on the top line growth. You've heard me say a number of times that while hyperinflation is difficult from a cost standpoint. From a top line standpoint, inflation has been our fronted, and we just don't have that tailwind right now. We do expect inflation to normalize over time but the high freight cost that we had and the significant inflation that we had in the industry, it's just not there right now. And this industry has been very disciplined about passing that inflation through but also in times where the inflation is not there, we've also been disciplined about the pace with which retails are raised. So we feel pretty good with where we are in total. We think inflation is going to return. But right now, it's running significantly lower than it was a year ago and lower than what we've seen historically. Greg Melich : And just to be clear, in the quarter, it was zero? Jamere Jackson : Yes, we saw ticket growth across the business being very muted in the quarter and we're seeing some inflation in certain categories and other categories we're seeing hardly any inflation. And as we manage our way through that, we've just got to make sure that we're pricing dynamically to price for inflation where we see it and in places where you don't see it. Obviously, we're being disciplined like this industry has been for a really long time. Greg Melich : So still discipline and you expect it to normalize, but right now, it's not, it's on the\u2026 Jamere Jackson : Yes, it's pretty muted right now. Greg Melich : And then my follow-up was just to understand a little bit more about the consumer trends. I know you've talked in the past that we really haven't seen trade down on the DIY side at all. I'm just curious if that started to show up as a way. I think you mentioned maybe fewer items in the basket. Could you just double click on that a little bit? Phil Daniele : I think there's a couple of things going on with -- if you kind of think about average ticket, some of it, frankly, has been mix of category, and I'll talk about it in a couple of different ways. One is highly discretionary items have been challenged for a while. Some of those have a great ticket. There's probably slightly fewer pieces in the basket. But I think some of that has been driven by the environment and the weather. Big jobs like air conditioning, if you will, those have been definitely muted in the spring time. Those are big jobs that have big tickets, multiple parts in them. When it rains, you're probably going to sell two wiper blades and when it's nice, people decide to do a tune up, you may have all kinds of filters that have significantly more parts transactions -- pieces per transaction in them. So I think ticket average will improve. It's not going to be improved based on hyper inflation like we've had over the last couple of years. But I do believe it will improve as we move through the summertime and get a better mix of product as we move through some of this more challenging weather scenario. Operator : Your next question for today is from Scot Ciccarelli with Truist. Scot Ciccarelli : Given the slowdown in sales that obviously we're talking about, is there anything else you guys think you can do to accelerate the sales trends, or is it just a matter of executing the way you can and you need the broader environment to improve? And then kind of part two of this is, is there a point at some stage where if sales stayed sluggish, does it potentially tempt you to go through another round of price investments? I know that wasn't the original intent, but a long period of -- so their sales could potentially raise that [temptation], I would think. Phil Daniele : Let me start with kind of your first -- the first part of your question. Are there things that we can do to improve? The answer is yes. We're in the process now of doubling down on customer service and execution. And on the commercial side, we're continuing on both sides. We're continuing to invest in hard parts coverage and hubs and mega hubs. Those drive sales. On the commercial side, we continue to invest in ways to service the customer better and faster and we like those initiatives that we have. So I think those help to improve our sales execution, if you will. The second part of the question\u2026 Jamere Jackson : The second part is on pricing. From a pricing standpoint, as I mentioned before, we've been very disciplined on pricing. And we executed around the pricing initiatives a couple of years and it helped us grow our shares and improve our units. We like where we're priced today. And we don't see the need to go move the needle on pricing as a way to go accelerate sales growth. I'll just remind you that the lion's share of the demand in this business is relatively inelastic. So this industry has been disciplined about pricing for decades, and we continue to see that being the case. And to Phil's point, I mean, we're committed and doubling down on our growth initiatives. It's improving the quality of our parts, it's expanding the assortments with mega hubs, it's improving delivery times, leveraging technologies, being competitive on pricing, all those are the kinds of things that are driving our business as we move forward, and we're pretty excited about the future. Phil Daniele : Our pricing strategy\u2019s on both DIY, we like where we are and we believe we have the right strategies on both sides of the business. We made those investments several years ago to rightsize those strategies. The industry has been very disciplined on pricing over a long period of time, and we don't see that changing. Operator : Your next question is from Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. Kate McShane : I just wanted to clarify. I think you mentioned in the prepared comments a mention of store growth. And I wondered if that was more of a domestic comment versus international comment? Should we see an acceleration of the store openings here? And we wondered if just with the sheer amount of growth you've seen over the last few years, do you think some of the demand weakness that you're seeing is just due to the sheer volume of what your current store base is handling? Jamere Jackson : We've talked several quarters ago about our aspirations to expand and accelerate our store growth in the back half of the decade. We historically have built about 150 stores, give or take, a few in domestically. And we think that we can significantly expand that number as we move forward. The drivers there, obviously, are the growth opportunities that we see in DIY but also a significant growth opportunity in commercial. And as we look at that, along with the expanded trade areas in the US, there's an opportunity for us to expand our business domestically. And we're going to do that by accelerating our store growth as we move through the balance of the decade. And then internationally, we've been extremely pleased with what we've seen in Mexico, and we like the growth prospects that we've seen in Brazil. And you've seen what we've posted in terms of same store sales comp growth now for several quarters. And there's an opportunity for us to go faster there as well. So that accelerated store growth is certainly a part of our future growth strategy, and it will help us become a faster growing business as we move forward. And then your comment about the capacity of our stores. I mean one of the things that we've done over time is we've continued to optimize the footprint of our satellite stores and then augment that with what we've done with hubs and mega hubs to jam more parts in a local market closer to customers. It's an important part of the growth strategy, both on the DIY and the commercial side of the business. And we'll continue to do that as we move forward, which is one of the reasons why we talked about expanding the number of mega hubs that we have and our mega hub count will be north of 200 at full build-out. Phil Daniele : We just wish they'd come faster. Those -- building new stores takes -- it's a long tail from the time you sign a contract to the time we actually open the doors and start selling parts out of them. It just takes longer than we'd like. Operator : Your next question is from Seth Sigman with Barclays. Seth Sigman : A couple of follow-ups from my side. So when I look at the gap between your DIY business and the commercial business, it just seems narrower than it's been in the past, certainly pre-pandemic and that's been happening in the last couple of quarters. And if you look at DIY down 1%, it's actually not that different than the range we've seen in the past. So it's really commercial at this lower run rate. I know there's a lot of moving pieces here, but it's more of a macro question, right? Do you think that the commercial end customer is just slowing more? And maybe that's deferral, maybe that's trading down, I'm not sure, but I guess that's really what we're trying to figure out. Is that is that commercial end customer that may be more middle income consumer trading down a little bit more? Phil Daniele : Yes, that's tough to figure out exactly what's going on in commercial when you you start talking about how is the customer migrating up or down the cost curve, if you will. We don't get near the segmentation on the commercial side that we do on the DIY side and the retail side of the business. But is the customer trading down, I think if you look at some of the segments that we have, that are more challenged, thinking tires, right? Tire purchase could be well north of $1,000 for a customer. Those -- that segment has been challenged for sure. Some of the new car and used car dealer segments have been a little more challenged, partly because I think they're not selling as many units. So those two segments have been challenged. So if you think are customers migrating down because of bigger jobs or down the good, better, best column, I think that's probably true that a customer may -- they may have normally taken a car to an OE dealer, do they then migrate to a Firestone or something of that nature, and do they migrate to the UDS customer or do the job themselves. I think you could see that but it's very hard to understand how customers move on the commercial side of the business. Jamere Jackson : And I think part of that, as we think of the commercial market, in general, that's why we've been focused on this notion that we're roughly a five share in what's approaching $100 billion market. Despite the fact that big ticket is pressured across really all of retail and certainly, a big ticket purchase in auto parts is not immune to those dynamics. I mean we still have an opportunity to grow significantly in commercial and an opportunity to grow significantly faster. And so all the things that Phil talked about in terms of our initiatives are the things that we're focused on. And if we do those things and execute on them, then that gives us an opportunity to really accelerate our commercial growth as we move forward. Seth Sigman : And just on that last point around accelerating commercial, you mentioned a number of initiatives around service and delivery. Can you just help us better understand operationally what is actually changing, are we adding people, are we adding routes and just how to think about that. And it sounds like you've had some success early on in some of the markets where you have deployed some of these changes. Any sense on the lift they're seeing there that gives you that confidence? Phil Daniele : I think we are seeing success. Again, still relatively small in our rollout and that rollout is not very mature at the moment. But we're leveraging some technology, leveraging the technology to handhelds and other technology in our stores to be smarter about how we deliver and where we deliver a part from. We're ultimately able to get the part to the shop faster than we were previously and we're leveraging all of the assets we have in the local market to get those parts to a customer faster, and we like the results that we're seeing. We believe that as we roll these out, our sales will improve in those markets. And ultimately, we'll provide better customer service and gain new customers as well as share of wallet with existing customers. Operator : Your next question for today is from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Brian Nagel : So the first question I have, I know that we've already had a number of questions on commercial, so I apologize also asking about commercial. But just in the near term, if I heard the prepared comments correctly, it sounded like you expected a bit of a strength in here into the end of fiscal '24, the fourth period. So the question I have is, as you look at the business, I think comparisons do get easier. But are there specific sort of say, building blocks, which could help to strengthen the business here in the very near term? Jamere Jackson : I think you got two dynamics. One, as you mentioned before, is that the comparisons do get a little bit easier in the fourth quarter if you look at our grow-over numbers. But the second one is just the initiatives that Phil talked about. I mean we've been really focused on jamming more parts in the local markets and we've done a great job of doing that, and that's paying dividends for us. And then we've been focused on service and delivery speeds. And if we can win the game in terms of parts availability with jamming those parts in the local market and we can get them to the customer faster, those are things that are going to drive our business as we move forward. So again, we're excited about where we are and excited about the opportunity to accelerate our growth as we move forward. There are always macro challenges that you have to fight your way through and big ticket is pressured. But you combine the fact that we're underpenetrated, we've got a full slate of growth initiatives in place, those are the things that get us excited about the future. Brian Nagel : My follow-up, again, it's also a follow-up. But just with respect to the consumer, I mean, look, you operate in a unique part of retail. A lot of the spend that happens at your stores is not necessarily discretionary, but there's a lot of chatter out there right now across consumer about maybe some incremental pressures on the lower income consumer. So the question is, are you seeing that -- as you look at your business and the data that\u2019s available to you, are you seeing clearly or somewhat clearly signs of incremental pressure on this core consumer that's affected their shopping patterns? Phil Daniele : I think big ticket, I think, has been a challenge for the consumer in all of retail, not just us. Like you said, big pieces of our business are break fix, starter, alternator, battery, your car is down, you've got to fix it. And those tickets, while they're large, they're not -- it's not thousands of dollars, it's -- a starter and an alternator could be a couple of hundred bucks. Certainly puts pressure on the low end consumer to have to have that money come out of pocket and they're under pressure. But discretionary categories have been under pressure for, frankly, quite some time. They all exploded during the pandemic when there was a lot of money in the consumer's pocket. And they've certainly been more challenged over the last 18 to 24 months and that continues. But maintenance items, I think as customers get more cash strapped, they look at -- if I take care of my car, I know that it will perform better and save me money in the long run. So maintenance items have a tendency to start to trickle up over time. And then the failure items, if you're going to get the car back on the road, you've got to purchase it. We don't have a lot of good, better, best categories. We have some in brakes and a couple of other categories, but that's not a big piece of our business. The vast majority of our sales are on application parts that have -- you have one choice and the customer buys that part to get their car back on the road. And we think that will continue. Operator : Your next question for today is from Michael Lasser with UBS. Michael Lasser : Phil, how would you compare and contrast this year for the aftermarket to 2017, which was the last year of challenged trends within the industry? And in your mind, is it really just a function of more cooperative weather that will drive an acceleration for the industry from here or do you think something else needs to happen in order for the backdrop to be more favorable? Phil Daniele : It's a great question, I was wondering when the tough weather questions from a winter perspective would come up, and that was kind of that 16%, 17% range you're talking about. It's a great question. It's frankly one we talk about internally all the time. We've had a pretty soft winter weather pattern for the last two years. And when I kind of look across the country, this winter pattern, we got some pretty good weather from a precipitation, snow and temperatures in the Midwest. We got very soft weather patterns relative to driving, break fix part failures on the Eastern seaboard. Wasn't a lot of snow in New York, Boston, Philadelphia, D.C., and we didn't have a lot of cold temperatures in those markets. And those typically have meant undercar and brake categories performed very well when you have those types of seasonal patterns. We didn't get that this year and frankly, didn't get it last year. So it's a little undetermined what happens in a long period of time where you haven't had those weather patterns with categories in that half of the country. So I think that is yet to be seen. We don't have the inflation that we had probably back in '17, '18 and frankly, over the last two years to be a benefit. But I do think we'll get a better mix of categories going into the summer selling season than we've had in Q3. So I don't know if I'm really answering your question. I think that's yet to be seen and I think it will prove out over the next four months or so. Michael Lasser : My follow-up question is on the underlying gross margin trend outside of the LIFO benefit. It sounds like the LIFO could be about a $20 million drag in 4Q. How much more room do you have to improve the underlying gross margin to offset that type of headwind that you're going to experience, especially as you move into next year where comps could remain uncertain and the market is still expecting double digit EPS growth? Jamere Jackson : So what I'll say is we've run the gross margin play with intensity and our merchandising teams and our supply chain teams have done a fantastic job. You saw last quarter, we had -- this past quarter, we had almost 90 basis points of margin improvement strictly from what we're doing on the merchandising side and what we're doing with the supply chain. I wouldn't suggest that those numbers are going to be as high as we move forward. We are coming out of a period where we had some pretty significant inflation that we got some deflation. And as we mentioned a little bit earlier, we're not getting the ticket necessarily to help us from a gross margin standpoint. So that will be muted some. But we believe that we'll have the potential to offset most, if not all, of the pressure that you see from a LIFO standpoint. Operator : Your final question for today is from Max Rakhlenko with TD Cowen. Max Rakhlenko : So first, on the speed initiative, can you discuss the pace of the rollout? And when we think -- when we should think that it will be in majority or all of the markets that you have mega hubs in? Phil Daniele : We've been working on this for probably a year, year and half, and we started seeing the results that we really liked earlier this year and started ramping it up. We're probably in the middle innings, if you will, of rolling that out to our stores, we've got -- in our networks. We've got some more to go and we'll continue to add incremental stores as we move through the process. But I would say we're in middle innings. We do believe that as we roll this out, again, we believe we get better customer service, faster time to shop. And we believe with that better customer service, we'll gain new customers and grow share of wallet. It won't be an immediate snap but we like the efforts and the growth that we're seeing in those markets. Max Rakhlenko : And then just as a follow-up, on the slower mega hubs openings, is that more structural, is it tougher to find boxes in the right areas or is it about execution opportunities on your end? And then it does sound like that the opening should start to accelerate in the next few quarters. Is that right? Jamere Jackson : The openings will definitely accelerate, and Phil has sort of smiled at me because I own store development as part of my finance responsibilities. And so this is one of my primary objectives for this year. They are big boxes in hard-to-find locations. We've been working through what we need to do from an execution standpoint. I will say it's anybody that's doing new store construction across the business know how challenging the market has been over the last couple of years or so. But we've worked our way through a lot of those challenges this fiscal year. We like the pipeline that we've built and we expect to see that accelerate as we move into FY25. Phil Daniele : And I think the good thing is we know exactly where we want these stores in every metro market or adding multiples to a given city or an individual market that may have a smaller number of stores. We know where we want to be. We want to make sure we get them at the right distance from our current locations. And they've got to have good routes so they're easily accessible to the other markets. And then you got to find the spot that is a great retail location and a great place to do to fulfill and get these expanded parts to our shops and our stores fast. And it's just -- it takes time. We'd love to go faster because they're great boxes for us and they know -- they help us on both DIY and commercial. Max Rakhlenko : That\u2019s great. Appreciate all the color and best regards. Phil Daniele : Great, thank you. Okay. So before we conclude the call, I'd like to take a moment to reiterate that we believe our industry is in a strong position and our business model is solid. We are excited about our growth prospects for the remainder of the year but will take nothing for granted as we understand our customers have alternatives to shopping with us. We have exciting plans that should help us succeed for the future, but I want to stress that this is a marathon and not a sprint. As we continue to focus on the basics, and strive to optimize shareholder value for the future, we are confident AutoZone will be successful. Lastly, as we celebrate Memorial Day next Monday, I ask that we all remember our country's heroes both past and present. We owe these great Americans a tremendous debt of gratitude. Thank you again for participating in today's call. Operator : This concludes today's conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

Operator : Good day, everyone, and welcome to AutoZone's 2024 Fourth Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. At this time, all participants have been placed on a listen-only mode, and we will open the floor for your questions and comments after the presentation. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Phil Daniele, CEO of AutoZone. Sir, the floor is yours. Phil Daniele : Thank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for AutoZone's 2024 fourth quarter conference call. With me today are Jamere Jackson, Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax. Regarding the fourth quarter, I hope you had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about our quarter's results. If not, the press release, along with slides complementing our comments today are available on our website at www.autozone.com under the Investor Relations link. Please click on the Quarterly Earnings Conference Call to see them. As we begin this morning, I want to thank our more than 120,000 AutoZoners for their contributions during fiscal 2024 that resulted in our solid performance. As the first line of our pledge states, they continue putting our customers first, which resulted in total sales growth of 5.9% for the fiscal year, while earnings per share increased 13%. As a reminder, this fiscal year had an extra week of results. So, excluding the 53rd week, our sales were up 3.8%, while our EPS was up 10.4%. In the fourth quarter, with our continued focus on what we call Wow! Customer Service, our total sales were up 9%, while EPS was up 11%. On a 16-week basis, our Q4 sales were up 2.6%, while our EPS was up 3.5%. We also delivered 1.3% total company same-store sales, domestic same-store sales growth of 0.2%, and international same-store sales up 9.9%. Our domestic commercial sales accelerated sequentially, finishing up 4.5% versus last year's Q4 of 3.9%. This is on a 16-week versus 16-week basis. We were up 10.9% on a 17-week versus 16-week basis. While our international business continued to comp up approximately 10% in local currencies, we faced a nearly 500 points of currency headwind and our reported growth rate is approximately 5%. As you know, the weaker US dollar has been a tailwind for our reported results, since we began reporting international comps last year in our fourth quarter earnings report. The stronger dollar had a meaningful impact on our reported sales, operating profit, and EPS this quarter. Jamere will update the potential impact of foreign currency on FY '25 later in the call. While there will always be tailwinds and headwinds in the quarter's results, what has been consistent is that we could not have achieved both this quarter's and this year's success without exceptional efforts across the entire organization. So, let me dive into our sales results. First off, I will say that our domestic DIY results were very similar to last quarter. Q4's DIY comp sales were down about 1%. The impact from the headwind on our discretionary merchandise categories drove the bulk of this decline, similar to last quarter. For our fourth quarter, discretionary category sales were approximately 18% of our mix and they were down roughly 5% year-over-year, again similar to our results in previous quarters this fiscal year. We have seen this trend for the entire fiscal year and our belief is that these categories will continue to be pressured until the consumer gets some economic relief and customer confidence improves -- consumer confidence improves. With regards to our inflation impact on the DIY comp, we saw both average ticket and like-for-like SKU inflation up approximately 1% for the quarter. While still low versus historical norms, the growth is a good trend for us as we would expect inflation in our ticket average to be approximately 3% over time. We anticipate average ticket growth will return to historical industry growth rates as we move farther away from the hyperinflation of the last couple of years. We also saw DIY transactions count down 2%. While our industry overall sales growth rate for DIY appears to be down over the last quarter, it was very encouraging to see our market share growth in DIY. We believe we have a best-in-class offering, and this gives us confidence that when our consumers return to their historical shopping habits, we will be the beneficiaries of that upswing. Secondly, I'll speak to our regional DIY performance. Simply put, it was consistent across the country as each of our 10 reporting census regions delivered approximately a 1% negative comp. Third, I will address weather and what we believe the impact was on our DIY business. We clearly saw hot weather across the U.S. this past summer. And in those markets where the weather was hot, our sales increased accordingly. However, across the majority of the country, the weather pattern was similar to the previous year and, therefore, did not have a meaningful impact on our performance. Next, I will touch on our U.S. commercial business. While we reported this morning that our commercial sales were up 10.9% for the quarter, on a 16-week comparable basis to last year, our sales were up 4.5%. We were encouraged to see our U.S. commercial sales growth. This past quarter marked another quarter of sequential increases to year-over-year DIFM sales. We saw very little variation in the commercial sales across regions as the entire country was basically running at the overall sales growth rate of 4.5% on a 16-week basis. While we are encouraged by the progress we are making, we still have significant opportunities in front of us to grow market share, with improved satellite store inventory availability, significant improvements in hub and mega-hub coverage, the strength of our Duralast brand, and good execution on our initiatives to improve speed of delivery and improve customer service. We are confident about our future. This quarter, inflation on a like-for-like SKU basis was essentially flat, which drove flat pricing and average ticket for commercial. We have seen pricing remain relatively flat as inflation has cooled for goods in our industry. We expect to see slightly more inflation next year, and our assumption is like-for-like SKU retail inflation will be in the low-single-digits in FY '25. For the year, we opened eight hubs and 11 mega-hubs, which is roughly half of what we did in FY '23. We are excited about the ability to resume aggressively opening these important assets in FY '25, although openings will be somewhat second-half loaded. Hubs and mega-hubs lead to comp results that grow faster than the balance of the chain and we are going to continue to aggressively deploy these assets. For our first quarter of FY '25, we expect both DIY and commercial sales trends to modestly improve. We expect better sales performance in Q2 and the Q3 timeframes. We will, as always, be transparent about what we are seeing and provide color on our markets and outlook as trends change. Before turning the call to Jamere, I would like to take a moment to discuss our international business. We were busy opening stores this quarter. Between Mexico and Brazil, we opened 49 new stores and now have 921 international stores. As you can see from our press release, our same-store sales were just under 10%. We remain committed to growing the number of stores in both Mexico and Brazil. Today, we have 13% of our store -- total store base outside of the U.S. and expect that number will continue to grow. We plan to accelerate our openings by 2028, and we are targeting around 200 international openings per year. We continue to take our U.S. store learnings and introduce them to the international store operations, and we are very excited about our future in international. In summary, we have continued to invest in making end-market inventory assortments better to drive future traffic growth and sales, enhancing our IT systems and our supply chain. In FY '25, we'll continue to ramp up our store openings, specifically our hubs and mega-hubs and drive efficiencies from our new DCs, which are expected to come online in 2025. At AutoZone, we are investing in our future growth initiatives. In FY '24, we invested more than $1 billion in CapEx and are focused on our strategic growth priorities. In FY '25, you will see more of the same. We are investing in accelerated store growth, specifically hubs and mega-hubs, placing inventory closer to our customers, distribution centers that will drive efficiency and reduce supply chain costs, IT systems that will improve customer service and improve our AutoZoners' ability to help our customers. We believe that our industry is strong and we have an opportunity to grow market share domestically and internationally. Now, I will turn the call over to Jamere Jackson. Jamere Jackson : Thanks, Phil, and good morning, everyone. Before I unpack our results, I want to remind you that each year, our fiscal year ends on the last Saturday in August. Based on the way the calendar fell this year, we had an extra week in our fiscal year and the fourth quarter is based on 17 weeks versus 16 weeks. For comparison, our same-store sales comps are based on a 16-week basis, while our total sales, EBIT, and EPS results will be discussed on a 17-week basis. As Phil has previously discussed, we reported 9% total company sales growth. On a 16-week basis, total company sales were up 2.6%. Our domestic same-store sales grew 0.2% and our international comp was up 9.9% on a constant-currency basis. Total company EBIT grew 6.1% and our EPS grew 11%. I also want to point out that we had a headwind from foreign exchange rates in this quarter. We had a 500-basis-points drag on international sales that resulted in a $32 million headwind to sales, an $8 million headwind to EBIT, and $0.32 a share drag on EPS versus the prior year. We continue to deliver solid results despite the economic backdrop, and the efforts of our AutoZoners in our stores and distribution centers have enabled us to grow our business and our earnings in a meaningful way. Let me take a few moments to elaborate on the specifics in our P&L for Q4. For the quarter, total sales were just over $6.2 billion and, as I just mentioned, was up 9%. For the year, our total sales were $18.5 billion, up 5.9% versus last fiscal year. Let me give a little color on our sales and our growth initiatives. Starting with our domestic commercial business, for the fourth quarter, our domestic DIFM sales increased 10.9% to $1.7 billion. On a 16-week basis, our domestic commercial business grew 4.5%. For FY '24, our commercial sales were $4.9 billion, up 6.2% versus last year. In the quarter, sales to our domestic DIFM customers represented 31% of our domestic auto parts sales and 27% of our total company sales. Our average weekly sales per program were $16,700 flat to last year as we lap new programs that we opened that are not at maturity. Our commercial acceleration initiatives are continuing to deliver good results as we grow share by winning new business and increasing our share of wallet with existing customers. We now have our commercial program in approximately 92% of our domestic stores, which leverages our DIY infrastructure, and we're building our business with national, regional and local accounts. This quarter, we opened 55 net new programs, finishing with 5,898 total programs. Importantly, we have a lot of runway in front of us and we will aggressively pursue growth in commercial, which represents a tremendous growth opportunity for our company. To support our commercial growth, we now have 109 mega-hub locations. While I mentioned a moment ago, our commercial weekly sales per program average was $16,700 per program, the 109 mega-hubs averaged significantly higher sales and are growing much faster than the balance of the commercial business in Q4. As a reminder, our mega-hubs typically carry over 100,000 SKUs and drive tremendous lift inside the store box as well as serve as an expanded fulfillment source for other stores. The expansion of coverage and parts availability continues to deliver a meaningful sales lift to both our commercial and DIY business. These assets are performing well individually and the fulfillment capability for the surrounding AutoZone stores is giving our customers access to thousands of additional parts and lifting the entire network. We have an objective to have well north of 200 mega-hubs at full buildout. Our customers are excited by our commercial offering as we deploy more parts in the local markets closer to the customer while improving our service levels. On the domestic retail side of our business, our DIY comp was down 1.1% for the quarter. For all of FY '24, our DIY comp was down [0.6%] (ph). Despite the industry softness, we continue to gain share in DIY and we are well-positioned when the industry reaccelerates. As Phil mentioned, we saw traffic down 2% along with 1% ticket growth. And as we move forward, we would expect to see slightly declining transaction counts, offset by low- to mid-single-digit ticket growth, in-line with the long-term historical trends for the business, driven by changes in technology and the durability of new parts. Our DIY business has continued to gain share behind our growth initiatives. Importantly, the market is experiencing a growing and aging car park and a challenging new and used car sales market for our customers, which continues to provide a tailwind for our business. These dynamics, ticket growth, growth initiatives, and macro car park tailwinds, we believe will continue to drive a resilient DIY business environment for FY '25. Now, I'll say a few words regarding our international business. We continue to be pleased with the progress we're making in our international markets. During the quarter, we opened 31 new stores in Mexico to finish with 794 stores, and 18 new stores in Brazil, ending with 127. Our same-store sales grew 9.9% on a constant-currency basis and 4.9% when taken into account foreign exchange rates. We remain committed to international, and given our success in these markets, we will accelerate the store opening pace going forward. We're bullish on international being an attractive and meaningful contributor to AutoZone's future sales and operating profit growth. Now, let me spend a few minutes on the rest of the P&L and gross margins. For the quarter, our gross margin was 52.5%, down 21 basis points, driven primarily by an unfavorable LIFO comparison to last year. Excluding LIFO from both years, we had a 32-basis-point improvement in gross margin, driven by continued improvement in merchandising margins. For Q4 last year, we had a $30 million LIFO credit, while this year, we did not have any credits. We previously said that we thought we would have approximately $10 million of LIFO credits in the quarter, which would have equated to 16 bps of higher gross margins or $0.45 a share. At year-end, we had $19 million in cumulative LIFO charges yet to be reversed through our P&L. At the moment, we are not anticipating any charges or credits to our P&L for Q1 of FY '25, as inflation has not materially impacted our LIFO inventory accounting results. I will remind you that in last year's first quarter, we booked $2 million LIFO credit. And as a reminder, once we credit back the $19 million through the P&L, we will not take any more credits and we will begin to rebuild an unrecorded LIFO reserve. Moving to operating expenses. Our expenses were up 10.4% versus last year's Q4 as SG&A as a percentage of sales deleveraged 37 basis points. On a 16-week basis, our SG&A was up 4.6%. The growth in SG&A has been purposeful, as we continue to invest at an accelerated pace in IT and payroll to underpin our growth initiatives. These investments will pay dividends and customer experience, speed and productivity. We're committed to being disciplined on SG&A growth as we move forward, and we will manage expenses in-line with sales growth over time. Moving to the rest of the P&L. EBIT for the quarter was $1.3 billion, up 6.1% versus the prior year. EBIT for FY '24 was just under $3.8 billion, up 9.1% versus the prior year, driven by top-line growth and gross margin improvement. Interest expense for the quarter was $153.2 million, up 41% from Q4 a year ago, as our debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $9 billion versus $7.7 billion at Q4-end last year. We're planning interest in the $108 million range for the first quarter of FY '25 versus $91.4 million in this year -- in this past year's first quarter. Higher debt levels and borrowing rates across the curve are driving this increase. For the quarter, our tax rate was 21.1%, and down from last year's fourth quarter of 22.4%. This quarter's rate benefited 80 basis points from stock options exercised, while last year had benefited 22 basis points. For the first quarter of FY '25, we suggest investors model us at approximately 23.4% before any assumption on credits due to stock option exercises. Moving to net income and EPS. Net income for the quarter was $902 million, up 4.3% versus last year. Our diluted share count of 17.5 million was 6% lower than last year's fourth quarter. The combination of higher net income and lower share count drove earnings per share for the quarter to $51.58, up a 11% for the quarter. For FY '24, net income was $2.7 billion, up 5.3%, and earnings per share was $149.55, up 13%. Now, let me talk about our free cash flow. For the fourth quarter, we generated $723 million in free cash flow, and for the year, we generated $1.9 billion in free cash. We expect to continue being in an incredibly strong cash flow generator going forward and we remain committed to returning meaningful amounts of cash to our shareholders. Regarding our balance sheet, our liquidity position remains very strong and our leverage ratio finished at 2.5 times EBITDAR. Our inventory per store was up 3.7% versus Q4 last year, while total inventory increased 6.8% over the same period last year, driven by new store growth. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable on a per-store basis, was a negative $163,000 versus negative $201,000 last year and negative $168,000 last quarter. As a result, accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 119.5% versus last year's Q4 of 124.9%. Lastly, I'll spend a moment on capital allocation and our share repurchase program. We repurchased $711 million of AutoZone stock in the quarter, and at quarter-end, we had just under $2.2 billion remaining under our share buyback authorization. The strong earnings balance sheet and powerful free cash we generated this year has allowed us to buy back 6% of the shares outstanding since the beginning of the fiscal year. We have bought back over 100% of the then outstanding shares of stock since our buyback inception in 1998 while investing in our existing assets and growing our business. We remain committed to this disciplined capital allocation approach that will enable us to invest in the business and return meaningful amounts of cash to shareholders. To wrap up, we remain committed to driving long-term shareholder value by investing in our growth initiatives, driving robust earnings and cash, and returning excess cash to our shareholders. Our strategy continues to work. We're growing our market share domestically and internationally, and improving our competitive positioning in a disciplined way. As we look forward to FY '25, we're bullish on our growth prospects behind a resilient DIY business, a fast-growing international business, and a domestic commercial business that is continuing to grow share. I continue to have tremendous confidence in our ability to drive significant and ongoing value for our shareholders behind a strong industry, a winning strategy and an exceptional team of AutoZoners. Before handing the call back to Phil, I want to remind you that we report revenue comps on a constant-currency basis to reflect our operating performance. We generally don't take on transactional risk, so our results reflect the translation impact for reporting purposes. As I mentioned earlier in the quarter, foreign currency resulted in a headwind on revenue and EPS. If yesterday's spot rates held constant for Q1 FY '25, then we expect an approximate $55 million drag on revenue, a $16 million drag on EBIT, and a $0.63 a share drag on EPS. And if rates remained at the current spot rates for the full fiscal year 2025, we would expect an approximate $265 million impact to revenues, a $90 million impact to EBIT, and a $3.64 a share impact to full year EPS. And now, I'll turn it back to Phil. Phil Daniele : Thank you, Jamere. We're proud of our AutoZoners across the globe and the results our team delivered this past quarter. In FY '24, we focused on improving execution and driving Wow! Customer Service. We made meaningful progress and are well-positioned to grow sales across our domestic and international store bases with both our retail and our commercial customers. Our gross margins are solid, and our operating expense is appropriate for future growth. We continue to put our capital to work where we'll have the biggest impact on sales. Our stores, distribution centers and leveraging technology to build a superior customer service experience where we are able to say \"yes\" to our customers' needs. The top focus areas for fiscal 2025 will remain growing share in our domestic commercial business and continuing our momentum in our international markets. We believe we have a solid plan in place for growth over the next 12 months. We know our focus on parts availability, flawless execution and what we call Wow! Customer Service will lead to sales growth and gains in market share. We're excited to start 2025. This time of year, we also enjoy reflecting on the past. Our team achieved some impressive milestones this past fiscal year : $18.5 billion in sales, headed toward the $20 billion milestone; commercial sales are about to eclipse $5 billion, it wasn't that long ago we just crossed across $2 billion, that was only 2017; average weekly sales domestically of $47,000 a week, equating to just under $2.5 million per store annually; our Mexico and our ALLDATA teams both broke multiple records, and Brazil has now more than 100 stores and is growing; we bought back $3.2 billion in AutoZone stock, marking $37 billion in buybacks since the start of our program back in '98. As we start our new fiscal year, I'd like to take a moment and discuss our operating theme for this New Year, \"Great People, Great Service.\" I am asked frequently what differentiates AutoZone from others. My answer always goes back to the same point over and over again, our AutoZoners and AutoZone's amazing culture. Our AutoZoners have built this culture. This year, we will focus on our AutoZoners like never before. We are determined to improve upon an already existing culture of service. Next week will mark the start of our National Sales Meeting here in Memphis. Just over 3,000 AutoZoners will be in Memphis to learn about our parts and products, celebrate this past year's accomplishments, as well as allowing our leadership to celebrate and recognize the best-performing store and distribution center AutoZoners. We cannot wait to have everyone here. But we can't rest on our laurels and we aren't without our challenges, that's for sure. We must make sure that every store is staffed right every hour of every day. Our processes need to function properly, always, and we have to meet our new store opening goals and timelines. Simply put, we have to remain the execution machine that we have always been. Fiscal 2025's top priorities will continue to be based on improving execution, and we will continue to invest in our following strategic projects : reaccelerate our new hub and mega-hub openings; effectively and efficiently open our new distribution centers and optimize our direct import facility; ramp-up our domestic and international store growth; as discussed, our international teams posted same-store sales comps on a constant-currency basis of 10.2%, continuing several years of very strong growth; and most importantly, reaccelerate our domestic commercial sales growth and continue to gain market share on DIY. Also this morning, I'd like to remind everyone that Ken Jaycox joined AutoZone this past quarter as our Senior Vice President, Commercial. Ken is a strong addition for us, having served most recently at U.S. Steel where he served as their Senior Vice President and Commercial Chief Officer. He has extensive experience in the B2B space and has developed and led world-class sales teams. He is a great cultural fit, and we are fortunate to have Ken join us. We are excited about what we can accomplish, and our AutoZoners are committed to delivering even better results. We believe in our potential for future growth. We believe in AutoZone's best days lie ahead of us. Now, we'd like to open up the call for questions. Operator : Certainly. Everyone at this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. Your line is live. Simeon Gutman : Good morning. Hey, Phil, you mentioned accelerating commercial sales growth. You made a hire recently, and we talked about hubs on the call, and I think you're tweaking inventory. Can you talk about timing? What should investors expect? What you expect out of the organization? When we could see commercial sales move to that next level? Phil Daniele : Yeah, it's a great question. Thanks, Simeon. I think we will sequentially improve from here. Again, I'd -- like we've talked about on the last couple of calls, I think it's a progressive improvement. I don't think it's going to be a snapback. If you look at the environment out there, the consumer is still pressured and we think that's showing up on both DIY and the commercial side of the business, but we like our strategies that we have in place as far as exactly what you said, incrementally improving the store side assortments at the satellite stores, opening up these hubs and mega-hubs, and adding inventory closer to the customers. And then, we're also working on ways to streamline customer service, specifically improving speed to customer on those harder-to-find parts. So, we like our strategy, and we think we'll continue to build from here. Simeon Gutman : And then, a quick follow-up on gross margin. What's left, and how high it can go? Because I think discretionary being down would have hurt you, commercial being up would probably hurt you. So, how do you -- I guess, where is the drive? Where is the strength coming from? And how much can it continue? Jamere Jackson : Yeah, I think, we got a couple of things working in our favor. One, our merchants are doing a fantastic job driving merchandising margin improvements and negotiating with our supply base, and that team has done a tremendous job for us. So, I think, as we move forward, we'll continue to drive merch margin improvements. We have a little bit of a drag early on because we're adding a couple of DCs associated with the supply chain efforts that we have, but net-net, we think that the merchandising margin improvements will continue to power us moving forward. The one area that we're watching very closely is what's happening in the industry from a pricing standpoint, as Phil alluded to and I alluded to as well, that we're not seeing the average ticket growth. That's largely a function of what we're seeing on the inflation side. As we get some additional inflation that starts to make its way into the industry, we're looking forward to having an opportunity to push retails a little bit harder. So, a very disciplined approach, very strong merchandising margins, and we're looking forward to a pretty good outlook for FY '25. Simeon Gutman : Thank you. Good luck. Phil Daniele : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Bret Jordan from Jefferies. Your line is live. Bret Jordan : Hey, good morning, guys. Phil Daniele : Good morning, Bret. Bret Jordan : Could you talk about what, if any, are the hurdles to reaccelerating the hub growth now that the three major players are all using a hub strategy? Is it a real estate access issue, or is it just sort of timing of your internal development team? Jamere Jackson : Phil always smiles when we get this question, because I own store development inside of our organization. We feel very good about what we've done, essentially what we've done over the last year or so is rebuilding our pipeline and our capabilities. Obviously, and we've talked about it here on the call, we struggled a little bit as we got through the pandemic. Everything was generally delayed during that timeframe, but the reality is that there were things that we needed to improve from an operational standpoint to really improve that pipeline. We're pretty excited about where we are on hubs and mega-hubs. We still have our plan to open 200-plus mega-hubs versus our original estimate of 110. We'll build 20-plus in FY '25 and I'm really excited about the fact that we have about 70 mega-hubs in the pipeline today, most of which are under construction. So, I feel good about the team, what we've executed on, et cetera. These are big 30,000-square-foot boxes and tough to find locations, but we've reorganized our team and doubled down on our efforts to get those boxes into the marketplace. I'm excited about what they'll contribute to our future growth prospects. Bret Jordan : Okay. Then a follow-up on the commercial business. I mean, can you talk about the cadence through the quarter and then any dispersion between national account business versus the up-and-down the street business? Phil Daniele : Yeah. If you talk about the cadence -- the quarter, like I said, both regionally and the cadence across the quarter were all pretty similar. If you -- the very beginning of the quarter was a little bit lighter. June was great. Some of it due to the hot weather came a little bit earlier this year. And then, when you got into July and August, it was pretty similar to last year from a weather perspective. So, you didn't see meaningful change in July and August from a comp perspective. Where it was hot, we saw all the categories take off like you would expect. So, we had a good summer. It wasn't demonstrably different than last year though. And so, that's kind of how we think about that from a quarter perspective. Sorry, what was the second part of the question? Bret Jordan : And, I guess, national account versus the up-and-down the street business, are you seeing any change in the independent, the WD competitive landscape out there around the net -- around the up-and-down the street? Phil Daniele : Yeah. So, on national accounts, that's a great question. We kind of think of our -- the up-and-down the street customer. We think about national accounts and then we have what we call some verticals. And I'll explain kind of how we saw performance across those segments. The up-and-down the street customer has been very resilient, been one of the best-growing segments for us. The national accounts have improved quarter-over-quarter, and part of that improvement has come from a lot of those national accounts are heavily tied towards tires and tires are not as bad as they used to be. The trends have improved. We're seeing more tire replacements, even though those customers generally, I think, are seeing down customer traffic, but tires are not the big drag that they have historically been. The one segment that has not performed very good for us and, as I say, I think it's going to make sense, it's anything related to new cars, used cars, or [buyer payer] (ph) lots. As cars change hands, there's generally an uptick in maintenance. To a used car, they may refurb and put on -- put tires on, put on new brakes, suspension items, change all the filters, do some maintenance, et cetera. And as that new customer picks up the new car, they may continue to personalize it. So, that segment of the business, which we're highly penetrated in, has not performed as well. We think as the environment and the economy improves a little bit and we see more used cars change hands and new cars being sold that will help those two segments of the business. Bret Jordan : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Chris Horvers from JPMorgan. Your line is live. Chris Horvers : Thanks, and good morning. Can you talk about where you think the DIY -- domestic DIY and domestic commercial markets are growing? You mentioned share gains in DIY, but you comped down [1] (ph). So, any thoughts on where you think those markets are -- grew during the quarter, and how we think about the improvement in the backdrop over FY '25? Phil Daniele : Great question. Thank you. So, on DIY, as we said, the biggest pressure point has really been in the discretionary part categories of the business. So, think of that accessories, truck towing performance, things of that nature. That business has been pretty tough for us for at least a year. And when you look at the share gains, that sort of area is where we've seen the most challenging performance. In our maintenance categories and our failure categories on the DIY side of the business, they have been pretty resilient, but it's those headwinds from the discretionary categories that have been tough. And we frankly don't know that that's going to change too much until that our pressured consumer starts to get some economic relief and, frankly, when their confidence starts to improve a bit. On the commercial side, we believe we're still one of the fastest-growing in the industry, a little bit of a tougher comp scenario, but we believe we're growing share and we like our strategies of deploying inventory through the hub and the mega-hub assortments. And we have several strategies that are focused on improving customer service in commercial, and we're seeing really good results from those. Jamere Jackson : And I would say, just to build on that, I mean, if you think about the growth rates, we actually believe that the DIY market has been down kind of low-single-digits because of those dynamics that Phil talked about, but also the fact that we're not seeing the same level of retail inflation. Tickets are still growing slower than the historical levels and that's put some pressure on it. So, a combination of the consumer sentiment, the fact that we are not seeing retail inflation are sort of driving that business down a little bit. But what we're excited about is the fact that we continue to execute, as Phil mentioned, I mean, we're providing great service to the customer. And as that portion of the industry reaccelerates, we'll be in great shape. And on the commercial side, I mean, as near as we can tell, I mean, commercial has been flat to declining for -- or slightly declining for a few quarters here. And if we look at what we saw this quarter, it was probably in a similar sort of zip code. So, we're excited about the fact that we've accelerated our commercial sales growth. And as we move forward, the execution on our initiatives that Phil talked about, the fact that we'll get more hubs and mega-hubs in our marketplace, all bode well for us as we move forward. Chris Horvers : Got it. And then, a couple of quick margin follow-ups. First on the gross margin. It looks like that 53rd week, the gross margin was maybe 80 basis points lower. So, is there something to read into that? You talked about being positive on gross margin over the year, but some DC pressures. So, is that just accounting nuance or something that we should think about in terms of cadence? And then secondly, on the potential FX headwind, the international implied operating margin for the year is materially higher than the quarter, so what you experience in the fourth quarter. So, is that the 53rd week impact, or is there something going on there? Jamere Jackson : Yeah, so the 53rd week is always a little bit noisy for us, just in general in terms of how allocations happen, et cetera. So, I wouldn't read much into how you think about it. I mean, overall for the total company, we had about $365 million of sales and about $87 million of EBIT associated with that extra week when you look at it on a like-for-like basis. And I wouldn't -- the margin impacts and SG&A impacts and all those things can get a little bit skewed just based on how you do allocations in the quarter. What I'll say about international and the international margins as we think about it going forward, it's a very strong business for us. Our business in Mexico has basically doubled over the last three fiscal years or so. So, given that significant revenue and EBIT impact of our international footprint, swings in FX rates are going to impact us, et cetera. The teams are doing a great job of executing and we wanted to be really transparent on what we see in terms of FX moving forward and what the margin impact is going to be going forward. Chris Horvers : Got it. Thank you. Phil Daniele : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Steven Forbes from Guggenheim Securities. Your line is live. Steven Forbes : Good morning, Phil, Jamere. Phil Daniele : Good morning, Steven. Steven Forbes : Maybe just a follow-up to start on the commercial business. Maybe if we just focus on sort of weekly sales per commercial program. If we adjust for the extra week contribution, it looks like your sales were sort of down mid-single-digits year-over-year. Any way to help contextualize sort of what's driving that and/or, right, any sort of initial thoughts on how your initiatives on speed of delivery, right, customer service you may help inflect that, right, as we look out over the coming quarters here and potentially get it back to growing? Phil Daniele : Yeah. Well, again, if you compare the 16-weeks to 16-weeks, we were up 4.5% versus last year. So -- and it sequentially from the last three quarters, that's three quarters in a row of growing trend on our commercial sales. If you look at what we're focused on with the -- obviously, improving our assortments is something we do all the time. I think our merchants have done a fantastic job of improving the store-level assortments and also improving the store -- the hub and mega-hub assortments within any given market that may have one of those types of boxes. What we're focused on is utilizing deployed inventory in a given market, either in a hub or a satellite, and getting that inventory quicker to the customer at the shop level. So, we think of it in terms of time, speed to shop, how quickly can we get that inventory from wherever it may be to the shop, the fastest way to improve customer service. And as you back up to a hub or a mega-hub, the assortments get deeper, and how do we get that product to those customers faster. We've deployed quite a bit of technology over the last couple of years. We continue to leverage that technology and learn how to improve the customer service at the -- for the AutoZoners, allowing them to help the customer better, as well as getting that inventory quicker to the customer wherever that inventory maybe. And we're seeing really good results. We like the strategy. What I'll tell you is, it's dependent on having a hub and a mega-hub, which is why this strategy of having more hubs deployed with those inventory assets closer to the customer is so important. We wish we could go faster. We'll start reaccelerating those hub and mega-hubs later in the year. And then, we've got a -- as Jamere mentioned, we've got a great pipeline. We feel good about the future. We know where we want all of these big boxes to be. Of all the sites, well north of 200 of them on the mega-hub side. We know where they are. It's just a matter of negotiating and getting them open. Steven Forbes : I appreciate the color. And then, just a quick follow-up for Jamere. I appreciate the quantification of FX, assuming all things constant, the release, obviously, quantified the EBIT contribution of the extra week. You also called out LIFO. If we add these up, right, we have sort of a mid-single-digit headwind to EBIT growth next year. Is that the right way to frame up sort of the non-controllable headwinds to EBIT growth, or anything else you want to add as we think about sort of cleansing the models here? Jamere Jackson : Yeah, there's really two pieces. One is, we had about $40 million of LIFO credits that roll through the P&L this year, that become headwinds next year. Now depending on what happens from an inflation standpoint, we've got about $19 million of credits still to come before we go back to an unrecorded balance. So, you could offset maybe half of that $40 million benefit that you had this year on the LIFO side. So that should help you from a modeling standpoint. And then, from an FX standpoint, we try to be transparent about where the spot rates are. We're certainly not making a prediction on where FX is going to land. There are lots of things that will impact that, certainly, things that happened in the U.S. economy, things that happened in the international economies, and some of the political dynamics. So, what we wanted to do is just be really transparent about where the spot rates currently are and what the impact could potentially be on our P&L. We'll update you as we move through the year. It's been pretty volatile. You've seen a pretty significant spike probably to the tune of 20% or 25% in a very short period of time. And again, as I said, given the size of international and our P&L and the profitability of that business, it does have an impact. So, we'll be transparent and share with you exactly what we see as it rolls its way through the P&L. Steven Forbes : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Robbie Ohmes from Bank of America. Your line is live. Robbie Ohmes : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was hoping, could you guys talk a little bit more about seeing inflation return and what the drivers to that normally are or what they could be. And maybe as part of that, remind us how historically tariffs and port strikes and things like that impact inflation for you guys? Phil Daniele : Yeah. So, let me kind of back up, and we've talked about this a couple of different times, the historical growth rates versus what we're seeing today in ticket average. It's been fairly muted over the last year or so at around this 1% retail inflation and ticket average inflation that's been muted, both -- on both sides of the business, similar numbers that are down from historical rates. Over the long-term and I'm talking literally close, somewhere between 20 and 30 years, the industry has generally seen somewhere between 3% and 5% inflation in average ticket and around 1% to 3% decline in transactions, typically driven by inflation of parts as well as technology, enhancements in quality of the product. We believe that sometime in the near-time horizon, we would revert back to a historical growth rate on both of those metrics. What we typically see what drives inflation is mix of business -- drives ticket average is mix of business converting to higher technology parts, which generally speaking are more expensive and inflation caused by product cost. Over the last year, there hasn't been much product costs come into the system. And we all believe that that's because of -- if you look back through the pandemic years when we had the supply chain constraints, we had massive inflation in cost and we took those retails and pushed them to the consumer and we ended up with this hyperinflation. We're now lapping a lot of that and that trend starts to slow down kind of now going through the end of the year, and we would expect that inflation would come back in sometime in '25 and get back to normal. As far as tariffs, your question there that -- those sorts of things have ebbed and flowed over the years. If we get tariffs, we will pass those tariff costs back to the consumer and we'll pass them through. As they turn through, we'll generally raise prices ahead of -- we know what the tariffs will be. We generally raise prices ahead of that. You get some gross margin improvement as the cost of goods turn in and then it flattens out. So, that's historically what we've done. I see no reason this industry has been very consistent on pricing and rational and we believe that all those same metrics are still in place. Robbie Ohmes : Thanks. And just a quick follow-up since you brought up the last 20 to 30 years. When over the last 20 to 30 years has the consumer been like this? You guys are talking about on the DIY side a challenged consumer. What happened last time the consumer was like this? Phil Daniele : Gosh, I don't know -- well, that's a great question. The consumer is under much different pressure. The bottom-end consumer has been pressured for the last 20 months or so or maybe more, but it's ebbed and flowed over recessions, et cetera. Have we seen the type of inflation that we saw over the last three years? No, not -- certainly not in my lifetime. But generally speaking, in tougher economic times, people will generally defer maintenance and discretionary items early in the cycle. And then, as we get further through the cycle, they start to repair their cars because they realize a little investment today, maintaining their vehicle defers a major repair into the future. So, we think it's going to ebb and flow over time, but we feel like our execution, our improvement in execution and our strategies are the right strategies for us and we'll work over the long-term. Jamere Jackson : Just a little more on the consumer. I mean, a couple of things really stand out to us. One is, if you look at the economy just in general, I've said this for a while that you've had this sort of this two-speed world where the middle- and upper-income consumers have strong balance sheets and are continuing to spend as normal, and the lower-end is feeling the pinch, particularly in the discretionary categories. The beauty of our business is that the lion's share of our business is relatively inelastic, it's break-fix, it's essential maintenance. Consumers need their vehicles for mobility. So, we tend to power our way through those. What encourages us about the consumer is that even in this environment, you've got unemployment at 4.2%, you've got wage growth at 4%, so wage growth is finally keeping up or outpacing inflation. So, we feel pretty good that as consumer sentiment improves, moving forward, that you'll see some return of normalcy in terms of spending and our business will benefit from that. But the good news again is the lion's share of our business, that break-fix, essential maintenance, is pretty resilient really through all cycles. Robbie Ohmes : Really helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Michael Lasser from UBS. Your line is live. Michael Lasser : Good morning. Thank you so much for taking my question. So, the market has grown accustomed to AutoZone growing its earnings by a double-digit clip with mid-single-digit operating income growth and the rest coming from share repurchases. It seems like your message today is that algorithm might prove elusive for the next few quarters as the headwind to our international business comes into play from FX and some of the other unique factors like LIFO. So, when is it realistic that AutoZone can get back to this double-digit EPS growth algorithm? And is it really incumbent on an acceleration in pricing that's going to both help the top-line as well as the margins moving through 2025? Thank you. Jamere Jackson : Yeah, thanks for your question, Michael. First thing I'll say is that the long-term algo is unchanged. I mean, this is a business that we believe as we look forward will be a consistent, steady grower. It has an opportunity to expand margins that will have a ton of free cash flow at the bottom of the waterfall and we'll buy back shares and do shareholder-friendly things associated with it. In the near term, the things that you've alluded to, things like LIFO, a little bit of pressure on -- from an FX standpoint, may impact that on a quarterly basis, but that long-term algo doesn't change. I think what we're encouraged by is that the growth initiatives that we have as the macro environment improves, you'll see the acceleration in the top-line, which is key to that algo working as we move forward. So, all the things we're working on from a growth initiative standpoint will really start to show up in the results, but in this environment where particularly the consumers have been pressured, DIY has been a little bit soft, it's a little tough to print that number quarter-over-quarter as we move forward. So, we feel good about where we are, we feel good about the fundamentals of the business, the fundamentals of the industry, the fundamentals of our execution, but on a quarterly basis, it's difficult to print the algo as it has been. So, long-term, no change. Short-term, you'll certainly see some impacts from the top-line and some of these other drivers in the business. Phil Daniele : Yeah. Just to reiterate, I mean, there definitely will be pressure on the given quarter, but the Mexico business and the international business is an incredible business and growing. We like the profitability of that market and we like our strategies both on the international markets and our opportunities that we still have here in the U.S. So, we're happy with our strategies. Don't like the FX pressure, but we can't. That's not one we can deal with at the moment. Michael Lasser : My follow-up question is, the margin structure of AutoZone has evolved a bit over the years. It's now more incumbent upon the gross margin expansion to drive stable to flat overall operating margins and offset some growth in SG&A. So, if AutoZone is running into obstacles to grow its gross margin, should the market expect that it can manage its SG&A to moderate that to keep its overall operating margin flattish moving forward? Jamere Jackson : Yeah. I think two things associated with that. One is we are continuing to run the gross margin play with intensity inside the company. And as I mentioned a little bit earlier, our merchandising teams are doing a fantastic job of finding a way to give us expanding margins even in an environment where we haven't had an opportunity to raise retails as fast, which is a pretty significant achievement for the company. I've also said that in the middle of the P&L that to the extent that the top-lines or the gross margins don't materialize that we have the muscle and we'll make the decisions that are necessary to make sure that we're protecting our operating margins in total and that includes the things that we do on the SG&A line. What we've been able to do over the last couple of years is invest in a very disciplined way in things that are positioning us very, very well for the future in SG&A. So things like IT, payroll to improve service, the payroll that's necessary to support some of these growth initiatives, and those things are all going to pay benefits for us. So, I think the message here is no change to the algo. No outlook that suggests that operating margins are going to be on the decline here. We'll work our way through these. And as we see the top-line return and as we continue to work gross margins and work the middle of the P&L, the operating margin profile of the company is protected. Michael Lasser : Thank you very much. Phil Daniele : Thanks, Michael. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Michael Baker from D.A. Davidson. Your line is live. Michael Baker : Okay. Thanks guys. Two quick ones. You've alluded a little bit to pricing, competitive pricing. Can you just tell us, we know one of your competitors has been investing in price. Is that impacting the average ticket at all? Phil Daniele : Yeah, I would say that they -- we've heard that they're doing that. And at the end of the day, we monitor our pricing all the time. We haven't seen any radical change. I think, specifically, on the commercial side of the business, the vast majority of the share is with the WDs and that's who we focus on in our pricing strategies, and we haven't seen any material change there. And I would say that, if you ask if that's the pressure point for a lack of average ticket growth, the answer is no. The impetus for average ticket growth and retail inflation is really comes from cost. And as the cost comes in, we'll push that cost to the consumer and that's where you get some of that retail average ticket inflation. So, I would say it's not -- that is not the primary reason for the lack of inflation on ticket average. It goes back to this hyperinflation that we had since the supply chain issues of the pandemic. Jamere Jackson : Yeah. I mean, you heard me say in the past, particularly during the pandemic where we saw a pretty significant increase in ticket that inflation is a bit of our friend when it comes to retails, and that dynamic is because, as Phil alluded to, this is a very disciplined rational industry in terms of pricing. And so, even when you are looking at changes that you're making dynamically from a pricing standpoint because you're largely in a break-fix business where you don't necessarily stimulate demand from pricing -- downward pressures on pricing, you generally don't see that happening in our industry. And this industry is rational today, it's been rational for decades. Phil Daniele : Exactly. Michael Baker : Yeah. Okay. Pretty clear. One follow-up, I guess, maybe in two quick parts. You said you expect first quarter comps to be -- I think you said improving. Why? Is that based on what you're seeing quarter-to-date? And then, you also said accelerating or more store growth. Can you quantify that? How many stores -- you gave us a mega-hub number for next year. How many total stores should we expect in 2025? Thanks. Phil Daniele : Yeah. So, Jamere said, I think we're expecting somewhere north of 20 on the mega-hubs. As I said, they'll also be kind of back-end loaded. So, think kind of after Christmas or so will be where the vast majority of those will come in the latter part of the year. So, we like that we will reaccelerate those. We wish that we were going to be earlier in the year. They just, from a timing perspective, are going to come in the back half of the year. As far as the first quarter, what we said was we expect the Q1 to look pretty similar to the last quarter. We don't see a whole lot of -- the consumer is still under the same pressure they were back in over the summertime. The consumer confidence I think is pretty stable at the moment. We wish it would improve, but we don't see a whole lot of catalysts for it to improve. Frankly, maybe until December timeframe after the election, et cetera. So, we expect it to be pretty similar and we think it will improve. We'll get back to a normal growth average ticket growth later in the year. So that's kind of when we see things maybe having a better inflection point. We'd love for winter to get here and have a harsh winter. Jamere Jackson : And just in terms of... Michael Baker : I thought you said you expect first quarter to modestly improve, so... Phil Daniele : Yeah, modestly improve from a [DAP] (ph) perspective. That's correct. Michael Baker : Yeah. Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our last question this morning is coming from Zach Fadem from Wells Fargo. Your line is live. Zach Fadem : Hey, good morning, and thanks for squeezing me in. So, Jamere, you mentioned the car park as a tailwind, but since we're entering a period where new cars from 2018, 2019 are starting to come off warranty and new car sales lagged during the pandemic, just curious why you wouldn't view this as an air pocket or a headwind for the industry. Any thoughts on why that wouldn't be the case? Jamere Jackson : Yeah. I think simply put, the cars are lasting longer and they're staying on the road. So, even though the SAAR has come down, you're not seeing cars go to the boneyard. So, as a result of that, the car park has continued to tick up. And you can see that from the data that's out there. I mean, the average age of a vehicle on the road has ticked up to 12.6 years and what all the data suggests based on what we know today is that it's likely going to be one or two ticks higher next year. And that's a combination of what consumer behavior is, but it's also the factor of what's happening with technology. The cars just simply last longer and you're seeing them stay in the car park much longer, which means the average household is fractionally going up a little bit more in terms of the number of vehicles that they have. Phil Daniele : Yeah, I think it going to kind of your air pocket. I think that did happen to some degree back in the financial crisis 2007, '08, '09, but your car -- your new car SAARs literally dipped below 10 million annually. And we haven't seen anywhere near that type of a decline in SAARs. So, I don't think it's necessarily going to be an issue. Again, we love the fact that cars are now over 12 years on average and the American consumer is driving a lot. Those are a great tailwinds for us. We like that. Zach Fadem : Got it. That makes sense. So, maybe fewer newer cars entering the addressable market, but also fewer scraps. So that makes sense. So, just separately, when you look at your SG&A growth on a per-store basis, it was about 1% normalized, a step down from about 3% in Q4. And when you think about managing your business for 2025, could you talk about why this low-single-digit range is the right level for you, particularly in light of the investments that you're making in commercial and also in light of some of the peers stepping up to mid-single-digit to drive share gains? Jamere Jackson : I mean, what we've said about SG&A is that we'll continue to invest in a disciplined way to support our growth initiatives. And so, to the extent that there are opportunities for us to invest in things like store payroll, the work that we're continuing to do in IT to improve the customer experience and improve our AutoZoners experience, we're going to invest into that all day long. But we also very responsible in terms of how we manage that SG&A as we move forward. So, in a softer sales environment, we do the things that we need to do to make sure that we're running efficiently from an SG&A standpoint. So, it's a balanced approach. We're not hesitating to invest in growth initiatives. We haven't pulled back on any investment in growth initiatives, but we are disciplined about how we manage it when the top-line is a little bit softer. Zach Fadem : Appreciate the time. Phil Daniele : Thank you. Appreciate the question. Operator : Thank you. That concludes our Q&A session. I will now hand the conference back to Phil Daniele, CEO of AutoZone, for closing remarks. Please go ahead. Phil Daniele : Thank you, everyone, for the questions today. Before we conclude the call, I'd like to take a moment to reiterate, we believe our industry is in a strong position and our business model is solid. We were excited about our growth prospects for the year, but we will take nothing for granted, as we understand our customers have alternatives. We have exciting plans that should help us succeed into the future, but I want to stress that this is a marathon and not a sprint. As we continue to focus on flawless execution and Wow! Customer Service and strive to optimize shareholder value for the future, we are confident AutoZone will be successful. Thank you for participating in today's call. Operator : Thank you, everyone. This concludes today's event. You may disconnect at this time and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.",

Phil Daniele : Thank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for AutoZone's 2025 first quarter conference call. With me today are Jamere Jackson, Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax. Regarding the first quarter, I hope you had the opportunity to read our press release and learn about our quarter's results. If not, the press release, along with slides complementing our comments today, are available on our website, www.autozone.com, under the Investor Relations link. Please click on the quarterly earnings conference call to see them. As we begin, I want to thank our more than 125,000 AutoZoners across the globe for their commitment to the first line of our pledge which states, AutoZoners always put customers first. Their contributions continue to drive our performance. We knew this first quarter would be similar to last quarter as our expectations for domestic same-store sales were muted and our international sales would be up against a difficult FX rate comparison. As we mentioned on our previous conference call, we did not expect the macro environment to positively impact our results. We are, however, optimistic that our improved execution and customer service initiatives are on track. The environment will improve as we experience winter weather, and the uncertainty of the election are now behind us. While the macro environment has led customers to be cautious with their spending, we remain confident that we will continue to gain share over time in both domestic DIY and commercial. For the quarter, with our continued focus on what we call, WOW! Customer Service, our total sales grew 2.1%, while earnings per share decreased 0.1%. We delivered positive 1.8% total company same-store sales with domestic same-store sales growth of 0.3%, and our domestic commercial sales grew 3.2% and up 9% on a two-year stack basis. International same-store sales up 13.7% on a constant currency basis. While our international business continued to comp impressively, up almost 14% in local currencies, we faced approximately 1,300 basis points of currency headwind, which resulted in an unadjusted 1% international comp. The stronger U.S. dollar had a negative impact on our reported sales, operating profit and EPS. Jamere will provide more color concerning the foreign currency impact on our business and what we are thinking regarding the impact on our financial results for Q2 and the remainder of the year. While there will always be tailwinds and headwinds in any quarter's results, what has been consistent is our focus on driving sustainable long-term results. We continue to invest in improved customer service, product assortment initiatives, our supply chain, and believe we are well positioned for future upswings in consumer demand. Now let me dive into our sales results. First off, our domestic DIY results showed a slightly improved - a slight improvement to last quarter as Q1's DIY comp sales were down 0.4%. Our discretionary merchandise categories continue to be a drag on our domestic DIY sales, similar to the last several quarters. For our first quarter, discretionary category sales were approximately 17% of our mix, and these categories continue to underperform our expectations. While better on a percentage basis than last quarter's results, we are now comping against last year's mid-single-digit declines in the discretionary categories. Our belief is that sales will continue to be pressured until the customer gets some economic relief and consumer confidence improves. With regard to inflation's impact on DIY sales, we saw the average like-for-like SKU inflation up approximately 1.6% for the quarter, while the average DIY ticket was up 1.3%. The difference between inflation and ticket growth was driven by the mix of goods sold. We were encouraged with the uptick in our average ticket and expect that trend to continue into Q2. We continue to expect inflation in our ticket to be approximately 3% over time and we anticipate average ticket growth will remain - will return to historic industry growth rates as we move further away from the hyperinflation over the last couple of years. We also saw DIY transaction count down 1.8%. This, too, was better than the down 2% we experienced last quarter. While we do not have final share data for the last segment of the quarter, we were encouraged by the recent favorable trends. We believe we have a best-in-class product and service offering, and this gives us confidence that when customers return to their historic shopping habits, we will be beneficiaries. Secondly, I'll speak to our regional DIY performance. We saw noticeable underperformance in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic and the rest of what we call the Rust Belt. These markets were down negative 1.8% versus negative 0.1% in the rest of the domestic markets. This doesn't surprise us as these markets have underperformed due to the milder-than-normal temperatures and lower than usual precipitation levels the last couple of years. Third, I will address weather and what we believe the impact was on our DIY business. This quarter was impacted by several markets having hurricanes. Although these storms are difficult for our customers and our AutoZoners, they did not have a meaningful impact on our DIY business. Also across much of the country, the weather pattern was similar to the previous year. We do not believe weather played a meaningful role on our DIY performance in Q1. Next, I will touch on our U.S. commercial business. Our commercial sales were up 3.2% for the quarter compared to last quarter's 4.5% total commercial growth. The first four weeks were the weakest as sales grew only 1.8%, primarily because of the hurricanes. More broadly across the U.S. and similar to what we saw with our DIY customers, we noticed underperformance in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic and Rust Belt markets. The spread between these markets and the rest of the country was approximately 400 basis points. We exited the quarter with stronger sales and believe we are continuing to gain share. While we have continued to see wide variations in performance across these more sensitive weather markets, we remain steadfast with our initiatives. We are encouraged with our improved satellite store inventory availability, significant improvements in Hub and Mega-Hub coverage, the continued strength of our Duralast brand and good execution on our initiatives to improve speed of delivery and improved customer service, which gives us confidence as we move through the year. This quarter, on a like-for-like SKU basis, our commercial business was down, which contributed a negative 0.7% to average ticket. The lack of inflation continued to pressure sales. Our sales growth will be driven by our continued ability to gain market share and an expectation that like-for-like retail SKU inflation will accelerate by the end of FY '25. For the quarter, we opened a total of 23 net domestic stores. We remain committed to more aggressively opening regular stores, Hubs and Mega-Hub stores. And for the remainder of FY '25, our openings will be continued to be skewed towards the back half of the year. Hubs and Mega-Hubs lead to better comp results that are growing faster than the balance of the chain and we are going to continually aggressively deploy these important assets. For the second quarter, we expect both DIY and commercial sales trends to modestly improve as our comparisons become slightly easier and we gain momentum from our sales growth initiatives. We will, as always, be transparent about what we are seeing and provide color on our markets and outlook as trends emerge. Before turning the call to Jamere, I'd like to take a moment, and discuss our international business. In Mexico and Brazil, we opened a total of 11 stores in the quarter, and now have 932 total international stores. As you can see from the press release, our same-stores were just under 14% on a constant currency basis, and accelerated from last quarter's 10%. Today we have just under 13% of our total store base outside of the U.S. and expect this number to grow materially as we accelerate our international store openings. For the fiscal year, we expect to open around 100 international stores. As you'd expect, we continue to take our U.S. store learnings and introduce them into our international operations. We are very excited about the future in international stores. In summary, we have continued to invest in driving traffic and sales growth. This year we expect to again invest more than $1 billion in CapEx, in order to drive our strategic growth priorities. We are investing in accelerated store growth, specifically hubs and mega-hubs, placing inventory closer to our customers, distribution centers that drive efficiency, and reduce supply chain costs. And leveraging technology and our IT systems that improve our AutoZoners ability to serve our customers. We believe that this is exactly the right time to invest in these initiatives in order to be ready when industry demand ramps up. Now I will turn the call over to Jamere Jackson. Jamere Jackson : Thanks Phil. Good morning everyone. For the quarter total sales were $4.3 billion, up 2.1%. Our domestic same-store sales grew three-tenth of a percent and our international comp was up 13.7% on a constant currency basis. Total company EBIT was down nine-tenth of a percent and our EPS was down a tenth of a percent. As Phil discussed earlier, we had a headwind from foreign exchange rates this quarter. From Mexico, FX rates weakened 13% versus the U.S. dollar for the quarter, resulting in a $58 million headwind to sales, a $17 million headwind to EBIT and a $0.68 a share drag on EPS versus the prior year. We continue to deliver solid results despite the challenging economic backdrop that Phil discussed earlier. As the efforts of our AutoZoners in our stores and distribution centers, have enabled us to continue to grow our business. Let me take a few moments to elaborate on the specifics in our P&L for Q1. I'll start with giving a little more color on sales and our growth initiatives, starting with our domestic commercial business. For the first quarter, our domestic DIFM sales increased 3.2% to $1.1 billion. For the quarter, our domestic commercial sales represented 30% of our domestic auto parts sales, and 26% of our total company sales. Our average weekly sales per program were $15,900 flat to last year, as we lapped several new programs that, we opened that are not at maturity. Our commercial acceleration initiatives are continuing to deliver good results, as we grow share by winning new business, and increasing our share of wallet with existing customers. We continue to have our commercial program in approximately 92% of our domestic stores, which leverages our DIY infrastructure and we're building our business with national, regional and local accounts. This quarter we opened 37 net new programs, finishing with 5,935 total programs. Importantly, we continue to have lots of opportunities, to expand sales per program and open new ones. We plan to aggressively pursue growth across our domestic commercial customers, which represents a tremendous sales opportunity for our company. To support our commercial growth, we now have 111 mega-hub locations. While I mentioned a moment ago that our commercial weekly sales per program average was $15,900 per program, the 111 mega-hubs average significantly higher sales, and are growing much faster than the balance of the commercial business in Q1. As a reminder, our mega-hubs typically carry over 100,000 SKUs, and drive tremendous sales lift inside the store box, as well as serve as an expanded assortment source for other stores. The expansion of coverage and parts availability continues to deliver a meaningful sales lift to both our commercial and DIY business. These assets are performing well individually and the fulfillment capability for the surrounding AutoZone stores, is giving our customers access to thousands of additional parts and lifting the entire network. We have now set a new objective to have just under 300 mega-hubs at full buildout. Our customers are excited by our commercial offering, as we deploy more parts in local markets closer to the customer, while improving our service levels. On the domestic retail side of our business. Our DIY comp was down 0.4% for the quarter. Importantly, we maintain share in DIY, and we're well positioned when the industry reaccelerates. As Phil mentioned, we saw traffic down 1.8% along with a positive 1.3% ticket growth. As we move forward, we would expect to see slightly declining transaction counts offset by low to mid-single-digit ticket growth in line with the long term historical trends for the business driven by changes in technology and the durability of new parts. Our DIY share has remained strong behind our growth initiatives. Importantly, the market is experiencing a growing and aging car park, and a challenging new and used car sales market for our customers, which continues to provide a tailwind for our business. These dynamics, ticket growth, growth initiatives and macro car park tailwinds we believe will continue to drive a resilient DIY business environment for FY '25. Now I'll say a few words regarding our international business. We continue to be pleased with the progress we're making in our international markets. During the quarter, we opened six new stores in Mexico, to finish with 800 stores and five new stores in Brazil, ending with 132. Our same-store sales grew 13.7% on a constant currency basis, and 1% on a reported basis. We remain committed to international and given our success in these markets, we will accelerate the store opening pace going forward. We are bullish on international being an attractive and meaningful contributor to AutoZone's future sales, and operating profit growth. Now let me spend a few minutes on the rest of the P&L and gross margins. For the quarter our gross margin was 53%, up 16 basis points. This quarter, while we did not book any LIFO adjustments, we did have a $2 million unfavorable LIFO comparison to last year. Excluding LIFO from both years, we had a 21 basis point improvement in gross margin, driven by continued improvement in merchandising margins. As a reminder for Q2, last year, we had a $14 million credit and we do not expect to have any credits this Q2, as freight cost increases are offsetting deflation and the remainder of our cost of goods. At quarter end, we still have $19 million in cumulative LIFO charges yet to be reversed through our P&L. And as I've said previously, once we credit back the $19 million through the P&L, we will not take any more credits and we will begin to rebuild an unrecorded LIFO reserve. Moving to operating expenses, our expenses were up 4.5% versus last year as SG&A, as a percentage of sales delevered 75 basis points. While we are managing our SG&A spend in a slower growth environment in a disciplined way, we will continue to invest at an accelerated pace in IT and CapEx, to underpin our growth initiatives. We believe these investments will pay dividends in customer experience, speed and productivity and are important enablers, for us to gain future market share. We will remain committed to being disciplined on SG&A growth as we move forward and we will manage SG&A expenses in line with sales growth over time. Moving to the rest of the P&L, EBIT for the quarter was $841 million, down nine-tenths of a percent versus the prior year. As I previously said, FX rates reduced our EBIT by approximately $17 million. On a constant currency basis, our EBIT would have been up approximately 1%. Interest expense for the quarter was $107.6 million, up 18% from Q1 a year ago. As our debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $9 billion versus $8.6 billion a year ago. We're planning interest in the $108 million range for the second quarter of FY '25 versus $102.6 million last year. Higher debt levels and borrowing rates across the curve are continuing to drive interest expense increases. For the quarter, our tax rate was 23% and up from last year's first quarter of 21.6%. This quarter's rate benefited 72 basis points from stock options exercised, while last year it benefited 147 basis points. For the second quarter of FY '25, we suggest investors model us at approximately 23.4% before any assumption on credits due to stock option exercises. We are assuming Q2 option exercises are less than Q2 last year, which had $23 million of credits. Moving to net income and EPS, net income for the quarter was $565 million, down 4.8% versus last year. Our diluted share count of $17.4 million was 4.7% lower than last year's first quarter. The combination of lower net income, and lower share count drove earnings per share for the quarter to $32.52, down a tenth of a percent for the quarter. As a reminder, the unfavorable FX comparison drove our EPS down approximately $0.68 a share. Now let me talk about our free cash flow. For the first quarter, we generated $565 million in free cash flow, versus $595 million last year in Q1, driven by lower net income and higher CapEx. We expect to continue being an incredibly strong cash flow generator going forward, and we remain committed to returning meaningful amounts of cash to our shareholders. Regarding our balance sheet, our liquidity position remains very strong and our leverage ratio finished at 2.5 times EBITDAR. Our inventory per store was up 5.4% versus Q1 last year, while total inventory increased 8.7% over the same period last year, driven by new store growth and inventory placement, to support new growth opportunities. Net inventory defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable on a per store basis, was negative $166,000 versus a negative $197,000 last year and negative $163,000 last quarter. As a result, accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 119.5% versus last year's Q1 of 124.4%. Lastly, I'll spend a moment on capital allocation, and our share repurchase program. We repurchased $505 million of AutoZone stock in the quarter, and at quarter end we had $1.7 billion remaining under our share buyback authorization. Our ongoing strong earnings balance sheet and powerful free cash continues to allow us to return a significant amount of cash to our shareholders through our buyback program. We have bought back over 100% of the then outstanding shares of stock, since our buyback inception in 1998. While investing in our existing assets and growing our business. We remain committed to this disciplined capital allocation approach that, will enable us to invest in the business, and return meaningful amounts of cash to shareholders. To wrap up, we remain committed to driving long-term shareholder value, by investing in our growth initiatives, driving robust earnings and cash and returning excess cash to our shareholders. Our strategy continues to work. We're growing our market share and improving our competitive positioning in a disciplined way. As we look forward to the balance of our fiscal year, we're bullish on our growth prospects behind a resilient DIY business, a fast growing international business and a domestic commercial business that is continuing to grow share. I continue to have tremendous confidence in our ability to drive significant, and ongoing value for our shareholders behind a strong industry, a winning strategy and an exceptional team of AutoZoners. Before handing the call back to Phil, I want to remind you that we report revenue comps on a constant currency basis, to reflect our operating performance. We generally don't take on transactional risks, so our results primarily reflect the translation impact for reporting purposes. As I mentioned earlier in the quarter, foreign currency resulted in a headwind on revenue and EPS. If yesterday's spot rates held for Q2. Then we expect approximately a $95 million drag on revenue, a $30 million drag on EBIT, and $1.30 a share drag on EPS. And if rates remained at the current spot rates for the full fiscal year of 2025, we would expect approximately a $355 million impact to revenues, $120 million impact to EBIT, and a $4.90 a share impact the full year EPS. And now I'll turn it back to Phil. Phil Daniele : Thank you, Jamere. We are proud of our AutoZoners across the globe, and the results our team delivered this past quarter. We promise to continue to focus on improving our execution, and driving WOW! Customer Service. While our sales increases don't reflect it quite yet, we believe we've made meaningful progress on our initiatives, and are well positioned to grow sales across our domestic and international store bases, with both our retail and our commercial customers. Our gross margins are solid, and our operating expense is appropriate for future growth. We continue to put our capital at work where it will have the biggest impact on sales, our stores, distribution centers and leveraging technology to build a superior customer experience where we are able to say yes to our customer's needs. The top focus areas for fiscal 2025, will remain growing share in our domestic commercial business, and continuing our momentum in international. We believe we have a solid plan in place, for the balance of the fiscal year. We know our focus on parts availability and our WOW! Customer Service culture will lead to sales growth, and gains in market share. We're excited to start calendar 2025. In September, we hosted our field leadership teams here in Memphis for AutoZone's 2025 national sales meeting. The energy and excitement about our plans and what we can accomplish was fantastic. Our operating theme for this New Year, Great People, Great Service was on full display over those four days. I could not be more proud of the effort being exhibited across our organization. This year, we will focus on our AutoZoners like never before. We are determined to improve upon an already outstanding culture of customer service. In this difficult macro environment, we cannot rest on our laurels. We have to make sure every store is staffed right, every hour of the day. Our processes need to function correctly always. We must meet our store opening goals and timelines. Simply put, we have to remain the execution machine that we have always been. Fiscal 2025 top priorities, are based on improving execution and WOW! Customer Service. We will continue to invest in the following strategic projects, reaccelerating our new hub and mega-hub openings. As we said recently, we now plan to have more than 285 domestic hubs or mega-hubs. These stores do take time, but we are incredibly excited about their continued performance. Effectively and efficiently opening our new distribution centers, and optimizing our direct import facility, ramping up our domestic and international store growth. As discussed, our international teams posted same-store sales comps on a constant currency basis of nearly - or 14%, continuing several years of strong growth, and most importantly reaccelerate our domestic commercial sales growth. As the macro environment has remained challenging, AutoZoners have been focused on improving execution, and leveraging our culture of outstanding customer service. The automotive aftermarket, is always going to go through change, and we look to take advantage of that change, and focus on gaining additional market share. We are excited about what we can accomplish, and our AutoZoners are committed to delivering better results in 2025. We believe AutoZone's best days are ahead of us. Now we'd like to open up the call for questions. Operator : Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Please pose your question. Your line is live. Bret Jordan : Hi, good morning guys. Phil Daniele : Good morning, Bret. Jamere Jackson : Good morning, Bret. Bret Jordan : Hi, could you talk a little bit about what you're seeing on the West Coast as one of your peers, is shutting stores and exiting that region? I guess in the short-term how you see inventory liquidation and maybe any price disruption, I think in the longer term, how you see that market share filtering out, obviously there will be some share gain potential? Jamere Jackson : Yes, I'd say this is early innings in what they're doing. Obviously as they're closing their stores, they've ramped up their discounting and things of that nature. It's very early as you could imagine, and it's hard to tell what that looks like over time. I think that'll be a benefit for us out there as we'll see shared gains, as they exit those markets they are discounting. That could potentially be a slight headwind in the short-term, as there's discounted prices in what's a pretty inelastic business. And it's kind of wait and see at this point. But long-term, I think those will be great opportunities for us to gain some market share out there. Bret Jordan : Okay. And then could you talk about the cadence of the first quarter, I guess into the second quarter? I think you called out that the first four weeks were the weakest in commercial. But could you talk about what we've seen as winter has begun to show up? Phil Daniele : Yes, that's correct. The first, if you think about the DIY business, we've talked a lot about the underperformance in kind of those Rust Belt markets. That's kind of continued but pretty consistent. And there wasn't a whole lot of weather impact in the quarter on the DIY side of the business. The commercial business, those first four weeks is where those hurricanes came across. A lot of the Southeast markets. And it has a more material impact initially on the commercial side of the business, as those shops get disrupted. And that's what we saw in the first four weeks of the quarter, and then it kind of returned to more normal volumes in the back half of the quarter on the commercial side of the business. Bret Jordan : Okay. Have you seen the later part of the quarter and the beginning of the second quarter improve with cold weather, or is it really not meaningful enough yet? Phil Daniele : Again, our quarter just ended. It's so early in the quarter. We like the initial part of the winter, but we've got a long way to go in winter to see that materialize. And again, I think what matters the most over time is does those Rust Belt markets, and the cold and snow markets. Do they get precipitation and cold weather throughout the winter, which really hasn't happened over the last couple of years. Bret Jordan : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is coming from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please pose your question. Your line is live. Simeon Gutman : Good morning, everyone. My question, it's on operating income growth and you mentioned ex the FX. It would have been up slightly. My question is, if this backdrop of sluggish macro doesn't change, and comps more or less stay in this area, is that a good way to think about EBIT? I know you don't guide, but the question is, can you strengthen comps with keeping EBIT in this slightly up range, or are you debating to invest more for some period of time, and take it a little bit lower? Jamere Jackson : Yes, I think a couple of dynamics stand out to us. One is we do expect the comps to improve as we move through the year, and we're positioning ourselves both in terms of inventory and infrastructure to take advantage of some of those opportunities. I think the second dynamic is that, we expect gross margins to remain strong as we move through. We're taking good actions on the merchandising margin side of the business. And the teams are doing a fantastic job of executing there. And then the third is, we're able to manage our SG&A in a very disciplined way. Now, we are going to invest in infrastructure and opportunities to take advantage of sort of the competitive environment and the opportunities for us to grow, share. But we believe that we can do that without it having a negative impact on operating income. So in a lower comp environment, you would expect us to be disciplined in the middle of the P&L, but we are going to invest in a disciplined way to take advantage of those growth opportunities. Simeon Gutman : Okay. That's helpful. Jamere, my second question to follow-up. It's on pricing and CPI and then tariffs. So the CPI is picking up. Curious if there's any bearing to the real world with it. They're getting into 3% to 4% range year-over-year. And then when Biden put back these Section 301 tariffs earlier in the year, some prices went up. I'm just curious how that example could play into potential future tariffs. Meaning did the suppliers take them? Did they take price? Are you taking price? Like, how is that working? Jamere Jackson : Yes, tariffs are an interesting question. And I'll start off by saying at this point, we really don't know, what's going to happen. Our merchant teams have been dealing with tariffs now for the better part of a decade. And I think if you go back historically and look early on when those tariffs happen, the vast majority of our supply chain was pretty dedicated to certain countries of origin. Since that timeframe, we've done a lot of work to make sure that our country of origins have been diversified. We have more than one category in the vast majority, more than one provider in the category than we had back then. And we've become pretty nimble in our supply chain. So, we'll continue to exercise against that playbook. And long-term, I think this industry has been very disciplined in the pricing strategies and I suspect that that will continue. But it's very early in this cycle to see what ultimately is going to happen with tariffs. Jamere Jackson : And I think on the inflation front, while we are starting to see some movement in CPI, I mean, a little bit closer to home, we've seen freight start to spike up. We expect that to make its way in the cost of goods and ultimately in the pricing and tickets over time. And I think the labor markets have thawed a little bit. So we're not seeing what we saw, when we saw hyperinflation there. But to the extent that there is some inflation, as Phil mentioned in his prepared comments, we expect the normal inflation that we see inside the industry to return and that should have a positive impact on what we see in like-for-like inflation on an SKU basis. And as this industry has been very disciplined about taking pricing when we see that kind of inflation. So I think net-net it'll potentially be a tailwind, but it's going to work its way through over a relatively slow period of time, we believe. Simeon Gutman : Agreed. Okay. Thanks. Operator : Your next question is coming from Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. Please pose your question. Your line is live. Mark Jordan : Good morning. This is Mark Jordan on for Kate McShane. Just thinking about share repurchases. It came in a little bit lower than we were expecting for the quarter. How should we think about capital allocation going forward here? How do you feel about current debt levels, and are you planning on still rolling over the notes that are coming due in April this year? Jamere Jackson : Yes. So no change in our capital allocation policy as I mentioned, we're going to be a significant free cash flow generator. We're going to hold our leverage target in the two and a half times area. That gives us a tremendous amount of financial firepower, to invest in our existing assets to grow our business, and to give a significant amount of cash back to shareholders. And we're going to continue to run that play over time, and you can expect us as it relates to our debt stack, to continue to manage to a two and a half times leverage target, and that will impact what we do on any debt that's due. Mark Jordan : Okay. Perfect. And just as a follow-up, kind of piggybacking on the tariff comments that were made earlier, do you have the option, and do you plan on maybe accelerating some purchases, have any tariffs that might come across? Phil Daniele : Yes, I mean our merchants are looking at that today. Keep in mind the vast majority of the categories that we operate in are pretty low turning. So, we'll take opportunities where that makes sense to do that. And the merchants are pretty studious and adept in this type of environment, and we'll act accordingly. What's in the best, thoughts for us and obviously for our customer. Mark Jordan : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is coming from Michael Lasser with UBS. Please pose your question. Your line is live. Michael Lasser : Good morning. Thank you so much, for taking my question. Given the extra week you had last year in your calendar, how did the shift in how you measure your same-store sales impact your comp this quarter? And how would you expect that to play out over the next few quarters? Jamere Jackson : That's a good question, Michael. We didn't talk about it specifically, but it did impact our comps. About a point in the quarter, negatively impacted our comps about a point in the quarter. And we would expect just given the shifts in the calendar that, we potentially pick up an extra bump later in the spring that could impact our comps. But it was worth about a point. And it'll play out over the next couple of quarters or so, particularly as we get into the spring months. Michael Lasser : So Jamere, it'll - continue to be a drag in the next quarter and then it'll reverse in the third and fourth quarter of the year, is that right? Jamere Jackson : That's the right way to think about it. Michael Lasser : Okay. And my follow-up question is, if you look at the stores that are being serviced by the hubs, what is the average commercial sales per week in those locations, versus stores that are not currently being serviced by a hub? And is it a good rule of thumb, for us to think about that the - less productive commercial programs could reach the more productive commercial programs, as you accelerate the rollout of these hubs over the next several quarters, especially given the consolidation that's happening in the market with all these foreclosures? Thank you. Phil Daniele : Yes, Michael, great question. And we don't break out all those numbers and share them publicly, but you can suffice it to say that when a hub or a mega hub gets put into a market, those stores overperform a satellite store, as you would probably imagine. They have deeper inventory and they also lift the market frankly, on both sides, on DIY and the commercial side of the business. But delineating those is - in many cases, hubs may have been serviced. Stores may have been serviced by a megahub that was say 100 or 200 miles away. As you can imagine, if you put - inventory closer to the customer, it lifts all of those boats in that market, if you will. So it's better for us. Again today we have, if you think about our store placement, where we have these deeper inventories in both hubs and megahubs. We're just under 7% of our stores having these deeper assortments closer to them. Over time, we'll take up those megahubs pretty significantly and that will lift both DIY and commercial sales in those markets. The closer you get, the inventory to the customer, the bigger advantage you have. Hopefully that answers your question. Operator : Your next question is coming from Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan. Please pose your question. Your line is live. Chris Horvers : Thanks. Good morning, guys. So my first question is on the gross margin. You talked about the LIFO headwind. Presumably there was some DIY mix headwind. If you back that out, it looks like you're generating 40 basis points of expansion from lower product costs. So can you talk about what's going on there? That seems, that level seems pretty consistent with where you've been the past couple of quarters. So how far are, you into that initiative, and how much longer do you think we can continue to benefit - that level of improvement? Jamere Jackson : Yes, I mean, we have a few moving pieces in the gross margin line, but I'll say a couple things. Number one, from a merchandising margin standpoint, we are doing extremely well both in terms of how we're merchandising, the work that we're doing with our supply base, the mix of products that we have in the marketplace. I feel pretty good with where we are, there are a couple dynamics that are happening. We're not raising prices as fast as we were, when we saw sort of more inflation in the marketplace and more like-for-like inflation. So we're offsetting that, to some extent with the tremendous actions that we have from a merchandising margin standpoint. LIFO wasn't that big of a deal this quarter. We only had, a couple million dollars of credits. Last quarter, we didn't book anything this quarter. And just given where freight is, and some of the inflationary impacts that we've talked about, it's not likely that we're booking any LIFO credits next quarter. In fact, we could actually see some headwinds just depending on where we are. And then, I'll say the third dynamic that we have is, we've got a couple of new DCs that are coming online. And those DCs are clearly not at maturity. And that's a little bit of a drag in the gross margin line. So net-net, when you put it all together, I'm very pleased that we're up 21 basis points on an ex LIFO basis. I think we're running the gross margin play like we always do, with intensity. And we should be managing gross margins to be positive, as we move through the back half of the year. Chris Horvers : Got it. And then as it relates to the balance sheet. I know in a previous question you talked about, staying around two and a half times, based on, I know you don't guide, but based on maintaining the current level of debt, assuming more of a gradual improvement in comps over the balance of the year. It would seem like, it could, it could really draw down on the amount of share repurchases you could make. In the past, we've seen you move up a little bit higher than two and a half, maybe into the 2.6, 2.8 range. To what extent do you see flexibility in your ability to just take it up, and keep that investment grade rating? Jamere Jackson : Yes I mean, we clearly have a tremendous amount of flexibility there. And you hear me often talk about it as the two and a half times area. And so that two and a half times area gives us the ability at different points of time to tick it up a little bit, or even tick down a little bit as you've seen us do in the past. So, but we like being in that two and a half times area. As I said, it gives us a tremendous amount of flexibility to invest in the business, to grow with our growth initiatives, and to give a lot of cash back to shareholders. And we're going to continue to run that play over time. Chris Horvers : Great. Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question is coming from Steven Forbes with Guggenheim Securities. Please pose your question. Your line is live. Steven Forbes : Good morning, Phil. Maybe just a follow-up on the mega-hubs and hub strategy. I believe you raised the target for the end state to 300 from maybe 200 plus. So curious what drove that. So maybe learnings that are driving that decision, and if there's been any change in the planned cadence of openings over the next years to come? Phil Daniele : Yes, so the change in strategy, if you go all the way back, ultimately we thought we'd have somewhere between 25 and 40 of these mega hubs, it's a long time ago. Then we've updated the guidance several times. The benefit of these stores is, we continue to see outsized performance from the hubs and specifically the mega-hubs. And it's kind of interesting as you look back over time, we kind of thought we've reached the height of what these stores will be able to produce for us. And at the end of the day, they continue to grow, and become more and more productive as we continue to optimize our inventory in those stores, continue to leverage the power of our brands, add incremental brands and incremental assortment, and they help on both. We talk specifically about the commercial side of the business, but they do help on both sides of the business. They kind of become epicenters for the surrounding stores, and they help drive both commercial and DIY sales results. So we like these assets. As I've said before, we wish we could open them faster. They do take time. Jamere has now got a pipeline full of about 80 of these stores that are essentially ready to go. But it does take us almost two years to get these stores open on average. So it takes time, but we're excited about them. Again, just under 7% of our stores today have stores with deeper assortments. That's including hubs and mega-hubs. And as a reminder, the mega-hubs have roughly 100,000 SKUs in them, and the hubs have somewhere between 45 and 60,000 SKUs. And again, we like these assets and we're going to go as fast as we can, to keep opening them. Jamere Jackson : Yes, I think one of the things you've heard me mention over the last couple of years, is that we were testing mega-hub density in several markets. And as we've wrapped up those tests, one of the things that we've learned is that we can jam mega-hubs closer together, and see very little in terms of cannibalization. So to Phil's point, when we put those boxes in the marketplace. We're seeing a lift to both the DIY and the commercial business. So as we've wrapped up that mega-hub density test, that's given us a lot of confidence about the number that we can put in the marketplace, where we should put them. And as we said, we're rapidly building the pipeline moving forward. Steven Forbes : Then maybe as a follow-up, sticking with real estate, top focus area, ramping up store growth. You gave the targets in the past for sort of out year domestic and international stores per year. Any updates on how we should be reframing, or rethinking the curve, or the slope of new store openings? Jamere Jackson : So Phil's smiling at me when this happens. This is one of my big KPIs inside of the company. But we feel very good about the pace that we're ramping up stores. We're going to open significantly more stores domestically this year, than we did last year. They will be back half loaded. And then as Phil talked about in his prepared comments, we'll open roughly 100 stores internationally here. So the target of doing 300 domestic and 200 international, we're on the right glide path to do that towards the end of the decade. We've rebuilt our store development pipelines here. We've got some attractive opportunities. We're going as fast as we can to get them open. And this will be a good, significant piece of our growth strategy as we move forward. Phil Daniele : I think, I would say we're much more confident in our ability to hit those timelines for this year and get towards that. Roughly 500 stores open in all markets, domestically being roughly 300 and international 200 by that '28 timeframe that Jamere mentioned. So we feel good about where we're headed. Again, these stores take a long time. The trails on these stores are pretty long from the time you decide to open up a store to the day it actually rings up its first sale, takes quite a bit of time. But we're excited about where we're headed and feel pretty confident that we'll be able to meet our goals. Steven Forbes : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is coming from Steven Zaccone with Citi. Please pose your question. Your line is live. Steven Zaccone : Great. Good morning. Thanks very much for taking my question. I wanted to focus on the DIFM business. Sequentially, it looks like the comps got a little bit weaker. Now you called out some weakness in those first four weeks, but could you just talk through how transactions performed? Do you attribute the sequential step down, largely those first four weeks? Is there anything you've seen in the industry that, would suggest the overall industry backdrop for DIFM has gotten a little bit weaker? Phil Daniele : Yes, we - did decelerate a little bit from our Q4 comp, total comp. The first four weeks were definitely impacted and mostly in those markets where we saw the impacts from those hurricanes. If you kind of think about what we've talked about with transactions and ticket average, the ticket average on the commercial side of the business has been more muted. Although we are seeing some transaction growth, which we're pretty happy about. We exited the quarter with some improving comps versus the first four weeks. There are lingering effects to those hurricanes. And I'll also say, if you look inside of our commercial business, we don't share all this detail, but if you think about any of our customers that are new and used car related. Those segments of business have been pretty poor, over the last couple of quarters. I'm not so sure that segment of business responds quickly. As you think about the new car sales, used car sales are down over the - if you call the pandemic highs of over 40 million used cars sold in a year, and interest rates continue to be high. So I'm not sure those particular segments recover. We do like what we see in the other parts of our business. The UDS customers are pretty resoundingly in positive area and we think that's a positive trend for us going forward. Steven Zaccone : Okay. That's helpful. And then just to shift SG&A, the dollar growth rate was one of the lowest in quite some time. Is there anything to call out there in terms of some of the fixed cost pressure in the business? Maybe wage inflation, is that moderating or and how do you think about that SG&A growth rate over the balance of the year? Jamere Jackson : Yes, I mean, what we've said is that we're going to grow SG&A in a disciplined way as we, continue to focus on growing our business as we move forward. We're continuing to invest at a very healthy clip in our growth initiatives that, are really focused on speed and productivity, and improving our customer service levels. We have seen wages cool off some. And so, that has given us an opportunity to not see the same sort of growth rates that we saw when SG&A was significantly more elevated. The growth rate in SG&A was significantly more elevated. So, what I'll say overall is that, we've run this play with intensity over time. We're investing in a disciplined way, and to the extent that there are market opportunities for us to grow share, we've got the inventory and infrastructure in place to take advantage of those opportunities. Steven Zaccone : Okay. Thanks for the detail. Operator : Your next question is coming from Scot Ciccarelli with Truist. Please pose your question. Your line is live. Scot Ciccarelli : Good morning, guys. Phil Daniele : Good morning. Scot Ciccarelli : Hi. Looking for clarification or comments about expecting better DIY and commercial performance based on where we are with the macro, are you also expecting improvement in domestic stacked comp trends, or is the improvement you referenced just fully due to easier comparisons? Jamere Jackson : Well, I think you got a couple things going. Clearly, we've got some easier comps in the back half of the year, and I'm specifically thinking about what we have on the commercial side of the business. But I think you layer on top of that the progress that we're making with our growth initiatives. And we've been on a steady diet of focusing on, putting more inventory in the local markets closer to customers. We've been really focused on driving speed and service and those things even in a commercial market that has not seen the same levels of growth that we've seen over the last couple of years. Those are the kinds of things that give us a lot of confidence as we move forward. And then, we think there are going to be some share opportunities available for us both on the DIY and the commercial side as we move through the year. So those are the things that give us a bullish outlook on where we're going to finish up the year. Phil Daniele : Yes, I think all those things that Jamere said are true. We've also, we've talked pretty extensively over the last 18 months or so, about improving our execution. Turnover at the store level has started to moderate. We've spent money and effort towards training our AutoZoners at the store both on the DIY side and the commercial side of the business. So I think we feel like, we've kind of got a running start going into this. The next seasonal opportunities that are going to come. We believe we'll get a more normal weather pattern, which hopefully will help specifically in those rust belt markets we've talked about that, have been a little more depressed. So we're pretty excited about where we're headed. And we feel like we're well positioned with the strategies that we have in place. And to Jamere's point where we've deployed inventory, put our effort towards focus on the customer, both on the DIY side and the commercial side. Our execution, among our strategies on delivering better service to the commercial customer, specifically in speed of delivery, have all improved. And we like where we are and we believe we'll be, we are well prepared to take the share opportunities we have in the future. Scot Ciccarelli : I appreciate that. And just a quick follow-up if I can. There is a very large retailer out there that's become increasingly price competitive across a lot of product categories, including auto parts, I think, especially batteries. Have you seen any change in the competitive environment outside of your direct peers, which are typically very consistent in their pricing strategies? Phil Daniele : Yes, if you think about mass they're doing, they always are going to have changes and we've competed against those mass players for four decades at this point in the automotive arena. They don't play in the vast majority of our hard parts, if you think about it that way. They do play in batteries and oil and some of those other categories that are generally front of store. And we like the strategy we put in place several years ago on the DIY, and specifically the sales force part of our business. And we're continuing to maintain those strategies. We don't see any reason to change those at this point. Scot Ciccarelli : Excellent. Thanks guys. Phil Daniele : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is coming from David Bellinger with Mizuho Securities. Please pose your question. Your line is live. David Bellinger : Hi, good morning. Thanks for the questions. Another one on the mega-hub target moving up closer to 300. I believe you already have more than 90% of domestic stores with access to mega-hub inventory. So are you getting to a point now where it's more normal to have multiple mega-hubs that are servicing a store location? Maybe two or three. And can you talk about the returns associated with that kind of strategy? Phil Daniele : Yes. So if you think about that inventory again, it really is about how forward placed that inventory is within a given market. If you think about some of these large metro markets, take New York, LA, Chicago, Miami, just pick one. The mega-hub may have been on one side of the city, and driving all the way to the other side of the city takes a long period of time. We believe the closer we can get this inventory to the customer, we will benefit. As Jamere talked about earlier, we've done some of these mega-hub density tests, and they've proved that we can add multiple mega-hubs in a given market depending on the size and the amount of vehicles in those markets, and not have a lot of cannibalization. And ultimately those stores perform incredibly well on their own. And then ultimately they begin to lift the surrounding stores on both the DIY side of the business, and the commercial side of the business. Ultimately it's proximity of hard to find parts close to the customer, either DIY or commercial and they benefit us. David Bellinger : Got it. And then just one quick follow-up. I think before you mentioned something like 7% of stores have a deeper assortment closer to them. Could you talk about what the makeup of that inventory is? Does that lean more to commercial? And just by having these mega-hubs in the market, what do delivery times look like? Do those get sped up as well? Thank you. Phil Daniele : So those 7% of stores are either, that's including both hubs and mega-hubs. Again, hubs have roughly 50,000 SKUs in them. Mega-hubs have over 100,000 SKUs. And delivery time, the assortment depth is generally speaking on the hard part side of the category. So starters, alternators, fuel pumps, things of that nature. And as those parts get deployed closer to the commercial customer. Instead of it taking three, four, six hours to get to that commercial customer, it may take 45 minutes, or an hour to get there. So that lifts the market as you get those parts closer to the customer. And it also helps on DIY. They're great assets for us and we like them. David Bellinger : Appreciate it. Thanks Phil. Phil Daniele : Thank you. Great question. Operator : Your next question is coming from Greg Melich with Evercore. Please pose your question. Your line is live. Greg Melich : Hi. Thanks guys. Two questions, just wanted to dig a little deeper on the inflation deflation. I guess on commercial we have the same SKU inflation and DIY, but why was DO IT FOR ME deflationary? I think you said 70 or 80 bps in the quarter? Jamere Jackson : Right. We've seen just continued pressure on the commercial side of the business. On the - we try to watch our competitors there all the time and it's a pretty small number, again less than 1%. But we have seen a little bit more deflation on the ticket average, on the commercial side of the business relative to the DIY. We do believe over time that those numbers will start to get back to more historic numbers. But it's not going to be a snapback. It's going to take multiple quarters. But I think the premise of your question have we seen irrational behavior on the commercial side of the business? And the answer is no. We have seen some pretty significant inflation on like SKU inflation on the commercial side of the business over the last several years, but ultimately that's moderated, and it's become slightly deflationary over the last quarter or two. We think that will return back to more normal historical trends over time. Phil Daniele : Just to be clear that DO IT FOR ME number that was an average ticket number. So that's really mix that's driving that rather than same SKU deflation on commercial. Jamere Jackson : That's correct. That's correct. Greg Melich : Got it. Jamere Jackson : It's a little bit of both, but. It's a little bit of both, but you're correct. Greg Melich : Got it. So then my second question was could you just level set us now on where your COGS come from? What percentage are import, what come from China, what are direct and indirect as we figure out how this plays out into next year? Jamere Jackson : Yes, we've never shared that externally I can tell you we buy from all over the world. We sell in a given year roughly 500,000 individual SKUs, and product assortment comes from all over the world. Lots of it comes domestically and tons of it comes from an international perspective. And our global sourcing team is very good at finding ways to reduce costs from those products that come from overseas. And frankly in the domestic arena as well. So it's a significant number. But I'll go back to what our merchants have done over the last decade, is spent a lot of time diversifying both country of origin as well as having multiple suppliers in each category. And it allows us to be more nimble and reduce those risks of inflation and tariffs and all the other things that come with any sort of global sourcing activity. Greg Melich : Great. Well thanks and good luck guys. Jamere Jackson : Thanks, Greg. Phil Daniele : Thank you. Okay. I think that is our last call. We have one more. Jamere Jackson : I'm sorry, one more. Operator : Yes, you have one more. Your last question is coming from Scott Stember with ROTH MKM. Please pose your question. Your line is live. Scott Stember : Great. And thanks for taking my question, guys. Phil Daniele : Thank you. Scott Stember : I want to dig into the international side of the equation. I know everybody's focusing on the domestic piece, but can you maybe breakout the sales growth, or the performance by region in Mexico versus Brazil and Mexico in particular? Maybe just talk about what's driving that - apparent meteoric growth that you're seeing there, and how do you expect that to play out for the rest of the year? Phil Daniele : Our international markets, and we don't break them out between the Brazil and the Mexico markets. We talk about them in total. But our international markets have been great for us. They're growing very quickly. Obviously it's much more weighted towards Mexico than Brazil, because of the store count. We have just over 100 stores in Brazil. And as to Jamere's point earlier, we have over 800 in Mexico. But the reason we're seeing such great performance there, is they're great markets and we've exported a lot of the domestic strategies into those markets. We've also said the biggest opportunity for us to grow domestically is commercial, and it is the same on those international markets as well. And we like the strategies that we have in place, and we think they'll continue to accelerate, both in store count and in productivity. Scott Stember : And then a follow-up. Have you ever disclosed what the DIFM versus do-it-yourself mix is in Mexico? Phil Daniele : No, we have not. Scott Stember : Okay. Got it. All right, that's all I have. Thank you.
