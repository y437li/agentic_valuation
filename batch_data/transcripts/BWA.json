Brinkman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division Colin Langan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division Dan Levy - Barclays Capital, Research Division Operator : Good morning. My name is Melissa, and I will be your conference facilitator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BorgWarner 2014 First Quarter Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Ken Lamb, Director, Investor Relations. Mr. Lamb, you may begin your conference. Kenneth Lamb : Thanks, Melissa. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us. We issued our earnings release this morning at 8 a.m. Eastern Time. It's posted on our website, borgwarner.com, on our home page. A replay of today's conference call will be available through May 8. The dial-in number for that replay is (855) 859-2056. You'll need the conference ID, which is 18708099. The replay will also be available on our website. With regard to our Investor Relations calendar, we will be attending the following conferences between now and our next earnings release : May 7, we'll be at the Wells Fargo Industrial & Construction Conference in New York; May 14, we will be at the Barclays Americas Select Franchise Conference in London; May 28, we'll be at the KeyBanc Automotive, Industrial and Transportation Conference in Boston; and June 4, we will be at the Deutsche Bank Industrials Conference in Chicago. Before we begin, I need to inform you that during this call, we may make forward-looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties, as detailed in our 10-K. Our actual results may differ significantly from the matters discussed today. Now moving on to our results. James Verrier, President and CEO, will comment on first quarter results, as well as some of our accomplishments during the quarter. And then Ron Hundzinski, our CFO, will discuss the details of our operating results and also our updated outlook for 2014. With that, I'll turn it over to James. James R. Verrier: Thank you Ken, and good day, everybody. Ron and I are very pleased today to review our first quarter results, as well as our recent accomplishments. First of all, I'd like to take a moment to congratulate and thank all of the BorgWarner employees for an excellent first quarter. Your efforts just continue to drive outstanding results for the company. So now on to our results. Reported sales are up in the quarter with $2.1 billion, which is up 9% from a year ago when we exclude the impact of foreign currencies and the Wahler acquisition. U.S. GAAP earnings were $0.69 per share, or $0.83 per share excluding the restructuring charges. Our operating income, again excluding noncomparable items, was an impressive 13.1% in the quarter. And we see 2 key factors that drove our strong results : solid sales growth in both Engine and Drivetrain segments and operational efficiency and cost controls that enabled strong incremental margins. Really outstanding performance by our operations. Let me go through the 2 segments, first of all, the Engine segment. First quarter sales were just over $1.4 billion, which is up about 8% from a year ago after excluding the impact of foreign currencies and Wahler. These results were led by strong turbocharger sales in Europe and China, new engine timing and VCT launches in China and higher EGR cooler and valve sales around the world. Into the Drivetrain segment, sales were approximately $680 million. That's up 12% from a year ago when we exclude foreign currencies. The Drivetrain results were driven by strong all-wheel drive sales in North America. We saw higher dual-clutch transmission module volumes in Europe and higher transmission component sales in Korea. Now while the Drivetrain business continues to grow, our restructuring plan is paving the way for a more profitable business in the future. We're minimizing drivetrain's high-cost footprint and simultaneously investing in Poland, Hungary, Mexico and China. And we see these actions will enhance Drivetrain's competitive position, which we expect to translate into winning more business in the future. Now these segment reviews highlight a couple of the core strengths of the company. Now the first one is our entire product portfolio is in high demand and contributed to our global growth. And we are seeing the improvements in Drivetrain, as expected, and continued strong performance in the Engine group. Now as we look to the future, we see BorgWarner continues to invest for the long term. Capital spending continues to grow. We spent about 6.1% of sales on capital in the first quarter, which is pretty much in line with our expectations, and we remain committed to supporting our future growth and productivity improvements. Our spending for R&D was about 4% of sales in the quarter, again, in line with our targeted spend of greater than 4% of sales this year. And I see the intensity around organic innovation and product development remains very strong inside the company. I'd like to take a moment or 2 to review some exciting announcements that we did make during the quarter. As I mentioned before, we completed the Wahler acquisition in the first quarter. And from a strategic perspective, Wahler's EGR valve technology we see very well positioned to exploit the rapid adoption of EGR in gasoline engines. And this, combined with its thermostat technology, makes it a very strong addition to our portfolio. And Ron will discuss the financial details of the Wahler transaction in just a few minutes. The company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.125 per share of common stock. The dividend is payable on May 16 to shareholders of record on May 2. BorgWarner also received an Automotive News PACE Innovation Partnership Award for its collaboration with General Motors on the Eco-Launch solenoid valve. We have several patents pending for this innovation, and GM has already committed to using the technology on an upcoming vehicle. BorgWarner's innovation also received a 2014 Automotive News PACE Award. Last but not least, BorgWarner was formally named the North American supplier of all-wheel drive transfer cases for the Toyota Tundra pickup truck. Now I'm going to provide an overview of our guidance for 2014, which has been updated a little since our last earnings call. We see sales growth in 2014 expected to be between 12% and 15%. This is up from the 7% to 11% previously, primarily due to the impact of the Wahler acquisition. Our operating margin remains at 12.5% or better. And our earnings guidance has been raised to $3.15 to $3.30 per diluted share, which is up from the $3.10 to $3.25 per diluted share previously. Again, both ranges exclude noncomparable items. So as I said, this is only a high-level overview of our updated guidance, and Ron will take you through the details shortly. So I see the first quarter as a strong start to what we expect to be another strong year for BorgWarner. We are expecting industry-leading revenue growth and continued excellence from our operation, and we see this combination resulting in tremendous earnings power for our company. The industry's adoption of our leading-edge powertrain technology we see will continue for years. And because of this, I feel very, very good about our company's future and really believe that no company in the auto sector is better positioned for long-term profitable growth than BorgWarner. So now with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ron. Ronald T. Hundzinski: Thank you, James, and good day, everyone. Before I begin reviewing the financials, I also would like to commend all of our employees for their hard work and congratulate them on another great quarter. Once again, the team exceeded expectations. Congratulations. Now on to our financials. James already provided a detailed review of our sales performance in the quarter. In summary, sales were up 9% from a year ago, excluding the impact of foreign currencies and the Wahler acquisition. The growth in the quarter came from both segments, from nearly every product group and from around the world. Overall, a strong quarter for sales. Working down the income statement. Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 21.4% in the quarter. That's a 120-basis-points improvement from a year ago, tremendous performance. SG&A as a percentage of sales was 8.3% in the quarter, down 30 basis points from a year ago. R&D spending, which is included in SG&A, was 3.9% of sales in the first quarter, in line with R&D spending a year ago. This implies that all of the 30-basis-points decline was in other SG&A spending. We attribute this to good execution of our cost control plan. Reported operating income in the quarter was $233 million. However, this includes a $40 million charge related to restructuring activities that I will discuss shortly. Excluding the charge, operating income was $273 million, or 13.1% of sales, compared with 11.7% of sales on a comparable basis a year ago. After excluding the impact of foreign currency, the Wahler acquisition and the restructuring charge, our year-over-year incremental margin was 34%, well above our mid-teens incremental margin target. In summary, operational efficiency led to an improved gross profit margin. Cost controls led to lower SG&A spending. This enabled us to maintain R&D spending and expand our operating income. Outstanding performance by operations and a great start to the year. As you look further down the income statement, equity in affiliate earnings was $9 million in the quarter, down slightly from $10 million last year. This represents the performance of NSK-Warner, our 50-50 joint venture in Japan, which sells transmission components to our Japanese customers in Japan and China; as well as TEL, our turbocharger joint venture in India. Interest expense and finance charges were $8 million in the quarter, down slightly from $10 million a year ago. Provision for income taxes in the quarter on a reported basis was $68 million. However, this includes a $9 million tax benefit related to restructuring. Excluding the impact of restructuring, provision for income taxes was about $77 million, which is an effective tax rate of about 20% in the quarter. Our estimated effective tax rate for the full year, excluding noncomparable items, is now 28%, up from 27% previously. This change is primarily due to a shift in our cash repatriation strategy. We are now focusing -- forecasting that the cash generated by our Chinese operations will be enough to fund our growth in China, as well as supplement other corporate initiatives. Therefore, we will begin repatriating cash from China in 2014 and expect this to continue for the foreseeable future. On an EPS basis, this will cost $0.05 per share in 2014. Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest was $8 million in the quarter, up from $7 million a year ago. This line item reflects our minority share, partners' share in the earnings performance of our Korean and Chinese consolidated joint ventures. That brings us back to net earnings, which were $159 million in the quarter, or $0.69 per share. Excluding the impact of restructuring activities, net earnings were $0.83 per share, up 28% from $0.65 per share a year ago. Now let's take a closer look at our operating segments in the quarter. As James said earlier, reported Engine segment sales were $1.4 billion in the quarter. Excluding currency and Wahler, Engine segment organic sales growth was 8% from a year ago. On a reported basis, adjusted EBIT for the Engine segment was 16.4% of sales. Excluding currency and Wahler, adjusted EBIT for the Engine segment was 17.2% of sales, up 110 basis points from 16.1% reported a year ago. Excluding currency and Wahler, the Engine segment's performance -- year-over-year incremental margin was 31% in the first quarter. Excellent performance by the Engine segment. In the Drivetrain segment, reported sales were $681 million in this quarter. Excluding currency, organic sales was up 12% from a year ago. On a reported basis, adjusted EBIT was 11.8% of sales. Excluding currency, adjusted EBIT was 11.9% of sales, sharply up from 9.3% of sales a year ago. Excluding currency, the Drivetrain segment year-over-year incremental margin was 34% in the first quarter, another outstanding quarter for the Drivetrain segment. As mentioned earlier, the Drivetrain restructuring continues. We have reached several agreements with the labor unions of both European facilities that we intend to close. The $40 million charge taken in the first quarter of 2014 was primarily related to one of the agreements. Charges related to the other agreement will come in future quarters. In summary, of the estimated $140 million total cost of restructuring plan, we have now taken approximately $90 million in charges, just over $50 million in the fourth quarter in 2013 and $40 million in the first quarter of 2014. To date, nearly 2/3 of the charges have been cash outlays for severance and other activities. We expect the remaining $50 million to also be primarily cash. From a performance perspective, we expect this restructuring plan to improve segment margins by 100 basis points or more and make the Drivetrain segment a solid double-digit business. We now expect that these actions will be taken for the next -- to the end of 2015, and the full benefit of restructuring is expected to be realized beginning in 2016. Now let's take a look at our balance sheet and cash flow. We generated $46 million of net cash from operating activities in the first quarter, up from $16 million a year ago. This increase was primarily related to higher net earnings. Capital spending, which was $126 million in the first quarter, up $39 million from a year ago. This increase was driven by capital required to support our backlog of net new business, which is gaining momentum. Free cash flow, which we define as net cash from operating activities less capital spending, was an outflow of $80 million in the first quarter. The first quarter is typically a challenge as it relates to cash flow. Our investment in working capital ramps up in the first quarter to match higher levels of business activity compared with the end of the year. Despite this, we still expect to generate strong free cash flow in 2014. Looking at the balance sheet itself. Balance sheet debt increased by $144 million at the end of the first quarter compared with the end of 2013. Cash decreased by $131 million during the same period. Net debt increased by $275 million, primarily due to the capital expenditures and the Wahler acquisition. Our net debt-to-capital ratio is 13%, up from 7.2% at the end of 2013. Net debt to EBITDA at the end of the year, on a trailing 12-month basis, was 0.4. Our capital structure remains in excellent shape. Before I review our updated guidance, I would like to go over some discussions of the Wahler acquisition. The total consideration for Wahler was $143 million, or about 0.4x sales. From a performance perspective, the operating income margin for the business is mid-single digits today. However, we've identified operational efficiency and footprint opportunities to present a clear path to double-digit margins for this business. We expect to achieve these levels in 2 to 3 years. As James mentioned, Wahler is a very good strategic fit for us, with great technology, an attractive customer base and BorgWarner-like growth. Once we've had a chance to restructure the business, it will be a solid contributor to our bottom line as well. Now I'd like to discuss our guidance for 2014. James reviewed our guidance at a high level, I'll discuss some of the finer points. Our sales guidance range is now 12% to 15%, up from 7% to 11% previously. From midpoint to midpoint, that's a 450-basis-point increase. The 2 components of the increase are Wahler and currency. Wahler sales are expected to add about 350 to 400 basis points of sales growth in 2014. But please note, that's for 10 months of sales. Previously, our sales growth guidance assumed very little currency impact. However, due to the favorable impact of currency on the first quarter sales and a more favorable outlook for the euro, we now expect currency to contribute 50 to 100 basis points of sales growth this year. We still expect raw material inflation of $5 million to $10 million in 2014, still a headwind, but less than what we see in a typical year. As James mentioned earlier, our operating income margin is expected to remain at 12.5% or better in 2014. This should be viewed in 2 parts. Wahler is not expected to contribute operating income in 2014 because of purchase price accounting adjustments, which will have an unfavorable impact on our operating margin. However, due to an improved outlook for the rest of our business, we are able to maintain our operating margin guidance. On the EPS guidance range, the range has been raised to $3.15 to $3.30 per diluted share, up from $3.10 to $3.25 per diluted share. The $0.05 per share increase has 2 components : a $0.05 per share unfavorable impact from a higher tax rate, and a $0.10 per share favorable impact from an improved outlook for the business. Finally, our expected diluted share count for 2014 is unchanged at approximately 230 million shares. This diluted share count guidance excludes any share repurchases that may be executed during the year. We continue to be confident in our ability to execute in any market. This company has demonstrated a heightened focus on efficiency and cost control. This focus resulted in highly efficient growth and record margins each of the last 4 years. With the return to historical growth rates and our operations performing at a very high level, 2014 should be another year of record sales and record profits for BorgWarner. As we look beyond 2014, we intend to execute our growth plan, yielding high-single to low double-digit growth and to efficiently convert our sales growth to profits. The future is very bright for BorgWarner. With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Ken. Kenneth Lamb : Thanks, Ron. Now let's move to the Q&A portion of the call. Melissa, please remind everyone of the Q&A procedure. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities. Richard Michael Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Just a couple from me. Ron, on the guide here, so you talked about Wahler and then FX. So it doesn't sound like you've assumed any improvement beyond -- or any production improvement beyond what you were thinking at the beginning of the year. Is that a fair statement? Ronald T. Hundzinski: Coming into the year, Rich, our guidance was based on program-level volume assumptions. So basically, our projections haven't changed today than they were when we came into the year. So we're still executing to our plan this year, and that's where our guidance is set at. Richard Michael Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Okay. And then is South America -- I know that you have some commercial business down there. How much of a drag on the business is that at this point going forward? James R. Verrier: Yes, Rich, this is James. It's -- you're right. It's primarily for us a commercial vehicle business. It's not that significant for us. Some of the conditions down there are not too bright right now, as you know, but it's not too material for us. Richard Michael Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Okay. All right. And then on Drivetrain, so the margins were very strong. You're still early stages on the restructuring. How should we think about that 100 basis points of structural margin expansion going out a couple of years and the benefit from that, given the performance here over the last couple of quarters? Ronald T. Hundzinski: Yes, Rich, let me set the starting point on this 100-plus basis points improvement. I think what everybody should do is they should take a look at 2013 as the base year and do your projections from that base year. I would not say take a look at the current run rate of the margins in that segment. So go back to 2013, which I'll give you the number, I think it was 10%, 10.3% for the full year. Kenneth Lamb : Let me add one thing, Rich, before you go to your next question. We are -- we did say that while we're growing during this restructuring period, you can still expect us to get our mid-teens incremental margins on that growth in Drivetrain while we're doing the restructuring. James R. Verrier: Yes. Richard Michael Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Okay. All right. But, I mean -- so it sounds like here in Q1, you had some things that went very favorable that are not necessarily sustainable. Is that...? Ronald T. Hundzinski: Well, Rich, we know a couple of things. One is the restructuring activities have just really begun. We made -- we have agreements now with the works councils. But now I'll just say this for the operating guys, the hard work starts. They have to start moving machinery and equipment and startup. So although they had a great quarter -- I'm not going to take that away from them, fantastic quarter. But in the subsequent quarters, now that we have those agreements, this is when all the equipment starts to move. And any time you start going through that process, it can get a little choppy. Richard Michael Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Okay. And then -- and just last one for me on Wahler. You said double-digit margin. Is there any reason to not believe that Wahler can get to this 12%, 13% range that the corporate average is currently? James R. Verrier: Rich, where I would -- the way I think about it right now is -- I mean, first of all, we're delighted to get the transaction completed. I think it's going to be a really, really terrific asset for us, with the technology it brings and the growth and the European customer relationships, primarily. So feeling very, very good about it. The start point, as Ron alluded to, is quite a bit below the normal BorgWarner level. It's mid-single-digit-type numbers. So we've got a good 2 or 3 years of work ahead of us to get it to that kind of double-digit range. And I think -- bear in mind, we're only, what, a couple of months in. We'll have better clarity on that as time plays out, Rich. But I think the real message is great technology, great growth, and we're going to work -- get it up, for the next 2 to 3 years, to that double digit. Where it rests 2 or 3 years from now, Rich, I'm not sure. We'll just keep working on that over the period. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : I just wanted to follow up on Drivetrain, because it was such strong performance in the quarter. I mean, is there anything going on with mix there on trucks or anything that might be sustained through the course of this year, as we go through recovery in North America and potentially, a stronger mix in Europe? James R. Verrier: John, I would say sales came in pretty much about where we thought they would be. I think the operating performance was strong. It wasn't so much of a revenue or a mix shift that drove good performance. I think we just executed, executed well. That's really the driver. And as Ron alluded to, we -- over the -- over some of the recent quarters, it's been a little bit choppy, a little bit that way. And I think this was certainly one of our strong quarters, but no big shift in volume or mix, John. John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Okay. And then just a second question on bringing cash back to the U.S. from China that's driving up the tax rate. What's the sense of urgency to pull that cash back to the U.S. and get hit by this higher tax rate? Is there something going on, on the acquisition front or return to capital to shareholders that we would expect to see, that you'd be bringing that cash back for it so quickly? Ronald T. Hundzinski: John, I wouldn't say there's any urgency. However, it does provide a lot of flexibility to do things like share repurchases. But I would say one of the other items is when we started taking a look at the long-range plan for the business in China, we see tremendous amount of opportunities to bring cash out in the future. So no urgency, but it does provide us some flexibility, and it's going to continue to provide us flexibility in the out years. John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Okay. And then just lastly, as you look at the acquisition landscape, it sounds like -- because you didn't do many buybacks, that you see a lot of stuff out there. What does it look like? Is there a pace of activity picking up, which it sounds like it is? And is there a potential for you guys to maybe get involved with direct injection technology and some technology there? Because that would be sort of a nice complement to your existing portfolio. James R. Verrier: John, first off, the activities, they're still pretty intense. We've certainly not slowed down with the Wahler acquisition now getting completed. But I would tell you, or say that the level of opportunities we have kind of in the pipeline, so to speak, is pretty similar to where we were a year ago. So it's a good healthy number. And just like we've talked about in the past, some of those are relatively early in the phase, pretty preliminary, and a couple of those are much further down the process. The way I would think about it from a technology point of view, John, we, we're focused heavily on the powertrain space that we're in. Drivetrain or Engine, we're agnostic, but both either or both are good. Light vehicle, commercial vehicle is fine. And regional, we don't have a bias there, because ultimately, these products that we participate in do go global. So I don't want to talk specifically on individual technologies, John. But bolt-on or kind of related products to where we're at right now are likely to be the primary focus for us going forward. And whatever technology we bring, it's going to deliver the type of growth that we've become used to with the company. So hopefully, that gives you a bit of a flavor for it, John. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Just a couple of questions on Wahler. How much of Wahler revenue actually was included in 1Q? Ronald T. Hundzinski: One month. Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : One month? Okay. Ronald T. Hundzinski: Just the month of March. Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Got it. And do you have the order number in that? Or do I just take one month of the $350 million for the year? Ronald T. Hundzinski: We said $350 million for the year, divided by 12, so that's a rough number. Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Got it. Understood. And how much of a drag is the PPA right now in 2014 numbers? Ronald T. Hundzinski: All right. Ravi, let me just take one quick second here. Yes, for the purchase price accounting at a normal run rate, you can look at the Q for some details and do some math, but I'll shorten it up for you and give you the numbers. Roughly $3 million to $4 million is a run rate drag. However, that's for full year. But I would like to point out that when you do an acquisition, you have to do fair value for inventories. So basically, I'm going to have 2 months with no profitability in the business. So the normal run rate is $3 million to $4 million, but I did have 2 months of, I'm not going to call them abnormal, of no profit, because of the weight of PPA. That goes away going forward. Kenneth Lamb : So Ravi, just let me -- this is Ken. Let me add on to that. So essentially, what we're saying is this year, you can expect operating income to be almost nothing... James R. Verrier: Nothing. Kenneth Lamb : This year. And then it will improve going forward from growth and incremental income, restructuring, and also the PPA will diminish. James R. Verrier: Right. Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Got it. So do you have any benchmark on what we should put in our model for like '15? I know you said you're getting double-digit margins over a 2- or 3-year period. But just, once you get that accounting headwind out, is it like a high single-digit margin for that business? Ronald T. Hundzinski: Well, double digits, and then I gave you the purchase price accounting, and then you could assign a growth rate to the top line as well, Ravi. Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Okay, understood. And just lastly, can you also update whether you have picked up any debt or any pensions or anything else that came with it? Ronald T. Hundzinski: Very immaterial. We did -- all right. On the debt side, it was -- cash paid was about $106 million, a little bit north of that. You can read that in the Q. We picked up about $30 million to... Kenneth Lamb : $33 million. Ronald T. Hundzinski: $33 million of debt. So the enterprise value gets up to the $146 million. Pensions were very small. I'll just say that. It's fairly immaterial. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Rod Lache of Deutsche Bank. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Can you just maybe just clarify for us, you said the guidance for incremental margins ex Wahler were mid-teens. And as you indicated, you converted at 34% in the quarter. So what is causing -- it was a pretty dramatic variance versus your expectation in the first quarter. And what are the headwinds that you're anticipating in Q2 through Q4, obviously, ex Wahler, which isn't going to contribute any EBIT. But what are the headwinds that would cause that to moderate back down to the mid-teens? Ronald T. Hundzinski: A couple of things. I had said earlier in the call that Drivetrain going forward would be a little bit more choppy as we start to move our production facilities to Eastern Europe. That's going to be a drag. Also, the deferred spending in the SG&A lines that we've done in 2013 will start to come back into the business, that would start to reduce our incremental margins. So 2 items, all right? Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : And with those items be, kind of, if you were to think about things on a year-over-year basis, I would presume that those don't recur in 2015. So the inefficiencies associated with moving your footprint or some of the extra SG&A spending, that would moderate. Is that reasonable? Ronald T. Hundzinski: Our long-term incremental margin guidance still would remain at mid-teens, though, Rod. So I'm not quite sure -- yes, you're right, we would, in the move to Eastern Europe, those headwinds would go away, but that's already in our expectations of 100 basis points plus, okay? On the SG&A side, in general, we will continue to invest in SG&A at some rate close to or slightly less than the sales growth. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Okay. And just to clarify on the Wahler acquisition, I missed what you said about the contribution that you're expecting for the 10 months. Were you just saying, take the $350 million, divide it by 12, times 10? Or was there a specific number you gave? And is Wahler actually growing organically, kind of similar to the rate that you guys have been experiencing? Kenneth Lamb : Rod, this is Ken. So yes, what Ron was saying was that the contribution in the first quarter was basically that $350 million of sales divided by 12. That was the 1 month of sales that we had for the first quarter. And the growth rate for Wahler going forward is similar to BorgWarner-type growth, as we think about how it's going to grow going forward. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli from Citi. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Just on the guidance for the year, I'm just trying to get an understanding of what the operating margin would have looked like outside of the Wahler acquisition. I think, Ron, you talked about the $0.05 headwind from tax, offset by $0.10 of improvement in the business. That seems to work out perhaps to about 40 basis points of margin improvement versus the prior outlook for the full year. Is that -- am I thinking about that correctly in terms of maybe you were -- you'd be brushing closer to 13 if not for the acquisition? Ronald T. Hundzinski: You're close. You're right, Itay. I mean, it's easy math. You can add back in the sales that we gave you some generation -- general numbers around and then recalculate it. But you're right, you're right in the 30 to 40 basis points, you're right. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Okay, perfect. And then just a couple housekeeping items. One, equity income looked like it was down a bit in Q1. Any thoughts on that for the full year? And then I think with the repatriation going forward in China, should we think about the tax rate in that 28% ballpark beyond 2014 as well? Ronald T. Hundzinski: At this point, I'll ask -- I'll answer the tax question. At this point, yes, 28% going forward. The affiliate earnings, you have to go back and say where are those earnings coming from. And they're coming from Japan and they're coming from India. India has been a challenged market. I think it will stabilize. I don't think it's going to deteriorate, but it's been a challenged market for everybody. And in Japan, that market, if you -- as everybody knows, they're moving production outside of Japan. Now going forward, I would say that I should see improvement going forward. I don't think we're going to see any continued deterioration in those markets, as far as on my equity line. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Great. And just lastly, any general comments on booking activity in the first quarter? James R. Verrier: Itay, it was a good quarter for us. I would say relatively consistent with prior quarters, certainly the last 3 or 4, which is good and healthy, good balance across pretty much all of the products and a nice balance globally. So I would say it's been a good typical booking business quarter for BorgWarner, if that makes sense to you. Operator : Your next question comes from Brett Hoselton with KeyBanc. Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : Wanted to ask you just, first of all, on the Wahler acquisition, kind of just the progression of margins over the next 2 to 3 years. Is there pretty steady progression in margins in your opinion? Or is it more of a stair-step in the out years for some reason? Ronald T. Hundzinski: Brett, I think James said this earlier, we've owned this asset for 2 months now. What I would say is we're refining where this business is going. We know the end game. We know where we can be. The timing it takes to get there -- I think over time, you'll hear more from us on how it's going. For us to give you an exact timeline right now is premature. Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : Fair enough. The -- and then, as I look at your balance sheet after you completed the Wahler acquisition, you've got kind of in around $500 million, $600 million in net debt. Sounds like you're starting to repatriate some cash from China. Certainly, you've got a lot of -- you have a lot of cash. I didn't see that you repurchased any shares in the quarter. I might have overlooked that in your press release. But how do we think about things going forward in terms of capital deployment? I know you've -- you're either going to do acquisitions or share repurchase. But in the past couple of quarters, it seems like you're really slowing your share repurchase down to kind of a standstill. Ronald T. Hundzinski: Brett, let me -- you're right. First, we did not do any share repurchases in Q1. So you don't have to go dig through a bunch of documents to find that out. We didn't do any in Q4. But let's talk about that for a second. In Q4, I funded a pension in Germany of some $150 million-ish, $137 million in Germany, which is -- it's a big cash outflow. Q1 is typically a low cash-generating quarter, historically, for a lot of companies. And as a result, we also did the Wahler acquisition, right? So if you look at 2 quarters, I wouldn't say that's indicative of us turning off the share repurchases. I would just say that was just 2 circumstances that happened back-to-back quarters that put us in a position where we just kind of had to hold still for a while, okay? Now you mentioned China. We see that China's going to generate a lot of cash for us, and we want to bring that back to the States, so that we can continue to initiate a lot of corporate items like share repurchase in the future, and give us the flexibility going in the future with our cash. So 2 quarters are not indicative and China's going to be a great cash flow for us, and we still remain flexible in share repurchases. Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : Yes, I think per John's question earlier, I think John's kind of -- the flavor of John's question was something along the lines of it kind of seems like you guys are setting up for an acquisition of some kind. James R. Verrier: Yes, Brett, this is James. I think as I was trying to say to John, that intensity has really not slowed down, and our philosophy continues on. That's still our primary use of the cash, I think, as we all know. And the approach remains the same, really, Brett, that we're working on a relatively large number of possible targets, with the belief that 1 or 2 of those over the next couple of years will flow through and get executed. We know the variable is often the businesses are not for sale. So these things are a little choppy in terms of how you get them -- how quickly you can get them done or even how you can even predict the timing of the event. But what you guys may be picking up on is there's a lot of intensity and a lot of belief that over the next couple of years, we will do additional acquisitions. And we remain confident that we'll be able to hopefully get that done. Operator : Your next question comes from Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets. Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Maybe just following off that last point. How -- I mean, this is obviously -- I think you classified Wahler as a tuck-in. So I wouldn't imagine it to be a huge drag on management resources. But maybe can you give us a sense as to how many deals of something around the size of Wahler do you think you can accommodate, just from a resource perspective, I guess? James R. Verrier: Yes, from a resource perspective, Joe, we would like to think over the next couple of years, we could probably do a couple more of that size or a little more and be able to manage those. It does depend a little, Joe, in terms of where they land within the business. What I mean by that is if all 3 were in one particular part of the company, that makes it a little more challenging. But our belief is that the list of targets are pretty well spread across all of the BorgWarner portfolio. So for us to do a couple more Wahler-like transactions in the next 12 to 24 months, that's very doable. If we have to do one more than that, that will probably be okay, too. So we're comfortable, which is why the intensity is not slowing down, Joe. Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Okay. And then maybe just on Wahler, attacking from a little bit of a different angle. It seems like Engine margins would have been high 16s this quarter ex Wahler. So if I sort of try to extrapolate what you said going forward, is a low double-digit incremental in the Engine business what you guys are expecting for this year, inclusive of Wahler? Ronald T. Hundzinski: Our guidance is always mid-teens incremental margins. That's our target. We don't really give guidance any closer than that at this point. Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : But it's mid-teens even inclusive of Wahler being neutral? Ronald T. Hundzinski: Yes. James R. Verrier: Yes. Operator : Your next question comes from David Leiker with Robert W. Baird & Co. David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : I've been jumping around a little, so I hope I don't repeat myself here on something. But on the repatriation of cash, did -- I don't think I heard you quantify how much cash you brought from China. Ronald T. Hundzinski: You heard correctly, David. I did not. David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : How much is it? Kenneth Lamb : Well, just to clarify, David, what Ron did say is that we will begin repatriating cash from China this year. Those were the exact words, get that into the transcript. Ronald T. Hundzinski: But I didn't give you a dollar amount, David, you're right. David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Yes, but can you help us out there, how much cash do you think you're bringing back? Ronald T. Hundzinski: I would say it's sizable for me to make a tax change, how's that? I know I'm not giving you an exact number, but it's not $10 million, right? It's north of that. It's sizable that I see opportunities in the future and it's a good chunk of cash this year to put me in a very flexible position in the U.S. David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Did you bring cash back in the first quarter? Or is that just adjusting it for what you think you're going to do over the course of the year? Ronald T. Hundzinski: Course of the year. We have not yet brought anything back from China. We will bring it back through the summer months. David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Okay. And then as we look at the cash that you generate in China and the excess cash, what portion of that do you think you'll bring back here versus keep there to reinvest in the business? Ronald T. Hundzinski: David, that's a little bit of a complex question, and I'll tell you why. What we're really doing is we're able to leverage up a little bit more in China than we have in the past, with local borrowing lines in China. Our banking relationships have gotten really strong there. So what we're able to do is leverage up, at the same time, we can bring cash back out of there, which would indicate that we could bring back a higher percentage of the cash flow because of the leveraging. I don't have an absolute number for you. But that's, in strategy, what's going on in China right now. David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Okay, great. And then as we -- have you pull off Wahler and the currency and vehicle production, it looks like your growth above market organically from new business was a little bit on the light side. Is there anything in particular from a headwind that you would call out that's behind this? It's better than what we were seeing last year, but is there anything that's still a headwind for you? James R. Verrier: I wouldn't say anything significant, David. I think where we're at from a revenue run rate, so to speak, is about where we thought we'd be at. And I think when we look at the end markets from where we started the year, European light vehicle production as an example, we don't see it's moved that much -- a little bit of nuance in between regions and platforms. But in general, it's about what we thought of the end markets, and it's about what we thought inside of BorgWarner, is where we're at right now. David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : And then just one last topic here on Wahler, how much of the purchase price was goodwill? Ronald T. Hundzinski: Just a second, David. You can get that in the Q. But I'll see if I have that right now for you, about $16 million, I think it was, about $16 million. You -- if you go into the Q, which we file at roughly noon today, I think that's what you'll see in the Q. David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : And then -- and I know you kind of talked around this a little, but how much would Wahler add to your 3-year backlog of new business? Kenneth Lamb : Dave, let me do some work on that and talk to you about that later. But I mean, what we said is we expect growth similar to our own, from Wahler. David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Growth on the backlog or your current revenue growth versus the market? Kenneth Lamb : Dave, Wahler should growth at a similar rate to BorgWarner, which we've said is high-single to low double-digit growth. Operator : Your next question comes from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Ryan J. Brinkman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Thanks for the double-digit margin in BorgWarner, like growth guidance that you gave here today on Wahler, that's very helpful. Is there anything more now that you can comment on? So for example, I know that most of its revenues are presumably from Europe, it's based there. But can you kind of break down its geographic and customer exposures for us to sort of compare and contrast how that differs from your current EGR exposures? James R. Verrier: Yes, it's -- your instinct was right. It's weighted to Europe, European customers, European sales. It does have some revenue in Asia, primarily in China and a little bit in North America, but it's weighted towards the German OEMs and European sales. One of the -- actually, one of the mainly attractive aspects of the deal for us, when we line that up against our current EGR valve business, it's very complementary. Our current EGR valve business is a little weighted to North America and to China. So when you put the 2 together, now I think our geographic balance and footprint will be very, very good for us. Ryan J. Brinkman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : That's helpful. I think Drivetrain margin has been a huge surprise and a big part of the story recently. I know that your underlying Drivetrain margins are inflecting better because of the increase in sales and cost discipline. And recently, you announced some more restructuring actions to increase it even further now. With that said, I think I remember that one of the reasons, given historically light margins at Drivetrain were less than Engine was because of like a legacy cost burden that was disproportionally allocated to Drivetrain. Am I remembering that correctly? And then if so, has there been any sort of recent trailing off in that amortization or allocation of legacy cost to Drivetrain that could partly explain the recent better results or that might be one of the drivers of better performance in the future? Ronald T. Hundzinski: You're right in your memory. That was some items we discussed in the past. And what I would say is when that segment was smaller, it had disproportional impact on it in that time period. But since the business segment has grown, it's become minimized. That, coupled with some pension funding valuations that have got -- have improved over time, the drag on that segment has become to a point where it's minimized where we're at today. Ryan J. Brinkman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Okay, great to hear. And then just last question, I know you don't provide your granular sort of organic performance versus industry production any longer by region. You did call out in the release, sort of like turbo strength in Europe and China. Anything you can tell us sort of directionally about how your business is performing by geography? I imagine it's doing better in Europe in the strength there, but any sort of color. James R. Verrier: I think I alluded to this on one of the other questions is it's pretty much in line with how we thought things would be at the beginning of the year. So if you think of how we -- what color we gave then, I think that still stands pretty well. If you think of how our backlog was put together and communicated towards the back end of last year, Ryan, it's playing out pretty well there. So what that means is we're benefiting well from a strong North American production, trucks help us, China growth continues to be very strong for the company and good growth performance in Europe off a relatively stable or slightly increasing production volumes in Europe. Operator : Your next question comes from Colin Langan with UBS. Colin Langan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : In your commentary, I believe you said that ex FX and Wahler, the Engine margins were 17.2%. I mean, that seems like a pretty big delta. And in your comments, you also said that purchase accounting is only going to be $3 million to $4 million for the full year. So what is really causing that big difference? Is it mostly FX? Or was Wahler impacted some unique way in that [indiscernible] margin? Or did I misunderstand it? Ronald T. Hundzinski: No, you're right. It's -- first off, it was 17.2%. But what's happened in the first quarter is, I was trying to explain this earlier, the run rate on purchase price accounting is going to be $3 million to $4 million, except for 2 months where we have to get rid of our fair value inventory at no profit. So that's an extra drag for this year. So that's why you see this large delta between the comparable basis versus what the reported number was. It's just -- I wouldn't pay too much attention to it. It's just a rare situation for 2 months. Kenneth Lamb : Just to be clear, it is meaningful though. This year, this inventory markup and the purchase accounting adjustment, because it is meaningful, is pretty much offsetting all the operating income from that business this year. James R. Verrier: Right. Colin Langan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : And if it's 2 months, does that mean we're going to see the same impact in Q2? Or is that right? Because there's only 1 month of Wahler in this quarter. Ronald T. Hundzinski: You'll see 1 month in Q2, but you'll have 3 months of sales. So it's going to be less, but you will have the same impact. Colin Langan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Okay. And any color around Wahler in terms of where that puts your total EGR share globally, and any color there? Are you a global leader in that product? Kenneth Lamb : So as you know, we don't really talk about shares very much. But it has definitely positioned us as a preeminent player in the space. As far as the producer of both valves and coolers, there is really no one else in the world that does that now. That's pretty much rare air that we're in. Colin Langan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Okay. And just one last one. Nickel prices have jumped a lot this year. Is that an impact on you at all? And can you just remind us of your sort of protection in your contracts around commodities? Ronald T. Hundzinski: Nickel prices can impact us. There's no question. And then primarily we use that product in turbocharger business, on the hot side of the engine, because nickel is used quite often in heat applications. However, we experienced this nickel price increase some time ago back in 2006. Actually, I was in the turbo business then. Since then, we've taken steps to try as much as possible to put in instruments, either through hedging or through other activities, to mitigate that. At this point, we're able to mitigate it and not seeing the impact completely on our results. Colin Langan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : And any color on what percent is typically hedged or [indiscernible]? Ronald T. Hundzinski: Well, you can see sometimes in the Ks and the Qs and some of those tables. Historic -- I can tell you that nickel prices, until just recently, have not been that much of an issue. So you'll see less amount of hedging being done recently in that space than we have in the past. Operator : We have time for one final question and that question comes from Brian Johnson with Barclays. Dan Levy - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Dan Levy on for Brian. As you go through the restructuring in Drivetrain, how do you think of incremental revenue opportunities vis\u2013\u00e0\u2013vis being in a position of cost leadership. Does that allow you to come out with a better price? And if you get incremental revenue upside from being in a position of cost leadership, is there upside? I believe you had mentioned that there is upside to the 100 bps of marketing expansion, but I was just trying to gauge what that upside may be. James R. Verrier: I'll comment on, more, if you wish, on the growth. And I think your observations are very real, that as we do go through the restructuring efforts and move our footprint from Western Europe to Eastern Europe, we do still anticipate and expect to see growth in the Drivetrain segment. A good way to think of it, again, is if you take a look at the backlog announcement that we did back in November as a recent -- a decent way to look at it, where it breaks out, and you can see the growth, by product, in dual-clutch product, step automatic product and the all-wheel drive products. So we do see that growth. It's high single-digit, low single-digit-type growth for Drivetrain that we'll move forward with and execute on. And you're right, that's in parallel to the execution efforts of our restructuring. Kenneth Lamb : Thank you, Dan. I'd like to thank you all for joining us. We expect to file our Q before the end of the day, Ron said around noon, which will provide more details of our results. If you have any follow-up questions about our earnings release, the matters discussed during this call or our 10-Q, please direct them to me. Melissa, please close out the call. Operator : That does conclude the BorgWarner 2014 First Quarter Results Conference Call. You may now disconnect.",

Incorporated, Research Division Colin Langan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division Operator : Good morning. My name is Jeremy, and I will be your conference facilitator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BorgWarner 2014 Second Quarter Results Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Ken Lamb, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Lamb, you may begin your conference. Kenneth Lamb : Thank you, Jeremy. Good morning, and thank you, all, for joining us. We issued our earnings release this morning at 8 :00 a.m. Eastern. It's posted on our website, borgwarner.com, and on our Investor Relations home page. A replay of today's conference call will be available through August 7. The dial-in number for that replay is (855) 859-2056. You'll need the conference ID, which is 59589666. The replay will also be available on our website. With regard to our Investor Relations calendar, we will be attending the following conferences between now and our next earnings release : August 12, we'll be at the JPMorgan Automotive Conference in New York; September 3, we will be at the CLSA Autos Assembly in New York; September 10, we will be at the RBC Capital Global Industrials Conference in Las Vegas; September 16, we will be at the Morgan Stanley Laguna Conference in Laguna Beach; and September 23, we'll be at the Citi Global Industrials Conference in Boston. Before we begin, I need to inform you that during this call we may make forward-looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties, as detailed in our 10-K. Our actual results may differ significantly from the matters discussed today. Now moving on to our results. James Verrier, President and CEO, will review highlights of our operating results, as well as some of our recent noteworthy accomplishments. And then Ron Hundzinski, our CFO, will discuss the details of our operating results and also our updated outlook for 2014. With that, I'll turn it over to James. James R. Verrier: So, thank you, Ken, and good day, everybody. So, as we start the call, let me just take a moment to congratulate the 119 BorgWarner employees from around the world who were honored for innovation and excellence earlier this month. They epitomize the entrepreneurial spirit that sets BorgWarner apart and helps drive our success. So thanks to all of the BorgWarner employees for your continued dedication and hard work. Now, Ron and I are very pleased to review our second quarter results, as well as some of our recent accomplishments. First of all, the second quarter, we reported sales of $2.2 billion, which is up 16% from a year ago, or 8% if we exclude the impact of foreign currencies and the Wahler acquisition. U.S. GAAP earnings were $0.83 per share, or $0.89 per share when we exclude restructuring charges. Our operating income margin, again, excluding the restructuring charges, was an impressive 13.5% in the quarter. Two key factors drove our strong results : first, solid sales growth in both the Engine and Drivetrain segments; and then operational efficiency and cost controls that enabled strong incremental margins. Really, it's outstanding performance, again, by our operations. Let me take a look now at the Engine segment. We saw that second quarter sales were about $1.5 billion, which is up 16% from a year ago, or 6% when we exclude foreign currencies and Wahler. These impressive results were led by strong turbo sales in Europe and China, and new engine timing and VCT launches, also in China. In the Drivetrain segment, sales were approximately $710 million, which is up 16% from a year ago, or 13% when we exclude foreign currencies. Drivetrain's results were driven by strong all-wheel drive sales in North America, higher dual-clutch transmission module volume in Europe and high transmission component sales in Korea. So we see Drivetrain continues to grow and our restructuring plan is paving the way for a more profitable business. Just this month, we began moving our equipment from our Western European operations to Poland, and these actions will enhance Drivetrain's competitive position, which we expect to translate into winning more business. Now this segment review highlights BorgWarner's core strengths. Our entire product portfolio is in high demand in markets around the world and we're seeing improvements in Drivetrain, as expected, and the continued strong performance in Engine. Our strength and strong performance is based on our ability to anticipate and drive the next technology waves. As I look to the future, BorgWarner just continues to invest for the long-term. Capital spending continues to grow. We spent about 6% of sales on capital in the second quarter, which was is in line with our expectations, and we remain committed to supporting our future growth and productivity improvements. Our investment in R&D was just over 4% of sales in the quarter, which is also in line with our target for the year. And I can tell you the intensity around organic innovation and product development remains very strong. I'm also proud to share some exciting announcements we made during the quarter. We began producing our electronically controlled Vistronic fan drives at our new plant in Itatiba City, Brazil. And this highly efficient engine cooling technology improves fuel economy, reduces emissions for trucks, buses and off-highway applications. BorgWarner supplies 12 of the 15 finalists in the 2014 World Car Awards, including the Audi A3, the Mercedes S-Class, and the Porsche 911 GT3, all of which were winners. We provide one or more advanced technology to each of the finalists, including engine timing systems, turbochargers, EGR components, thermostats, emission systems, cabin heaters, friction plates and all-wheel drive couplings. We also supply our HY-VO transfer case chain for the Lexus GX and the Toyota Land Cruiser Prado, 4runner, Tacoma and also the FJ Cruiser. The chain is designed to reduce the friction in the transfer case, which improves efficiency and fuel economy. BorgWarner will supply Pressure Sensor Glow Plugs for Volkswagen's new 1.4, 1.6, and 2-liter diesel engines later this year. The glow plug pressure sensor measures cylinder pressure in the combustion chamber, and reports that data to the engine control unit, which allows the engine controller to continuously adapt fuel injection for each cylinder. We're also now producing multi-spark ignition coils for Daimler's 6- and 8-cylinder GDI engines, and these advanced ignition coils expand the ignition zone for more controlled and optimized combustion, improving fuel economy and emissions. Now let me take a moment to provide an overview of our revised guidance for 2014. Sales growth in 2014 is expected to be between 13% and 15%, which is up from our 12% to 15% previously. We see our operating margin is now expected to approach 13%, and our earnings guidance has been raised to $3.25 to $3.35 per diluted share from $3.15 to $3.30 per diluted share previously. Both ranges exclude non-comparable items. This is a very high-level overview of our updated guidance, and Ron will provide more details shortly. So the first half of the year was a great strong start to what we expect to be another excellent year for BorgWarner. We're expecting industry-leading revenue growth, continued excellence from our operations, and that combination results in great earnings power for our company. The industry's adoption of our leading-edge powertrain technology will continue for years ahead, and I feel very, very good about our company's future. No company in the auto sector is better positioned for long-term profitable growth than BorgWarner. So, with that, let me now turn the call over to Ron. Ronald T. Hundzinski: Thanks, James, and good day, everyone. Before I begin reviewing the financials, I would like to commend all of our employees for their hard work and congratulate them on another great quarter. Once again, the team exceeded expectations, and congratulations. Now on to the financials. James already provided a detailed review of our sales performance in the quarter. In summary, sales were up 16% from a year ago, or 8% excluding the impact of foreign currencies and the Wahler acquisition. The growth in the quarter came from both segments, from nearly every product group and from around the world. Overall, a strong quarter for sales. Working down the income statement. Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 21.5% in the quarter. That's a 60-basis-point improvement from a year ago, another great quarter. SG&A as a percent of sales was 8.2% in the quarter, flat with the second quarter 2013. R&D spending, which is included in SG&A, was 4.1% of sales in the second quarter, up 30 basis points from a year ago. This implies 30-basis-points improvement in other SG&A spending. We attribute this to good execution of our cost-control plan. Reported operating income in the quarter was $281 million. However, this includes a $15 million charge related to restructuring activities that I will discuss shortly. Excluding the charge, operating income was $296 million or 13.5% of sales compared with 12.9% of sales on a comparable basis a year ago. After excluding the impact of foreign currency, the Wahler acquisition and the restructuring charge, our year-over-year incremental margin was about 31%, well above our mid-teens incremental margin target. In summary, operational efficiency led to an improved gross profit margin. Cost controls led to a lower SG&A spending, and this allowed us to increase R&D spending and expand our operating margin income. That's a great way of running a company, outstanding performance. As you look further down the income statement, equity in affiliate earnings was $12 million in the quarter, up from $11 million last year. This represents the performance of NSK-Warner, our 50-50 joint venture relationship in Japan, which sells transmission components to our Japanese customers in Japan and China; as well as TEL, our turbocharger joint venture in India. Interest expense and finance charges were $9 million in the quarter, flat from the same quarter last year. Provision for income taxes in the quarter on a reported basis was $85 million. However, this included a $2 million tax benefit related to restructuring charges. Excluding the impact of restructuring, provision for income taxes was about $87 million, which is an effective tax rate of 29% in the quarter. Our estimated effective tax rate for the full year, excluding noncomparable items, is now 28.5%, up from 28% previously. The increase is primarily due to a change in expected mix of income from around the world. Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest was $10 million in the quarter, up from $6 million a year ago. This line item reflects our minority partner's share in earnings performance of our Korean and Chinese consolidated joint ventures. That brings us back to net earnings, which were $190 million in the quarter or $0.83 per share. Excluding the impact of restructuring activities, net earnings were $0.89 per share, up 19% from $0.75 per share a year ago, outstanding performance for the company. Now let's take a close look at our operating segments in the quarter. As James said earlier, reported Engine segment sales were $1.5 billion in the quarter. Excluding currency and Wahler, Engine segment organic sales growth was 6% from a year ago. Note that our commercial vehicle business, which has faced a challenging environment this year, is in the Engine segment. On a reported basis, adjusted EBIT for the Engine segment was 16.1% of sales. Excluding currency and Wahler, adjusted EBIT for the Engine segment was 17.6% of sales, up 50 basis points from 17.1% reported a year ago. Excluding currency and Wahler, the Engine segment's year-over-year incremental margin was 26% in the second quarter, very good performance for the Engine segment. On our last earnings call, we discussed operational efficiencies and footprint opportunities for Wahler that presented a clear path to double-digit margins. This restructuring plan is expected to cost approximately $28 million, including a $3 million charge taken in the second quarter. The charges will be recorded over the next 2 to 3 years, after which, Wahler is expected to be a double-digit margin business. The total consideration from Wahler, plus the cost of restructuring, is less than 0.5x sales. In the Drivetrain segment, reported sales were just under $710 million in the quarter. Excluding currency, organic sales growth was 13% from a year ago. On a reported basis, adjusted EBIT was 12.6% of sales. Excluding currency, adjusted EBIT was 12.5% of sales, up sharply from 9.7% of sales a year ago. Excluding currency, the Drivetrain segment's year-over-year incremental margin was 35% in the second quarter, another outstanding quarter for the Drivetrain segment. As mentioned earlier, the Drivetrain restructuring continues. In the second quarter, we took a $9 million charge related to the plan. To date, we have recorded approximately $100 million in charges related to the plan, 2/3 of which will be cash outlays for severance and other activities. We expect to record another $40 million by the end of 2015. These remaining charges will also be primarily cash. As a result of the restructuring, we expect Drivetrain's adjusted EBIT margin to improve by at least 100 basis points. Now let's take a look at the balance sheet and cash flow. We generated $326 million of net cash from operating activities in the first 6 months of 2014, up from $300 million a year ago. The increase was primarily related to higher net earnings. Capital spending was $257 million in the first 6 months of 2014, up $63 million from a year ago. The increase was driven by capital required to support our backlog of net new business, which is gaining momentum. Free cash flow, which we define as net cash from operating activities less capital spending, was $69 million in the first 6 months of 2014, down from $105 million during the same period last year, primarily due to higher capital spending. Looking at the balance sheet itself. Balance sheet debt increased $23 million at the end of the second quarter compared to the end of 2013. Cash decreased by $168 million during the same period. The $191 million increase in net debt was primarily due to capital expenditures and the Wahler acquisition. Our net debt-to-capital ratio was 10.9%, up from 7.2% at the end of 2013. Net debt-to-EBITDA at the end of the year, on a trailing 12-month basis, was 0.3x. I meant at the end of the second quarter. Our capital structure remains excellent. Now our guidance for 2014. James reviewed our guidance at a high level, I'd like to discuss some of the finer points. Our sales growth guidance range is now 13% to 15%, up from 12% to 15% previously. The increase is partly due to an improved volume outlook, partly due to stronger foreign currencies and primarily the euro. We still expect raw material inflation of $5 million to $10 million in 2014. Still a headwind, but less than we've seen in a typical year. Our operating income margin is now expected to approach 13% in 2014. This is primarily due to our operations continuing to exceed expectations. Our EPS guidance range has been raised to $3.25 to $3.35 per diluted share, up from $3.15 to $3.30 per diluted share. The $0.08 per share increase from midpoint to midpoint has 2 components; a $0.02 per share decline from a higher tax rate and a $0.10 per share increase from an improved outlook for the business. Our guidance implies lower sales and earnings in the second half of 2014 compared with the first half, so I'd like to review the logic on this. In a stable year, revenue and operating income are typically lower in the second half due to summer shutdowns and year-end holidays in both Europe and North America. In addition, the relocation of Drivetrain's European operations, which began this month and will continue into 2015, will incur start-up costs and other temporary inefficiencies. And you may recall that we deferred spending in 2013 to defend against the slower growth environment that we were in. Some of that spending is expected to return this year, primarily in the second half. With that said, our operations have been performing at a very high level over the last several quarters. The momentum they've gained may, to some degree, offset the challenges ahead. Finally, our expected diluted share count for 2014 is unchanged at approximately 230 million shares. This diluted share count guidance excludes any share repurchases that may be executed during the year. We continue to be confident in our ability to execute in any market. This company has demonstrated a heightened focus on efficiency and cost. This focus resulted in highly efficient growth and record margins in each of the last 4 years. With return to historical growth rates and our operations performing at a very high level, 2014 should be another year of record sales and record profits for BorgWarner. As we look beyond 2014, we intend to execute our growth plan, yielding high-single- to low-double-digit growth, and to efficiently convert our sales growth to profits. The future is bright for BorgWarner. So with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Ken. Kenneth Lamb : Thanks, Ron. Now let's move to the Q&A portion of the call. Jeremy, please remind everyone of the Q&A procedure. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities. Richard Michael Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Ron, on Drivetrain. So, last quarter you indicated that first quarter, you shouldn't use that as the benchmark to build off of, and here in the second quarter you did much better, and I know you just started moving equipment and whatnot here in July. How should we think about the trajectory here off of the base in Q2 on margins? I assume it's down from Q2 levels, but how meaningful? And then when you think about the movement of equipment, how long will that take? It sounds like it probably goes into '15, but any color on that will be helpful. Ronald T. Hundzinski: Okay. So I guess the question, Rich, is where's the base for the segment, is what you're asking. Historically, we said it was double digits. I mean 10, 10.5, right? And I think we said recently that we've moved that benchmark up slightly higher from what we thought originally, going into this restructuring. I think what we did for the quarter is the high mark, but I would say we moved off the lower end of what we expected coming in to restructuring. So we're somewhere in between 10.5 and 12.5 at this point. We moved it up. The other question you asked was how long this would take. This move could take through the end of '15. I'm not sure if it's going to be the end of the third quarter of 2015 or in the fourth quarter. But it's going to take some time. We've just started the moving of equipment. And I expect at least a minimum of 1 year, maybe 5 quarters. Okay? Richard Michael Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Okay. And then just a quick follow-up with Engine margins. I know you have some dilution from Wahler here, but the margins have been down, and I know you talked core being up. But any color around what you're seeing on the core business going forward? Do you still expect to see increases in the core business? And I realize here in the back half, you're going to still have some dilution from Wahler. But if we think about it, once that's fully integrated, how should we think about margin trajectory within Engine? Ronald T. Hundzinski: All right. So I'm going to talk about it excluding Wahler, okay? The way I would look at it is the organic growth we're getting in that area is in the mid-teens on incremental margins. Now the issue is you're approaching incremental -- the convergence is just about there. So the basis points are getting really narrow, depending on how you define mid-teens. So I would say it's starting to narrow on the margin expansion in that segment because we're approaching the convergence point on incremental margins. Richard Michael Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Okay. And then last one on minority interest, that was a little bit higher than we had expected. Should we think of this as a good run rate going forward? Ronald T. Hundzinski: No. I think we had a little bit of -- there's one operating unit that had a very good outstanding quarter due to some unusual items. So I wouldn't say that's where the run rate is going to be. I would back it off a little bit, okay? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Just a first question on Wahler. I was curious, what has changed there that you're kind of stepping up these restructuring charges? Is the business performing largely as you expected and this is just incremental integration expense? I'm just trying to understand what's changed there? Because I think we're all kind of assuming that it might be going -- it sounded like it was going a little bit better than expected and it might be a little bit different now. James R. Verrier: John, this is James. I would say it's pretty much in line with what we had expected going in. I think if you recall, we talked about that mid-single-digit start point for the business. Good growth trajectory, great technology. And as we take a good look at it and improve the operations more in line with typical BorgWarner performance, over that 2- or 3-year period, we'd be able to get it up to that kind of double-digit range. Nothing's really moved off that. I think what you're seeing, John, is that -- a way to think of it is you're seeing a little bit more clarity now. We kind of knew that going in there'd be some level of restructuring in order to move that operating margin up. And we are a few months in and we've kind of got our arms around that and we're starting to execute, and that's what you're seeing in the restructuring. Fundamentally, John, no change. Just a little bit more clarity and the story's still solid. John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Okay. And then, second question, just on Drivetrain and we look at sort of the strength in the first half of this year. How much of that has to do with Ford prebuilding F-150s ahead of the changeover and sort of the weakness we might see in the second half of the year as a result of the changeover? And could we really just see the Drivetrain margins kind of bounce right back up in the first half of next year as that truck launch gets going? I'm just trying to understand what kind of impact that launch is having on your margins. Kenneth Lamb : Yes, this is Ken. So the Drivetrain performance year-to-date is pretty broad, globally and across the product spectrum. So we've had strength in our dual-clutch business, we've had strength in our traditional automatic transmission components and then also in our all-wheel drive business, and it's been all over the world. So I wouldn't point to the F-150 as a reason for it. Obviously it doesn't hurt. But certainly, we've had some broad, good activity in the business. So I think that's the right way to think about it. John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Okay, that's helpful. And then just lastly, I mean, schedules through the second quarter seemed like they improved in both North America and Europe through the quarter, and third quarter's schedules are expected to be reasonably strong in North America and Europe. In your early read, I mean, are you seeing sort of schedules being slowly inched higher and downtime being stripped back in a lot of factories? It just sounds like we're sort of in that environment where the companies are being relatively cautious in their initial schedules, but then inching them up as we go through the quarter. James R. Verrier: Yes, John. I would say -- I wouldn't say we've seen a lot of meaningful move. I think, in general, second quarter schedules came in, globally, pretty much in line with what we thought, and our read as we go into the third quarter is pretty much the same at a general level. It varies a little bit when you get into the plant-by-plant, customer-by-customer. But I was able, overall, for us as a company, John, it's pretty much following what we'd anticipated. And in general, it's relatively solid and strong. I mean, the schedules when you look at it, particularly North America, are running well and holding well. And that stability in Europe that we were all looking for and hoping for, I think we're seeing that. So I think in general, it's a pretty positive picture, but no real change for us, if that make sense. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli from Citi. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : So just some quick questions. First one, can you give us some color in the booking activity in the second quarter by any chance? James R. Verrier: Yes, sure. I would say it was another good strong quarter for BorgWarner, relatively typical to kind of what we see. Both at an -- and activity level was good, there was a lot of activity. And the ratio, so to speak, of what we were looking to win came in line pretty much with what we thought. And it was very well-balanced globally and very well-balanced across our whole portfolio. So it was another good typical BorgWarner-type quarter for us in bookings. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Excellent, that's very helpful. And then you mentioned that it was balanced globally and across the portfolio. Can you give some color maybe on the growth by region that you saw? James R. Verrier: What I would get you to think of is, in a few months, our backlog overview, which gives you that 3-year view. And that's when it's more meaningful, because it's -- the reason I say that is it can bounce around quarter-to-quarter, depending on the customers and the time. But I would say, generally, it was well-balanced, but the better way to look at that is over a longer horizon, like that 3-year period versus an individual quarter. But it was good. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Very helpful. And then just quickly on the margin cadence for the back half of the year, and then kind of incremental margins and that mid-teen target. Just curious as to how we should kind of be thinking about it. I mean, if you take the -- I guess, just on the back of the envelope math, it kind of seems like the back half of the year might be coming in below the mid-teen target. But you did mention that there were some start-up costs and deferred costs that were going to be hitting. Can you quantify those or maybe just give some color, additional color on that? Ronald T. Hundzinski: I'll give some high-level and then maybe after the call, I'm sure everyone will call Ken on more details. But high level is how I would say this. You got to look at it sequentially. And I said in my script that sales are going to be down, and I think if you do some math, you'll see 2% down or something. We're going to have a decremental, obviously, on that, as sales come back for the reasons I mentioned, right? Summer shutdowns and holidays. So you have a decremental on that, 20%, 25%. And then we have, on top of that, we have incremental cost coming back and. So it's in 2 buckets; volume and it's in cost coming back in. And I gave some color about the cost coming in. But that's the high level and you can do the math, maybe give Ken a call later. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brett Hoselton with KeyBanc. Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : Let's see here. Maybe I'll just start off with contribution margins. I understand what your guidance implies, I believe, but as I kind of look at your contribution margins, for example in the quarter, I calculate 17% on operating income basis, overall; 23% if I kind of x out Wahler, and I may have my estimates wrong there. But the point of all that is that it seems like it's trending, or has been trending and continues to trend at a rate higher than the kind of mid-teens contribution margin that you're looking for longer-term. And I'm kind of wondering -- I'm not suggesting that you should change your longer-term guidance. But I'm kind of wondering, over the next 2 to 3 quarters, is there a possibility that we could certainly trend well above that mid-teens contribution margin if we adjust for Wahler and so forth? Kenneth Lamb : Brett, this is Ken, again. Let's talk about this a little bit. So, first of all, as you stated, over the last few quarters, our incremental margins have been well above the expectation of in the mid-teens. First thing that we need to note is, in the second half of last year, there was a very sharp increase in Drivetrain margins that really kind of led to the increase in incremental margins. I don't know the basis points off the top of my head, but it was a pretty sharp increase from the first half to the second half. That's the first thing to think about that probably will not be repeated as we go forward. And then when you add on top of that, we are starting the Drivetrain moves now, just started them this month. So that spending is definitely coming back, and then we have this deferred spending that we talked about last year that's also coming back. So those are the variables to think about it. Is it possible that the momentum in our business could partially offset some of these challenges ahead of us? We do think that that's a possibility, which is why Ron had that in his prepared remarks. But those are all the things of we're thinking about when we were contemplating guidance for you guys. Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : And then switching gears, capital deployment. Let's see, obviously, we talk about acquisitions quite a bit here. I'm kind of wondering what's your outlook at this point in time. And I guess the specific question is, is there anything imminent, i.e. what's the likelihood of seeing something in the back half of 2014? James R. Verrier: Yes, Brett, this is James. I'll give you maybe a little bit of an overview where we are on the M&A pipeline, so to speak. Because I think you know, that's still our preferred path, obviously, for utilization of cash. So, Brett, the good news, the pipeline remains very robust and very strong. The number of potentials in the queue are pretty good and we continue that. I think as we've talked about before, the timing of those is not easy to pin down because of the complexity of the transactions you get into. So we're continuing to drive to outcome on those. I'm not going to make a prediction of timing of when they will get executed, not because I don't want to, it's just that I really don't know, because of the nature of the negotiations that we're in. But I'll tell you, we're pushing hard to get that done. But in the light of that uncertainty, that's why we have other components that we utilize the cash for. And Ron maybe can add a bit of color of where we want to go on that side of it. Ronald T. Hundzinski: Right, Brett. So, obviously, potential of M&A is what we take into consideration. We also look at -- and short of that, we'll do share repurchases. But when we look at that, we have to look at where our cash is, the valuation of our stock, for example, and some other factors the come into play. But I think, another way to look at this is that, for the first half of the year, we spent $190 million on capital allocation. If you include Wahler, if you include the dividends that we're paying and if you include the share repurchase that we have, this rounded it up to $200 million, which is almost half of our free cash flow for the year. So that's another way to look at this, okay? That we have been proactive up to this point okay? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays. Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Thinking about the Drivetrain, you've talked about the restructuring and the move. But the question I was asking is, with a more competitive cost base in Drivetrain, are you seeing your business win rate go up or perhaps the margins that you're looking for in there? Just kind of what's the impact of your lower cost base on that? James R. Verrier: Yes, this is James, Brian. I think a couple of things that are worth thinking here. And I think you kind of nailed one of the critical points for us. This whole restructuring around Drivetrain is to position us for future growth. We absolutely see a lot of growth potential in that segment and this is an integral part of getting that footprint, combined with the leading-edge technology we've got, puts us in a very strong position. So our quote rates and our win rates have generally been strong in Drivetrain over the last year or so, and you saw some of that in the backlog that Ken took us through last year. And I think this continues to keep us in the competitive position, that the growth rate's going to continue to remain strong for Drivetrain. It's probably a better read or a strong re-brand [ph] will be as you look out 2, 3 years from now, what that translates into. And we'll see that, obviously, in a couple months here as we roll out the backlog. But I will tell you, in terms of our win ratios in the Drivetrain business that we're quoting, both on the transmission side and on the overall Drive side, I'm very comfortable and positive with what I'm seeing. Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Research Division : And somewhat related to that, a large German-based drivetrain competitor has confirmed their interested in acquiring a company that has not a lot of drivetrain content. How do you view acquisitions overall? And does that kind of diversifying acquisition either, a, say anything about what's going on in the drivetrain segment, or b, influence at all the way you think about your acquisition strategy? James R. Verrier: Yes. I think I'll talk about our acquisition strategy, Brian, and it remains consistent with prior discussions. And what that really relates to is acquiring leading-edge technology to complement the technology that we've got both on Drivetrain and on Engine side of the business. And when I look at our pipeline of potential opportunities, we see companies in both segments. So, as we look out, we see the majority of our growth on Drivetrain will come organically, because we've got a very good set of technology today. But we remain open to further acquisition activity around Drivetrain. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Sponheimer with Gabelli. Brian Sponheimer - G. Research, Inc.: The other Brian asked my question, but just one other on -- you talked last quarter about repatriating some cash from some of your Chinese JVs as they're now self-funding. Can you talk about any progress you made there during the quarter? Ronald T. Hundzinski: Yes. I think you need to look at repatriation at a higher level than the focus everyone's been putting on China. We repatriate cash from a number of areas in the world, not just China. If you go back about a year ago, we changed -- I think, it was from the Korean operations, we started bringing back some cash more. And that's just -- actually, the China event that you're referring to is just a continuation of what we do every single day in this business as we look at regions of the world and we make decisions on -- are they self-funding going forward. And on the China situation, that was just one of those decisions. So the cash is starting to flow back in the United States. And more importantly, as we look forward, our China operations are growing at a very healthy clip. Cash generation there is going to be very healthy. I just want to make sure we set ourselves up going forward to bring that cash back so we can use it for other investments. So that's all that really is. I think everybody's putting too much emphasis on that China repatriation. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Ryan J. Brinkman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Can you talk about your operations in South America, how they tracked in the quarter? And can you remind us of sales in South America as a percentage of total? I think it's a bit less for you than for many other suppliers, but that you recently expanded operations in Brazil. James R. Verrier: Sure. Yes, this is James, Ryan. It's a relatively -- we don't disclose the exact percentage, but it's a smaller part of our overall business at the moment, South America. It's concentrated all in Brazil. We serve our South American customers all from Brazil. You're right to note that we did do quite a bit of investment and expansion, and that's for where we see opportunities for future growth in that market, both on the light vehicle and commercial vehicle part of our business. But in the short term, yes, it's definitely a little bit of a headwind for us. The commercial vehicle segment, which is primarily what we serve in Brazil and South America, is very challenged, I think you guys know that. So it's not helping us at all in the short run in Brazil. But we believe, for the long haul, it's still a great growth potential for BorgWarner and that's why we feel the investment we made was the appropriate one. Ryan J. Brinkman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Okay, sure, that's fair. And I think you've got an investor event coming up next month. But around this time last year at the summer event, you gave a pretty detailed drill-down of your M&A plans, including the number of targets that you were looking at. Obviously, you've pulled the trigger on Wahler. Is there any update you can give us on sort of the level of activity in evaluating additional acquisitions? Has the evaluation process declined as you work to integrate Wahler? Is there still a lot going on behind the scenes? And sort of last question along those lines, what are the sizes of the potential acquisitions that you're looking at relative to Wahler? Was Wahler one of the larger businesses that you were looking at? The others are more bolt-on technology stuff? Or can you help us there? James R. Verrier: Yes, sure. The quick answer, Ryan, is the pipeline is pretty robust and long and deep. And I would say, in general, it's similar to what it was about a year ago. Obviously, from a year ago we got 1 completed, which was Wahler, a couple have fallen out of the process, a few more are being added in. But I would give you a sense of the number of target companies in the pipeline is pretty similar to where it was a year ago. The scale and size is pretty similar. And probably, most importantly is the focus or the target of where we're trying to acquire is very consistent. So, again, we want to acquire technology, we want to acquire leading-edge technology that will drive growth for us. And we're agnostic whether it's engine or drivetrain, and we're agnostic in terms of where it is in the world because we're a global company. So hopefully that helps you little bit. We're very focused on it and we believe, as we look out over the next few years, acquisition will be a part of it. And, in general, it will be adjacencies and complementary technology in the powertrain area is the way to think of it. Ryan J. Brinkman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Very helpful. And last question if I can, just on the 290-basis-point improvement in Drivetrain margin, it's obviously very large. Are you able to share how much of that year-over-year improvement relates to some of the pension and other sort of nonoperating legacy cost actions you've taken as opposed to more typical cost cutting and contribution on higher sales? Ronald T. Hundzinski: I'm just going to say it's really based on performance of the operations. Not on any other -- I would say, operational efficiency is where it all came from. Just their performance, concentrating on incremental margins. The sales was very strong, as we've pointed out, and they converted those sales. So it's just operational efficiency is what they're doing there. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Leiker with Robert W. Baird & Co. Joseph D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : This is Joe Vruwink online for David. Can you maybe quantify, or I apologize if I missed it, the headwind from your commercial vehicle and off-highway markets in the quarter? Kenneth Lamb : So we actually didn't provide any numbers around that, Joe. Commercial vehicle is about 15% of the company, and if you throw in aftermarket, it's up to 20%. And as you know, the market, almost the entire market around the world, was pretty depressed. It was decent in North America, but South America was really poor. Europe and China had almost no growth. So it certainly didn't help us when you think about our overall business and how much we grew in other parts of it. Joseph D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Yes, I'm just thinking of your revenue guidance for the year. Most of your OE customers have walked back a bit, their outlook on a global basis. So Eastern Europe is weighing on things, South America, some weakness in the off-highway space in Asia. And obviously [indiscernible] from an organic basis. If I think about maybe your automotive business, does that forecast actually inch higher a bit to get you to the updated guidance range? Kenneth Lamb : Well, so I guess I could say this, overall, clearly we have a better expectation for the business. We didn't bifurcate between commercial vehicle and light vehicle. I'd have to say, in general, commercial vehicle is probably a bit weaker now than what we thought at the beginning of the year. So I guess your logic is sound. Joseph D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : And maybe just last one on this, in thinking about the backlog. So typically with rising GDPs, you'd expect higher equipment demand for a lot of reasons. That hasn't been the case in the commercial vehicle space. What sort of headwind has that been on kind of the backlog deployment in the last couple of years? I mean, since 2011, I think global volumes have been more or less flat, and if you do start to get the cyclical recovery in Europe and North America, is that a tailwind for you over the midterm? Kenneth Lamb : It certainly wouldn't hurt us. There are lot of other factors, of course, in the backlog that we will discuss in detail in November. You and I can talk about that more offline, in detail if you like. But again, November, at your conference, we'll share more detail about the ins and outs, the changes that have happened in the backlog since the last announcement. Joseph D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Okay. Focusing for a second equity income, pretty good growth seen in that line item in the quarter. I would imagine you're beginning to see a ramp-up in volume from China. Is it fair to say that since it's still early days, that JV's probably not getting BorgWarner-like profitability? And what might be the timeframe for just seeing greater bottom line leverage in equity income from that growth? Ronald T. Hundzinski: If you're referring to our joint venture in China on dual-clutch, yes, we're gaining momentum there. That's a component in there. But I think it's not materially an impact for us at this point, okay? I wouldn't put a lot of emphasis on it at this point. I think in the future there's going to be much more emphasis, but not in the short run. Joseph D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Okay. And then just since the M&A scene seems to be in vogue, I'll add one more. When you look at the product adjacencies that might be out there, and when I think of what BorgWarner has done in the last few years, you used to have a smaller air side business with Dytech and Wahler, you significantly enhanced that. Are there similar categories in the portfolio today that are maybe a little smaller in nature but you see a runway through M&A to expand them? James R. Verrier: Joe, this is James. I think the example you used is a good one, and that's around the theme of emissions, right? Or emissions products. If you look and think about business, think of it that same way. So we have a theme around all-wheel drive, we have a theme around air management, we have a theme around thermal management, we have a theme around boosting solutions. And there's product or technology that you could add, that would complement that sphere of thermal management or all-wheel drive management. And some of that, obviously, we'll do organically. But that's obviously where we do look for acquisition targets that could get us there quicker and would complement and allow us to offer more comprehensive solutions than what we have today. So I think you're thinking is the right one, Joe. Joseph D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : And there's not any impediments in terms of... Ronald T. Hundzinski: Joe, thanks, we've got to let somebody else on the call, okay? Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Colin Langan with UBS. Colin Langan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Any color? Some suppliers have highlighted there might be some mix [indiscernible] issues heading into Q3. I know you have a lot of Ford exposure and some of their trucks are expected to be down. Is that a near-term headwind when we're thinking about quarter-over-quarter? Is there sort of an underperformance risk mid-term? James R. Verrier: Well, I think the way to think of it for us, as you know, we're a very broad and diverse supplier, so we're spread all around the world. So individual programs often don't weigh or drag too heavily in the short-term for us. As Ron said, there is, obviously, the sequential change from Q2 into Q3, where you get the seasonality which will impact us. But we don't see any anything that specific, Colin, if that makes sense to you. And we're comfortable with where we're at. Colin Langan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Okay, that make sense. Any color on the corporate cost for only $23 million, they were down year-over-year. It seemed like a pretty low level. Is that sustainable going forward or was there some special benefits in the quarter? Ronald T. Hundzinski: I think the corporate costs were like $35 million, but I'll give more flavor on it. I think you can anticipate that's been running about $150 million full year. So it's up and down by quarters a little bit. But that's usually what we've been running, about $150 million and it has been pretty flat year-on-year. I think it was $35 million in the quarter. Colin Langan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Okay. I guess just one last question. A lot of suppliers -- a couple of suppliers have taken action to defease their pensions. I mean, how would you think about, long-term, taking actions around your pension plan? Ronald T. Hundzinski: Yes. We constantly look at our pensions. If you recall, in the fourth quarter of '13, we funded a German pension fund over there, which I would like to brag that we're getting good earnings on it, on the pension fund. It was a good move. We had some cash over there. But I think you're probably more referencing like putting them into annuities for example. We are looking at that. It's too soon to tell where it would go. We're in the business of making auto parts, not being a fund manager when it comes to pensions, but we are looking at those options going forward. Operator : We have time for one final question and that question comes from Joe Spak with RBC. Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : I guess just going back to the backlog, which I know was sort of announced a year ago, and you gave the split between Engine and Drivetrain. If we were to assume that split was consistent across all years, it would appear that Engine's maybe underperforming a little bit, Drivetrain's better. So did something happen there or is the mix of the backlog actually just more skewed to Drivetrain this year, implying that some of the engine backlog is actually a bit more '15 and '16 weighted? Kenneth Lamb : Well, first of all, it is not -- you can't use that ratio for each year. So you're right about that, that's a 3-year look. Over the course of the 3 years, that's how the backlog splits. Now I will say that if you go back a few years and look at the split, it does bounce around a little bit. It's been a little bit heavier in Drivetrain a couple of years back and it's been moving a bit. So it's another factor to consider. I would say maybe the one factor this year that's probably having an effect, where the backlog's probably coming in a little bit differently than expected, is commercial vehicle is a little bit weaker than expected. So that's maybe the one variable. But overall, I think if you're going to look at that split for the 3-year backlog, you got to consider that it's over a longer period of time. Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Okay, but is it fair to assume that within that, that maybe Engine was a little bit more back half -- the growth is more back-half weighted than this year? Kenneth Lamb : No, I wouldn't say that. Engine had some strong growth in the first half. I mean, I know it's not been as strong Drivetrain. But again, the commercial vehicle business is contained almost completely by Engine. That's been maybe the one weak spot on the engine side. But I wouldn't say it's a first-half, second-half issue. Ron talked about our growth difference in the second half versus the first half, and it's largely just seasonal. Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Okay. And then just one housekeeping, and sorry if I missed this. But did you give what the inventory write-up was for Wahler in the quarter? I think you previously were saying it would about $5 million? Ronald T. Hundzinski: I think it was about $6 million. James R. Verrier: I'd like to thank you all, again, for joining us. We expect to file our 10-Q before the end of the day, which will provide details of our results. If you have any follow-up questions about our earnings release, the matters discussed during this call or our 10-Q please, direct them to me. Jeremy, please close up the call. Operator : That does conclude the BorgWarner 2014 second quarter results earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Kyle, and I'll be your conference facilitator. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the BorgWarner 2014 Third Quarter Results Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to turn the call over to Ken Lamb, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Lamb, you may begin your conference. Kenneth Lamb : Thank you, Kyle. Good morning, and thank you, all, for joining us. We issued our earnings release this morning at around 8 :10 a.m. Eastern Time. It's posted on our website, borgwarner.com, on our Investor Relations homepage. A replay of today's conference call will be available through November 6 also on our website. The dial-in number for that replay is (855) 859-2056. You'll need the conference ID, which is 99689813. With regard to our Investor Relations calendar, we will be attending the following conferences between now and the end of the year : November 4, we will be at the Gabelli Automotive symposium in Las Vegas; November 12, we will be at the Goldman Sachs Industrial Conference in Boston; November 20, we will be at the Barclays Global Automotive Conference in New York; December 4, we will be at the Goldman Sachs Global Automotive Conference in London; and finally on November 10, we will be at the Baird Industrial Conference in Chicago.

At 9 :30 a.m. Eastern that day, we will post a brief Q&A conference call regarding the backlog. Now before we begin, I need to inform you that during this call, we may make forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties as detailed in our 10-K. Our actual results may differ significantly from the matters discussed today. Now moving on to our results. James Verrier, President and CEO, will highlight our quarterly operating results as well as some of our recent noteworthy accomplishments. And then Ron Hundzinski, our CFO, will discuss the details of our quarterly operating results and also our updated outlook for 2014. With that, I'll turn it over to James. James R. Verrier: Thank you, Ken, and good day, everybody. Ron and I are very pleased today to be reviewing our third quarter results as well as some of our recent accomplishments. But before I get into the details, let me just take a moment to thank all of our BorgWarner employees around the world for delivering yet another outstanding quarter for the company. So on to the results. So for the third quarter, reported sales were just over $2 billion, which is up 13% from a year ago or 8% when we exclude the impact of foreign currencies and the Wahler acquisition. U.S. GAAP earnings were $0.73 per share or $0.79 per share excluding nonrecurring charges. Our operating income margin, again, excluding nonrecurring charges, was an impressive 12.5% in the quarter. Two key factors that drove our strong results : solid sales growth and operational efficiency in the Engine segment and good cost controls across the corporation. So outstanding performance again by our operations. Let me talk a little bit about the 2 segments. First, in the Engine segment, third quarter sales were $1.4 billion, which is up 17% from a year ago or 10% after excluding the impact of foreign currencies and Wahler. Those results were led by strong turbocharger sales in Europe, China and Korea and new VCT launches in China. I'll switch over to the Drivetrain segment where sales were approximately $630 million, which is up 4% from a year ago or 3% when we exclude foreign currencies. Drivetrain's sales growth is driven by high dual-clutch transmission volumes in Europe, but this was partially offset by a planned slow ramp-up of a major program by a North American customer. Drivetrain continues to grow and our restructuring plan is on track. In July, we began moving equipment from our Western European operations to Poland. And we've said that before that the equipment moves may cause some inefficiencies in the business, which we saw a little of in the third quarter. However, these actions which will enhance Drivetrain's competitive position are critically important to the long-term success of the business. The segment review highlights BorgWarner's core strengths, a product portfolio in high-demand in markets around the world, strong operational performance from the Engine segment and very good execution of the Drivetrain restructuring plan designed to improve long-term performance. Our financial strength and strong performance is based on our ability to anticipate and drive the next technology waves. As we look to the future, BorgWarner continues to invest for the long term. Capital spending continues to grow. We spent about 7% of sales on capital in the third quarter, which is slightly above our target of 6%, and we remain committed to supporting our future growth and productivity improvements. Our investment in R&D was just over 4% of sales in the quarter, which is in line with our target for the year. And the intensity around organic innovation and product development remains very strong. I'm also proud to share some exciting announcements we made during the quarter. First of all, BorgWarner supplies its mini direct-acting variable force solenoid for General Motors global front-wheel-drive 6-speed automatic transmission program. Featured in the range of 2015 Chevy, Buick and GMC vehicles, BorgWarner's solenoid enables improved fuel economy and shift feel and applications exist in every major global market including the Americas, Europe, China and South Korea. Last month, we officially opened our second turbocharger production facility in China, the new green facility is strategically located in the city of Taicang, a major development area close to Shanghai, and the facility will produce advanced turbocharging technologies for several automakers. Our production facility in Ningbo, China has produced more than $1.5 million exhaust gas recirculation valves or EGR valves for both passenger cars and commercial diesel vehicles. EGR helps reduce emissions and improve fuel economy. And the plant has been supplying our customers in China with EGR valves since 2010 and also EGR coolers and modules since 2013. BorgWarner expects to produce about 1 million EGR valves annually in Ningbo beginning in 2016. Also, BorgWarner supplies its high-performance wet friction technology for Volkswagen's new hybrid DQ 400e dual-clutch transmission launching in the 2014 Volkswagen Golf and the Audi's A3 e-tron. The transmission hybrid vehicles employs 3 clutches, the dual-clutch module plus a disconnecting clutch to smoothly connect and disconnect the electric engine from the drivetrain. For all 3 clutches, BorgWarner's leading wet friction technology improves shift performance, NVH and fuel economy. BorgWarner's production facility and engineering center in Itatiba City, Brazil recently received Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, also known as the LEED certification. This achievement is a first for an automotive supplier in Brazil, and LEED certification affirms sustainable building strategies and practice. Our environmentally friendly Brazilian campus was specifically designed and built to fulfill the demanding requirements for this LEED certification, and it's one of several BorgWarner facilities around the globe to achieve this prestigious certification. Now let me take a moment to provide an overview of our revised guidance for 2014. Sales growth in 2014 is expected to be 12% to 13%, which is down a little from our previous guidance range of 13% to 15%. This change is due to weaker foreign currencies. So as a result of the lower sales guidance, we're trimming our earnings guidance to a range of $3.23 to $3.28 per diluted share, and the range excludes noncomparable items. Our operating margin is still expected to approach 13%. Our operations have performed at a very high level for the past several quarters, and we expect that to continue. I recognize this is only a high-level overview of our updated guidance, and Ron will take you through the details shortly. So the first 3 quarters of the year were very strong for BorgWarner, and as we look ahead to the remainder of the year and beyond, our expectations for the company are unchanged. We're expecting industry-leading revenue growth and continued excellence from our operation, and that combination will result in tremendous earnings power for our company. The industry's adoption of our leading-edge powertrain technology will continue for years, and I feel very, very good of our company's future, and I see no company in the auto sector better-positioned for long-term profitable growth than BorgWarner. So now with that, let me turn the call over to Ron. Ronald T. Hundzinski: Thanks, James, and good day, everyone. Before I begin reviewing the financials, I also would like to commend all of our employees for their hard work and congratulate them on another solid quarter. So now, on to our financials. James already provided a detailed review of our sales performance in the quarter. In summary, sales were up 13% from a year ago or 8%, excluding the impact of foreign currencies and the Wahler acquisition. The growth in the quarter came primarily from the Engine segment, while the Drivetrain segment had a tough year-over-year comparison. I'll talk more about that later. Overall, it was a strong -- another strong quarter for our sales. Working down the income statement, gross profit as a percentage of sales was 20.9% in the quarter, down 10 basis points from a year ago. During the same period, SG&A as a percentage of sales was 8.6%, down 10 basis points. R&D spending, which is included in SG&A, was up 20 basis points. This implies a 30-basis-point improvement in other SG&A spending. Reported operating income in the quarter was $238 million. However, this includes nonrecurring items related to restructuring activities and a pension plan settlement. The $13 million restructuring charge includes expenses related to the continued relocation of 2 drivetrain facilities from Western to Eastern Europe, the continuing investment in improving Wahler's operational efficiency and footprint, and a global legal entity realignment plan and tentative enhanced [ph] treasury management flexibility. The $3 million pension plan settlement is related to a lump sum payment made to former employees to discharge our obligation under the plan. Excluding nonrecurring items, operating income was $254 million or 12.5% of sales, flat with the same period a year ago. However, if you exclude the Wahler acquisition, operating margin would have been 13.2% of sales or 70 basis points better, a strong performance concerning the restructuring-related inefficiencies -- efficiencies that we were working through. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, the Wahler acquisition and nonrecurring items, our year-over-year incremental margin was 22%, above our mid-teens incremental margin target. This is the sixth straight quarter in which we have surpassed our target. As you look further down the income statement, equity and affiliate earnings were $15 million in the quarter, up from $10 million last year. This represents the performance of NSK-Warner, our 50-50 joint venture in Japan, which sells transmission components to our Japanese customers in China and Japan, as well as TEL, our turbocharger joint venture in India. Interest expense and finance charges were $9 million in the quarter, up slightly from a year ago. Provision for income taxes in the quarter on a reported basis were $72 million. However, this included a tax benefit of $2 million related to the restructuring and pension settlement charges. Excluding the impact of the nonrecurring items, provision for income taxes was about $74 million, which is an effective tax rate of about 28.5% in the quarter. Our estimated effective tax rate for the full year, excluding noncomparable items, remains at 28.5%. Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest was $6 million in the quarter, basically flat with the third quarter 2013. This line item reflects our minority partner's share in earnings performance of our Korean and Chinese consolidated joint ventures. That brings us back to net earnings, which were $167 million in the quarter or $0.73 per share. Excluding the impact of nonrecurring items, net earnings were $0.79 per share, up 13% from $0.70 per share a year ago, outstanding performance for the company. Now let's take a closer look at operating segments in the quarter. As James said earlier, reported Engine segment sales were $1.4 billion in the quarter. Excluding currency and Wahler, Engine segment organic sales growth was 10% compared with the same period a year ago. On a reported basis, adjusted EBIT for the Engine segment was 15.8% of sales. Excluding currency and Wahler, adjusted EBIT for the Engine segment was 17% of sales, up 80 basis points from 16.2% reported a year ago. Excluding currency and Wahler, the Engine segment's year-over-year incremental margin was 26% in the third quarter, very good performance by the Engine segment. Restructuring plan for Wahler is on target. The remaining charges will be recorded over the next 2 years or so, after which Wahler is expected to be a double-digit margin business. So now the Drivetrain segment. Reported sales were about $630 million in the quarter. Excluding currency, organic sales growth was just over 3% compared with the same period a year ago. As I said earlier, Drivetrain faced a tough year-over-year comparison. The third quarter 2013 was the beginning of a surge in all-wheel drive sales in North America and dual-clutch module sales in Europe for the company. Third quarter 2014 is the anniversary of that surge in growth, making it a tough comparison. Also, in the third quarter of 2014, Drivetrain was impacted by a planned slow ramp-up of a major program by a North American customer. On a reported basis, adjusted EBIT was 10.8% of sales. Excluding currency, adjusted EBIT was 10.7% of sales, down slightly from 10.9% of sales a year ago. Excluding currency, the Drivetrain segment's year-over-year incremental margin was about 5% in the third quarter. So let's keep this in perspective. Drivetrain delivered $1 million of incremental adjusted EBIT on $20 million of incremental sales. That means the segment was only $2 million to $3 million shy of a 15% to 20% incremental margin, which can be attributed to costs associated with our new DCT component plant in Taicang, China that has not yet launched production and the restructuring challenges faced in the quarter. The Drivetrain restructuring plan is also on target with regard to both timing and cost. We still expect to have the relocations completed by the end of 2015, after which, Drivetrain would be in a much better competitive position in Europe. Now let's take a look at our balance sheet and cash flow. We generated $546 million of net cash from operating activities in the first 9 months of 2014, up from $514 million a year ago. The increase was primarily related to higher net earnings. Capital spending was $398 million in the first 9 months of 2014, up $100 million from a year ago. The increase was driven by capital required to support our backlog of net new business. Free cash flow, which was defined -- which we defined as net cash from operating activities less capital spending, was $146 million in the first 9 months of 2014, down from $216 million during the same period last year primarily due to higher capital spending. Looking at the balance sheet itself, balance sheet debt increased by $89 million at the end of the third quarter compared with the end of 2013. Cash decreased by $157 million during the same period. The $246 million increase in net debt was primarily due to dividend payments to shareholders, share repurchases and the Wahler acquisition. Our net debt to capital ratio is 12.2%, up from 7.2% at the end of 2013. Net debt-to-EBITDA at the end of the year on a trailing 12-month basis was 0.4x. Our capital structure remains in excellent shape. Now I'd like to discuss our guidance for 2014. James reviewed our guidance at a high level. I'll discuss some of the finer points. As James said, the decrease in our sales guidance is due to weakening foreign currencies, mainly the euro. We've taken our full year forecast for the euro down from $1.35 to the euro to approximately $1.33 to the euro. Our sales and margin guidance implies a mid-teen incremental margin in the fourth quarter on a comparable basis. While this is in line with our long-term target, we do not concede that this is at the end of our above-target performance. We think this is more a function of our near-term environment spending for our new DCT component plant in China and restructuring-related efficiencies. Finally, our expected diluted share count for 2014 is now 229 million, down from approximately 230 million shares primarily related to share repurchase executed today. We continue to be very confident in our ability to execute in any market. This company has demonstrated a heightened focus on efficiency and cost. This focus resulted in a highly efficient growth and record margins in each of the last 4 years. With return to historical growth rates and operations performing at a very high level, 2014 should be another record of sales and profits for BorgWarner. So as we look beyond 2014, we intend to execute our growth plan yielding high single to low double-digit growth and to efficiently convert our sales growth to profits. The future is bright for BorgWarner. So with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Ken. Kenneth Lamb : Thanks, Ron. Now let's move to the Q&A portion of the call. Kyle, can you please remind everyone of the Q&A procedure? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Rich Kwas from Wells Fargo Securities. Richard Michael Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Ron, on the comment about Drivetrain with mid-teens incremental margins, is that exclusive of the restructuring inefficiencies? So should we assume a lower rate for Q4 because of ongoing inefficiencies from the restructuring? Ronald T. Hundzinski: Rich, mid-teens is our target exclusive of restructuring. Am I saying that right? However, the restructuring inefficiency is included in that mid-teens incremental target. Richard Michael Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Okay, alright. I just wanted to clarify that. And then on the currency assumption, that 1 33 is the average for the year, not for the quarter, correct? Ronald T. Hundzinski: That's correct. I knew Rich was wanting to talk about currency for a second. You're absolutely correct. The spot rate is about 1 26, 1 27. BorgWarner uses an average. So the 1 33 is the average that would be -- we're anticipating for the full year if the spot rate remains in this 1 26, 1 27 range. Richard Michael Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Okay. Alright. And then on commercial, off-road has been weak here recently. Could you just remind us your exposure both -- to that end market both from a regional standpoint as well as an end market, whether it's ag, construction, et cetera? James R. Verrier: Yes, Richard, this is James. Roughly about 15% thereabouts of our annual revenue is commercial vehicle. And that's pretty well split relatively equally between on-road and off-road. And from a geographical perspective, the 4 markets primarily we serve are Europe and North America, which are the 2 bigger markets for us, and then we also serve Brazil and China. And our view, Rich, is those markets, with the exception of North America, remain kind of weak, particularly obviously in South America. So if that helps you out, that's a general thing. And then the last comment, Rich, just from a product perspective, the 3 primary products that we serve our market with are turbo and fan drives business in the thermal part of the company and our emissions products, both valves and coolers [ph]. So hope that's gives you hopefully a bit of a summary. Richard Michael Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : On the North America piece, are you -- others have talked about some weakness here lately. You're not seeing that in your book of business, off-road specifically? James R. Verrier: Not significantly. Not enough to move us significantly, Rich. No. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brett Hoselton from KeyBanc. Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : I apologize. I guess, I'm kind of -- I'm trying to think -- I'm thinking about the fourth quarter, and I'm thinking about contribution margins. And my simple back of the envelope math leads me to a 6% contribution margin in the fourth quarter. And I'm kind of thinking 12.2% operating margins and $2,050,000,000 in sales, or something along those lines. I'm thinking that seems a lot different than mid-teens. I know that you just kind of addressed that to some extent. But I guess I'm still somewhat confused. Is my math completely incorrect? Feel free to say that. Or is there some headwinds I need to account for that caused that differential. Ronald T. Hundzinski: Brett, are you doing a fourth quarter year-over-year comparison? Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : Yes. Ronald T. Hundzinski: So have you taken into consideration the Wahler impact on us? Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : No, I'm just saying all-in total company, you're at 6%, so I guess Wahler would be one of the major differentials there. Ronald T. Hundzinski: Right, right. Well, no. In the quarter, Wahler on the total company was about 70 basis points impact. On the full -- and I think I gave the color around the actual segment, so it's a significant margin impact if you do the math. Go back through the transcript and you'll see the magnitude of that I gave you. Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : Yes, okay. I guess, and then, let me ask you about just capital deployment, just switching gears here. As we think about capital deployment, it sounds like you're moving toward a more deliberate approach towards capital deployment, particularly share repurchase. I'm wondering, how should we think about the pace of share repurchase as we move through 2015? Ronald T. Hundzinski: Okay. Brett, so, let me just talk about total capital deployment. I think we have a very balanced approach right now, is what you're seeing. You're seeing CapEx is up, so we're funding the CapEx. We put in a dividend, so the dividend payments are in there, then the share repurchases. And then you go take into consideration M&A activity, right? So I would take a look at M&A and share repurchases together. And I think we've said in the past, in the absence of M&A activity, we would fill that gap with share repurchases. So to answer your question, in '15, I think, one of the question needs to be the M&A activity consideration, right? In absence of, we would move to share repurchases. If we had M&A activity, we would focus on M&A activity. Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : And that makes sense. I guess what I'm asking here is, if my calculations are correct, if I use your leverage targets, your debt-to-capital targets, I've got about $1 billion of buying power out there, and that's a lot. And so it seems like your incremental capital free cash flow might be available towards share repurchase, and we might be able to think about modeling maybe a more consistent level of share repurchase activity than we've seen over the past 8 quarters. And I guess I'm wondering, is that the direction we're moving? And if so, is there a dollar amount that you'd recommend or would you just, \"Look, I wouldn't model anything for now. Just hold off and it'll all be incremental upside.\" Ronald T. Hundzinski: Brett, the unknowns here are the size of the M&A activities, right? And what I mean by that is, if you have an M&A activity that's pushing $500 million, $600 million, that changes that discussion because that would give us in a leverage range quicker. So I would say this though. Share repurchases are part of our deployment of capital. That's the bottom line. We're not going to give guidance at this point as far as what value that is because it's predicated on an M&A strategy, and when transactions in M&A actually happen. Kenneth Lamb : And Brett, this is Ken. I want to add to what Ron just said. He mentioned in his prepared remarks about the global realignment plan to increase our treasury management flexibility. And a part of that flexibility is around using cash for various things including share repurchases. That's the plan we've been talking about for the last several months. It is underway. We expect to have that in place no later than the beginning of 2016. And I think that there can be some more consistency in our share repurchases at that time. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rod Lache from Deutsche Bank. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : It's Rob Lache here. So a couple of questions. First is, could you maybe help us with a couple things on the organic growth in the fourth quarter? You may be -- just first of all, what is the FX impact that you're expecting in terms of dollars. Is it around $75 million for Q4? Ronald T. Hundzinski: Relative to what, Rod? To... Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Prior year -- no, no the year-over-year effect. We're just trying to back into what you're achieving. Ronald T. Hundzinski: That's correct. You're in the range, yes. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Okay. So if you use the midpoint of your guidance range, revenue growth is around $170 million. Add back the $75 million from FX, maybe subtract the $88 million from Wahler. So organic growth is maybe $157 million, $158 million, up around 8.5% from last year? You did 1.885 . Your production is a positive. Obviously, pricing is a little bit of a negative. So there was expected to be some uptick in your backlog to get to that $700 million full year backlog. I think that the uptick -- you'd have to do something like north of $200 million, maybe $250 million of backlog in the fourth quarter? Is there something that is meaningfully affecting that $700 million full year backlog? Is that the slow ramp-up from the customer. Can you maybe just elaborate on what are some of the components of the organic growth guidance for the fourth quarter? Ronald T. Hundzinski: So I'm trying to keep up with your math. But essentially, our guidance, when we came into the year, organic sales growth was going to be between 7% and 11%. And as we do all the puts and takes that we just talked about, I think, that's exactly where we ended up landing. And that original guidance was based on our backlog of around $700 million this year. So last year, well, I'll just say that the impact that you talked about, they seem to be in the range. I'll have to maybe work with you offline to see if there's any other missing pieces, but that sounds right. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Were you expecting an uptick in the contribution from backlog in the fourth quarter relative to earlier in the year? And is that still the case? Ronald T. Hundzinski: No, no. We, as you know, when we give our guidance for the year, even our backlog, it's kind of an annual look. I can't say that there's an expectation that there is going to be any strong lift in the fourth quarter versus the other quarters. And then let me reiterate, our guidance now is very well-aligned with what our guidance was in January, which was based on our backlog that we -- the announcement we made last November. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Okay. Could you talk a little bit about the timing of the drag from restructuring inefficiencies in Europe? How should we be thinking about some of the big moves that you're making and how that kind of flows through? And then, lastly, I don't know if you have any comments on this, but obviously, there's some reviews of testing procedures that's going on in Europe. One of which -- one of the changes being discussed is moving from this new European driving cycle to WLPT. Do you see that as having any puts and takes or puts or takes vis-a-vis the outlook for backlog or for mix for you? James R. Verrier: Rob, this is James. I'll comment a little on the evolution of driving test cycles, et cetera. In a nutshell, we don't really expect any meaningful change in -- for us in terms of our product strategy, our growth expectations. We just -- we don't. I think there's always been this element of test cycles versus real world driving and there's always been some disparity. I think any move towards aligning those closer or aligning it consistently globally, around the world is a good thing. I don't believe there's anything materially that's going to adjust the automaker strategies around maybe fuel economy and emission standards. And so therefore, I think, our product plans will stay in place. So I don't think it's going to really make any much difference to BorgWarner, Rod, if that helps you. But in terms of the Drivetrain piece, let me just comment, if I can, just from a macro point rather. Then if Ron or Ken want to add detailed numbers, that's fine. First and foremost, the Drivetrain restructuring remains really important for us, and the reason it remains important for us is to support our growth plans for Drivetrain. It's an integral part of our growth strategy and we wanted to put ourself in a position where we can capitalize on that growth by an optimized footprint. Let's just -- it's a refresh. And the really good news, that plan stays on track where, as Ron alluded to, we're now in a phase of moving equipment and then going through all that stuff. What we've talked about, Rod, is that would meaningfully kick off in the middle of this year and it would run through most of next year until we're fully, fully done. And I think what we talked about -- that's staying on track. And what we talked about is, when we were running in the higher incremental lines earlier, in earlier quarters, in the 30s, we talked about a couple of headwinds and one of them was Drivetrain restructuring but our target and our goal is that would probably moderate us back to the mid-teens or maybe a little more than that. And I think, we feel good actually, that's kind of what we're seeing play out. So it's not a 1-quarter event, Rod. We'll see some noise in that over the next few quarters, but that's not going to take us through all our commitment to the mid-teens. And if it works out a little better than we hoped, it'd maybe take us a little north of the mid-teens. So does that help a little, Rod, give you some better understanding on it or... Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : So just kind of at a high level, if you were to do 15% incremental in 2015, because this is, obviously, this is going to take a while before this is done, would 15% be in line or somewhat disappointing for you? James R. Verrier: I would say, the mid-teens is our expectation, and we would look to hope to exceed that. I mean, that's typically the way we look at it, right? We don't manage the company to run at mid-teens. We're always looking to improve. And I think what I'm trying to characterize a little, Rod, is there's a lot of moving pieces when you do it over a 12- or 18-month period. So there's going to be noise, but we'll look to try and exceed that if we can. But I think, mid-teens is a reasonable minimum expectation. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker from Morgan Stanley. Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : I'm sorry, I'm going to ask you another guidance question because I still can't make the math work. If I were to just take, just for ease of calculation, the high end of your guidance for revenues at 13% and your margin of approaching 13%, I get to an EPS number that's about $0.05 above the high end of your guidance range on EPS. I'm just kind of starting to figure it out, is there anything below the line that's hurting numbers? Or why that would be the case? Ronald T. Hundzinski: No, there's nothing that would be a negative that -- we know we have restructuring at this point, and we're trying to work through what those restructuring impact of moving those facilities to Western Europe are. But that -- there's nothing really I can say that's a negative. Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Okay. Maybe I'll follow-up with Ken post the call, but I think you're getting a number of these questions because I think people are just trying to make the math work. And I think your guidance change on revenues and margins makes a lot of sense. But it just seems like EPS is moving a lot more than that. And I think people want to figure out why. I'll follow up again post the call. Kenneth Lamb : One comment, Ravi, just before you move on. Our -- the difference -- the main difference is that expectations may have been different than our guidance as of the last quarter, I think. But our -- we can work through that offline, but I have a math model here that supports this. So I'm sure we'll figure it out. Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Understood, understood. Just on the slow ramp by that North American customer, can you just give more detail on who, what, why, how long it's going to last, or how much dollar impact that is on 3Q and going forward? James R. Verrier: Ravi, I don't want to give too much specificity about which customer, but what I will say is, it's planned and it's in line with what we were kind of expected, and it's not a long-term thing. I think it'll be sorted by the fourth quarter and back to normal levels. So it's not a surprise or a shock. It's kind of about on track to what we were expecting actually, and we should be through it by the end of the year. Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Okay. And then just lastly, you guys had hinted earlier in the year that you may be closing in on another acquisition before the end of the year. Any update on that? James R. Verrier: The update probably, Ravi, is we continue to have a number of targets in the pipeline. And I think what has been typical over recent quarters, we've always got 1 or 2 that are kind of closer towards completion than others, and I think that's pretty much where we are right now. So we're working really very hard and very diligently to try and get one completed. I think you just know. It's just -- you can't predict that date just because of the uncertainty of the process itself. But the intensity is strong. The pipeline is very robust actually. And again, typically, we've got 1 or 2 that are kind of getting closer to completion and I think -- I would say that's where we're at right now, Ravi. Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Okay. And I'm sorry, just one more. Just on the backlog and recently, you guys sounded fairly confident in talking about the backlog math. I think you've -- Ken even said that it's best macro environment in 2 years, doing [ph] the backlog math. And any update on that? I mean do you feel like things have deteriorated as you've done more math? Or what's your view going into a couple of weeks now? Ronald T. Hundzinski: I think that if you visit us at November 10, you'll get the whole picture of what you're looking for, Ravi. Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : That's very helpful. Ronald T. Hundzinski: I know that it's not, but I have to defer till then. Sorry. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Spak from RBC Capital Markets. Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : First, maybe to just talk about the fourth quarter guidance in a different way. If you do the math on the FX impact, it does come to about -- down [ph] EPS level, $0.03. The low end of the range lowered by about that much but the high end was more like $0.07. So I'm just wondering what the delta is and what could really cause that larger discrepancy behind. Is it more cost? Is it some additional volume pressure? Ronald T. Hundzinski: All right, Joe. So the first question, are you referring to the prior guidance number sequentially you're trying to do it or year-over-year? Because that's important too. Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Yes. Well. I guess, what I'm doing is I'm looking at sort of your prior full year guidance range versus your new year guidance range. Ronald T. Hundzinski: Yes, alright, so I get about a little bit north of $100 million in sales reduction, okay? Now maybe the difference is the third quarter difference as well but I get $100 million. And typically, it's $0.12, $0.14 on the dollar that FX impact has on the operating income, then you have to flush it through the EPS. So I get more of a $0.05. I think, you're getting $0.03 a share, right? Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : So just to be clear, I guess, I'm wondering, so if you look at just new versus old for the full year, the high end was lowered by much more than the low end. I'm just wondering what caused that discrepancy. Ronald T. Hundzinski: We'd have to... Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : We could follow up later. Ronald T. Hundzinski: Joe, I get $0.05 at the midpoint, I will say that. Now, if it's $0.06 or $0.005 on the high end, low end, in the midpoint, it's roughly $0.05. And it's not just the euro, you have to take into consideration that there's strength against just about every major currency except the Korean won. So there's currencies involved. But top level, it's about 100-plus million. You can always use this $0.11, $0.12, $0.13 decremental to the operating number, and then you flush it through the EPS, you get about $0.05, I think on the midpoint. Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Okay. And then on the Drivetrain revenues, so it sounds like some of the delayed program should be through by -- or delayed ramp should be through by the fourth quarter, but you also mentioned the tougher comps, which really should persist for, I guess, another three. So is it -- and should we expect just some lower growth overall in that segment for a couple of quarters here before a little bit of an acceleration and more towards the back-half of '15? Is that a fair way to think about it? Ronald T. Hundzinski: Well, we'll have to talk about 2015 a little bit more in January. But I think it's a fair way of thinking about it. If you look at the progression of Drivetrain over the last 18 months, you will see that surge in the second half of last year, and it has anniversary-ed now. So yes, that's going to slow down the growth a bit. And the other things that we've been talking about in that segment, the restructuring-related inefficiency. This new plant that we opened in China that's not going to start producing parts until third quarter 2015, those are going to be things that we're dealing with. We have been saying over the last couple of quarters, Drivetrain is going to be a little bit bumpy for the next few quarters, but at the end of that, the thing is going to be a much more competitive business. So we're taking those steps for the benefit of the long term. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman from JPMorgan. Ryan J. Brinkman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : I know that you already dodged one backlog question, but just approaching it a different way just in terms of an overall industry background question. Can you remind us of what drove in recent years the phenomena of automakers pushing out the timing of planned new programs? Was that more about them trying to cut cost during the downturn particularly in Europe. And as sales are improving in that region, have we maybe cycled past this phenomena? James R. Verrier: Yes, I mean just from my point, Ryan, I think if you look back on it historically, if you -- the downturn period clearly caused some of the automakers to stall and postpone and realign programs. So that was obviously a significant event. Over and above that, generally, programs really move around a little bit just based on more than anything the ability of the OEMs with their suppliers to get products launched. And when you're managing a transmission or an engine program launch over a 3- or a 4-year period, to have a month or a quarter change or a slight volume adjustment up or down, is very normal, and we have a lot of those just like any other supplier does. But -- so I would say those are the 2 points that there was a big adjustment in the past. And then normal course of business is customers will tweak programs and volume launch dates based on a number of things, and we just try and true that up, and that's why we do the backlog press just [ph] once a year. Ryan J. Brinkman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Okay, that's very helpful. And then relative to the planned slow ramp at a major customer program in North America. Now you earlier didn't want to identify that specific customer program. But maybe just along those lines, can you remind us what your biggest programs in North America are? And then specifically, what your revenue exposure might be to the Ford F series program, on which I know you've got some great turbos including 2 I think on 1 Engine, right? So... Ronald T. Hundzinski: Yes, our largest programs are the truck programs with the domestic OEMs, generally speaking. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson from Barclays. Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Yes, a couple of questions. I just want to kind of reiterate what I think I'm hearing on Drivetrain going into 4Q in 2015. Basically, that while we have been spoiled by very strong sort of 20-ish percent incrementals in a pace to 15% margins there, at least for the first couple of quarters of 2015, as you grow into the DCT plant, before you get the benefit of other restructuring, we're not going to see that same kind of margin expansion? Ronald T. Hundzinski: You said it very well, but I'm not going to agree to the numbers yet until we work through our 2015 plan, Brian. But I think the high level of analysis you just played out could play out that way, okay? It was very well put. Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Okay. And is there any tailwind there from the shift to see these SUVs either in Europe or in China? We had great Jeep numbers yesterday, and they're launching their -- not necessarily the program you're on, but as evidence of the segment. And is that that potentially providing some revenue upside in Drivetrain? James R. Verrier: No, I'm not sure I have that specific level of detail on that, Brian. I'll just say, in general, the growth on Drivetrain, it's been strong across both our transmission business and the overall drive business, and it's kind of multiple programs, multiple regions of the world. I mean, I think, at a macro level, I would say we've certainly benefited well from truck mix and truck strength in North America. I think that's for sure. And in Asia or China specifically, we've done very well. So I wouldn't want to break it down vehicle segment so much other than truck in North America and generally Asia, both China and Korea has been strong for us. Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Okay. And as a final housekeeping, just for the fourth quarter, equity income, I think a fair amount might come from NSK-Warner. Should we be thinking about this mystery around the top line, op income and EPS? Could currency pressures in the equity income line be part of what the fourth quarter guided here? Ronald T. Hundzinski: No. I just want to comment on the third quarter. Equity income was outstanding, and the year-over-year variance looked quite large. But actually, Brian, if you go back sequentially, it's not that far off on a sequential basis. We're just -- NSK-Warner also serves to the Chinese market, I'll just point it out that way, and a lot that came from that side of the business. But no, to answer your question, that is not impacting us on the fourth. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli from Citi. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Just a quick question on cash flow actually. Any update to the outlook for the full year? It seems like the operating cash flow was running a little bit behind your -- perhaps what was implied in the prior 2014 outlook. Ronald T. Hundzinski: Yes. Yes, it is. In fact, we're just talking about that a little bit this morning, about that stuff. Operating cash flow, is -- I think what we're being impacted by is restructuring activities floating in and out. Because remember, we have to start from a GAAP basis. We don't normalize it for a continuing basis, so we're seeing some of the spending of cash in restructuring activities. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Okay. Do you still expect to kind of hit that range you've previously outlined? Ronald T. Hundzinski: No, I think, the range is going to come down slightly. We're going update that range slightly down. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Okay, great. I'm just hoping we could talk a little bit about just your overall tone of global macro where you're seeing things a little bit better, maybe worse, and just your initial kind of industry view perhaps into 2015. Just love to get your updated thoughts there. James R. Verrier: Maybe I would -- maybe we can start in Europe. I think as we came into the year, Itay, we were relatively cautious around growth in Europe. We said it'll be relatively very small and slow and a little bit bumpy through the year. I think that's pretty much what we've seen and we -- as we talked about it through this year, we probably anticipate a similar thing going into next year. So I think it's going to be very small kind of growth and a little bit lumpy. North America, I think, has been a strong market this year. And it's a little early to know what '15 is going to look like, but I think that's a robust market, and there'll be some growth in North America going into next year also. I think the other market of note on the macro is China, and we continue to see a relatively strong market growth in China both this year, and I wouldn't expect that to change. Next year, I think it'll be another strong growth year for China. Whether it moderates between 7%, 8%, 9% in that range, we'll see, but it's still meaningful growth. And obviously, when you layer the content growth on top of that for BorgWarner, it's a real strong platform for us. And then the other macro that we -- I alluded to earlier, Itay, was commercial vehicle, there's a little been bit of growth in North America, which has been welcome. The other regions of the world continue to be a challenge, and we're going to take a good look at that as we go through the fourth quarter of how we think that will play out next year. So not too bad overall. I mean, there's still modest to moderate growth for the industry, and it's just primarily China and North America are the 2 stronger zones for the world and for us as well. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Archambault from Goldman Sachs. Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Just maybe 2 items left for me. So there was a question earlier about the timing of the footprint actions. Can we just go through the catalog of some of those onetimers that aren't restructuring charges, that are kind of temporary factors? I think you talked about those. Obviously, you talked about the China plant, which isn't really seeing revenue until the fourth quarter, I think. And then I thought there were some other costs had been deferred maybe in the first half of this year, end of last year that were also still coming back. So maybe just going through those items and when they're actually sort of impacting you and also how much of an impact they had this quarter would be helpful. Ronald T. Hundzinski: Sure, Pat. So we announced this restructuring back in the third quarter -- fourth quarter of 2013. And typically in the first 2 quarters, what we saw is mostly severance cost and so on and so forth, then that gets put into restructuring. What doesn't get put into the restructuring and call-out line items are items like excess labor sitting at the receiving plant, transportation cost for bringing in more inventory or shift in inventory between the plants, some bringing cost for example. Those inefficiencies at start-up, those costs are not pulled out. Those are in our operating results. Now they can be -- they can run very high at times or we can control them, but they're very difficult to actually predict to be honest. But those are the types of cost that comes into the operations at the gross profit numbers, which you saw here a little bit of a 10 basis points reduction. Those are the type of costs that come into the business. The other costs you were referring to were more on SG&A side that we deferred in 2013 for, I would say, personal development investment, I guess, is one way to say it, everything from training activities, IT, improvement, things of that nature. Those items we deferred in '13. And once the organization was given the greenlight basically in '14, that the growth was back to spend those. Those start to come into the business. So you're going to -- at the gross profit line and you starting to see that coming in SG&A line as well. Does that help you out? The timing is -- when they came in. Remember, we thought the second quarter was going to be a little bit but we saw them in the third quarter. So -- okay? James R. Verrier: So I just want to put all Ron's explanation together, I think it's kind of worth it as we kind of come towards the end of this. BorgWarner's been performing in the mid-30s and low 30s incremental rate over a number of quarters, which is just incredible performance, which we've all talked about. And I think just to refresh what we talked about was some moderation of that back towards the mid-teens or a little above. I think that's what we're seeing. So I just want to reiterate that this is -- I think what hopefully we've been projecting and I think that's what's coming. We remain very confident that we're going to run this company with that mid-teen incremental and/or above. And I think that's what we've demonstrated. And the third quarter is another great example of it. With all of those headwinds, we still delivered a very solid incremental. So I think -- I just think it's important we don't lose sight of that bigger view as we go forward. Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Okay, helpful. Can I just fit in one more? Just on -- there's something you said earlier I wanted to clarify about, I guess, the -- restructuring some of the -- I'm probably saying this wrong, but the legal aspects to be able to repatriate cash more effectively from overseas. And I thought you had said that that's -- maybe the language was that's going to make it easier to kind of pay dividends kind of in the 2016 time frame. But I just want to make sure that wasn't precluding cash deployment between now and then just because obviously right now you do have some acquisitions in the hopper, but you are fairly far out of that leverage range that you guys have typically kind of guided to. Ronald T. Hundzinski: Yes, let me restate what's going on here maybe. Back in the early part of the last decade, there was a legal structure that was put in place to support the strategic growth of the company. We've outgrown that structure. And growth is a little bit different now. It has to be reengineered, and we're going through the process of reengineering that structure to support different growth objectives in other parts of the world. So what this will do is this gives us more flexibility to execute that plan basically, okay? So that's what it really is. It's just that 10 years ago, it was a different business than it is today. This work that we're doing is going to provide a tremendous amount of flexibility in all aspects of our business from cash flow to other strategic items that we have on the table, and it's not inhibiting us tremendously today. It would just enhance and give us flexibility to be more proactive in the future. Operator : Our last question will come from the line of John Murphy from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : I just have 2 quick ones here. Just first, as we think about the pressure that you're seeing from the slow ramp of this program in North America in Drivetrain, I would assume that you'd see some pressure in the Engine business just because you have turbos on that same program. So as we see sort of this lift from the slow ramp impacting positively Drivetrain, could it also have a real positive impact on the Engine business as well as we get through the fourth quarter? Ronald T. Hundzinski: Well, I mean, yes. But to a lesser degree, I think, it's less impactful on the Engine side of the business because it's bigger business. So relatively speaking, it's not going to have a material impact. But, yes, directionally, that's correct. John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Okay. And just a last question, and I hate to keep asking about this treasury reorg, but could that potentially have any impact on taxes positively or negatively, and hopefully positively, as you go through this reorg? James R. Verrier: John, I'm not going to predict which way, but to answer your question, it would impact cash, taxes and various other items. It impacts quite a few things. We have to work through the plans. Ken, I think, said earlier is going to take us through next year. And then the outcome of that will be more clear as far as the total impacts on the total company, all right? Kenneth Lamb : I'd like to thank you, all, again for joining us. We expect to file our 10-Q before the end of the day, which will provide details of our results. If you have any follow-up questions about our earnings release, the matters discussed during this call or our 10-Q, please direct them to me. Actually, I think I'll be quite busy this afternoon. Kyle, go ahead and close out call. Operator : That does conclude the BorgWarner 2014 Third Quarter Results Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect.",

Brinkman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division Operator : Good morning. My name is Melissa, and I will be your conference facilitator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BorgWarner 2014 Fourth Quarter and Full Year End Results Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Ken Lamb, VP of Investor Relations. Mr. Lamb, you may begin your conference. Kenneth Lamb : Thank you, Melissa. Good morning, and thank you, all, for joining us. We issued our earnings release this morning at around 8 a.m. Eastern time. It's posted on our website, borgwarner.com, on our Investor Relations home page. A replay of today's conference call will be available through February 20, also on our website. The dial-in number for that replay is (855) 859-2056. You'll need the conference ID, which is 63271907. With regard to our Investor Relations calendar, we will be attending the following conferences between now and our next earnings release : February 18, next week, we will be at the Barclays Industrial Select Conference in Miami; April 1, we will be at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch New York Auto Summit. Now before we begin, I need to inform you that during this call, we may make forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties as detailed in our 10-K. Our actual results may differ significantly from the matters discussed today. Now moving on to our results. James Verrier, President and CEO, will review highlights of our quarterly and full year operating results as well as some of our recent noteworthy accomplishments. And then Ron Hundzinski, our CFO, will discuss the details of our quarterly and full year operating results. With that, I'll turn it over to James. James R. Verrier: Thank you, Ken, and good day, everybody. Ron and I are very pleased to review our fourth quarter and full year results with you as well as some of our recent accomplishments. Let me take a moment, though, before I begin to thank all of our employees around the world for another outstanding quarter, and it's really tremendous 2014. Your efforts drove great results that continue to lead our industry. Now onto our results. First of all, the fourth quarter, reported sales were just under $2 billion, which is up 6% from a year ago or 7% when we exclude the impact of foreign currencies on the Wahler acquisition. U.S. GAAP earnings of $0.61 per share or $0.75 per share when we exclude nonrecurring charges. Our operating income margin, again excluding nonrecurring charges, was an impressive 12.4% in the quarter. And 2 key factors drove the strong results : solid sales growth and operational efficiency in the Engine segment and good cost controls across the corporation. Again, it's outstanding performance by our operations. If I look at the 2 segments, let me start with the Engine segment. We have fourth quarter sales of $1.4 billion, which is up 9% from a year ago. Our sales growth excluded the impact of foreign currencies in Wahler, which also a 9%, as these items offset each other in the quarter. Strong results were led primarily by strong turbocharger sales in Europe, China and Korea. In the Drivetrain segment, we saw sales of $615 million, which is down 2% from a year ago or up 2% when we exclude the foreign currencies. Drivetrain's sales growth, excluding currency, was driven by higher dual-clutch transmission volumes in Europe, and that was partially offset by a planned slow ramp-up of a major program by a North American customer. Drivetrain continues to grow, and our restructuring plan is very much on track. This past July, we began moving equipment from our Western European operations to Poland, and these actions are a really critically important to the long-term success of that segment. The segment review really does again highlight BorgWarner's core strengths, shows a product portfolio and high demand in markets around the world, strong operational performance from the Engine segment and good execution of the Drivetrain restructuring plant designed to improve our long-term performance. Now let me move on to the full year. So reported sales were $8.3 billion, which is up an impressive 11.7%. After excluding the impact of foreign currencies in Wahler, sales were up 8% from 2013. U.S. GAAP earnings were $2.87 per share. And after excluding noncomparable items, net earnings were $3.25 per share, which is up 12% from 2013 on a comparable basis. And our full year operating income margin, when we exclude noncomparable items, was 12.9%. So in all 3 key metrics : sales, earnings and operating income margin, we achieved new records in 2014. Our financial strength and strong performance is based on our ability to anticipate and drive the next technology waves. And as we look to the future, BorgWarner continues to invest for the long term. Capital spending continues to grow. We spent about 8% of sales on capital in the fourth quarter, which is above our long-term target of 6%. Typically, our capital spending is primarily for machinery and equipment. However, our strong high single, low double-digit growth outlook over the next few years required investment in new plants and plant expansions, which is driving some elevated spending in the near term. We expect this to continue through the end of 2015, after which, we will return to more normalized spending levels. Our investment in R&D was 4% of sales in the quarter, which is in line with our target for the year, and the intensity around organic innovation and product development remains very strong. I'm also proud to share some of the exciting announcements we made during the last few months. We officially opened our new production plant in Viana do Castelo in Portugal. The state-of-the-art building expands our production capacity to meet growing demand for several exhaust gas recirculation technologies as well as dual-clutch control modules for both passenger cars and commercial vehicles. The new facility provides 50% more manufacturing space to the current rented site in Valen\u00e7a and has additional space for future expansion. Our facilities in Frankfurt, Illinois, Water Valley, Mississippi and Ithaca, New York, received the 2014 Supplier Quality Excellence Awards from General Motors and also our manufacturing plant in Manesar, India was presented with the 2014 Supplier Quality Excellence Award from GM in India. BorgWarner supplies its advanced turbocharging technology for Volkswagen's latest 1.4 liters four-cylinder gasoline engine for the China market. The wastegated turbocharger applies a mixed flow turbine to deliver superior responsiveness over the entire engine street range. Also, BorgWarner supplies its inverted silent chain for JATCO's CVT transmission. Our silent chain technology drives the oil pump used to lubricate the system and generate hydraulic pressure to adjust the pulleys that enable TorqTransfer in a continuously variable transmission. And this transmission propels a wide variety of automobiles, including Nissan, Suzuki and Mitsubishi. We're also supplying our high-performance friction technology for Audi's new DCT transmission. Our advanced technology features an innovative friction plate designed with significantly improved shift quality, helps increase fuel economy and reduce noise, vibration and harshness. Audi's new DCT transmission moves introduced on the Audi A6 platform. Also, we are supplying our advanced front cross differential or FXD for the new SEAT Leon CUPRA. Designed for high-performance front-wheel-drive vehicles, the electronic limited slip differential significantly improves vehicle handling, traction and stability in nearly all driving conditions. The FXD technology provides automakers with a cost-effective and fuel-efficient alternative to all wheel drive systems. BorgWarner also produces plug top ignition coils with integrated electronics at our proper facility in Ramos, Mexico for Volkswagen 2-liter and 1.8-liter I4 engine built in Mexico. These engines power the Volkswagen Jetta and the Beetle as well as other models designated for the U.S. market. Our complex plug top technology delivers more ignition and higher voltage than conventional plug top or pencil coil ignitions -- coils. Finally, let me talk about the separate press release that we issued this morning announcing that our board has authorized a share repurchase program of up to $1 billion over the next 3 years. For me to be a little clearer, this is a departure from our previous authorizations, which were open-ended from a timing perspective. Our intention is to execute a $1 billion of share repurchases over the next 3 years, and I believe this program is a clear indication of the following : our confidence in the long-term growth of our business, our expectations for strong free cash flow generation going forward and our continued commitment to create and deliver value to our shareholders. Now I'll provide an overview of our guidance for 2015, which we gave last month. Sales growth in 2015 is expected to be 2% to 6% or 9.5% to 12% when we exclude the impact of foreign currencies. We expect earnings to be within the range of $3.35 to $3.55 per diluted share or $3.60 to $3.75 excluding the impact of foreign currencies. And our operating margin is expected to be above 13%. This is only a high-level overview of our guidance, and Ron will provide more color to you in his remarks. So in summary, 2014 was a fantastic year for BorgWarner. And as we look ahead, the industry's continued adoption of our leading-edge powertrain technology combined with operational excellence are the prime reasons I believe we are happy, we still are and we will continue to be leading auto supplier in terms of growth and operating performance. So with that, I'm going to turn the call now over to Ron. Ronald T. Hundzinski: Thanks, James, and good day, everyone. Before I begin reviewing the financials, I would like to also commend all of our employees for their hard work and congratulate them on yet another great year. Now on to our financials. James already provided a detailed review of our sales performance in the quarter. In summary, sales were up 6% from a year ago or 7% excluding the impact of foreign currencies and the Wahler acquisition. The growth in the quarter came primarily from the Engine segment, which I'll talk more about later. Overall, it was a strong quarter for sales. Working down the income statement. Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 20.7% in the quarter. During the same period, SG&A as a percent of sales was 8.5%. R&D spending, which is included in SG&A, was at 4%. Reported operating income in the quarter was $212 million. However, this includes nonrecurring items related to restructuring activities, a pension plan settlement and intangible asset impairment. The $23 million pretax restructuring charge includes expenses related to the continued relocation of 2 drivetrain facilities from Western to Eastern Europe, the continuing investment in improving Wahler's operational efficiency and footprint and the global legal entity realignment plan intended to enhance treasury management flexibility. The $10 million pretax intangible asset impairment was related to Engine segment on amortized trade names. And the $400,000 pension plan settlement is the remainder of the lump sum payments made to former employees to discharge our obligation under the plan, activity which began in the third quarter. Excluding nonrecurring items, operating income was $246 million or 12.4% of sales, down 30 basis points from the same period a year ago. Excluding nonrecurring items, very strong performance considering the cost incurred ramping up new plants and restructuring related inefficiencies that we're working through. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, the Wahler acquisition and the nonrecurring items, our year-over-year incremental margin was about 17%, in line with our long-term mid-teens incremental margin target. Again, this is very strong performance considering the cost incurred in ramping up new plants and the restructuring related inefficiencies that we're working through. Note that our new plants in China will be up and running and the Drivetrain restructuring will be completed by the beginning of 2016, both should boost our performance. As you look further down the income statement, equity and affiliate earnings was just about $12 million in the quarter, in line with last year. This represents the performance of NSK-Warner, our 50-50 joint venture in Japan, which sells transmission components to our Japanese customers in Japan and China, as well as TEL, our turbocharger joint venture in India. Interest expense and finance charges were $10 million in the quarter, up slightly from a year ago. Provision for income taxes in the quarter on a reported basis was $67 million. However, this includes a tax benefit of $4 million related to the nonrecurring charges. Excluding the impact of nonrecurring items, provisions for income taxes was about $71 million, which is an effective tax rate of about 28.6% in the quarter. Our effective tax rate for the full year, excluding noncomparable items, was 28.5%. Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest were just under $8 million in the quarter, basically flat with the fourth quarter 2013. This line reflects our minority partner's share in the earnings performance of our Korean and Chinese consolidated joint ventures. That brings us back to net earnings, which were $140 million in the quarter or $0.61 per share. Excluding the impact of nonrecurring items, net earnings were $0.75 per share, outstanding performance for the company. Note that the weaker foreign currencies lowered earnings by about $0.05 per share in the quarter. As James mentioned, on a comparable basis, 2014 was a record year for sales, operating income margin and EPS. Additionally, our full year incremental margin was 27%, also on a comparable basis. That makes 2 consecutive years of incremental margins in the 30% range for our company. This is an unmatched performance in this industry. We expect great performance again in 2015. Now let's take a closer look at our operating segments in the quarter. As James said earlier, the reported Engine segment sales were $1.4 billion in the quarter, excluding currency and Wahler. Engine segment sales growth was 9% compared with the same period a year ago. On a reported basis, adjusted EBIT for the Engine segment was 16.4% of sales. Excluding currency and Wahler, adjusted EBIT for the Engine segment was 17.4% of sales or 100 basis points from the 16.4% reported a year ago. That's just fantastic performance. Excluding currency and Wahler, the Engine segment's year-over-year incremental margin was 29% in the fourth quarter and 28% for the full year. Again, excellent performance for this segment. The restructuring plan for Wahler is on target. The remaining charges will be recorded over the next 2 years or so, after which Wahler is expected to be a double-digit margin business. In the Drivetrain segment, reported sales were about $615 million in the quarter. Excluding currency, sales growth was about 2% compared with the same period a year ago. Drivetrain faced a tough year-over-year comparison in the fourth quarter. There was a surge in all-wheel drive sales in North America and dual-clutch module sales in Europe for the company a year ago, making it a tough comparison. Also, in the fourth quarter 2014, Drivetrain was impacted by a planned, slow ramp-up of a major program by a North American customer. On a reported basis, adjusted EBIT was 10.7% of sales. Excluding currency, adjusted EBIT was 10.6% of sales. Again, excluding currency, the Drivetrain segment's year-over-year incremental margin was negative 20% in the fourth quarter. But we need to keep this in perspective. Drivetrain lost $1 million of incremental adjusted EBIT on $17 million of incremental sales. That means the segment was about $5 million to $6 million shy of the 15% to 20% incremental margin, which can be attributed to the costs associated with our DCT component plant in Taicang, China that was not yet launched in production and the restructuring-related inefficiencies faced in the quarter. The Drivetrain restructuring plan is also on target with regard to both timing and cost. We still expect to have the relocations completed by the end of 2015, after which, Drivetrain will be in a much better competitive position in Europe. For the full year, Drivetrain's incremental margin, excluding currency was 27% in 2014, excellent performance considering the challenges faced in the second half of the year. We are very pleased with Drivetrain's performance in 2014. As we look forward, restructuring benefits combined with strong organic growth will drive outstanding performance for the Drivetrain segment for the foreseeable future. Now let's take a look at the balance sheet and cash flow. We generated $802 million of net cash from operating activities in 2014, up from 100 -- up from $719 million a year ago. The increase was primarily related to higher net earnings. Capital spending, which was $563 million in 2014, up $145 million from a year ago. The increase was driven by capital required to support our backlog of net new business. Free cash flow, which we define as net cash from operating activities less capital spending, was $239 million in 2014, down $57 million from last year, primarily due to higher capital spending. Looking at the balance sheet itself. Balance sheet debt increased by $117 million at the end of 2014 compared with the end of 2013. Cash decreased by $142 million during the same period. The $259 million increase in net debt was primarily due to dividend payments to shareholders, share repurchases and the Wahler acquisition. We spent nearly 150% of free cash flow on these activities in 2014. Our net debt-to-capital ratio is 12.8%, up from 7.2% at the end of 2013. Net debt-to-EBITDA at the end of the year on a trailing 12-month basis was 0.4x. Our capital structure remains in excellent shape. Now I'd like to discuss our guidance for 2015 as provided in January. James reviewed our guidance at a high level. I'll discuss some of the finer points. We expect sales growth of 2% to 6% and EPS within a range of $3.35 to $3.55 per diluted share in 2015. However, as James mentioned earlier, these numbers are heavily influenced by currency. Excluding currency, our sales growth is expected to be in the 9.5% to 12% range, and earnings are expected to be within the range of $3.60 to $3.75 per diluted share, very strong performance. Our operating income margin guidance of above 13% implies a mid-teens incremental margin, which is in line with our long-term target. Finally, our expected diluted share count for 2015 is 229 million shares. This diluted share count guidance excludes any share repurchases that we may execute during the year. However, we announced a repurchase plan of $1 billion in share repurchases over the next 3 years this morning. Our plan is to use cash, existing cash balances and indebtedness and future cash flow to execute that plan. We continue to be confident in our ability to execute in any market. This company has demonstrated a heightened focus on efficiency and cost. This focus resulted in highly efficient growth and record margins in each of the last 4 years. With our strong organic growth and operations performing at a very high level, 2015 should be another great year for BorgWarner. As we look beyond 2015, we plan to execute our growth plans yielding high single to low double-digit growth and to efficiently convert our sales growth to profits. The future is very bright for BorgWarner. With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Ken. Kenneth Lamb : Thanks, Ron. Melissa, can you re-announce the Q&A procedure? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities. Richard Michael Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : James, I just wanted to discuss the buyback. So pretty significant number. Does this have any implications for M&A, future M&A and what you're seeing out there? James R. Verrier: Yes, Rich, the way I would think about it is not at all in terms of any concern around M&A. Our pipeline is still strong. It's robust and we continue to drive, and that's very, very much in our focus to do M&A in addition to the buyback. So there's -- yes, there's no signal there. There's no indication. I think we outlined the primary drivers and purpose for why we're doing the share buyback but don't, for a minute, think that's going to slow down our intensity and commitment around trying to drive M&A because we will. Richard Michael Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Okay. All right. And then -- and Ron, the $5 million to $6 million of inefficiencies [Audio Gap] you think about over the course of '15? Or is it -- do you expect it to be kind of a lumpy number from quarter-to-quarter? Ronald T. Hundzinski: Rich, I can tell you that, that was the number in the fourth quarter. And going forward, I think, I would -- it's going to be lumpy. I don't see that's a predictable number. We're going to have to take each quarter by quarter and how their performance is. I think that was the number for the fourth quarter. Richard Michael Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Okay. All right. And then on CapEx and free cash flow for the fourth quarter. So working capital was below our expectation. CapEx was definitely much higher. The 8% number, that seems much higher relative to the trend. I think you were talking north of 6% this year. How should we think about this for -- as it plays out in '15? And then working capital, were there any headwinds in the quarter that were unique? Ronald T. Hundzinski: Okay, a couple of things. First, CapEx, Rich. I think for 2015, we're going to continue with this upper -- actually, above the upper end of our 5% to 6% of sales CapEx that we typically have as guidance. We're running on the high end of that and I always expect that to go through 2015 as well. I think it's 2016 when we'll we start to see that to come back down into the range. I think we've talked about we're putting in some brick-and-mortar over the last 2 years in various parts of the world, and that bubble, so to speak, will pass through and will go back to more normal machinery and equipment. Getting back to the cap, the working capital, a couple of things, a couple of challenges. Some of -- are decision of our customers took some liberties out of this, I guess, maybe on payments, which typically we don't see. So that was one of the headwinds. So I think we'll get back to a more normal level there. Richard Michael Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Okay. All right. And then just to clarify on the CapEx, though, is the 8% present level, is that a realistic outcome for '15? Or is it somewhere between 6% and 8%? Ronald T. Hundzinski: No. No, I think that what you saw there is you saw a spike in spending in the quarter, given where the sales were. So I think that's just a 1-quarter number that you saw. That's not a number for a full year, Rich. Kenneth Lamb : Rich, this is Ken. Our actual guidance for CapEx is in our investor presentation. It's around 6.5% to 7% of sales last year. Ronald T. Hundzinski: Right. So just a quarter thing, Rich, is what it was. Richard Michael Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Okay. Yes, I was just trying to gauge kind of how things will play out for you in a way. Operator : Your next question comes from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Ron, I've been asked on the major North American customer that's kind of hurting comps for our drivetrain. When does that normalize? Is that early 2015? Ronald T. Hundzinski: So if you take a look at '14, I believe that customer was running pretty high on volumes in the first 2 quarters of '14 as well. And so it would be more in the second half where you start to see the comps would even out. Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Okay, understood. And when you say that you're going to revisit or update the guidance after 1Q, can you remind us what are the moving parts that you are tracking? Is it entirely FX you're kind of waiting for things to stabilize before figuring out what the mark-to-market do? Or are there other items as well? Kenneth Lamb : I'm glad you asked that, Ravi. Yes, currency is probably the most volatile piece that we're thinking about right now, but there are other factors at play here. Commodity prices, for instance. Volumes are also in play. So our message is that our organic growth, we're still very comfortable with that guidance that we gave back in January, but there other variables at work here that we want to get a few months behind us, kind of see how they play out and then we'll give an update at the end of April. Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : If I can just follow up on that, both the commodities and given your kind of underlying guidance, the volume assumption you've made for global growth, I'd assume that both are very -- are being revised up, they're going to be tailwinds. Ronald T. Hundzinski: Ravi, I think we're going to wait for that in the first quarter to give you guidance on that. Okay? Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Okay. I won't jump the gun there. And just finally, on the corporate expenses, $36 million in the quarter, that's -- I think a new record high for you and it was much higher than what we were expecting. Can you help us understand what's going on there and what's a good run rate for 2015? Ronald T. Hundzinski: Absolutely, Ravi. So you're right. That number is very high, but a couple of things I want to point out. One is the items in there, which I talked about in the second were noncash items. They were not spendings. So to answer your question, the run rate is going to come back to more what you saw probably in the 3 quarters of the year of 2014. So what was in there? Basically, at the end of the year, there's a couple, I'll call them mumbo-jumbo accounting, transactions we have to do. So for example, intercompany profits on inventory, we have to adjust for and LIFO adjustments we have to adjust for. And they were actually a bit higher than normal than we anticipated and that's what's sitting in there. That's basically the whole difference. So that was just a 1 quarter adjustment. It's -- that's all that was, noncash and we go back to more normal run rate going forward. Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Great. I'll clarify the CPA definition of mumbo-jumbo offline. Ronald T. Hundzinski: It's interesting I used mumbo-jumbo, but the other thing is if you take that off, the performance at the segment level was outstanding. That was the focus here, right? [indiscernible] if you're looking for performance. Okay. All right. Operator : Your next question comes from John Murphy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Just a first question, as we think about the pace of buybacks because obviously it's a big program. I'm just curious, do you think you're going to be soaking up your free cash flow to do this? Or would you be willing to take on some net leverage to get this done maybe sooner rather than later? And I'm just trying to understand what would be your sort of net leverage limits or targets as you kind of work through this process and think about acquisitions as well? Ronald T. Hundzinski: Yes, I'll talk about the first part and then maybe James can talk about the acquisition side of that. We have a lot of opportunities, John, to use. We have existing cash, we have free cash flow that's being generated and we also have indebtedness that we can use as well. So I have a full suite of possibilities that I can pull triggers on to execute this plan. We're very confident and comfortable we can do that as well. So I have no issues in that part of our execution. On the M&A front and how that plays in the M&A, again -- actually, James, I want to answer this. On the M&A front, we still have a lot of capacity on the balance sheet for M&A activity. So James was asked this question earlier. This, by no means, takes away anything on the M&A front. We have capacity to execute the share buyback. We have capacity to execute M&A activity. We're very comfortable. John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Okay. And maybe just to follow up on that. I'm just trying to understand if we look at the end of 2015, and the shares haven't moved much. I mean, could we be looking at the bulk of this buyback having been executed? I'm just trying to gauge the pace. I mean, is there a target of 1/3, 1/3, 1/3 over the next 3 years? Or is this going to be opportunistic and you've got a lot of room on leverage? Ronald T. Hundzinski: John, we're not going to give guidance as far as any numbers in this area. But to answer your question, yes, we're going to take advantage of opportunities when they present themselves. And when they do, we'll be more aggressive, for example. And that's how we're going to do the buybacks. It's not going to be any kind of linear number or anything we're going to do. But we'll use all of our balance sheet, we'll use the cash flow -- free cash flow and the existing cash balances to do it as well. John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Okay, that's very helpful. And then as we look at Drivetrain, I mean, the margins this year, in aggregate, aren't anything really to apologize for but obviously there's some near-term headwinds here with the F-150 changeover and the restructuring you're executing in Europe. Just curious, as we think about those margins and ultimately where they can go as you work through these sort of transitory issues, I mean, is there any reason to think that you might not be able to get the Drivetrain margins near with the engine group margins are over time? I'm just trying to understand the potential magnitude of upside as we get into 16, '17 and '18. James R. Verrier: Yes, yes. And that's a good thought, John, and I appreciate your acknowledgment that ours still a pretty strong year, particularly if we kind of look back a couple of years. I think a really critical part for me, John, is that this restructuring activity that we're undertaking, which is causing a little bit of short-term headwind is all to support our growth. And so there's 2 primary drivers that we've got going for us. One, we've got a strong growth outlook that, obviously, are more capitalized on the incremental revenue plus we're coming from a better cost optimization because of the restructuring. Those 2 things combined are going to take margins up that -- I feel very comfortable with that. In terms of putting up a precise number, John, in terms of 2 or 3 years out, I think we still want to get through this year. But we've not peaked on Drivetrain margins. We've got room to grow and we will over the next couple of years, John. John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Okay. And then just lastly on gas prices. I mean, there's a lot of concern we're hearing from investors just on the short run that there could be some pressure on the business. I mean, have you seen anything on mix on a gross basis or on a net basis between the 2 groups that would cause you any concern just in the short run? James R. Verrier: The quick -- the real quick answer, John, is there's actually no concern from a BorgWarner viewpoint. And I would articulate that in 2 aspects. One, if you take the short run, the short-term stuff that you're alluding to, first of all, as we know, it's predominantly a U.S.-related issue. I think that's fair to say. So that's about 25% of our total revenue. But even so, even when we see that mix shift in a quarter or over a period of time, in the mix between cars and trucks, it's actually neutral to favorable for us. We have a lot of gas price. And if you think about that intuitively, if you look at the typical content that you would see on the larger vehicles, when you think of things like transport cases, you think of turbos and other things, we benefit from the low price in the short run in North America. And then over the long run, which is the other question obviously we're asked, could this influence CapEx pushouts or adjustments, our view on that is we don't see anything meaningful there. We think the trend is in place for continued push on drive on fuel economy and emissions and we're not seeing anything at all in terms of adoption rates of technology or discussions around technologies that will launch in 3 years, 5 years, 6 years out. So quick answer, really in the short run, it's neutral to favorable and in the long term, no change. Operator : Your next question comes from Brian Johnson with Barclays. Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Just want to kind of go in a little bit on some of the stuff you talked about in pricing in Detroit Auto Show, how that actually kind of played out as you kind of locked down the quarter and kind of went in to the price discussions for 2015. You talked about 2% price-downs in 2015. We've been typically seeing 1.5% before. Were you being conservative there? We had a period of low oil prices or OEMs kind of pushing back a little bit more than they used to. Is there any change in the competitive dynamic and, I guess, related to that my follow-on question will be kind of how does nickel and commodities play in to those discussions? Kenneth Lamb : Brian, this is Ken. So -- first of all, let me clarify for you. The guidance that we gave around pricing was around a 2% decline this year versus last year, which is very much in line with what we've given guidance -- or the guidance that we've given over the long term. It was not a change from previous guidance. So I want to make sure that, that's clear. So the idea around commodity prices playing into that, doesn't really have an effect on that. We have quite a bit of pass-through on nickel. I think you flagged nickel, so pricing is affected by that. But this particular discussion around price-downs is a bit separate from that. And I just want to reiterate that, that 2% decline was no different than any guidance we've given in the past. Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Okay. And in terms of the timing of pass-through on nickel, how should we be thinking about that vis-\u00e0-vis the quarterly cadence? Ronald T. Hundzinski: Yes, Brian, this is Ron. I'm not just going to focus on nickel. I'd like to focus on commodities, in general. You have a myriad number of options when you talk about commodity pass-throughs. Sometimes they're set on a quarter basis, sometimes they're set on a half-year basis and some commodities are actually done yearly. So to put one simple number on it is very difficult. It all depends on the commodity, all depends on the customers. But generally, there are lags. I will say that there's lags when you pass them up and there's lags when you pass them down. It's not everything single month, you mark-to-market, so to speak. But there are lags, and the lags, can -- like I said, depend on 1 quarter to 2 quarters to a full year. Operator : The next question comes from David Leiker with Robert W. Baird & Company. David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Your actions on Drivetrain in Europe as you work through that near the end of this year and the next year or so, what kind of opportunities does that present you for going after new businesses? I guess a different way, has your cost structure been an impediment to getting new business or just margins? And does this open an opportunity to be more aggressive? James R. Verrier: I would say, David, what I was maybe trying to articulate earlier, our growth is still very strong for Drivetrain. What this does is it just keeps us or makes us very competitive, I mean, as we optimize that footprint. It just makes us competitive. When I look at -- over the over the last few years in terms of our win rates and how we've been doing in market share type metrics, we've been doing well, and I think this will continue to keep that momentum going. In addition to that, it's absolutely helping us from a margin perspective and we'll continue to do. So it's a little bit of both, David. It helps fuel and support our growth while being competitive and it's helping in the margin side as well by the competitiveness as well. David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Okay, great. And then one other item here. We've been hearing here in the last couple of months more discussions about dual-clutch transmissions coming into the commercial vehicle space. Is that an area that you're able to play in and participate? Kenneth Lamb : Yes, David. That is an area that I think you're going to see us participate in. We are very much participating now, and that we expect that to continue going forward. Operator : Your next question comes from Patrick Archambault with Goldman Sachs. Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Just a couple of, like, clarifications. First, just on the impact of lower gas prices, just one item I was curious about. How much flexibility in programs is there for customers on the take rate whether they have a turbopower -- a turbocharge powertrain or a naturally aspirated? I know that exists for certain programs like the F-150, but my impression was that it wasn't really there in a lot of vehicles and a lot of engines. So one would be tempted to conclude that no matter what gas prices do, a lot of what's in going in for the next few years is kind of baked in. Is that correct or incorrect? Kenneth Lamb : I think you're more right than wrong on that. The backlog, as you know, is booked. So as we look at programs for the next 3 years, that gives it, as you put it, kind of locked and loaded. So we feel comfortable with that. And when we get out 5, 6 years from now, there's a little bit more flexibility, but certainly over the next few years, we feel very comfortable with that. And you did highlight that turbochargers is maybe one potential where people can pick that option or not, but that's maybe the only one. As we think about it, the rest of our technology, they're on those engines, they're on those transmissions and there's not a lot of consumer options or they're thinking about different options as it relates to those other technologies. So I think that overall, that our backlog will not be affected by this change in oil prices. And let's not forget, this is a U.S. phenomenon and a lot of our backlog is outside of the U.S. as well, where this change in oil prices doesn't affect the consumer much at all. Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Well, that's helpful. One other clarification for from me. Just -- I mean, you guys have given a pretty good breakdown of some of those items that are potentially weighing on contribution margin over the year, all right, the new facilities, the restructuring in Drivetrain. But from a quarterly perspective, by the end of this year, beginning of next, is it -- are those front-end loaded costs that really have the bulk of their impact in the first and second quarter? Or do they kind of stretch all the way through the year? Kenneth Lamb : Well, I think, when we talk about the Drivetrain restructuring -- I'll do this in pieces. The Drivetrain restructuring, Ron has said earlier, is going to be kind of lumpy, hard to predict. But we think that there's going to be impact throughout the year to varying degrees. One impediment was the large North American program that impacted that. That should be in the first half of this year and we should be about have that behind us when we get to the second half of the year. And the new plants ramping up, that's probably going to continue through the year as well, again lumpy. We're ramping them up. We're talking about hiring people, getting the plant ready to go, so that's not a straight line either. I think the way to think about it is this stuff will be behind us by the end of the year. And 2016 is going to be very good launching off point for improved performance. Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Understood. Okay, so perhaps a little bit more front-end loaded with the large program piece, but the other guys are kind of spread throughout? Kenneth Lamb : Yes, I think that's fair. James R. Verrier: [indiscernible] Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Okay. And then last, just more of a structural question, I mean, you mentioned it on the call, 30% contribution margins for the last 2 years, which is higher than most of us had thought you would get to. And now even with -- beyond the restructuring and some of the transitional issues that you have this year, you're talking to something more in the mid-teens, right, on a sustainable basis. And I don't want to sound like a spoiled brat or something, but why -- like, what is the structural difference between 2 years ago and in the future once you're beyond some of this frictional issues? Why -- is it just sort of later in the cycle, higher levels of utilization, why structurally is the business not staying at the 30? Again, I don't want to make it sound like a complaint. Just trying to understand the drivers. Ronald T. Hundzinski: Sure, Pat. So really, what you have going on is if I go back a little bit of history and understand that as volumes start to ramp up, you're able to leverage more of your manufacturing utilization to a certain point. And once you meet that, you hit this mass point of utilization in your capital, you have to put in more capital infrastructure. What that does is it starts to bring down those incremental margins. You're not running very efficiently is what you're doing. So for a short period of time, you're seeing good margins, incremental margins because you're utilizing your capital. As you reach this fixed point, you have to put in capital. As you put this capital in, which is what we've been doing in the last half of this year, the incremental margins start to come down. So that's 2 points I'm bringing up -- I'm talking about as you expand and when you in capital. On a steady-state basis, which is what I typically use, Ken is a little bit different, on a steady state, you're putting capital at the same rate of your growth. So your incremental margins tend to blend at mid-teens. We hadn't been in that steady state. We would be in one state, we're in another state. The business needs to run at steady state. And at steady state, you put in capital at the same rate your sales grow, your cost structure, you're adding a plant here and there. You're adding people in those plants and those incremental margins will be the mid-teens as you're in steady state. Operator : Your next question comes from Emmanuel Rosner with Credit Agricole Securities. Emmanuel Rosner - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division : I wanted to ask you first a quick clarification on the buyback program. Is it -- this new $1 billion, is it in addition to what you had left on the existing authorization? I think as of last quarter, if I remember well, it was something like 10 million shares which is at current stock price also a decent amount of change? Kenneth Lamb : So this program is going to utilize the shares that were existing on that authorization. So we had about 8.6 million shares remaining. We'll use those shares as part of this $1 billion share repurchase program. Emmanuel Rosner - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division : Okay. So it's $1 billion from now basically including those? Kenneth Lamb : That's correct. James R. Verrier: Yes. Emmanuel Rosner - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division : And so just another point of clarification, the -- I think back at the Detroit Auto Show, you were saying you're essentially waiting for some clarity on your legal restructuring before making a move. Is that -- do you have that clarity now? Or did you just decide to go ahead and then announce the program now and then you will eventually get this legal restructuring done? Ronald T. Hundzinski: Yes. So we've been, for the last 2 years, working on a legal restructuring program. And as we come into 2015, we do now have complete clarity that we're going to be able to execute and finalize this program in 2015. So yes, that came into the decision. Emmanuel Rosner - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division : Okay, perfect. And then one final one for me. Just wanted to speak about the topic of diesel. We've seen some, I guess, pressure on the diesel mix in Europe as well as Western countries, making some efforts to sort of, in fact, maybe reduce the diesel penetration at the government level. I wanted to ask you, can you please just go over the math of what impact it has on you when, I guess, with equal purchase the oil produced, I guess, is gas versus diesel oil, specifically in Europe if possible? James R. Verrier: Yes, Emmanuel, this is James. I would say our view, which we talked about in Detroit also, was we see over the next year or 2 there may be some slight erosion in terms of diesel share versus gas in Europe, primarily. We don't see a big shift change. We do see a couple of percentage points it may move. That generally won't move the needle meaningfully for BorgWarner because we have pretty good content on gas as well as diesel. If you break it down into more detail, in the short run, we'll probably have a little more benefit from diesel. But over the next 2, 3, 4 years, that's going to balance out as we see more and more of our technologies getting adopted onto gasoline vehicles. And therefore, those shifts will become neutral for BorgWarner over the next 2 or 3 years. So not a big deal for us is the quick summary, Emmanuel. Operator : All right. Your next question comes from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Ryan J. Brinkman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : I think a lot has been answered, but maybe just going back to the backlog call in November. Remember when you moved from a single-point estimate to a range. Obviously, it's very early in 2015, but a few months have passed since then. I'm curious if you have any insight into whether you might be tracking in more toward the higher or lower end of that range. $850 million to $950 million so, for example, for 2015, let's say. Kenneth Lamb : Yes, that range is fully represented in our guidance. And you may actually do the math on the guidance, and it pretty closely ties to $850 million at the low end and $950 million at the high end. And as you know, we haven't really had a change since that initial guidance was given. So I think that's a very long way of saying we haven't really given any sort of guidance as where we're falling within that range as of yet. What we did say today was we feel very comfortable about the organic growth of this business. And that range, we're still very comfortable with. Ryan J. Brinkman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Okay. That's great. And then with the repurchase announcement, I mean, we had expected that you would buy back almost that amount of stock, but maybe that the announcement might come a little bit later. Does this mean that you had made a little bit more progress than you earlier thought when you had that dinner last year about repatriating cash from overseas? Is that process been going well or is that not necessarily related like we thought maybe it would be through an announcement. Ronald T. Hundzinski: Yes, I would say that when we talked about it last summer, we had a plan and we're on track on that plan. And a good thing happens as we got into this year and we kept on track, our confidence level was enhanced, right, whereby we're comfortable making the decision of making an announcement of the buyback. So we stayed on track, the confidence was gained and then we thought that the announcement was appropriate this time. Ryan J. Brinkman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Okay. And then your response to an earlier question about how consumers are changing their behaviors as a result of lower gas prices. It was really interesting, really helpful and I understand you got some all-wheel drive stuff that benefit from CDs and stuff. And it was touched on what could happen with CAFE standards, but maybe if you could just revisit that in a little bit greater depth. There's this potential, I guess, medium term review, but it's very soft review. Can you just kind of maybe describe the process? I'm sure you're more familiar with it than we are or the investors are. And Ford made a comment at the Detroit Auto Show saying something's got to give here. We agreed to this stuff, not that they had a whole lot of choice in agreeing to it, when gas was substantially higher. And they're even saying that like if the government doesn't relent somewhat, then maybe people won't buy as many vehicles, and the new vehicles are more efficient than the old vehicles or it could be counterproductive and they want to talk with them. So I'm just curious if you had any sort of better insight than us into how the process might play out in 2017 or what the rules are or whatnot. James R. Verrier: Sure. James here, Ryan. So the way I think about it is that midterm review, it's part of the process. It's part of the scheduled review. And I think I'm going to go through that meaningful review as planned. I think that'll play out. Our view, as we sit here and talk to a lot of different people, is we're not anticipating or envisaging any significant change in the CAFE standards. That doesn't mean there may not be minor tweaks in language or numbers, but I don't think there's going to be anything materially moving, from our viewpoint, around CAFE standards. Let me maybe just give you one example of why you think that. When you look at the development cycle for, particularly powertrain type product transmission or an engine, that splits along -- that's a long gestation period of 2, 3 or 4 years to get that technology ready to go. And those programs often have a 7- to 10-year life. So -- and those are very, very capital-intensive, big investments that are made. So all of that stuff that's been going on, that's all being put into the works. And I -- based on that, I just don't -- I don't think that's going to be a meaningful shift. So I think it'll -- I think I'll go through the process as outlined, as you articulated. But I don't see any meaningful change or difference to the OE strategies and, therefore, the BorgWarner strategies. Operator : Your next question comes from Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets. Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Ron, just to follow up on the tax repatriation strategy which is helpful color. I mean, who knows what will happen with Obama's recent proposal, but if something along those lines does go through, will that throw off your current strategy or change your thinking at all? Ronald T. Hundzinski: Joe, a couple of years ago we were hoping for some sort of tax reform, and we didn't get it. I'd say that we just have to stay with our plan and if anything happens then, it's a benefit that will be great for everybody. But at the end of the day, you have to run your business and execute your plan, and that's the path I'm on. Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Okay. And then maybe just -- well, one more quick one on -- I appreciate the $4 million to $5 million hit that you talked about in powertrain, and that will be -- continue to be lumpy. That does seem to be maybe a little bit towards the higher end. So is it fair to say that $4 million to $5 million is higher on a lumpy scale? Ronald T. Hundzinski: No, because I don't have absolute knowledge of they're going to be going forward. All I can tell you is that given the stuff we saw in the fourth quarter, it is that amount of money and as -- Ken did a good job as well saying that we have a start-up in China. That's a different issue, and then you've got relocation in Eastern Europe, which is actually a different issue. The reason I say that is the start-up has a planned cost base in there and we're getting ready for sales and shipments. So that's a little bit more predictable. Now the European structure side of it is a little more unpredictable because they're moving equipment and you're getting inefficiencies and then you may get efficiencies and they may come across something that's not working well. So one is a little bit more predictable and one is less predictable. Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Okay. And then just real quick on equity income, which is down a little bit. I'm assuming that you had some FX hit in there? Is that fair and is it is possible to quantify? Ronald T. Hundzinski: [indiscernible] That's a good question. I'm surprised that no one really asked that earlier, and you're absolutely right. It was FX related for the quarter or translation. I want to be more specific, translational currency effects in there, yes. Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : All right. Is it possible to sort of give an indication of what that venture is doing organically? Ronald T. Hundzinski: I would say that we have 2 major joint ventures there. One is in India that's been -- very good performance. And this K1 that ships into China. So the performance over there has been very good as well. Operator : We have time for one final question, and that question comes from Itay Michaeli with Citi. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : So I just want to go back to the raw material incremental margin discussion. Ron, can you just remind us what percentage of your raw material buy is passed through? And how should we think about the impact on incremental margins? So I would think that even for the pass-through element as raw materials decline and you kind of get back pass-through lower revenue, will that optically help the incremental module for you in 2015? Ronald T. Hundzinski: Itay, there's a lot of commodities involved and a lot of timing differences to put a simple analysis around what you're trying to do. I know logically what you're trying to get at and there is a calculation but it's much, much more complex to make it that simple. But what I would say is that over a period of time, there -- the shift and those timings are not material to our business where it would affect incremental margins significantly on BorgWarner. I can say that, okay? Maybe in other businesses, it can. We're too large of an organization with a lot of different commodities to have any significant impact on our total numbers. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Great. That's helpful. And then just a big picture, a product development question. You launched a lot of product recently, particularly on electrified vehicles, both for stop/start and others. So just a question, just an update on how things are going there in terms of both developing product, going to market and your discussions with automakers as you pursue some of these new products that you have. James R. Verrier: Yes, Itay, the thrust, if you wish, around continued electrification focus for BorgWarner particularly remains strong and we've seen over recent years product, specifically enabling and supporting stop/start type of technologies, just to name a couple. And we continue to be very engaged with the automakers on the electrification of our current products, as an example. But also, as we see the evolution towards different forms of hybrid and 48-volt architectures that, that's leading to enhanced product opportunities for us. A quick example there would be different forms of electrical turbochargers would be an example. And then in the pure battery electric vehicle space, we've participated there and we anticipate playing in that space as we go forward, too. So in other words, saying it is, electrification absolutely is a content-add growth opportunity for BorgWarner and we're seeing more and more of that play out both through our organic actions and also as we look to acquisitions as well. I think it will be complementary as we look forward. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : James, and then just back on the midterm review. Yes, it was my understanding, just wondering if you have the same understanding that the review really is for the 2022 to 2025 time frame and not before that. So if there are any changes in the next few years, that's really the period in focus. Is that your understanding as well? Or is there some flexibility in terms of if there are changes made maybe affecting regulations prior to that? James R. Verrier: No, I'm sure pretty much of a similar view that you talked. We may both be wrong but, I guess, we're at least having a similar view there. That's my interpretation. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Great. And just lastly, just a clarification. If the company's leverage target, Ron, still in that 15% to 30% net debt-to-capital or has that changed at all? Ronald T. Hundzinski: No, no change. That is our target. Kenneth Lamb : Thank you, Itay. And I'd like to thank all of you for joining us. We expect to file our 10-K before the end of the day, which will provide details of our results. If you have any follow-up questions about our earnings release, the matters discussed during this call or our 10-K, please direct them to me. Melissa, please close up the call. Operator : That does conclude the BorgWarner 2014 Fourth Quarter and Full Year Results Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect.",

Hughes - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division Ryan J. Brinkman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division Operator : Good morning. My name is Melissa, and I will be your conference facilitator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BorgWarner 2015 First Quarter Results Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Ken Lamb, VP of Investor Relations. Mr. Lamb, you may begin your conference. Kenneth Lamb : Thanks, Melissa. Good morning, and thank you, all, for joining us. We issued our earnings release this morning at around 8 a.m. Eastern Time. It's posted on our website, borgwarner.com, on our Investor Relations home page. A replay of today's conference call will be available through May 8, also on our website. The dial-in number for that replay is (800) 585-8367. You'll need the conference ID, which is 17762917. With regard to our Investor Relations calendar, we will be attending the following conferences between now and our next earnings release : May 1, we will be at the Wells Fargo Industrials Conference in New York; May 19, we will be at the Barclays America Select Conference in London; May 27, we'll be at the KeyBanc Automotive Industrial and Transportation Conference in Boston; and June 3, we'll be at the Deutsche Bank Industrials Conference in Chicago. Before we begin, I need to inform you that during this call, we may make forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties as detailed in our 10-K. Our actual results may differ significantly from the matters discussed today. Now moving on to our results. James Verrier, President and CEO, will review highlights of our quarterly operating results as well as some of our recent noteworthy accomplishments. And then Ron Hundzinski, our CFO, will discuss the details of our quarterly results. With that, I'll turn it over to James. James R. Verrier: Thank you, Ken, and good day to everybody. Ron and I are very pleased to review. [Audio Gap] thank our employees around the world for another outstanding quarter. Your efforts drove outstanding results that help us to continue to lead our industry. Now onto our results. So during the first quarter, reported sales were just under $2 billion. That's about down 5% from a year ago, but it's up 3% when we exclude the impact of foreign currencies and the Wahler acquisition. Our growth in the quarter was below our normal high levels due to a few discrete items that I'll discuss in the segment review. Our U.S. GAAP earnings were $0.79 per share or $0.78 per share, excluding nonrecurring charges. Our operating income margin, again excluding nonrecurring charges, was an impressive 13.1% in the quarter. So considering our lower-than-normal growth quarter and some of the restructuring efficiencies and the new plants and plant expansions that we're managing this year, this is outstanding performance by our operations. Let me take a look at the 2 segments. In the Engine segment, first quarter sales were about $1.4 billion, which is down 2% from a year ago. But again, when we exclude the impact of foreign currencies and Wahler, the segment grew at 6%. These results were primarily led by strong turbo sales around the world, which was partially offset by some unfavorable mix of light vehicle production in North America. And we believe this is a temporary issue and should not impact our full year growth expectations. In the Drivetrain segment, sales of $611 million, which is down 10% from a year ago or down 2% when we exclude foreign currencies. The decline in sales for Drivetrain was related to unfavorable mix of light vehicle production in North America and also some launch delays in Asia. I'm very confident, though, for 2015 this will be a good year for Drivetrain. We expect Drivetrain to grow organically in 2015, and the restructuring work that's underway will position the business for strong growth and margin expansion in 2016 and beyond. [Audio Gap] our restructuring and expansion plans designed to improve our long-term performance. Our financial strength and strong performance is based on our ability to anticipate and drive the next technology [Audio Gap] BorgWarner continues to invest for the long term. Capital spending continues to grow. We spent about 7% of sales on capital in the first quarter, which is above our long-term target of 6%. Typically, our capital spending is primarily for machinery and new equipment. However, with our strong high single to low double-digit growth rate over the next several years, it requires investments in new plants and plant expansions, which is driving some elevated spending in the near term. We expect this to continue through the end of 2015, after which we should return to our more normal spending levels. Our investment in R&D was just under 4% of sales in the quarter, which is in line with our target for the year. The intensity around organic innovation and product development remains very strong. I'm also proud to share some of the exciting announcements that we made during the last few months. Just last week, BorgWarner received the 2015 Automotive News PACE Award for its front cross differential or FXD technology. The PACE Awards acknowledge automotive suppliers for superior innovation, technological advancement and business performance. We're very proud to receive this prestigious award this year, and that is our 15th PACE Award since 2005. The company received Supplier Awards from FCA, Toyota and Honda Japan within the last few months. And we're very appreciative of the strong relationships we have with our customers, and these acknowledgments are very important to us. The company has recently announced expanded manufacturing capacity for emissions technologies in China, Mexico and South Korea. The emissions business is gaining momentum globally and is a critical part of our growth going forward. Products produced at the newly expanded facilities include ignition products, EGR modules, valves and coolers, variable force solenoids, diesel cold-start technologies and coolant control valves. BorgWarner also supplies its GenV electro-hydraulically actuated all-wheel drive coupling for BMW's first ever front-wheel-drive vehicle, the all-new 2 Series Active Tourer. And we also announced that we are supplying VTG turbochargers for 2 newly developed 1.4 three-cylinder diesel engines from the Volkswagen Group. Both engines comply with Euro 6 emission standards and improve fuel economy up to 21% compared with the predecessor vehicles. Now I'll provide a brief overview of our updated guidance for 2015. Sales growth in 2015 is expected to be between minus 4% and 0, which is down from 2% to 6% previously. The change in sales growth guidance is entirely related to weakened foreign currencies that Ron will discuss later. Now excluding currency, our sales growth is still expected to be 9.5% to 12%, unchanged from our previous guidance. We now expect earnings to be within a range of $3.10 to $3.30 per diluted share, which is down from $3.35 to $3.55 per diluted share. Again, nearly all of this change is related to foreign currencies. And again, Ron will provide a little more detail later. And our operating margin is still expected to be above 13%. So I'm very encouraged by our outlook for the rest of the year. 2015 should be another fantastic year for BorgWarner, and the restructuring and expansion activities are a clear transition to even stronger performance in 2016 and beyond. As we look ahead, the industry's continued adoption of our leading-edge powertrain technology combined with operational excellence are the primary reasons we have been, we still are and we will continue to be the leading auto supplier in terms of growth and operating performance. So now with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ron. Ronald T. Hundzinski: Thank you, James, and good day, everyone. Before I begin reviewing the financials, I would like to also commend all of our employees for their hard work and congratulate them on a great quarter. Now on to our financials. James already provided a detailed review of our sales performance in the quarter. In summary, sales were down 5% from a year ago or up 3%, excluding the impact of foreign currency and the Wahler acquisition. Working down the income statement. Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 21.6% in the quarter, up 20 basis points from 21.4% a year ago. During the same period, SG&A as a percentage of sales was 8.5%, also up 20 basis points from a year ago. R&D spending, which is included in SG&A, was at 3.8% of sales in the quarter. Operating income in the quarter was $216 million. Excluding $12 million restructuring charges and an $11 million gain related to a buyout of a joint venture partner, operating income was $261 million or 13.1% of sales. Excluding restructuring charges taken in the quarter of 2014, this is in line with the same period a year ago. Excluding the nonrecurring items previously discussed as well as the impact of foreign currency and the Wahler acquisition, our year-over-year incremental margin was about 25%, well above our long-term mid-teens incremental margin target. Very strong performance considering the cost of 2 new plants in China, several other plant expansions and restructuring related inefficiencies in both segments. Note that our new plants in China will be up and running and the Drivetrain restructuring will be completed by the beginning of 2016. Both should boost our performance. As you look further down the income statement, equity and affiliate earnings was about $9 million in the quarter, in line with last year. This represents the performance of NSK-Warner, our 50-50 joint venture in Japan, which sells transmission components to our Japanese customers in Japan and China, as well as TEL, our turbocharger joint venture in India. Interest expense and finance charges were $10 million in the quarter, up slightly from a year ago. Provision for income taxes in the quarter on a reported basis was $72 million. However, this included a $4 million benefit from the restructuring charge and other tax adjustments. Excluding the benefit, the provision for income taxes was $76 million, which is an effective tax rate of about 29% in the quarter. Our estimated effective tax rate for the full year is approximately 29%. Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest were just under $9 million in the quarter, up from $8 million in the first quarter [Audio Gap] partner's share in the earnings performance of our Korean and Chinese consolidated joint ventures. That brings us back to net earnings, which were $179 million in the quarter. Excluding nonrecurring items, net earnings were $177 million or $0.78 per share, our outstanding performance for the company. Note that weaker foreign currencies lowered earnings by about $0.09 per share in the quarter. Now let's take a closer look at operating segments in the quarter. As James said earlier, reported Engine segment sales were just under $1.4 billion in the quarter. Excluding currency and Wahler, Engine segment sales growth was 6% compared to same period a year ago. On a reported basis, adjusted EBIT for the Engine segment was 16.7% of sales. Excluding currency and Wahler, adjusted EBIT for the Engine segment was 17.1% of sales, up 70 basis points from 16.4% reported a year ago. Excluding currency and Wahler, the Engine segment's year-over-year incremental margin was 29%, excellent performance for the Engine segment. The restructuring plan for Wahler is on target. The remaining charges will be recorded over the next 2 years or so, after which Wahler is expected to be a double-digit margin business. In the Drivetrain segment, reported sales were about $611 million in the quarter. Excluding currency, sales declined about 2% compared with the same period a year ago. Similar in the past 2 quarters, Drivetrain was impacted by a planned slow ramp-up of a major program by a North American customer in the quarter. We expect the volumes for this program to return to normal levels by the second half of 2015. On a reported basis, adjusted EBIT was 11.6% of sales. Excluding currency, adjusted EBIT was 11.3% of sales. Excluding currency, the Drivetrain segment's year-over-year decremental margin was 36% in the first quarter. To keep this in perspective, Drivetrain lost $5 million of adjusted EBIT on a $15 million decline in sales. That means the segment was only $2 million shy of our target decremental margin of 20%. Please note that the Drivetrain is managing through a cost associated with our new DCT component plant in Taicang, China and restructuring-related inefficiencies. The Drivetrain restructuring plan is also on target with regard to both timing and cost. We still expect to have the relocations completed by the end of 2015, after which, Drivetrain will be in a much better competitive position in Europe. Not let's take a look at our balance sheet and cash flow. We generated $33 million of net cash from operating activities in the first quarter of 2015, down slightly from $46 million a year ago. The decrease was primarily related to lower net earnings due to weaker foreign currencies. Capital spending was $140 million in the quarter, up $14 million from a year ago. The increase was driven by capital required to support our strong backlog of new net business. Free cash flow, which we define as net cash from operating activities less capital spending, was an outflow of $107 million in the quarter, which is typical seasonal occurrence for us. Our investment in working capital ramps up in the first quarter to match higher levels of business activity compared with the end of the year. Looking at the balance sheet itself. Balance sheet debt increased by $498 million at the end of the first quarter compared to 2015 -- '14. Cash increased by $238 million during the same period. The $260 million increase in net debt was primarily due to capital expenditures, a dividend payment to our shareholders and share repurchases. Our net debt-to-capital ratio was 18.4% at the end of the first quarter 2015, up from 12.8% at the end of 2014. Net debt-to-EBITDA at the end of the year on a trailing 12-month basis was 0.6. Our capital structure remains in excellent shape. Now I'd like to discuss our updated guidance for 2015. James reviewed our guidance to the high level, I'll discuss some of the finer points. We expect sales growth of a negative 4% to 0, which is down from 2% to 6% previously. As James mentioned earlier, the change in sales growth guidance is entirely related to weakening foreign currencies. Our full year dollar-to-euro exchange rate assumption is now between $1.05 to $1.10, down from $1.20 previously. We also have lowered our exchange rate assumptions for several other currencies, including the Brazilian real, Japanese yen, the Korea won, Mexican peso and the Swedish kroner. The impact of these new assumptions translates to approximately $500 million less in revenue this year. Excluding currency, our sales growth is still expected to be 9.5% to 12%, which is unchanged from our previous guidance. We now expect EPS within a range of $3.10 to $3.30 per diluted share in 2015, down from $3.35 to $3.55 per diluted share previously. This change in EPS guidance is also heavily influenced by currency, but includes additional interest expense from our $1 billion bond offering. Of the $0.25 change in EPS guidance, $0.20 is related to currency and $0.05 is related to the net impact of higher interest expense, offset by share repurchases. We expect our share repurchase program to gain momentum over the remainder of the year. Our operating income margin guidance is unchanged, which is above 13%, which implies a mid-teens incremental margin, excluding noncomparables in line with our long-term target. In conclusion, we continue to be confident in our ability to execute in any market. This company has demonstrated a heightened focus on efficiency and cost. This focus resulted -- results in highly efficient growth, record margins in each of the last 4 years. With our strong organic growth and operations performing at a very high level, 2015 should be another great year for BorgWarner. As we look beyond 2015, we intend to execute our growth plan, yielding high single to low double-digit growth and to efficiently convert our sales growth to profits. The future is bright for BorgWarner. With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Ken. Kenneth Lamb : Thanks, Ron. Now let's move to the Q&A portion of the call. Melissa, could you please remind everyone of the Q&A procedure? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities. Richard Michael Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Ron, on the Drivetrain, so should we think of the delta on the decremental, the $5 million decline in operating income typically would be $3 million at delta $2 million? Is that the inefficiency? Should we assume that? Or is there other stuff going on there? Ronald T. Hundzinski: That's a good assumption, Rich. But I would also say that in the Drivetrain itself, the inefficiencies are probably actually running a bit higher in that, the number you just gave out, okay? Richard Michael Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Okay. And then for the balance of the year, I know there's some moving parts, but how are you -- what do you have embedded in the guidance in terms of inefficiencies as we move through the last 3 quarters of the year? Ronald T. Hundzinski: So let me disqualify, when I say efficiencies, there's 2 things in Drivetrain. There's a couple of startups and there's inefficiencies. So I want to make sure I distinguish between those 2. The inefficiencies are going to take us through this year, and that was the relocation of Western European plants to Eastern Europe. But what I'd also like to point out is that in the Drivetrain, we still have a DCT plant being launched in China that's going to take us through the rest of the year. So the answer to your question is the inefficiencies should get better, but the drag on the startup of the plant in China should continue throughout the year. So long and short of it is we're going to see this headwind for a little while yet. Richard Michael Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Okay. But it sounds like net-net, it should get a little less as we move into the second half. Ronald T. Hundzinski: Yes. Right. Richard Michael Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Okay. And then, James, there is a comment around a pushout of some programs in Drivetrain in Asia. Is that related to DCT? And then if you take a step back and look at the adoption rates in quoting activity around DCT in Asia, is there any change? James R. Verrier: Yes, I would say, Rich, from a -- first of all, from a quoting activity on DCT remains very strong and good, primarily up in China or in Europe. So we're not seeing any shift or slowdown in quoting activity and even win rates for BorgWarner. So that remains very healthy. The little bit of the launch delay, a little part of it is DCT, but the majority of it is related to other TorqTransfer and transmission products. But I just want to stretch something for the call, it's not a BorgWarner-related issue, just to put that out there, for the -- if that gives you a bit of help, Rich. Richard Michael Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Okay, great. And then, Ron, real quick on commodities, last quarter or when you gave the initial guidance, you assumed that commodities -- I don't think you assumed that there was going to be any benefit. Is that still the assumption for the year? Ronald T. Hundzinski: Not anything material. So it's the same assumption, Rich. Operator : Your next question comes from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : So you guys kept your second year revenue guidance unchanged, and that's still a pretty impressive level. But can you confirm that you're not seeing -- or are you seeing any shift in OEM bake[ph] rates or program launches related to fuel efficiency from where gas prices are? And the flip side of that, are you seeing any uptick in Drivetrain-related cost? James R. Verrier: Ravi, let me take a shot at that. First of all, I appreciate your acknowledgment and recognition of that strong growth, and we feel good about it, too. And as we've outlined, we still feel good about that. The way I would articulate it is, Ravi, during the year, you'll always get little shifts, little mix shifts between whether it's cars and trucks in North America and other such things. But when you get all the puts and takes together, our sense is we're still comfortable with our full year projection of that 9.5% to 12% growth when you strip out currency. But no real significant shifts, Ravi, is what I would say to you in terms of -- in some of your specific points. Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Got it. And the thing with the guidance here, the mark-to-market and FX is, of course, completely understandable. But we are seeing a stronger-than-expected production run rate in Europe. The SAR in the U.S. continues to be pretty robust. Is your -- I believe your underlying industry growth assumption back in Detroit was 1% or 2% or something. Is there room to pick that up? And is that already embedded in the new guidance? James R. Verrier: Ravi, what I would say and I think what you -- how I would articulate it is the fact that we're reaffirming our full year view from what we gave out in January, I think, it's an indication that our overall macro assumptions haven't changed materially. I mean, I think you can point to unique specifics in different parts of the world or different programs, customers and countries, but at a high level, nothing major has moved in the quarter. And that's why we're holding the revenue guidance where it is. Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Okay. And just finally, Ron, the follow-up from Rich's question earlier. If you were to adjust Drivetrain margins this quarter for all the efficiencies, all the -- the China launch and the F-150 delays, what would the margin have been this quarter? Ronald T. Hundzinski: What I would say, Ravi, I'd have to do the calculation on the margin, but what I would say is that we lost $5 million. And I'd say we'd be nearly breakeven, maybe. So I don't want -- I'd have to do the math there, but we'd be, probably would've been breakeven on $15 million down in sales. Operator : Your next question comes from Brett Hoselton with KeyBanc Capital. Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : Let's see. First of all, your underlying sales expectations for the full year, 9.5% to 12% growth, is that pretty much comparable to the 3% number you did in the first quarter apples-to-apples and therefore, obviously implies an acceleration as you move through the remainder of the year? Or is Wahler kind of factored into the -- or I mean, are there some other things factored into the 3%? James R. Verrier: Brett, let me take a shot first and maybe Ken and I will add a little detail. What that implies is Q2, Q3 and Q4 are going to run stronger than Q1, which we're comfortable with. And a couple of those items that both Ron and I alluded to, specifically the North American customer, which we outlined, is a contributing factor to that. So, yes, we're going to run stronger in 2, 3 and 4 than we did in 1. And based on all what we know right now, we're very comfortable with that. Ken, you might want to... Kenneth Lamb : Yes. I'll add just this one thing. James alluded to the North American program also gaining steam over the rest of the year. Also the issues in Asia, the pushouts, we're expected to recover those in the back half of the year as well. So all of that together pretty much implies that this is a timing issue more than anything is kind of really the message. Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : Yes. The North American comment obviously relates to, well, the F-150. But the delays in Asia, what is that in regards to? Kenneth Lamb : Well, James had talked about some Drivetrain-specific issues and that none of them were really BorgWarner-specific, just a change in timing with our customers on the ramp-up of these programs. So a little bit slower in the first quarter, but picking up as the year goes forward. Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : Okay. And then, Ron, your comment about kind of the mid-teens incremental margin in 2015. Obviously, that's an excluding FX comment. Is it also an excluding M&A comment? In other words, Wahler? Ronald T. Hundzinski: Yes. Excludes -- this is on a comparable basis, which would exclude foreign currency. But actually as you go forward, Wahler falls out, right? Because we had it in last year's numbers, so that won't be as much of an issue going forward. Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : Okay. And then finally, did you repurchase any stock in the quarter? I didn't see any comment along those lines. Ronald T. Hundzinski: Yes, we did, 650 some thousand shares, I think it was, $38 million or something. Operator : Your next question comes from Patrick Archambault with Goldman Sachs. Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Just on the F-150 question. Can you -- I get the production cadence and that's come up a number of times this earnings seasons. But is it -- how do we think about the content opportunity there? Is there much different on the powertrain side? I think there was only maybe one new configuration, but I could be wrong about that. So just wanted to see if there was anything different or it's just really the volume piece that's the big teller [ph] . Kenneth Lamb : I think you said it well there at the end, Pat. The content opportunity doesn't really change for us as you go from the previous version to the current. It's really just the ramp-up and the volumes that are significantly different this year than compared to what they were last year. Last year was very strong in the first half, weaker in the second half, and it should be just the opposite this year. Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Okay. And then one question. I think the R&D number that you gave out, I had it written down, but it was like 3 -- sort of mid-3% range. Kenneth Lamb : 3.8%. Ronald T. Hundzinski: 3.8%. Right. Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Yes. I mean, that's lower than what you guys have traditionally done. Is there just a seasonality to that spend? Or is it something you're dialing back a bit as you're digesting some of these other elevated expenses? How should we think about that? Ronald T. Hundzinski: Pat, I can tell you one thing, we are not dialing back. That's one point I want to make. The other point is maybe there's some seasonality because it's pretty comparable to the last year. But other thing that is also embedded in there, and I don't want to go into all the numbers, but there is some FX issues that -- a lot of our engineering is outside the U.S. So you're getting some FX noise in there. And in fact, I think if you right-size that, Ken, wasn't it actually was about 4 or 4%. I think about 20 basis points impact of FX on it. So it's sort of a distorted number, I don't want to go into those details, but we're not dialing back at all. Not at all. Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Okay. That's helpful. And then just, I guess, building up on the Drivetrain question. The rebound that you have there. I guess, just wanted to dig into that a little bit more, like how -- because you didn't change your guidance for that, right? So it is fully assumed that it's coming back. How good is the visibility on those products? I mean, I take it that you kind of see the order book and the backlog, but just wanted to hear more on that. Kenneth Lamb : I think, you said that pretty well. Our expectations for the full year haven't changed. So all that has played out so far is kind of what we expected. We expected this large North American program to be slow in the first half and pick up in the second half in a pretty meaningful way. I would say, the only thing that was really a bit of a timing issue that was probably not big then was the first quarter was a little bit -- we're just a little bit off pace from where we thought we would be at this time of the year. But we fully expect that to come back into quarters, 2, 3 and 4. Operator : Your next question comes from Brian Johnson from Barclays. Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Research Division : A couple questions. More of a housekeeping guidance question and then into sort of a broader strategic question. Do you have any visibility yet into incremental margins for '16 over '15? You talked about they could be a step function higher in '16. How are the puts and takes shaking out? Ronald T. Hundzinski: Well, Brian, we have some of these headwinds as far as inefficiencies and restructuring. We have some plant startups. So I would say that at '16, we go into '16 and I would anticipate, I guess, a tailwind in incremental margins from where I sit today. I mean, it's still long ways off, but I think that's possible. Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Okay. The second is a broader question. Yesterday, in a kind of well-followed controversial call, Sergio Marchionne, Fiat Chrysler, made a case that ROICs for auto OEMs were low, margins were low. You probably hear that from your customers all the time when they compare it to your good margins in ROIC. And secondly, that there was a lot of redundant R&D and CapEx across the OEMs, in particular about 20% of vehicle development costs in powertrain. And you would argue and he would argue, in the mass market, V sedan market who really cares about the engine. So I guess, the question is, is this going to be an opportunity at all, mid-term, for you guys to step up and actually kind of move to what I might call the Apple model? Where they're not making their chips, they're not assembling their cars. You're providing engine and transmission components, but you're not providing engines and transmissions. Any possibility at all the industry could move in a direction that would make it more like other modern industries in terms of the value chain and, hence, perhaps offer better opportunities for all players? James R. Verrier: Let me try and take a shot, Brian. I actually didn't read the details of his commentary. I saw the headline. My take and you kind of touched on this is, we somewhat control what we can from a BorgWarner perspective. And as you alluded to, we feel very positive about where we're running from an ROIC point of view and from a margin perspective. And I would just point out, I think that's -- what we feel about that is that, that's the financial discipline, I think, we like to operate with the company in terms of capital utilization. So I can only look at that perspective from our viewpoint, and I'm very happy with where we're at. Your broader question. The way I would look at it and the way we think about it is I think there is going to continue to be more and more technology applied to the powertrain over the next decade or more. And I see that the BorgWarner's of the world having opportunity to bring additional system capability and content capability. And whether that be around additional content through electrification or even a broader system package, if that makes sense to you, I do see -- I see those as opportunistic -- opportune growth plans for BorgWarner. Yes. Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Research Division : But any possibility of moving all the way where an engine becomes modularized, common across different OEMs, so it can be plugged into a car, much as a Qualcomm chip goes into a smartphone? James R. Verrier: I mean, honestly, I don't know, Brian. But I will tell you, today, you see opportunities where there are shared engine capacity or engine platforms across OEMs. We participated in that, and it's been successful. Do I see more of that looking forward? I don't really know at this stage, Brian. But I've seen that model work, whether it's been shared capacity on engine development and a modular engine program across 2 OEMs, and it's been successful. And we've participated in that. Kenneth Lamb : I want to add one thing to that Brian. While James is making those comments, we also continue to see, as he said earlier, increased technology in the powertrain. We don't see the engine becoming a clotty [ph] in any way. We still see there's an awful lot of opportunity for improvement in the performance of the engine. And we are going to be a valuable partner to our customers in that regard. Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Yes. I was more getting at less maybe a commodity and more -- there's lot of innovation in smartphone chips, but that doesn't mean each of the smartphone makers is manufacturing its own separate chip. James R. Verrier: Yes. Kenneth Lamb : Right, right. Operator : Your next question comes from Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : A couple questions. One is just wanting to confirm. You did give us a helpful impact just from the FX. It looks like $0.20, and calibrated to maybe $64 million and like a 13% margin on the $500 million impact from FX. Is that what we should be thinking about going forward? Is it just basically translation? Or is there also transactional sensitivity as currencies continue to move? Ronald T. Hundzinski: So Rod, you're absolutely right. It's translational. And at a high level, it's roughly equal to our operating margin is the impact both ways on average. So that's correct. I'd like to respond on the transactional side. We do see transactional, but it's not material. Not to say we don't see it, we do. But net-net, it ends up being not that material for us. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Okay. And on this F-150 mix issue, got to check the numbers, but wasn't that an equivalent headwind for you in the fourth quarter? You actually had 6% organic growth in the fourth quarter. Are you basically saying that you're not seeing any other mix headwinds in diesel or any other place? And can you give us a sense of kind of maybe high level the kind of organic growth that you would expect in the second quarter as the Kansas City plant is starting to ramp-up now? James R. Verrier: Rod, specifically, for the first quarter, as we talked about, the significant piece obviously, as you outlined, is the large American platform we talked about. But we also -- the other aspect was a little bit of the launch issue -- issues in Asia that were also playing into that a little bit and a little bit of mix in the quarter, which is basically car truck mix in North America as well. So those were the kind of the components that impacted it. As we look forward, Rod, what's holding our guidance, as you know, from a revenue point of view, so that implies that we're going to be stepping up to more normalized growth levels in Q2, 3 and 4. And we're comfortable with that for sure. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : I guess, I'm just asking your -- I want to say that F-150 was down 40% in the fourth quarter and 40% in the first quarter. So it doesn't look like the headwind is greater. Are there other factors? I would think that truck -- car truck mix would actually be a favorable thing that you're seeing increasingly at this point. Kenneth Lamb : Well, specifically, the programs in Asia that James is talking about is the main delta from Q4 to Q1. So we talked about those additional launches that were happening in the first quarter that are ramping slower than we thought. That's kind of the main delta. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Okay. Can you give us an idea of the ramp from here in terms of the organic growth? There are some pretty big programs that are going to start kicking in again, as we look at the Q2 maybe. Kenneth Lamb : Well, you and I can work on that offline. But obviously, the full year organic growth number is still intact, so you can kind of back into it, we think the rest of the year should be. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Okay. And just lastly, I guess, this has been asked a couple times, but there are a number of unusual headwinds that you're absorbing this year that should go away. And presumably, that's going to help your incrementals into next year. There are also potentially some commodity tailwinds that become increasingly favorable as we look out to next year, just because some things are locked under contracts and commodities have been declining. Can you just put any parameters at all on how we should be thinking about that there's something else kicking into next year that we should be thinking about when we adjust your normal incremental margins? James R. Verrier: I think, Rod, you kind of hit most of the highlights. We're going through a lot of restructuring efforts in Drivetrain, and that is going to settle down. The other one that's not explicitly been mentioned in the call that I think helps with the transition with Wahler, we talked about that, the entry point there was that low single-digit margin. And we expect to be moving that up. So there's certainly more, as Ron alluded to earlier, certainly more tailwinds than headwinds as we look forward to the setup in '16. But obviously, we're also heavily focused on '15 and very pleased with where we're heading in '15 as well. But generally, more tailwinds. And I think as the year rolls out, Rod, we'll probably give more color on what we can -- how that translates into incremental margins for '16. But I think it's setting up well. Operator : Your next question comes from John Murphy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Just a follow-up on the F-150, just to beat a dead horse here. I mean, obviously, there's some pressure that's in the Drivetrain segment, but also given your content on the engine there, there's a little bit of pressure there as well. Just curious, as you see the -- those lines ramp in the second quarter and real more materially in the third and fourth, I mean, will you get a boost in the engine segment? Because the engine segment margins are still very strong right now, it doesn't seem to be suffering from pressure much, if at all, on the sales or margin line. So just curious, is there a drag in the Engine segment as well and will we see that same recovery in the second half? Ronald T. Hundzinski: Yes, John. So, let's talk about that vehicle that Rich was mentioning here. The content on it that we have is on an EcoBoost engine, we have turbos. Turbos fall under the Engine. We also have timing systems on that engine. So that's also under Engine. And then really, we have transfer cases if a four-wheel-drive option was selected, which impacts the Drivetrain. So yes, the volume reduction we see on that vehicle right now is impacting the Engine segment. But the Engine segment is a lot larger, so it's not as material as it is to the Drivetrain segment. John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Okay. Very helpful. And second, on mix. I mean, obviously, there's some stuff that's going on with the German lux manufacturers in China, where that market is relatively a little bit weaker for them, and the U.S. seems to be picking up and Europe is a little bit better. Is there anything that's going on with mix, given those different end markets that those vehicles are ending up in for you? Or you're not seeing any change with German lux manufacturers at this point? James R. Verrier: Actually, John, no -- from that perspective, no impact for us. We continue to see very strong growth in China, both domestically-produced and then imported-from-Europe product. That's all very, actually, helpful for us. And so no, no negative impact at all on the luxury stuff for us. It's been good, good and as kind of expected, John, is the way I would say. John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Okay. And then just lastly, I mean, as we think about the share buybacks and the stock being down almost 4% today, would you consider getting a lot more aggressive with the share buybacks? I know you bought back a little bit in the first quarter, but given what were seeing on the stock and given the sort of the disbelief in what your earnings are going to be around forex, it seems like a good time to buy the stock. Would you consider accelerating the buyback dramatically? Ronald T. Hundzinski: Yes, we would accelerate the buyback. I think I said that actually in my script, that we anticipate acceleration going into the year, John. Operator : Your next question comes from Itay Michaeli with Citi. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Just a couple of a -- it's just follow-up clarifications. So it's good to see that you've confirmed the 9.5% to 12% x currency revenue growth. I think in January, you laid out that of that the backlog was roughly, I think, 10% to 11.5%. Just wanted to clarify if that still is the case or if things kind of shifted around between the base business and the pricing assumptions within that. Kenneth Lamb : Just about everything else is unchanged, little movement here and there. But that chart that we laid out for you in January is still intact, with the exception that foreign currency piece is now a much more dramatic impact. John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Great. And to that, is there any dollar amount of backlog that came in Q1 that you can share or just kind of timing of the launches of the backlog this year for -- to help us out. Kenneth Lamb : We don't have a dollar amount for you, but -- and you should've gleaned from the comments, I think, that we think that we are probably a little bit behind where we thought we would be after the first quarter. But as we review the programs for the rest of the year, it seems that what we had lost in the first quarter's going to be recovered for the rest of the year. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : That's helpful, Ken, and then just 2 quick last ones. First, any change to the free cash flow guidance for the year, apologize if I missed it. And second, just any thoughts on the M&A environment in general and kind of what you're seeing out there? Ronald T. Hundzinski: Yes, Itay. We're going to adjust that guidance probably about $50 million down, and that's all driven by FX as well. Nothing on that's driving other than that. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Okay, $50 million. James R. Verrier: Itay, this is James. Just on the M&A environment, no real change from what we talked about in Detroit in January. We remain -- we've got a lot of work going on, got a lot of targets that were engaged with. And a lot of opportunities. Obviously, we're not announcing anything right now, but we continue to remain optimistic about M&A activity. And we're aggressively focused on it for sure. Operator : Your next question comes from Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets. Jacob W. Hughes - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : This is Jacob Hughes calling in for Joe. Just had a quick strategic question. I saw a competitor announce that they're working on an electric supercharger, which I think combines the benefit of a turbo and supercharger. But what are your thoughts on that? Is that going to be more prevalent, any update what you're doing in that area? Just... James R. Verrier: Yes. We see -- we do see adoption of, we'll call it, generically electric turbos or electrically-assisted turbochargers. We do see that trend emerging. Not surprisingly, BorgWarner is engaged with most of the OEMs, if not all, that are working on that. And we expect that to be a key program for BorgWarner going forward. We do have production orders for BorgWarner on electrically-assisted turbochargers. We're not in a position to announce those details at this stage, but we do have orders in the back, so to speak. And we see a steady growth of it, and we feel very good about it. And just to give you the primary reason why, generally, all forms of electrically-assisted turbocharger require turbocharger know-how, power electronics know-how and motor know-how, and BorgWarner brings all 3 together in a very nice integrated system approach. Operator : Your next question comes from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Ryan J. Brinkman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Can you just talk about the expected ramp from plus 3% organic growth in 1Q to the target range of 9.5% to 12% for the full year? What gives you the confidence you can ramp that strongly? And I definitely understand that 1Q was impacted by the pushout of the program launches. But I guess, what I'm still hazy on is that even if the impact to 1Q was temporal, how does that allow you to be on track for the full year? Can customers somehow make up for lost time by overproducing when the vehicle does launch? Kenneth Lamb : That last point that you made is relevant, especially in the programs we were talking about in Asia. They absolutely can do that. And secondly, remember that this growth number that we're talking about has a baseline. And the baseline gets easier for us in the second half of the year. If you go back to 2014, the first half was a very strong year, especially in the areas that we've been discussing today, and it was much weaker in the second half. So for us to see outsized growth in the second half is easier because it's an easier comparison. Ryan J. Brinkman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Okay. That's very helpful. And then my last question is just on raw materials. Can you remind us what your biggest commodity exposures are, and then how the cost-sharing arrangements work with your customers? And any help you can give us in terms of how it could impact your results in 2015. And then sort of separately to that, but related, does some amount of the pressure on revenue relate to the cost-sharing as you pass savings on with no negative impact to EBIT? Ronald T. Hundzinski: Okay. So, Ryan, let's go back in time. There was -- a couple of years ago, we used to see headwinds of about $30 million in commodity prices, I think in '14 that came down to probably under $15 million. And then in 2015, it's coming down again as far as that year-over-year headwind. So it's come down to where, at this point this year, it's a much smaller number than it was 3 years ago. So with that said, this year, it's much, much less. And the commodities we're buying, we see copper, we see nickel, we see resins and we see steel. But steel comes in a lot of different areas. Now what I will say is this, this is a very complex discussion, because what happens is each one has different contracts and different timing periods. And some of it's pass-through and some of it's not. So for example, in nickel, we probably have pass-throughs of maybe [Audio Gap] enable to pass prices up and down the change -- chain, that it's not that materially of a headwind or tailwind for us on average. So it's a very complex question you're asking, but we are in an environment that's more positive. I will say that. Operator : We have time for one final question, and that question comes from Richard Hilgert with MorningStar. Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division : Over in China, we've seen vehicle license lotteries coming into play in a lot of large cities, primarily because of the smog issues. We've also seen the government over there incentivize a lot more for the electrified powertrains. I'm curious, are the OEs over there more interested in your [Audio Gap] than OEs in other parts of the world? Have they started to utilize these things more so than in other world regions? James R. Verrier: Richard, I would summarize it this way. Our growth rate for BorgWarner in China remains on path to be, rough numbers, about a 30% CAGR over the next 5 years. And it remains very strong. I would say to you, the adoption of the BorgWarner technologies for fuel economy and emissions come in China. We've seen no pushout slowdown at all in China at the adoption rates. And all of our technologies in the product portfolio for BorgWarner are getting adopted. And if you think how that translates into new facilities that we've been building, whether it be Drivetrain-related or Engine-related, it really is very, very strong adoption. And that applies to both the domestic customers, Richard, as well as the global joint venture partners. So no slowdown and very rapid adoption rates of all of our technology over in China. Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division : Okay. And Ron, I was wondering if you could tell me, we saw the percentage change in the operating segment income come down less so on the Engine side versus the percentage change in revenue than we did on the Drivetrain side. Was there anything about currency in there that may have affected the way that the operating -- the EBIT -- adjusted EBIT changed year-over-year? Ronald T. Hundzinski: Okay. In my opening remarks, I gave some numbers around the comparable incremental or decremental numbers in those 2 segments. I did say that in the Drivetrain decremental, it was roughly 40-some-percent decremental, which was down -- I said, you've got to look at that segment because it's small numbers. So yes, I would say that the Drivetrain, I guess, is what you're getting at, probably was -- performed not as well, I guess, I would say, because of about $2 million. But it's small numbers, Richard. So yes, I think what you're getting at is the performance in the Drivetrain wasn't as impressive on the Engine side. Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division : Well, either that, Ron, or there's something positive about the margin that a weak euro has provided for the Engine segment. And that's what I'm trying to figure is if engine, because of currency, might not be necessarily as unfavorable a margin decline or profitability decline simply because of the year-over-year change in currency. But it sounds like it's more of a negative impact on the Drivetrain side than it is a positive impact on Engine. Kenneth Lamb : I think to sum it up, Richard, the Engine segment had a really good quarter. The Drivetrain segment is under a little bit more pressure, both on the revenue line and on the cost line, because we've got the restructuring inefficiencies, new plants and a lot of the revenue pressures that we talked about were more focused on Drivetrain than Engine. That's the good way to think about it. Kenneth Lamb : I'd like to thank you, all, again, for joining us. We expect to file our 10-Q before the end of the day, which will provide details of our results. If you have any follow-up questions about our earnings release, the matters discussed during this call or our 10-Q, please direct them to me. Melissa, please close out the call. Operator : That does conclude the BorgWarner 2015 First Quarter Results Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Melissa, and I will be your conference facilitator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BorgWarner 2015 Second Quarter Results Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Ken Lamb, VP of Investor Relations. Mr. Lamb, you may begin your conference. Ken Lamb : Thank you, Melissa. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. We issued our earnings release this morning at around 8 :00 AM Eastern Time. It\u2019s posted on our website, borgwarner.com, on our Investor Relations home page. A replay of today\u2019s conference call will be available through August 7. The dial-in number for that replay is 800-585-8367. You\u2019ll need the conference ID, which is 42071781 or you can listen to the replay on our website. With regard to our Investor Relations calendar, we will be attending the following conferences between now and our next earnings release. The JPMorgan Automotive Conference on August 11 in New York, the Credit Suisse Boston Transportation Conference on August 12, the CLSA Auto Conference on September 9 in New York, the RBC Capital Global Industrials Conference on September 10 in Las Vegas and the Morgan Stanley Global Autos and Industrials Conference on September 17 in Laguna Beach, California. One additional announcement. Going forward, our net new business announcement will be combined with our full-year guidance announcement. And this new combined release will be made in January. Synchronizing the timing of these announcements ensures that our one-year and three-year outlooks will be based on the same program volume, currency and [ph] large timing assumptions, improving the link between them. Now, back to today\u2019s earnings release. Before we begin, I need to inform you that during this call, we may make forward-looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties as detailed on our 10-K. Our actual results may differ significantly from the matters discussed today. Now, moving on to our results, James Verrier, President and CEO, will review highlights of our quarterly operating results, as well as some of our recent noteworthy accomplishments. And then Ron Hundzinski, our CFO, will discuss the details of our quarterly results. With that, I\u2019d like to turn it over to James. James Verrier : Thank you, Ken, and good day, everybody. Ron and I are very pleased to be with you to review our second quarter results, as well as our recent accomplishments. Before I get into those, let me just take a moment to thank all of the BorgWarner employees around the world for efforts and another good quarter for BorgWarner. Onto our results. So during the second quarter, reported sales were just over $2 billion. And that\u2019s down 7% from a year ago but up 4% when we exclude the impact of foreign currencies. Our growth in the quarter was below our normal high levels due to a few discreet items that I will discuss in the segment review. Our U.S. GAAP earnings were $0.65 per share or $0.75 per share when we exclude non-recurring charges. Our operating income margin, again, excluding non-recurring charges was an impressive 12.9% in the quarter. So, when we consider a lower-than-normal growth quarter, some of the restructuring efficiencies that we\u2019re going through, new plants, plant expansions that we\u2019re managing this year, this is very good performance by our operations. Now, let me talk first about the Engine segment. So, the second quarter sales were about $1.4 billion. That\u2019s down 6% from a year ago, but when we exclude the impact of foreign currencies, the segment grew 7%. And these results were primarily led by strong light vehicle total sales around the world, particularly in Europe, and this was partially offset by some unfavorable mix of light vehicle production in both North America and China and weak commercial vehicle markets around the world. In the Drivetrain segment, sales were $627 million. That\u2019s down 12% from a year ago or down 3% when we exclude foreign currencies, and the decline in sales for the Drivetrain was related to unfavorable mix of light vehicle production in North America, some launch delays in Asia and also lower light vehicle production in China. Now, similar to comments in the past three quarters, Drivetrain was impacted by a planned slow ramp-up of a major program by a North American customer in the quarter, and we do expect volumes for this program to return to more normal levels in the second half of 2015. So, despite the tough year-over-year comps and the challenging environment for growth in the first half, 2015 will be a really good year for Drivetrain and we expect Drivetrain to grow organically in 2015 and the restructuring work that\u2019s under way will position this part of our business for strong growth and margin expansion in 2016 and beyond. Our financial strength and strong performance is also based on our ability to anticipate and drive the next technology ways. So, as we look to the future, BorgWarner continues to invest for the long term. Capital spending continues to grow. We spent about 7.3% of sales on capital in the second quarter, and that\u2019s above our long-term target of 5% to 6%. And, typically, our capital spending is primarily from machinery and equipment. However, our strong growth over the next several years does require investments in new plants, plant expansions, which is driving elevated spending in the near term. We expect this to continue through the end of 2015 after which we should return to more normal spending levels. Our investment in R&D was just under 4% of sales in the quarter, again, in line with our target for the year. The intensity around organic innovation and product development remains very strong. As Ken said, I\u2019d like to share a few exciting announcements we made during the last few months. First of all, BorgWarner has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Remy International, a global market leading producer of rotating electrical components. Under the terms of the agreement, BorgWarner will acquire each of the outstanding shares of Remy for $29.50 in cash, which implies an enterprise value of Remy of approximately $1.2 billion. We expect the transaction to close in the fourth quarter of 2015. We produced a number of our advanced engine and drivetrain technologies for the new Great Wall Haval H9. The domestically-produced SUV features BorgWarner engine timing systems, turbochargers and two-speed talk-on-demand transfer case. BorgWarner\u2019s DCT clutch module helps Eaton\u2019s new Procision seven-speed DCT, which is the first DCT for Class 6 and 7 trucks in North America, improved fuel economy about 8% to 10% compared with similar vehicles with truck converter automatic transmissions. Our facilities in Bellwood and Frankfort in Illinois received 2014 Certificates of Achievement from Toyota for quality performance. Both facilities achieved 100% quality ratings and zero PPM levels in 2014. BorgWarner is regulated to two-stage turbocharging technology improves the performance and fuel economy of Ford\u2019s new powerful 2.0-liter diesel engine, the first Ford engine for passenger cars equipped with a two-stage turbo system. The engine will debut in the Ford Mondeo, S-Max and Galaxy in mid 2015 and will replace the 2.2-liter diesel engine. Our manufacturing plant in Seneca, South Carolina was presented with an Excellence in Quality Award from Honda North America. This award recognizing the outstanding product quality in 2014. Now, let me take a moment to provide an overview of our updated guidance for 2015. Due to the impact of weaker-than-expected market conditions in our business, we have lowered our sales growth expectations for 2015. Our sales growth guidance range is now minus 5.5% at the low end and minus 2.5% at the high end, which is down from the minus 4% to 0% previously. The change in sales growth guidance is primarily related to three major things; slower light vehicle production growth in China, unfavorable mix of light vehicle production in North America and weak commercial vehicle markets around the world. Now, when we exclude the impact of currency, base business growth and changes in product pricing, our organic growth is expected to be approximately 7% to 8%. And as a result of the lower sales guidance, we now expect earnings to be within the range of $2.95 to $3.10 per diluted share. That\u2019s down from $3.10 to $3.30 per diluted share. And our operating margin is now expected to be approximately 13% instead of above 13%. Despite the lower guidance, I\u2019m very encouraged by our outlook for the rest of this year. Our full-year sales guidance implies high-single-digit organic growth in the second half of 2015 and the restructuring and expansion activities are a clear transition to either strong performance in 2016 and beyond. So, as we look ahead, the industry\u2019s continued adoption of our leading-edge powertrain technology combined with operational excellence are the primary reasons that we\u2019re happy, we still are, and we will continue to be the leading order supplier in terms of growth and operating performance. So, with that, now, let me turn the call over to Ron. Ron Hundzinski : Thank you, James, and good day, everyone. Before I begin reviewing the financials, I would like to also commend all of our employees for their hard work in the quarter. Now, on to the financials. James already provided a detailed review of our sales performance in the quarter. In summary, sales were down 7% from a year ago, or up 4% excluding the impact of foreign currencies. Working down the income statement, gross profit as a percentage of sales was 21.1% in the quarter, down 40 basis points from 21.5% a year ago. During the same period, SG&A as a percentage of sales was 8.2% in line with last year; R&D spending which is included in SG&A was 3.9% of sales. Operating income in the quarter was $243 million. Excluding $20 million of restructuring charges, operating income was $262 million or 12.9% of sales, down 60 basis points from a year ago; 40 basis points of the decline is in operating margin, was lower in the gross profit margin line item; and 20 basis points was from higher corporate expenses. Our 13.5% operating income margin a year ago was a tough comparison concern. It was an all-time high for this company. Excluding the restructuring charges previously discussed, as well as the impact of foreign currencies, our year-over-year incremental margin was a negative 7%. In other words, operating income was lower on higher sales. I will discuss this further in the segment review. As you look further down the income statement, equity in the affiliate earnings was about $11 million in the quarter, down slightly from $12 million last year. This represents our performance of NSK-Warner, our 50/50 joint venture in Japan with sells transmission components to our Japanese customers in Japan and China, as well as TEL, our turbocharger joint venture in India. Interest expense and finance charges were $18 million in the quarter, up from $9 million a year ago. The increase is primarily due to the $1 billion of fixed rate senior notes issued in the first quarter. Provision for income taxes in the quarter on a reported basis was $80 million. However, this included unfavorable net tax adjustments of $3 million. You can read about each of these adjustments in our 10-Q which will be filed later today. Excluding adjustments, provision for income taxes was $77 million which is an effective tax rate of 30% in the quarter. Our year-to-date effective tax rate is 29.5% which is our new estimate for the full year, up from 29% previously. Net earnings attributable to non-controlling interest were just over $9 million in the quarter, basically in line with the second quarter 2014. This line item represents our minority partner share in the earnings performance of our Korean and Chinese consolidated joint ventures. That brings us back to net earnings which were $148 million a quarter. Net earnings, excluding non-recurring items, were $171 million or $0.75 per diluted share. Note that the weaker foreign currencies lowered earnings by $0.09 per share in the quarter. Now let\u2019s take a closer look at our operating segments in the quarter. As James said earlier, reported Engine segment sales were about $1.4 billion in the quarter. Sales growth for the Engine segment, excluding currency, was 7% compared with the same period a year ago. On a reported basis, adjusted EBIT was $228 million for the engine segment. Excluding currency, adjusted EBIT was $252 million or 15.7% of sales. Due to the inefficiencies related to the investments in new plant construction and expansion and the Wahler restructuring, adjusted EBIT as a percentage of sales was down 40 basis points from a year ago. And Engine segment\u2019s year-over-year incremental margin was 10%. These results are below our trend, but not unexpected given the level of investment activity within the segment. Plant construction and expansion currently in progress should be behind us by the end of 2015. And the restructuring plan for Wahler is on target after which we expect Wahler to be a double-digit margin business. In the Drivetrain segment, reported sales were about $627 million in the quarter. Excluding currency, sales declined about 3% compared with the same period a year ago. On a reported basis, adjusted EBIT was $72 million for the Drivetrain segment. Excluding currency, adjusted EBIT was $76 million or 11.2% of sales. Due to inefficiencies related to investments in the new DCT plant in China and restructuring plant in Europe, adjusted EBIT as a percentage of sales was down 140 basis points from a year ago. And the Drivetrain segment\u2019s year-over-year decremental margin was 53%. To keep this in perspective, adjusted EBIT declined $13 million on a $24 million decline in sales. If we were to assume a mid-teens decremental margin, you would expect a $4 million decline in adjusted EBIT on a $24 million decline in sales. The $9 million of additional expense is primarily due to investments I just mentioned and slightly elevated from the $5 million to $7 million of investment-related expenses in the previous three quarters. The Drivetrain restructuring plant and the ramp-up of the new DCT plant in China are both on target. We still expect to have the restructuring plant completed by the end of 2015 and the new DCT plant up and running in early 2016. The segment review highlights good progress on our restructuring expansion plans. Coming into 2015, we stated these investments would cause near-term inefficiencies. But over the long term, they strengthened our competitive position and performance. Now, let\u2019s take a look at the balance sheet and cash flow. We generated $319 million of net cash from operating activities in the first six months of 2015, down slightly from $326 million a year ago. Capital spending was $285 million in the first half of the year, up $28 million from a year ago. Increase was driven by capital required to support our strong backlog of net new business. Free cash flow, which we define as net cash from operating activities less capital spending, was $34 million in the first half of 2015, down from $69 million in the first half of 2014. We expect to generate in a range of $250 million to $300 million of free cash flow in 2015. Investments in restructuring and expansions that are driving elevated spending will soon be behind us. We expect spending to normalize beginning next year. Also, our realignment plan, which we provide an increase - which provided increased treasury management flexibility will be complete. As a result, we expect to see significant increase in cash availability for corporate initiatives beginning in 2016. We will quantify this improvement and clarify our intentions in the 2016 guidance call in January. Looking at the balance sheet itself, balance sheet, that increased by $464 million at the end of the second quarter in 2015 compared with the end of 2014. Cash increased by $310 million during the same period. The $154 million increase in net debt was primarily due to capital expenditures given in payments to shareholders and share repurchases. Our net debt-to-capital ratio was15.6% at the end of the second quarter, up from 12.8% at the end of 2014. Net debt to EBITDA at the end of the year on a trailing - at the end of the quarter at trailing 12 month basis was 0.5 times. Our capital structure remains in excellent shape. Now, I\u2019d like to discuss our updated guidance for 2015. James reviewed our guidance at a high level. I\u2019ll discuss some of the finer points. We expect sales growth of a negative 5.5% to negative 2.5%, down from 0% to 4%. James described a weaker than expected market conditions that have changed our outlook for the year. Our full year dollar to euro exchange rate assumption is now $1.10, at the high end of the previous range of $1.05 to $1.10. We now expect EPS within a range of $2.95 to $3.10 per diluted share in 2015. This is down from $2.10 to $3.30 per diluted share previously. The change in EPS guidance is primarily due to the impact of lower expected sales growth. We spent $25 million on share repurchases in the second quarter and $63 million year-to-date. Our share repurchase activity in the second quarter was slowed by a self-imposed blackout period while working on the Remy transaction. However, our plan remains unchanged. We still expect to spend $1 billion on share repurchases during the three year period ending in the first quarter of 2018. Our weighted average diluted share count is now expected to be approximately $226 million for 2015, up slightly from $225 million previously. Our operating income margin guidance is now expected to be approximately 13% instead of above 13%. This implies a mid-teens incremental margin for the full year and high-teens or better incremental margins in the second half. We continue to be confident in our ability to execute in any market. This company has demonstrated a heightened focus and efficiency in cost. This focus resulted in a high efficient growth and record margins in each of the last four years. With our strong organic growth in operations performing at a very high level, 2015 should be another great year for BorgWarner. As we look beyond 2015, we intend to execute our growth plan yielding high-single to low-double-digit growth and to efficiently convert our sales growth to profits. The future is great for BorgWarner. So, with that, I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Ken. Ken Lamb : Thanks, Ron. Now, let\u2019s move to the Q&A portion of the call. Melissa, please, remind everyone of the Q&A procedure. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. Rich Kwas : Hi. Good morning, everyone. James Verrier : Good morning, Rich. Ron Hundzinski : Hi, Rich. Rich Kwas : So, on the guide, the 7% to 8% that corresponds to the 10.3% to 11.5%, that was the original outlook for net new business, is that correct? James Verrier : Yes, Rich. That is correct. Rich Kwas : Okay. So, question is I know that you haven\u2019t given the specifics around region this year in your recent guidance updates. But for the second half, what are you assuming for the Chinese light vehicle market? And then when you think about the European landscape, what you have embedded in expectations? Just to get a better understanding of how much second half has been de-risked? Ron Hundzinski : Yeah. It\u2019s a good question, Rich. So, the way we\u2019re thinking about it is not a lot of change compared to current levels. We don\u2019t have specific market assumptions. The way that we do this is we have our program-level volumes that kind of roll up to our guidance. As we said at the first quarter call, we were a little bit in revenue compared to what our expectations were. And that happened again in the second quarter for actually different reasons, but that kind of same level is what we\u2019re expecting to see for the rest of the year. And so, I think we feel pretty comfortable with the guide and where it is right now. We feel that the risks and opportunities to forecast for the guidance is pretty balanced. Rich Kwas : Okay. And then, in terms of the North American vehicle mix, I know that\u2019s being - in fact, it has been affected by Ford, but what\u2019s the assumption for F-150 in just North American mix in the second half of the year? I mean, is it kind of the normal production increase the schedules suggest at this point or anything noteworthy there? James Verrier : Yeah, Rich. This is James. I would say no meaningful difference from the North American view to where we were in the last call. So, what we see from IHS and what we hear from the respective OEMs that you were talking about, that\u2019s kind of our view, too, if that makes sense. So, we\u2019re pretty much consistently in line with pretty much the customers on IHS for North America, which is not a big difference from a quarter ago. Rich Kwas : Okay. And then, is China - in terms of the China business, apart from the market, it seems like you\u2019re maybe impacted by some key customers over there. I mean, how does that shape up for the balance of the year? James Verrier : Yeah. Let me talk about that, Rich. Obviously, that\u2019s pretty meaningful for us. We saw - as we went into the second quarter, the light vehicle production rates in China, as we all saw, slowed pretty meaningfully. That\u2019s, as Ken said, is continuing on through the year, so we do see that. From a BorgWarner-specific point of view, Rich, we\u2019re weighted to the JV Western guys versus the domestics as we sit right now. And it\u2019s fair to say we\u2019re weighted, even within that piece, quite heavily to the large German guy that\u2019s over there. So that, as you can see from some of their commentary, kind of works a little bit against us. And in the short run, we\u2019re probably a little skewed to cars versus SUV trucks. So from a BorgWarner point of view, yeah, mix is a little bit of a headwind for us. Obviously, looking to the future, that\u2019s fine. We\u2019re still in a good growth environment for China. I think that\u2019s important from a BorgWarner viewpoint. But that growth rate versus where it was at the start of the year is down. That\u2019s the fundamental point, Rich. Rich Kwas : Okay. All right. Thank you. James Verrier : Thank you, Rich. Ron Hundzinski : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Brian Johnson with Barclays. Your line is open. Brian Johnson : Yes. Good morning. Couple of questions. First, vis-\u00e0-vis driveline. You talked last year when you took some cost after restructuring that you\u2019re becoming more competitive and seeing some win rates ideally increase in that unit. Has that - that certainly played out in last year\u2019s backlog, but how is it shaping up with sort of the orders and the backlog as it\u2019s been developing through this year? James Verrier : Yeah. Brian, this is James. I would say good is the quick answer. We\u2019re very happy, as you know from a Drivetrain perspective, we got two fundamental areas of product in the transmission side and then the all-wheel drive side of our business. And we\u2019ve been very encouraged with the quote win-rate activity and we\u2019re feeling good about that, actually. So, yeah, I don\u2019t want to give any specific numbers. As Ken said, we\u2019ll provide more color at the appropriate time. But good, good is the way to think of it. We\u2019re happy with where we are on Drivetrain. Brian Johnson : Okay. And the second question and maybe a little bit on the engine as well as the Drivetrain side is we\u2019re certainly very clear that by 2020 number, the upgrades to Powertrains need to happen to meet European and U.S. CAFE requirements aren\u2019t going to go anywhere. What\u2019s now the shape of the ramp in between? And are OEMs at all having second thoughts about potentially pushing, winning a year for our Powertrain program if they can live on CAFE or other credits and not have to get it say in 2017 when you\u2019re making way to 2018. Are those kind of discussions going on? And where do you think those will seek out? James Verrier : Yeah. Our view, Brian, is no is the real quick answer. We\u2019re not having those discussions. We\u2019re not seeing those discussions. When we - both on the engine and the Drivetrain side, the adoption rate of our technology, we feel very good about. We\u2019re not seeing any slowdown or adjustments. What you do see in the short run, you\u2019ll see noise in launch delays that we experienced a little bit in the first quarter in Asia. And you can see a little bit of a slow in terms of volume take rates, maybe on a China program. But in terms of meaningful movement in technology or Powertrain architecture or adoption of our product, no, we\u2019re not seeing any issues. They have very high demand for the product. Brian Johnson : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from John Murphy with Bank of America. Your line is open. John Murphy : Good morning, guys. James Verrier : Good morning, John. John Murphy : Just a first question, it looks like you reduced your free cash flow guidance by about $100 million on the range, but if we look at the earnings reduction based on the EPS, it\u2019s only about a $40 million decline. So, just curious if there\u2019s something else going on in the cash flow or around the working capital or something else that\u2019s going on that we explained that delta $60 million? James Verrier : No. John, if you\u2019ve taken a look at it, I think it\u2019s in line with the change in earnings. Cash flow changes roughly at the same amount. Yeah. Ron Hundzinski : Just to put some numbers to that, the free cash flow guidance previously was $300 million to $350 million, and now we\u2019ve changed it to $250 million to $300 million. John Murphy : Okay. [indiscernible] indeed numbers there. Okay. So, it\u2019s largely in line. Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Ron Hundzinski : Okay. All right. John Murphy : And then when we think about all the forex impact here, I mean, we really are looking at pure translation as opposed to anything that\u2019s transactional between regions. Ron Hundzinski : That\u2019s correct. The headwind is translational on FX, not transactional. John Murphy : Got you. And then also, if you could just talk about the potential for flexibility in your cost structure as we see increasing [indiscernible] about volume downturns at different regions, although we don\u2019t agree with that, but there is a lot of concern there. I mean, can you just talk about the variability in your cost structure, what kind of actions you\u2019d take if we saw some material declines in volume? James Verrier : Yeah. I\u2019ll talk about it for a moment, John. A couple of points, I would say, as Ken went around the globe, we see predominant relatively good stability in Europe and good volumes in North America. Probably the one area in the world obviously that got everybody a little nervous is China, and we get that. We\u2019re still in growth mode there. So, for us, our flexibility primarily, John, is around slowing the growth a little bit. So, that\u2019s a better problem than you can imagine. But we have good amounts of temporary employees in all three major regions of the world. We\u2019re still in good shape. And, actually, if we need to flex on the labor side, and we can obviously flex on the spending side. So, we feel good. And as we\u2019ve talked about in prior calls, all of the business units and the operating units have got good plans there to adjust if things were to move up or down. So, pretty good shape is the way I would describe it, John. John Murphy : And last quick question on Remy. Now, that news is out there, any reaction from your customers and positively, negatively? Or what\u2019s been the reaction from your customer base? James Verrier : Yeah. I would say - the summary, I would say, John, is overwhelmingly positive is kind of what I would share with you. And we\u2019ve talked to a number of our customers, and the general sense we\u2019ve got is a lot of excitement about the technology and particularly the combination of BorgWarner technology with Remy technology. So, very positive. And I would say that across the landscape, that\u2019s regionally. We got that feedback and it\u2019s across both the commercial vehicle and the light vehicle segments. So, overwhelmingly positive and a lot of good opportunities for us. John Murphy : Great. Thank you very much. James Verrier : Thanks, John. Operator : Your next question comes from Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Patrick Nolan : Hello? James Verrier : Hey, Rod. Operator : Rod Lache, your line is open. Patrick Nolan : Hi, guys. It\u2019s actually Pat Nolan on for Rob. James Verrier : Hi, Pat. Ron Hundzinski : Hey, Pat. Patrick Nolan : So, can you just talk about - I know that the start-up costs are a little bit heavier in Q2. Does that mean for the balance of the year, these costs will be a little bit lower than you thought? And how are you thinking about these costs as - are they 100% eliminated as we go into 2016? So, 2016, you\u2019ll still get your typical on [ph] commercial margin plus these costs going away and any kind of restructuring savings on top of that? Ron Hundzinski : All right. Pat, so, a couple of things. One is we talked about this quite a bit coming into this cycle. And we said that the cost would be lumpy and it would be, quite frankly, hard to predict if it was going to be $5 million to $7 million or in this quarter, $9 million or if it\u2019s going to be $4 million, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing. This one - this quarter was a little bit higher than we anticipated. Going forward, we know one thing is going into 2016 is going to be significantly reduced. So that part we do know. And now, we still have two more quarters this year. I would say that we go back in this $5 million, $7 million range. I think this quarter might be on the high side of it. That\u2019s what we\u2019re hoping to achieve rest of the year. And just to add a little bit to that so the - we have a couple of things going on. The restructuring in Europe, you can expect to see those costs pretty much eliminated as we go in to 2016. There will be a little bit of cost going into 2016, but almost negligible. Now, on the new plant launch, we\u2019ll start making product there next year, but that\u2019s going to be in a ramp mode, so it\u2019s going to be a while until that plant breaks even... Patrick Nolan : Right. Ron Hundzinski : ...making money. So, we\u2019re going to have a little bit of a ramp on the new plant, but the restructuring, we should see the benefit eliminated. Patrick Nolan : Thanks very much. Appreciate it. Ron Hundzinski : All right, Pat. James Verrier : [indiscernible], Pat. Operator : Your next question comes from David Leiker with Baird. Your line is open. David Leiker : Good morning, everyone. James Verrier : Hello, David. Ron Hundzinski : Good morning, David. David Leiker : I want to circle back on this North American mix side and just try and dig into it at a little bit different perspective. We\u2019re not really hearing that from any other suppliers that there\u2019s a mix issue in North America. I was wondering if you could help us with some color there, whether it\u2019s a particular vehicle or a particular segment or a particular customer that\u2019s causing the issue for you. Ron Hundzinski : So, let me try and explain this, David. So typically, when mix moves around the way that it has this year, that being passenger cars are down and light trucks are up. It\u2019s usually a relatively neutral event for us. Unless our largest truck customer is in a slow ramp-up in their major truck platform which happens to be our largest one globally, So, what we\u2019ve seen is whether we normally get that offset on a truck side, when car sales are down, we\u2019re not seeing it as much. Our exposure on passenger cars are to the guys that are seeing some lower volumes this year and our exposure in the truck side is not to the guys that are benefiting from that. If that helps. David Leiker : Yeah. That makes sense. And then the second item here, as we look at some of the revenue shortfall that we\u2019ve been running in here, some of them are mix-related, some of them are other volumes, some of it end markets. We\u2019re not going to hear an update on what the backlog is for six months here. Can you give us some sense of what you think the impact of that\u2019s going to be on your backlog just from those end market issues? Ron Hundzinski : Sure. So we talked about that, obviously. It\u2019s an important data point for us and you as well. We at this point think that it\u2019s a bit early to give any indication of how this is going to play out on the backlog. What we can say is if it\u2019s in China, mix and volume kind of stay where they are. It will likely have an unfavorable impact on the backlog. But having said that, that\u2019s a very dynamic market and we\u2019re not at all in a position to say that that\u2019s what we think is going to happen at this point. So give us a little bit of time. We\u2019re going to spend a lot of time looking at this before we come out with our actual guidance for this in January. David Leiker : Okay. Great. Thank you. James Verrier : Thanks [indiscernible]. Ron Hundzinski : Thanks, David. Operator : Your next question comes from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Ravi Shanker : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. James Verrier : Good morning, Ravi. Ravi Shanker : Thanks for the detail here. But I\u2019m certainly a little bit [indiscernible] still understand what\u2019s changed versus your previous outlook from three and six months ago. China, I get. Clearly, that\u2019s changed. But when you consider the lower mix in North America that you just addressed, is it that the F-150 is just a slower ramp than you saw it or why would that be an incremental drag on revenues? Ron Hundzinski : Okay. So, let\u2019s start back at the beginning of the year because that\u2019s really what we\u2019re comparing to because our guidance didn\u2019t really change after the first quarter. Ravi Shanker : Right. Ron Hundzinski : So, what really happened is we expected the program that you\u2019ve mentioned to be in this deliberately slow launch ramp. What we did not expect was the weakness on the passenger car side. That weakness has persisted to the first half of the year. That was unexpected. And as far as the North America piece of what has changed, that\u2019s the major difference from where we were as we talked about this in January. Ravi Shanker : Okay. Understood. And margin side, Ron, you flagged the number of cost-related issues and launch and restructuring and Wahler and such. Again, so the cut in the margin guidance was driven by the volume decline or is there anything else going on? Ron Hundzinski : All by the volume decline. The sales decline on the guidance update is what\u2019s driving the updated EPS guidance. Ravi Shanker : Okay. I guess what I\u2019m getting at is, are you seeing any weakness at all and just decrease for - in the turbo engines versus the non-turbo engines? I mean, apart from just a fast car versus truck shift, are you seeing a move away from some of the more fuel-efficient technologies towards less fuel-efficient technologies given gas prices and what\u2019s the view on the medium term? James Verrier : Yeah. Ravi, this is James. No is the quick answer to be candid. We\u2019re not seeing any shifts in those types of specific product mix, particularly in North America. And the desire and the take rate and the opportunity for turbo in North America remains very strong. So, no, we\u2019re not seeing any shifts there. Ravi Shanker : Great. Thank you for the color. James Verrier : Thanks, Ravi. Ron Hundzinski : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Brett Hoselton with KeyBanc Capital. Your line is open. Brett Hoselton : Good morning, James, Ron, Ken. James Verrier : Good morning. Ron Hundzinski : Good morning, Brett. Brett Hoselton : I was hoping that you could provide maybe a sense of what you\u2019re thinking in terms of China. I know that you\u2019ve already talked about your production expectations or kind of relatively levels from current levels, I think, through the remainder of this year. I think that\u2019s really what you said. I guess what I\u2019m wondering is obviously we\u2019ve seen a slowdown in the sales rate in China here in June in particular. Delphi was out just before you kind of talking about customers adding to the production schedules in the fourth quarter and third quarter being up maybe about 3% on a year-over-year basis. So, I guess, where do you think is taking place in China in terms of the slowdown in sales, slowdown in production? And what gives you confidence that it\u2019s going to remain roughly flat? And do you have any bias to the upside or downside and why? James Verrier : Yeah. I would articulate it this way, Brett. I think that - first of all, I think to put things in perspective, what we\u2019re talking about again is we\u2019re still growing and growing well in China for BorgWarner. So, that\u2019s an important reference perspective. But, obviously, as you say, the growth from where we started out the year in terms of our expectation has slowed. Q2 had moved very quickly as I alluded to earlier. And we feel comfortable with what our assumptions are right now in the guidance, which is pretty much continuing on at the level of the pace of run rates, so to speak, that we\u2019re at. It\u2019s a little less granularity of data in China when you compare it to, say, North America, so there is. Is there potential upside? Maybe. Is there potential downside? Yeah. My personal view is probably if there was a bias, it\u2019s probably slightly weighted to the down versus the up based on what we see. Some of that also, Brett, maybe specifically to BorgWarner. We talked earlier before. We have large concentrations with the two leading joint ventured Western guys out there. So, that\u2019s meaningful. We talked a lot about in the press release about Great Wall being a major customer for BorgWarner. And we see some issues there. So, we\u2019re comfortable with where we\u2019re at. We\u2019re still happy with the growth rate that we\u2019ve got, but it\u2019s a little lower than when we started the year. And as we look beyond 2015, which I think is important, we\u2019re very positive on China. And we see the strong growth in China, and we see very strong adoption rates to the technology in China. Brett Hoselton : And as I look at your guidance, again, the sales clearly on a year-over-year basis are improving in the back half of the year. So you\u2019re down 6% in the first half, down 2% in the back half to get to a 4% midpoint of your guidance. And again, that is the midpoint. But your margin expectation seems to be kind of flat going from the first half to the back half. And I\u2019m kind of thinking about some of the positives that may take place in the back half. And I\u2019m thinking that the margins possibly should have shown maybe a little bit of improvement sequentially from the first half to the second half. They have in previous years. What is it that\u2019s kind of driving that kind of flat margin expectation into the back half of the year? Ron Hundzinski : Well, one thing I like to point out, Brett, is that I think the midpoint the sales are actually down in the second half over the first half of the year on a reported basis. Slightly it is, but they are down. So you\u2019re going to have obviously a reduction in margins and everything remained the same. I would say this, we changed our guidance from above 13 to approximately 13. We were talking within 10, 20 basis points of movement here, okay. So, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s significant. I wouldn\u2019t say there\u2019s anything into that we\u2019re concerned about or anything like that. Is it possible our margins could still expand, yes, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s anything significant or be concerned about in your analysis that you\u2019re doing right there. Brett Hoselton : Okay. That\u2019s fair enough, Ron. Thank you very much, gentlemen. James Verrier : All right, Brett. Operator : Your next question comes from Patrick Archambault with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Patrick Archambault : Hi. Yes. Good morning. Just actually, I wanted to follow up on that question. Can we just put in the context that your new organic growth is 7 to 8? And I haven\u2019t done the math, but what was the organic in the first and second quarter? And what exactly is implied in the back half? Can we just go through that real quick? James Verrier : No. We\u2019re not going to be able to go through that real quick. We\u2019re going to have to do that when offline, Pat. We can give you that, though, Pat, but it\u2019s a complete walk as you know, right? That would take us some time to go through that complete walk. Patrick Archambault : Okay. But I think you were 4%, right, this quarter and you were something similar, right, I think in the first quarter... James Verrier : Yes. Patrick Archambault : ...assuming that\u2019s correct, right? So, call it... James Verrier : Yes. Patrick Archambault : ...like mid-single digits in the first half even if we don\u2019t have the exact numbers. So, it does imply kind of an organic growth acceleration in the second half? James Verrier : Yes. Patrick Archambault : And so that was really the crux of the question is - I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a lot of stuff you could point to like the F-150 launch and everything like that. But I just wanted to go through the line items that are relevant there in driving that pickup in the growth rate in the second half? Ron Hundzinski : Pat, I can\u2019t tell you at a very high level and then, obviously, we\u2019ll walk you through that later on. You were right, the first half organic was roughly 4%. It does accelerate in the second half year approaches, I think, between 7% to 8% organic growth. This is on a year-over-year comparable basis. So, at a high level, those are the numbers. Patrick Archambault : And then just to follow up like the main levers that you guys see to get to that acceleration. I\u2019m sure a lot of those are just timing of launches and things like that. But I wanted to specifically kind of hear that from you and kind of get a sense of what those are. Ron Hundzinski : So, we\u2019ll talk about it generally, Pat. Generally, we do see some pickup in the backlog in the second half versus the first half. And obviously, that North American program picking up steam is helpful in that regard. And secondly, the comps are [ph] easier in the second half. This is a big variable when you\u2019re thinking about this. So, those are kind of the two main pieces. Patrick Archambault : Okay. And then China was brought up a lot here, and I understand that you guys do everything sort of rolled up from an individual program perspective. So, it\u2019s not just as easy as saying the market\u2019s going to do X or Y. But Delphi actually put out pretty helpful dimensions. They were saying up, and I\u2019m probably getting this wrong, but I think they thought production as they saw what\u2019s going to be up 3% in the third quarter, just based on the schedule [indiscernible] for the market and then up 6% for the fourth is what I think what they had as a best guess and at a high level, just given you have a lot in China as well. Wanted to see if you were seeing something [indiscernible]. James Verrier : Well, first of all, we\u2019re not disputing what anybody else says about their expectations for the market in China. The reason that we don\u2019t provide that information is because, as you see in our business, the mix issue is significant and those particular figures are not as important to us as what our particular programs are doing in that market. So, that may be true what they said, but by and large, what we\u2019re looking at are the customers and the programs that James alluded to earlier because that\u2019s what\u2019s really driving our expectations for the second half. And just for clarity, when we talked about kind of flattish expectations for our business in China in the second half versus the first, that was BorgWarner-specific. That wasn\u2019t a volume number that we were giving for the market overall. That was for us. Patrick Archambault : Okay. Got it. And I\u2019m sorry. I should like - I know you guys have probably clarified this, but that flat, is that kind of the volume underlying the organic revenue? Was that actually the revenue forecast for you guys? James Verrier : It\u2019s a general description of how we feel about our business in China in the second half versus the first half. Patrick Archambault : Got it. Okay. And then, last one, I promise. And you probably just gave this, but like the - I understand VW is a big program and kind of the international guys. What\u2019s - sorry, what\u2019s the percentage of them in your China portfolio versus the domestic guys? James Verrier : We would - I would just say we are weighted - we\u2019re certainly weighted right now to the joint venture in Western guys, Pat. And the biggest piece of that joint venture Western piece is that large German customer you referenced. Patrick Archambault : Okay. And to push my luck here... James Verrier : We got to move on to the next person. Thank you. Patrick Archambault : I\u2019ll let you go. James Verrier : Thanks. Ron Hundzinski : All right. Thanks, Pat. Operator : Your next question comes from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Ryan Brinkman : Hi. Thanks for taking my call. Good morning. James Verrier : Good morning, Ryan. Ron Hundzinski : Hi, Ryan. Ryan Brinkman : Just one on China, a bit about the backlog there. First of all, you stood it out by overall region, but can you say how much is China? I think it\u2019s most of Asia Pacific. And then secondly, is there any risk that automakers could look to delay new program launches to save money like they did in Europe, which impacted you in 2012 and 2013? I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any risk of the automakers that I cover, not refreshing the products according to plan. But GM did on their call this quarter talk about the ability to pull back on capacity expansion if they needed to. And I was wondering maybe if product launch delays are an emerging trend that automakers that I don\u2019t follow closely. James Verrier : So when we had provided our backlog announcement this past November, we [overlapping conversation] American piece of what has changed, that\u2019s the major difference from where we were as we talked about this in January. Ravi Shanker : Okay. Understood. And on the margin side, Ron, you flagged the number of cost-related issues in launch and restructuring and water and such. Again, so, the cut in the margin guidance was driven by the volume decline or is there anything else going on? Ron Hundzinski : All by the volume decline. The sales decline on the guidance update is what\u2019s driving the updated EPS guidance. Ravi Shanker : Okay. I guess, what I\u2019m getting at is, are you seeing any weakness at all in just take rates for turbo engines versus non-turbo engines. I mean, apart from just a fast car versus truck shift, are you seeing a move away from some of the more fuel-efficient technologies towards less fuel-efficient technologies given gas prices and what\u2019s the view in the medium term? James Verrier : Yeah. Ravi, this is James. No is the quick answer to be candid. But we\u2019re not seeing any shifts in those types of specific product mix, particularly in North America. And the desire and the take rate and the opportunity for turbo in North America remains very strong. So, now, we\u2019re not seeing any shifts there. Ravi Shanker : Great. Thank you for the color. James Verrier : Thanks, Ravi. Ron Hundzinski : Thank you, Ravi. Operator : Your next question comes from Brett Hoselton with KeyBanc Capital. Your line is open. Brett Hoselton : Good morning, James, Ron, Ken. James Verrier : Good morning, Brett. Ron Hundzinski : Good morning, Brett. Brett Hoselton : I was hoping that you could provide maybe a sense of what you\u2019re thinking in terms of China. I know that you\u2019ve already talked about your production expectations for China. Relatively from current levels, I think, through the remainder of this year. I think that\u2019s exactly what you said. I guess, what I\u2019m wondering is, obviously, we\u2019ve seen slowdown in the sales rate in China here in June, in particular. Delphi was out just before you kind of talking about customers adding to their production schedules in the fourth quarter and third quarter being up maybe about 3% on a year-over-year basis. So, I guess, what do you think is taking place in China in terms of the slowdown in sales, slowdown in production? And what gives you confidence that it\u2019s going to remain roughly flat and do you have any bias to the upside or downside and why? James Verrier : Yeah. I would actually equate it this way, Brett. I think that - first of all, I think to put things in perspective, what we\u2019re talking about again is we\u2019re still growing and growing well in China for BorgWarner. So this is an important reference perspective. But obviously, as you say, the growth from where we started out the year in terms of our expectation, that\u2019s slowed. Q2, it moved very quickly as I alluded to earlier. We feel comfortable with what our assumptions are right now in the guidance, which is pretty much continuing on at the level of the pace or run rate, so to speak, that we\u2019re at. It\u2019s a little less granularity of data in China when you compare it to, say, North America. So there is - is there potential upside? Maybe. Is there potential downside? Yeah. My personal view is probably if there was a bias, it\u2019s probably slightly weighted to the down versus the up based on what we see. Some of that also, Brett, might be specifically to BorgWarner. We talked earlier before we have large concentrations with the two leading joint venture western guys out there, so that\u2019s meaningful. We talked a lot about in the press release about Great Wall being a major customer for BorgWarner and we see some issues there. So we\u2019re comfortable with where we\u2019re at. We\u2019re still happy with the growth rate that we\u2019ve got, but it\u2019s a little lower than when we started the year. And as we look beyond 2015, which I think is important, we\u2019re very positive on China. And we see strong growth in China and we see very strong adoption rates for the technology in China. Brett Hoselton : And as I look at your guidance and again the sales clearly on the year-over-year basis are improving in the back half of the year. So, you\u2019re down 6% in the first half, down 2% in the back half to get to a 4% midpoint to your guidance and again that\u2019s just the midpoint. But your margin expectation seems to be kind of flat going from the first half to the back half and I\u2019m kind of thinking about some of the positives that may take place in the back half. And I\u2019m thinking the margins possibly should have shown maybe a little bit of improvement sequentially from the first half to the second half, they have in previous years. What it is that\u2019s kind of driving that kind of flat margin expectation into the back half of the year? James Verrier : Well, one thing I\u2019d like to point out, Brett, is that I think the midpoint to sales are actually down in the second half or the first half of the year on a reported basis, slightly it is... Brett Hoselton : Yes. Yes James Verrier : ...but they are down. So, you\u2019re going to have obviously a reduction in margins and everything remain the same. I would say this, we changed our guidance from above 13% to approximately 13%. We\u2019re talking within 10, 20 basis points of movement here, okay. So, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s significant. I wouldn\u2019t say there\u2019s anything in it that we\u2019re concerned about or anything like. Is it possible our margins could still expand? Yes. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s anything significant or be concerned about in your analysis that you\u2019re doing right there. Brett Hoselton : Okay. That\u2019s fair enough, Ron. Thank you very much, gentlemen. James Verrier : All right, Brett. Ron Hundzinski : [ph] You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from Patrick Archambault with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Patrick Archambault : Hi. Yes. Good morning. Just actually one follow-up on my question. Can we just put into context, so your new organic growth is 7% to 8% and [indiscernible] on the math, but what was the organic in first and second quarter and what exactly is implied in the back half? Can we just go through that real quick? James Verrier : No, we\u2019re not going to be able to go through that real quick. [indiscernible], Pat. We can give you that though, Pat, but it\u2019s a complete walk, as you know, right? It would take us some time to go through that complete walk. Patrick Archambault : Okay. But I think you were 4%, right, this quarter and you were something similar, right, I think in the first quarter... James Verrier : Yes. Patrick Archambault : ...assuming that\u2019s correct, right? So, call it like mid-single digits in the first half even if we don\u2019t have the exact numbers. So, it does imply kind of an organic growth acceleration in the second half. And [indiscernible] and so that was really the crux of the question is I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a lot of stuff you could point to like the F-150 launch and everything like that, but I just wanted to go through the line items that are relevant there in driving that pick-up in the growth rate in the second half. James Verrier : Pat, what I can tell you at a very high level and then obviously we\u2019ll walk you through it later on. You\u2019re right. The first half organic was roughly 4%. It does accelerate in the second half year approach as I think between 7% to 8% organic growth. It\u2019s on a year-over-year comparable basis. So, the high level of those are the numbers. Patrick Archambault : And then just a follow-up like the main levers that you guys see to get to that acceleration. I\u2019m sure a lot of those are just timing of launches and things like that, but I wanted to specifically kind of hear that from you and kind of get a sense of what those are. James Verrier : So, we\u2019ll talk about it generally, Pat. Generally, we do see some pick-up in the backlog in the second half versus the first half and obviously, that North American program picking up steam is helpful in that regard. And secondly, the [indiscernible] in the second half which is [overlapping conversation] suppliers there. Ron Hundzinski : There\u2019s a little bit of mix there. Well - actually, I\u2019m sorry. That particular vehicle, the turbochargers are ours. Patrick Archambault : Okay. Terrific. Can you give a dollar content for the whole program or not? Maybe a rough range of what it looks like. James Verrier : It\u2019s a high-content vehicle for us, okay? Patrick Archambault : Okay. [indiscernible] with that. All right. Great. Thanks for [indiscernible]. James Verrier : All right. Thanks, [indiscernible]. Ron Hundzinski : Thanks. Ken Lamb : I\u2019d like to thank all of you for joining us. We expect to file our 10-Q before the end of the day, which will provide details of our results. If you have any follow-up questions about our earnings release, the matters discussed during this call or our 10-Q, please direct them to me. Melissa, please close out the call. Operator : That does conclude the BorgWarner 2015 second quarter results earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Melissa, and I will be your conference facilitator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BorgWarner 2015 Third Quarter Results Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Ken Lamb, VP of Investor Relations. Mr. Lamb, you may begin your conference. Ken Lamb : Thank you, Melissa. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. We issued our earnings release this morning at around 8 :00 AM Eastern Time. It\u2019s posted on our website, borgwarner.com, on our Investor Relations home page. A replay of today\u2019s conference call will be available through November 6. The dial-in number for that replay is 800-585-8367. You\u2019ll need the conference ID, which is 32249261 or you can listen to the replay on our website. With regard to our Investor Relations calendar, we will be attending the following conferences between now and our next earnings release. The Baird Industrials Conference in Chicago on November 9th, the Goldman Sachs Global Automotive Conference in London on December 3rd, and the Deutsche Bank Auto Industry Conference in Detroit on January 13th. A reminder our net new business announcement will not be in November but will be combined with our full year guidance announcement in January. Synchronizing the timing of these announcements ensures that our one year and three-year outlooks will be based on the same program volume, currency and launch timing assumptions, improving the link between the two. This is a permanent change going forward. Now, back to today\u2019s earnings release. Before we begin, I need to inform you that during this call, we may make forward-looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties as detailed in our 10-K. Our actual results may differ significantly from the matters discussed today. Now, moving on to our results, James Verrier, President and CEO, will review highlights of our quarterly operating results, as well as some of our recent noteworthy accomplishments. And then Ron Hundzinski, our CFO, will discuss the details of our quarterly results. Please note that we have posted a set of supplementary financial charts to the IR page of the website. You will find the link to this document at the Events & Presentation section beneath the notice for this conference call. We encourage you to follow along with these charts during Ron's discussion of our results. With that, I'll turn it over to James. James Verrier : Thank you, Ken, and good day, everybody. Ron and I are very pleased to review both third quarter results today, as well as some of our recent accomplishments. Let me just take a moment before I begin to thank all of the BorgWarner employees around the world for another good quarter. Now onto our results; so during the third quarter reported sales were just under $1.9 billion, now that's down 7% from a year ago but up 3% when we exclude the impact of foreign currencies. The U.S. GAAP earnings were $0.70 per share or $0.73 per share when we exclude non-recurring charges. Our operating income margin again excluding non-recurring charges was an impressive 13.3% in the quarter. So considering a lower than normal growth quarter, some of the restructuring inefficiencies and the new plants and plant expansions that we are managing this year, we view this as very good performance by our operations. Let me talk about the two segments. First of all, the Engine segment; so third quarter sales in the Engine segment were about $1.3 billion, that's down 7% from a year ago and when we exclude the impact of foreign currencies the segment grew at 4%. These results were primarily led by strong light-vehicle turbo sales particularly in Europe, partially offset by weaker market conditions in China and some weaker market conditions in commercial vehicles around the world. Now the Drivetrain segment, sales were $584 million, that's down 7% from a year ago or up 2% when we exclude foreign currencies. These results were primarily led by resurgent all-wheel-drive sales growth in North America and this was partially offset by the weaker market conditions in China. The major North American program ramp that had slowed Drivetrain sales growth over the previous four quarters did return to material volumes in the third quarter. We believe this program combined with benefits from the European restructuring will drive solid growth in margin expansion in Drivetrain in 2016. Our financial strength and strong performance is based on our ability to anticipate and drive the next technology ways. So as we look to the future BorgWarner continues to invest for the long term. Capital spending continues to grow. We spent about 7.3% of sales on capital in the third quarter which is above our long-term target of 5% to 6%. Typically our capital spending is primarily for machinery and equipment. However, our growth over the next several years does require investment in new plants and plant expansions which is driving some elevated spending in the near term. We do expect this to continue through the end of this year, after which we will return to normal spending levels. Our investment in R&D was 4% of sales in the quarter which is right in line with our target for the year and the intensity around organic integration and product development remains very strong. I am also proud to share some of the exciting announcements we made during the last few months. First of all, BorgWarner produces the 2-speed Torque-On-Demand transfer cases for the recently launched Foton Motor\u2019s Sauvana SUV. BorgWarner's Torque-On-Demand technology automatically redistributes the torque from the rear wheels to the front wheels without driver intervention for both improved traction, increased stability and enhanced dynamics. BorgWarner also received a 2014 World Excellence Award in the Aligned Business Framework category for exemplifying the Ford Motor Company\u2019s principles of quality, value and innovation. BorgWarner supplies silent engine timing chains for a wide variety of Yamaha vehicles. These include motorcycles, snowmobiles, all-terrain vehicles, recreational off-highway and personal watercrafts. Also BorgWarner supplies Eco-Launch stop/start accumulator technology and friction plates for the new 8-speed rear-wheel drive automatic transmission from General Motors. To enable the transmission\u2019s stop/start functionality, BorgWarner\u2019s system enables the transmission\u2019s stop/start functionality providing rapid and smooth engagements during engine restarts. This new transmission will improve fuel economy up to 5% compared with similar 6-speed automatic transmissions and it will debut on the 2016 Cadillac CT6 and will also drive the 2016 Cadillac CTS and ATS. BorgWarner produces its mini direct-acting variable force solenoid for the 2016 Chevy Volt, Chevy Malibu hybrid and Cadillac ELR. Designed to deliver increased accuracy with significantly lower leakage, the advanced solenoid reduces parasitic losses from the transmission oil pump, which saves battery power to propel the vehicle. Now let me move on and share a little bit of an overview on our updated guidance for 2015. We have narrowed our sales growth guidance range to the low end of the previous range. Our reported sales growth is now expected to be between minus 6% at the low end and minus 5% at the high end. This is compared with minus 5.5% to minus 2.5% previously. The change in our sales growth guidance is primarily related to two things. The impact of weaker than expected market conditions in China on our business and weak commercial vehicle markets around the world. Now when we exclude the impact of currency, our growth is expected to be approximately 4.5%. We also note our earnings guidance range. We now expect earnings to be within a range of $2.95 to $3 per diluted share and this compares with the $2.95 to $3.10 per diluted share previously. Our operating margin is expected -- still expected to be approximately 13%. Now Ron will provide a lot more details about our updated guidance shortly. So I am encouraged by our year-to-date performance and our outlook for the remainder of the year. Despite some challenging market conditions our full year guidance implies mid-single-digit growth and outstanding operating performance in 2015. And the restructuring and expansions activities, when they are through we have a clear transition to continue the strong performance in 2016 and beyond. So as you look ahead the industry's continued adoption of our leading edge Powertrain technology combined with operational excellence are the primary reasons that we have been, we still are and we will continue to be the leading order of supplier in terms of growth and operating performance. Now with that let me turn the call over to Ron. Ron Hundzinski : Thank you, James, and good day, everyone. Before I begin reviewing the financials, I also would like to commend all of our employees for their hard work in the quarter. Also as Ken mentioned I will be referring to supplemental financials slide deck and it is posted on our IR website. I do encourage you to follow along. Now, on to our financials. James already provided a detailed review our sales performance in the quarter. In summary as shown on Slide 2 of the slide deck, sales were down 7% from a year ago or 3% excluding the impact of foreign currencies. Working down the income statement, gross profit as a percentage of sales was 21.1% in the quarter or up 20 basis points from last year. During the same period SG&A as a percentage of sales was 7.9%, a 70 basis point improvement from a year ago. R&D spending, which is included in SG&A was 4%. You may have noticed that SG&A is nearly down $27 million year-over-year. Over half of this is related to currency. Of the remaining amount, corporate expenses were down $5 million and our [indiscernible] were down about $9 million. Operating income in the quarter was $237 million, excluding $9 million of restructuring charges and $4 million of M&A expenses related to the Remy transaction, operating income was $250 million or 13.3% of sales, up 80 basis points from a year ago as shown on Slide 3 of the slide deck. Excluding nonrecurring charges previously discussed, as well as the impact of foreign currencies, operating income was up $22 million on $66 million higher sales, giving us an incremental margin of 35%. As you look further down the income statement, equity and affiliate earnings was about $9 million in the quarter, down from $15 million last year. This line item represents the performance of NSK-Warner our 50/50 joint venture in Japan, which sell transmission components to our Japanese customers in Japan and China, as well as TEL, our turbocharger joint venture in India. Lower NSK-Warner sales in Japan and China was the primary reason for the decline in affiliate earnings. Interest expense and finance charges were $15 million in the quarter up from $9 million a year ago. The increase is primarily due to the $1 billion of fixed rate senior notes issued in the first quarter of 2015. Provision for income taxes in the quarter on a reported basis was $67 million. However, this included favorable tax adjustments of $6 million. You can read about each one of these adjustments in our 10-Q, which will be filed later today. Excluding, the adjustments the provision for income taxes was $73 million, which is an effective tax rate of 29.5% in the quarter. Our year-to-date effective tax rate is 29.5%, which is also our estimate for the full year. Net earnings attributable to non-controlling interest were about $9 million in the quarter up slightly from $6 million the third quarter of 2014. This line item reflects our minority partner's share in the earnings performance of our Korean and Chinese consolidated joint ventures. That brings us back to net earnings, which were $150 million in the quarter. Net earnings excluding nonrecurring items were $165 million or $0.73 per share. Now let's take a closer look at our operating units' segments in the quarter; beginning on Slide 4 of the slide deck. As James said earlier reported Engine segment net sales were about $1.3 billion in the quarter. Sales growth for the Engine segment excluding currency was 4% compared to same period a year ago. Turning to Slide 5, adjusted EBIT was $212 million for the Engine segment or 16.2% of sales. Despite inefficiencies related to investments in new plant construction and expansion and the Wahler restructuring, both of which are, for our emissions product family adjusted EBIT as a percentage of sales was up 40 basis points from a year ago. Excluding currency, the Engine segment's adjusted EBIT was up $10 million on $55 million of higher sales for an incremental margin of 17%. A very good performance given the level of investment activity within the segment. Plant construction and expansion currently in progress should be largely behind us by the end of 2015 and the restructuring plan for Wahler is on target after which we expect it to be a double-digit margin business. Now turning to Slide 6, Drivetrain segment net sales were $584 million in the quarter. Excluding currency, sales increased about 2% compared with the same period a year ago. On Slide 7, adjusted EBIT was $70 million for the Drivetrain segment or 12% of sales. Despite inefficiencies related to investments in the new DCT plant in China and restructuring plant in Europe, adjusted EBIT as a percentage of sales was up 120 basis points from a year ago. Excluding currency, the Drivetrain segment adjusted EBIT was up over $8 million on $10 million in higher sales for an incremental margin of nearly 90%. If you recall the third quarter of 2014 we had about $3 million of headwinds related to restructuring inefficiencies. We are beginning to see those headwinds dissipate as we get closer to completing the restructuring. This benefit is reflected in the higher incremental margin in this segment for the quarter. Drivetrain's European restructuring plant is on target and expected to be completed by the end of 2015. The ramp up of the new DCT plant in China which was expected to begin in early 2015 is under review considering the weaker than expected market conditions in China. The segment review highlights good progress on our restructuring and expansion plans, which will strengthen our competitive position and performance over the long-term. Now let's take a look at our balance sheet and cash flow. We generated $470 million of net cash from operating activities in the first nine months of 2015 down $76 million from $546 million a year ago. Weaker foreign currencies, higher cash outlays for restructuring and a few other miscellaneous items reduced net cash from operating activities in the first nine months of 2015 as compared with the same period a year ago. Capital spending was $419 million in the first nine months of 2015. This is up $21 million from a year ago. The increase was driven by capital required to support our backlog of net new business. Free cash flow, which we define as net cash from operating activities less capital spending was $51 million in the first nine months of 2015 down from $148 million in the first nine months of 2014. We expect to generate between $200 million and $250 million of free cash flow in 2015. Investments in restructuring and expansion that are driving elevated spending will soon be behind us. We expect spending to normalize beginning next year. Also our realignment plan which will provide increased treasury management flexibility will be complete. As a result we expect to see an increase in cash available for corporate initiatives beginning in 2016. We will quantify this improvement and clarify our intentions in our 2016 guidance call in January. Looking at the balance sheet itself; balance sheet debt increased by $469 million at the end of the third quarter in 2015 compared with the end of 2014. Cash increased by $236 million during the same period. The $233 million increase in net debt was primarily due to capital expenditures, dividend payments to shareholders and share repurchases. Our net debt to net capital ratio of 17% at the end of third quarter is up from 12.8% at the end of 2014. Net debt to EBITDA at the end of the year on a trailing 12 month basis is 0.6 times. Now I would like to discuss our updated guidance for 2015. James reviewed our guidance at a high-level, I will just discuss some of the finer points. We have narrowed our sales guidance to the low end of the previous range of minus 6% to minus 5% compared with the minus 5.5% to minus 2.5% previously. James described the weaker than expected market conditions that affected the change. Our business in China was the primary contributor. According to third-party sources light vehicle production in China was down 4% in the quarter. During that same period volumes at our four largest customers were down 12% in aggregate. And our sales growth in China for the quarter was flat. We expect our business in China to modestly improve to mid-single-digit growth in the fourth quarter. Our full year dollar-to-euro exchange rate assumption is $1.12, slightly higher than the previous assumed rate of $1.10. We have also narrowed our expected EPS within a range of $2.95 to $3 per share. The change in EPS guidance is primarily due to the impact of lower expected growth sales. Our share repurchase activity is gaining momentum. We spent $67 million on share repurchases in the third quarter and $130 million year-to-date. We still expect to spend $1 billion on share repurchases during the three-year period ending the first quarter of 2018. Our weighted average diluted share count is still expected to be approximately 226 million shares for 2015. Our operating income margin guidance is unchanged at approximately 13%. This implies a mid-teens incremental margin for the full year, incremental margins north of 20% in the fourth quarter. We continue to be confident in our ability to execute in any market. This company has demonstrated a heightened focus on efficiency and cost. This focus resulted in highly efficient growth and record margins in each of the last four years. With our solid growth and operations performing at a very high level 2015 should be another great year for BorgWarner. As we look beyond 2015 we intend to execute our growth plan yielding solid growth and to efficiently convert our sales growth to profits. The future is bright for BorgWarner. So with that I'd like to turn the call back over to Ken. Ken Lamb : Thanks, Ron. We are going to now move to the Q&A portion of the call. Melissa, please remind everyone of the Q&A procedure. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. Rich Kwas : Hi, good morning everyone. On Drivetrain Ron you talked about comping against some of the inefficiencies from last year but this is a pretty big step up in the margin. So it would seem like going forward here less than inefficiencies, leverage in some of your key platforms and there's an upward trajectory from here, is that the right way to think about it versus the 12% you have [trended] this quarter? Ron Hundzinski : Rich, I will say at this point it was a really good quarter, but the overall intent is for upward trajectory on margins in that segment, right. First thing I would note is that we did get a little bit favorability from North America F1 50 obviously because the volumes have returned, that also is driving some of the upper movement in that segment. Rich Kwas : Okay. Then just a broader question, I know you are not going to give the backlog until January and give your 2016 views then, but how should we think about growth for the company as in the current environment, assuming that the China production outlook is relatively modest next year and the developed markets are relatively modest as well? Just trying to get an understanding of where you think growth can go over the course for the next 12 months considering the landscape and considering what's happened with some of your key customers within the backlog that you provided last year at this time? James Verrier : Rich, this is James. Maybe what I will do is take a shot if I can and just giving you a little bit of high level commentary and then I want to ask Ken to talk maybe a little bit more specifically about maybe some of the math about how to think about the details of the backlog if that works for you. So I think, as we kind of transition through this year first of all and we are looking to pinpoint mid-single-digit type of growth which clearly is pretty decent. The two headwinds that we really faced from a macro point as we have gone through the year are commercial vehicle and China. China being obviously the bigger piece of that. So those are the two kind of headwinds that we have kind of have faced this year. I think it's fair to say as you look at commercial vehicle going into next year we are not looking for meaningful improvement in those end markets. I think in China what we are looking for from a light vehicle perspective as we look to next year in China, Rich, is 3% to 5% type growth rate of the market in China. As you know our content will grow well above that market rate in China because of the adoption of our technology. So we are looking for a strong growth here in China next year and that coupled with other elements of our backlog we are looking for a good growth here next year. But I am going to ask Ken to just put a little bit more detailed commentary around that so he can help you from a math point, Rich. Ken Lamb : Thanks, James. This is Ken. Based on the preamble of your question you are not expecting a lot I think. But we want to be as transparent as we can be about where we think we are throughout next year. So let's talk about the math a little bit. So rough math, this year's backlog is coming in at about 55% of what we expected coming into the year. Now with the conditions that caused that lower growth persist into next year and you know the conditions I am referring to is our business in China and commercial vehicles. Then we can reasonably assume that the backlog will come down similar levels next year. So essentially what we are saying is that's about cutting it in half. Then once you layer on the potential impact of other macro risk factors, it's reasonable to expect that we are looking at low-to-mid single-digit growth next year. Now regarding these other macro factors, if you look at the last five years we have had recessions, natural disasters, debt crisis, currency devaluations, business disruptions at some of our largest customers, just to name a few. The magnitude of the impact of these factors has varied for us but they all have had an impact. We intend to do a better job accounting for these risks in our guidance going forward. Did that answer your question. Rich Kwas : Yes. So I mean basically 55% of $1.1 billion that you provided last year at this time and then what are the -- what's the other color around the macro factors that you are saying will be down? Ken Lamb : Well I don\u2019t know that we have any data -- numeric data to attach to that. We just want you to know that that's something that we are definitely going to be considering as we come through with guidance next year. Rich Kwas : Okay. So that would be developed markets and other things that are going on basically. Ken Lamb : Yes. Sure. Rich Kwas : Okay. I will pass it on. Thanks. James Verrier : Thanks, Rich. Operator : Your next question comes from John Murphy with Bank of America. Your line is open. John Murphy : Good morning guys. I could just follow-on just on that top line thought process. Is there any change in your view of the revenue generation that Remy will bring in next year? And if you could remind us roughly what you would expect that to be for '16? James Verrier : Yes. John this is James here. It was about $1.2 billion is the approximate revenue stream that we were expecting to generate from Remy. Obviously we are going through the [close pressure] so we are going through some additional validations and we will bring a more accurate number of course for the meeting in January. But we are not expecting a meaningful shift away from that $1.2 billion number, is a good way to think of it John. John Murphy : So if we layer that onto your base business this year and you had say sort of 5% to 6%, I am sorry -- low-to-mid single-digit growth is what you said, Ken is sort of the combination of those two would be a decent way to think about it? Ken Lamb : I think that's right. So the low-to-mid single digit growth was on the base business and then later on Remy on top of that. John Murphy : All right. Just want to make sure we are clear on that. Second question, Ron, you talked about some delays or sort of some real stalls here in this DCT launch in China, yet you are getting up the F150 really ramping up pretty hardcore here and you are getting the restructuring in Eastern Europe working fairly well and should be running full throttle as far as benefits in '16. Is there any reason to think the Drivetrain should have a margin not above 12% next year, just given all those big guys? But is China really going to derail this or is that something then won't be that bad? Ron Hundzinski : So these negative there, I agree that it should be above 12%, John. The DCT plant is a Western OEM and at this point of all the headwinds we have had in DCT in China that's really basically the last one left, I would just say it that way. But we will give more color on that impact as I said in my script and will actually articulate exactly that headwind that we might see next year. But the bottom line is that the margin going forward should be known for that 12%. John Murphy : Okay. That's helpful. And then just lastly, if you think about capital and free cash flow, looks like there was a down tick in your free cash flow guidance to the $250 million, I think it previously $250 million to $300 million. What's the key driver of that? And as you think of maybe that might in the same context of the share repos, why don\u2019t you think you would be more aggressive with share repos just given what's happened with the stock more recently? Ron Hundzinski : Well, again, this movement in free cash flow, the combination of a little bit in earnings and a little bit items on the balance sheet movement. But to get back to the more important question right now we surely intend to be more aggressive. If you look at the year-to-date number it's not a well represented number because we had a self-imposed blackout period during the Remy acquisition. Our intent quite frankly is to be more aggressive given where the stock price is, I can just say that John. John Murphy : Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you. James Verrier : Thanks, John. Operator : Your next question comes from Chris McNally with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Chris McNally : Good morning, guys. I just wanted to -- its very helpful, appreciate the color on the '16 backlog. I think everyone was just trying to triangulate those numbers. But as we look at the 55% number, I mean you have given detail in the past about roughly 40% of your backlog coming from Asia. And then obviously the commercial vehicles are weak on top of that. I mean to get to the 55% could you just talk about how much of the backlog is pushed out from '15 to '16 to later years because of lower volumes related to the Chinese market? Because the math would suggest you are losing almost 100% of the Asian backlog. And so, if you could just give some color about potentially what's lost versus what was pushed out by year or two even -- from '15-'16 into '16-'17? Thank you. Ken Lamb : So the way I want to frame this is we provided that sort of directional guidance to help you think about where things may land. As far as the split of backlog, how much is going to be Asia, how much is Europe-North America, how much of its push out and how much of it is just program cuts, you got to give us a little bit of time to work through that. I think as we sit here today Asia as a percentage of the backlog is coming down. That's the market where we are having the most impact from what's going in the world today. In commercial vehicle the percentage of the backlog is also very likely coming down. Let us hold through that, what we wanted was to people to have a good sense for where we think we're headed next year. We will give more details in January. Chris McNally : Okay. Maybe just quantitatively if we take out China and CV would the backlog numbers for all other global production would they have come down as well and so that we are essentially near the $1.1 billion number that we were referencing probably would have been lower regardless other than a weak China and a weak commercial vehicle? Ken Lamb : Well. Sure. If you want to kind of recap the year and the things that affected the backlog we talked about primarily China, our mix of business in China. We have talked about the commercial vehicle issues around the world. We had some issues with the Asia launches that were coming down last year. We had some mix issues in North America as well. As I kind of go over those four or five topics, the two persistent ones is the impact of China and commercial vehicles. The mix issue in North America, we think that's going to normalize with the F150 coming back on screen for us. And the Asia launches that's all linked to China. China kind of drives that whole market anyway. So let us continue to do some work on that. But I think you are speaking about it correctly. We just have to work through the numbers for you. Chris McNally : Okay. Thanks, Ken. Thanks guys. Operator : Your next question comes from David Leiker with Baird. Your line is open. David Leiker : Good morning everyone. I am going to take one last stab at this comment about the backlog. How much of the short fall that you are seeing from the backlog that's realized this year is coming from currency? I think when you did the backlog last year you had enough pretty high euro value in there. Ken Lamb : I think we are $1.20 [texture]. But the European portion of the backlog was pretty small. It was remember coming into the year we thought it was going to be what 15% of the backlog. So the euro while it came down significantly, it didn\u2019t move the backlog number. David Leiker : Appreciate the increased transparency with everything, the slides and the commentary so far. I want to see if I can go one step further. Can you give us some quantitative ideally but qualitative perspective in terms of the revenue performance by region in the quarter? Ron Hundzinski : I gave you some David. I told you basically in China we were flat, that was in the script. David Leiker : Right. In the down market. Ron Hundzinski : In a down market and actually the comparable was to our customers in that market was down 12 and we were flat even though the market was four. David Leiker : About Europe and North America. James Verrier : We are just looking at the data. Ron Hundzinski : Because remember we had modest growth in both of those regions in the light vehicle area. Both North America and Europe we did grow modestly, and obviously in commercial vehicles not much growth at all. David Leiker : Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from Brett Hoselton with KeyBanc. Your line is open. Brett Hoselton : Good morning gentlemen. Two questions here. First on 2015 margins lower sales guidance but you maintained your margin guidance. Kind of what are the offsets there? Normally you would expect a little downward leverage there? Ron Hundzinski : On just really good operational performance. I mean we had a good third quarter. As you can see we are anticipating that to continue that performance level. So that we didn't feel that we need to take down the margin when the sales came down that we could still hold the margin. And it's probably through just good operations performance that's what's going on there Brett. Brett Hoselton : Then as you think about 2016 margins, I know you are not going to provide guidance here. But can you kind of talk about some of the major puts and takes there, pluses or minuses that you see. James Verrier : So we have been very clear about our objective is to get mid-teens incremental. So if you take sales and assign mid teens incremental that's the starting point. Now so some of the items that are going to be a tailwind for us, these inefficiencies we would see in for three quarters this year and we said that those inefficiencies will be tailwinds for us. So you take the mid-teens incrementals and then add in the inefficiencies that will now be headwinds and they will be on top of it. So the end result would be higher than mid-teens incremental margins going into next year. Brett Hoselton : And these inefficiencies can you just remind me what they were -- not necessarily what they were but how much they were? Ron Hundzinski : Sure. So remember in the second quarter we were seeing -- while first and second quarter and actually last year we're seeing anywhere from about $3 million I think the high was what $7 million, $8 million in the third quarter headwinds and it was bouncing around some time to be $4 million or $5 million. I think the worst stretch was that second quarter around $7 million of headwinds. It's somewhere between this $3 million to $7 million. The first time we saw it was a year ago in the third and was at $3 million, I referred in my script. So it's been between that number $3 million to $7 million. Now I am not seeing all that dissipate all 7 or 5 whatever number you use but the majority of that will. Some of it's normal activity that we have always things going on but majority is going to dissipate as we go into next year. Ken Lamb : Minor correction, $9 million. Ron Hundzinski : What was it $9 million in the second quarter? Ken Lamb : Yes. Brett Hoselton : $3 million in the first and kind of $9 million-ish in the second something along those lines. Ron Hundzinski : That $9 million was what we have -- first I think $9 million is the worst we are going to see quite frankly and that was in the second quarter. So it was bouncing between actually probably $5 million to $7 million was really the average, $9 million was the high end. Now again you can't just take simple $6 million to $7 million take that off the table, but some good portion of that will off the table. Brett Hoselton : Yes. Was there an impact in the third quarter specifically? Ron Hundzinski : No impact. That's well the year-over-year difference was favorable, right, that's what drove the high 120 basis points of improvement in the Drivetrain segment because we didn\u2019t have that headwind. So it is a good example of what we are trying to talk about here and why the incremental was 90%. Brett Hoselton : Thank you gentlemen. Operator : Your next question comes from Brian Johnson with Barclays. Your line is open. Dan Levy : This is Dan Levy on for Brian. Thanks for taking the questions. First question are you seeing any signs of program delays from any of your larger customers to may have been impacted by certain issues in the past quarter? James Verrier : Okay. Let me take a shot at that and answer this answer. I think know maybe which OEM you maybe referring to and the answer is we have not. We have seen no impact on any of our product development activities and we have really not seen anything relative to the engineering activity or launch activity with the customer that I think you are referring to. Dan Levy : Okay. More broadly on the diesel front, any signs that the diesel activity globally and I guess specifically within Europe still remains intact? James Verrier : Yes. Thanks for the question. If I can, I think this is kind of an important issue relative to specifically I think the two things that I would like to just address to the group here. The first one is, the Volkswagen specific emissions issue. I think it would be good for us to put some context on that and how that impacts or potentially impacts BorgWarner. Secondly, I will talk a little bit more generically around diesel specifically and any concerns that maybe an overhang on diesel. So let me start with Volkswagen and I think it's really important that I try and provide again some additional clarity and transparency around this. If I start with the Volkswagen business for BorgWarner it represents about 16% of our total revenue of the company. Significantly 4% of our total sales were a quarter of the Volkswagen business is tied to light vehicle diesel engine products. So I hope that provides a little bit of clarity. So what's really kind of in debate so to speak is about 4% of the total business for BorgWarner on diesel light vehicle products for Volkswagen. When we look from the BorgWarner perspective of the affected engines that have been disclosed by Volkswagen that breaks down to less than 0.5% of total revenue for BorgWarner. I think this is really a critical point I am trying to make because I know you guys have been trying to wrestle with that what's the exposure, what\u2019s the impact to BorgWarner and again the affected engines that Volkswagen have publicly talked about that breaks down to about 0.5% or less of our total revenue stream. If anybody would like a little bit more clarity and color on how we get to the 0.5% please feel free to follow-up because Ken's happy to provide that additional level of detail. So when I say that it frames it from a BW perspective it's really not a particularly meaningful impact. On top of that I want to be clear that from a schedule and releases perspective to Volkswagen we have seen no impact. We have seen no adjustments, no impact on our schedules. Furthermore I think the other point I will point out relative to specifically on the Volkswagen issue. Our opinion is as they go through the recall transition efforts next year we see that there will be no impact on BorgWarner because our products are not involved in any of the recall solutions. So hopefully that just gives you a little bit of clarity and a little bit of color. The message fundamentally to that issue is we are not seeing an impact. Now let me quickly transition and take a moment just to talk about the broader perspective of diesel. So I think it's fair to say we have been talking over the last couple of years that the slowdown in diesel adoption has been expected. We have seen that and proactively been managed around that. We still see that transition around a [slowing] adoption of diesel being a relatively slower trend over several years and part of that is because we still see diesel being a key element of the customer's plans to get to the fuel economy and emissions standards. I want to also give you a little bit of clarity and color, light vehicle diesel sales is about 15% to 20% of total BorgWarner just to give you a frame. So what we are talking about here is what's in play of diesel is about 15% to 20% of total BorgWarner revenue. So that's important. As we -- as the transition moves from diesel to gas we have talked quite openly about this, that in the short run as this transition occurs the way to think of it on a diesel engine for BorgWarner, BorgWarner related on a comparable advanced gasoline engine, BorgWarner gets about 70% of the content on a gas engine versus a diesel engine currently. That actually over time is evolving because we are having more and more content to gasoline engines, such as ETR valves and ETR coolers. So over the long run and I am talking two, three, five years, gas-diesel will become a relatively neutral event from the BorgWarner perspective. I know I have shared quite a lot of information there but I think I do recognize from the various conversations how important those two issues are relative to BorgWarner and I wanted to take some time to clarify that and hopefully that did. And of course if there is any follow-up questions we could take those now or later through Ken. Dan Levy : Thank you very much. That's very helpful. Operator : Your next question comes from Itay Michaeli with Citi. Your line is open. Itay Michaeli : Great. Thank you. Good morning. Just want to go back to the backlog discussion. Ken with the 55% arithmetic for 2016 and also roughly applied to 2017, the reason I am asking is just because if you kind of apply that it does make the 2020 revenue even if you adjust a little bit for M&A and FX kind of implies an acceleration in the last three years. And if so maybe talk about booking activity and kind of you know the visibility around the trajectory over the next five years or so? Ken Lamb : It's a great question. So let me answer it this way. So the part where we were talking about making sure that we account for macro rich factors in our backlog, I think that it's fair to say that we intend to apply that thinking to the entire backlog. Now the actual cutting the backlog in half directionally and how that applies to the out years of the backlog is still under development. I can directionally that's probably a pretty fair way to think about it. We have to continue to work through that. But we expect the backlog in those out years to also come down kind of at similar level but again we have to work through that. I am going to let James speak to the 2020 target of $15 billion, but that's kind of in the next few years is kind of the way we are thinking about it. James Verrier : I think Ken explained that very well. Let me say a couple of things that I think may help a little bit here Itay, because what you are hearing is, you are hearing that there is some macro headwinds sort of a challenge for us a little bit right. It's primarily again China and its commercial vehicle. What I would say is important for people to think about it is, what you are not hearing about is the adoption rates of our technology slowing because we have not seen that We are still seeing continued strong desire and adoption rates for all of our products at a similar rate. That's when we talked you to what we have -- we probably have been talking about the last couple of years. The reason that's important that still gives us tremendous confidence actually as we look out to the future for the growth of the product. We do recognize this year we faced some headwinds and as Ken said that will spill into '16 and somewhat into '17. But again the adoption rates of our products remain very, very strong from the technology point of view, which leads us to have very good confidence in mid-single-digit growth outlook. Again part of the $15 billion by 2020 is additional acquisitions that we remain focused on. So the fundamental story here, Itay, is not changing. BorgWarner's technology adoption is strong. We are going to be a strong growth company but we are in a little bit of a transition period this year and somewhat into next year as well. But still delivering single-digit growth which we feel is very strong in this industry and clearly obviously we are converting that into strong EPS performance. Itay Michaeli : That's very helpful and thanks so much. Operator : Your next question comes from Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Joseph Spak : Thanks, good morning everyone. And just to reiterate thanks for all the additional color and commentary. Just going back to Volkswagen mainly from the other side of that equation. I mean they have been out publicly talking about going after some big savings from the supply base to try to deal with some of the costs they are going to have to incur. I was wondering, if that's -- if any of that sort of that creeped into your discussions and if at all or if not how you feel you are positioned to handle with what seems like it would be more difficult conversation going forward? James Verrier : Yes. Certainly Joe, we sure saw some of the information and we pay a lot of attention to that of course. Frankly at this stage we have not seen I would say meaningful increased pressure specifically around pricing reductions and those types of things. I think our mindset right now, Joe, is it may likely intensify as we go forward. But our belief right now is that we can push back and contain that and stay somewhat in the range of [indiscernible] we have done over many years which is in the 1.5% to 2%. So quick answer, yes, we expect the intensity to come. We feel comfortable about our ability to deal with that and not deviate from our historical annual [IRF] type numbers that we provided. Joseph Spak : Okay. Just one more on the backlog. I mean you pointed out Ken and Ron that Europe was much lower for next year, which I believe was a result that you are talking about decreased diesel penetration there. So is that -- do you believe that any shift from in diesel and the impact from Volkswagen that's not one of the factors related to the backlog for next year or is that contained in maybe sort of the more conservative macro view you are taking? Ken Lamb : Yes. That's a good clarification there. So that's a good way to think about it. Our view in diesel has been pretty well-established in the backlog. We brought that up last year, I am sure you remember when we came out with the new backlog back in 2014. So yes, the changes are mostly happening in the areas that we talked about, which would be China and commercial vehicle. Diesel's kind of already built into that. And to James' point earlier, the impact of the Volkswagen issue is diminished. So that's not expected to impact our backlog as we sit here today. So I think as you think about it that the Europe is probably as a percentage of the total backlog is going to go higher because that feels like probably the most stable region for us out of the three between the Americas, Asia and Europe. Joseph Spak : Okay. I will pass on thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Patrick Archambault with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Patrick Archambault : I guess just a couple of follow-ups. The margin improvement in Drivetrain was obviously very, very strong year-on-year. It seems like you posted a little bit of margin improvement as well on the Engine side like 40, 50 basis points. I was just wondering, I think you have laid out the trajectory for further Drivetrain improvements pretty nicely. But how do we think about the growth potential on margins in Engine, are we getting -- are we close to levels that they are likely to be or is there some upside potential there as well? James Verrier : I would say that our objective has always been mid-teens. Now the question is how you define mid-teens. But I would say that Engine still has room for improvement. Patrick Archambault : And if you were to benchmark like the main drivers is it just efficiencies with better growth or anything sort of more specific than that? James Verrier : Well we have a couple of things. One is the growth and being able to convert in the mid-teens is above the average now. That's one area. The second one which is probably more important is the Wahler acquisition is going to gain momentum as time goes on. And quite frankly somewhat of a drag on our margins now as we go forward and then become a double-digit business that will start to move margins up. And then someday I don\u2019t know when commercial vehicle might actually start being a net tailwind for us and that will obviously start driving margins up too. But I am not going to predict that for '16, that's somewhere down the road. Patrick Archambault : Yes, I hear you on that last one. Just on the revenue side did you -- I mean I guess I will keep this question including FX because I guess that's the simplest way to take it. But your new guidance I guess midpoint of down 5.5% implies that your fourth quarter is down about 2% and you've been down about 7% year-to-date. I understand that currency is probably a big part of that improvement, right, if you think if it's just a delta as we progress year-on-year going from down 7% to down 2%. I guess the F150 would be another piece. I guess what are the -- how do we think about the improvement there? Ken Lamb : I am going to start this and Ron can follow up. You know a couple of things for Q4. First of all you are right, the F150 is kind of a major mover of our growth in Q4 which was last year and also you have to remember Q4 2014 is where we took a major currency hit. That's when this all kind of started and then that dissipating relative to the previous quarters. So the impact of currency year-over-year is a little bit less, so that's helping us a little bit on the growth side. Patrick Archambault : Okay. So it sounds like it's those two main things, right? Ken Lamb : I think that that's fair. Patrick Archambault : Okay. And then final just one housekeeping for me. The timing of Remy I think you had previously said closing in the fourth quarter are we still on track for that? James Verrier : Yes. We are Patrick. The only thing really left is the regulatory approval from China which we didn\u2019t process. So we are anticipating an early to mid November closing is what we are on track for as it stands today. So we are looking forward to that for sure. Patrick Archambault : Okay. Got it. Thanks a lot guys. Operator : Your next question comes from Colin Langan with UBS. Your line is open. Colin Langan : Can I have a follow-up on the European light vehicle diesel. When you talk about 15% to 20% of your sales does that -- I mean is that total diesel or is there a chunk in there that's commercial vehicle which would be almost very unlikely to be impacted? And then can you also talk about you relative share in Europe on gas and diesel products? I mean are you pretty balanced on both products or is some -- you have had a strong position in your Europe are you more leveraged today market share wise on diesel products? James Verrier : Yes. Colin let me take a shot at -- or at least to clarify your first question. And then maybe Ken can offer you a little bit of commentary on the European split between gas and diesel. Just to -- what I wanted to do is to clarify, so light vehicle diesel sales are about 15% to 20% of the total company revenue. If that makes sense to you. So we deliberately wanted to exclude the commercial vehicle piece in terms of how we look at that. So it's 15% to 20% light vehicle diesel sales of our total overall BorgWarner revenue. So that frames it for you. Does that clarify for you? Colin Langan : Yes. That's exactly about what I was talking about. Ken Lamb : I will take part two of that. So the commentary that we had made around $0.70 on a $1 of content for advanced gasoline engines versus diesel, that's kind of a direct comment on our mix of business in Europe diesel versus gas, okay. Two other factors, that gap is closing over time. There is going to be more and more content on gas engines as we continue to evolve in that market. We have seen that happening over the last few years and that's going to continue going forward. And secondly our market share for gasoline turbochargers is higher than it is for diesel today and it's only continuing to get stronger going forward. So that's going to give us a bit of a lift as we see the shift from diesel towards gas. A few points higher for gas than it is for diesel. Colin Langan : Okay. That's very helpful. You talked earlier about take rates being stable, but I think some of the recent award data shows that turbo take rates are flat year-over-year which is consistent but they have been growing for the last few years. Has that been a factor in your outlook for this year that you would have probably anticipated if gas wasn't so cheap that take rates would have actually continued to grow? And when do you think that starts to reaccelerate because I can't getting to the 2025 standards without more turbo adoption? James Verrier : Yes. Let me take a shot at that. We have not seen a slowdown in [indiscernible] penetration rates at all actually. As we look -- and primarily as you know Colin the two primarily areas of the world are increasing rapidly on penetration is China and North America and we are not seeing slowdown in the adoption rates fundamentally of the technology, if I can start there. What you do see a little bit is of course there is some volume reductions of which we have seen this year in China obviously and we have seen some launch impacts in Asia which could be turbo related. But that's got nothing fundamentally to do with slowdown of adoption rates of turbo. If that helps you? Colin Langan : That's very helpful. Then just last question, can you give any color on the margin direction? I am trying to bug in the numbers. It seems like margin -- sales should be up a little bit -- margin direction quarter-over-quarter, seems like sales should be up a bit but margins look fairly flattish. I mean how should we think margins [indiscernible]? Ron Hundzinski : Are you talking sequentially or are you talking into the fourth quarter? Colin Langan : Yes. To Q4, yes. Ron Hundzinski : I think if you do the math it will be down slightly sequentially more in line with what you saw in the better half of the year. Colin Langan : And in fact usually the seasonality better at [indiscernible] production? James Verrier : Yes. But we have some other offsets going on that we anticipate in the fourth quarter on the costs side that probably might bring that down right now. So that's booked in the guidance. If you do the math on the guidance you will have slightly lower margins in the fourth -- from the third but it will be more in line what you saw in the first half of the year. I am going to even go one step further. You can see that our SG&A expense was quite lower in Q3 and we don\u2019t think that's going to be the run rate going into Q4. The Q4 run rate for SG&A is probably going to be more like the average over the three quarters for the first part of the year. If that helps and certainly in the SG&A line in there. Colin Langan : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : We have time for one final question and that question comes from Dan Galves with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Dan Galves : To kind of following up on Patrick's question. On organic growth into Q4, it seems like you and the guys need to do somewhere 7%, 8%, 9% in Q4. Can you talk about what your organic growth expectation is specifically for Q4 and if there is a big acceleration from the first three quarters of the year why wouldn't that slow into at least the first half of next year? Ron Hundzinski : I think that the math indicates that the fourth quarter organic growth about foreign currency is around 5% which is slightly above year-to-date average I guess at this point. I think that's how the math works out. Not -- I think you had a higher number. Dan Galves : Yes. My mistake. Thanks guys. Ken Lamb : I\u2019d like to thank all again for joining us. We expect to file our 10-Q before the end of the day, which will provide details of our results. If you have any follow-up questions about our earnings release, with the matters discussed during this call or our 10-Q, please direct them to me. Melissa, please close out the call. Operator : That does conclude the BorgWarner 2015 third quarter results earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BorgWarner 2015 Fourth Quarter and Full Year End Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Ken Lamb, VP of Investor Relations. Mr. Lamb, you may begin your conference. Ken Lamb : Thank you, Melissa. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. We issued our earnings release this morning at around 8 :00 a.m. Eastern Time. It's posted on our Web site, borgwarner.com, on our Investor Relations home page. A replay of today's conference call will be available through February 18. The dial-in number for that replay is 800-585-8367. You'll need the conference ID, which is 25547967 or you can listen to the replay on our Web site. With regard to our investor relations calendar, we will be attending the following conferences between now and our next earnings release; The Barclays Industrial Conference in Miami on February 17 and the BofA Merrill Lynch New York Auto Summit in New York on March 23. Now, back to today's earnings release. Before we begin, I need to inform you that during this call, we may make forward-looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties as detailed in our 10-K. Our actual results may differ significantly from the matters discussed today. Now, moving on to our results, James Verrier, President and CEO, will comment on the industry and provide a high level overview of our results and expectations for 2016. And then Ron Hundzinski, our CFO, will discuss the details of our results and guidance. Please note that we have posted an earnings call presentation to the IR page of the Web site. You'll find the link at the events and presentation section beneath the notice for this conference call. We encourage you to follow along with these charts during the discussion. With that, I will turn it over to James. James Verrier : Thank you, Ken. And welcome to everybody. Thank you for joining us this morning for the call. As Ken alluded to, I'm going to provide some high-level commentary around both the industry and around BorgWarner. I will give a brief recap of some of our financial numbers and then Ron will go through the details around those numbers. So, I am now on Slide 1 for those of you following along with the deck. And I'm going to just provide a few overview comments about the macro and industry. Let me just start at a general high level. And I think what we are experiencing at BorgWarner just like everybody else, in general is a lot of uncertainty out in the world. And whether that's reflected in oil prices, strength of the dollar, Middle East and challenges. We do see a lot of uncertainty out there. But I think what we also see is a pretty solid auto industry. Now, I will provide more color and detail around that as I go through my comments here. But my message really is in spite of all of that macro uncertainty, we see strength in the auto sector. The other comment I'd like to just proactively talk a little bit about is China. And as you know, China is a really critical market for the growth of BorgWarner. So I want to spend a moment and just provide some overview there. So, as we go into the year, we see GDP levels for China in the mid-single digit type of a range. We see auto production in a like vehicle auto production in about 3% to 5% growth environment. We do see the incentive programs and initiatives that were enacted towards the end of last year. Our assumption is that they will continue on through the majority if not all of this year and you will see later in our numbers that did provide some benefit for us. So, our view on China is, we see a decent level of stability around GDP and auto production. And that gives us encouragement with such a lot of growth for the business in China. I will make a couple of comments specifically around the markets. I would start with, say, our views on production numbers for light vehicle and commercial vehicle are pretty aligned with IHS. And what that means for us, we see North America now starting to plateau or peak type numbers in the 17.5-ish range. We see China as I alluded to earlier at about 3% to 5% growth in light vehicle. And Europe -- the environment for Europe is somewhere between a 1% to 2% growth environment for light vehicle production. Commercial vehicle we see still remains quite challenged. We're going into a year where on an aggregate basis globally we see little or no growth in commercial vehicle. As you go around the regions in the segments, there is a little bit of differentiation but fundamentally we see still a pretty challenged commercial vehicle space. I wanted to share with you what I would describe the areas of watch that we at BorgWarner are paying close attention to as the year evolves. And I would say that the three major areas that we are paying a lot of attention to are commercial vehicle, as I mentioned, can there be upside there, could it deteriorate a little worse? So, we are paying a lot of attention to that. We are paying close attention to the China incentives and how that will play out through the year. And clearly for us our biggest customer remains Volkswagen. So we pay a lot of attention to what is going on at Volkswagen. But I would say to summarize on the market outlook, I would say so many things are playing out as we'd expected as we came into the year and that's what we are seeing reflected through the first six weeks of the year as we're going forward. Let me switch a moment and provide a couple of comments on the regulatory and technology environment. I would say very importantly for us, we still see a very strong drive for fuel economy and emissions regulations. We see no slippage in driving interest from our customers around cafe and other programs. In fact, the latest example we saw in Europe with the real drive and emissions standard for us points to further evidence of strong drive for enacting greater fuel economy and emissions standards. We've also seen the pace of the transition to increase electrification of the power train continues to gain momentum. And importantly for everybody on the call to know, we are aware of that because we are right in the middle of it as BorgWarner. We are meeting and discussing with multiple customers, many different architectures involving our products on 12-volt, 48-volt, mild hybrids, pure electrics, the whole spectrum of electrified power trains. We are right in the middle of that. And that's what's driving and building our growth for the long-term. I thought it would be good to share the electrification effort for BorgWarner is not just a long-term phenomenon. As we look here, right now in the year of 2016, I just want to give you an example, we are on pace to ship about 15,000 single speed transmissions for pure electric vehicles in China this year. So it's both a now story and a future story. The last comment around diesel, at this point we are not seeing any real shift in mix between gas and diesel in the short run. We do know as we talked about in prior calls there will be a transition to more gas engines from diesel overtime and we fell BorgWarner is very well positioned to take advantage of that trend. Let me now switch and give a few high level comments about BorgWarner specifically. I will start with a recap of 2015, and again, Ron will provide a lot more detail and color around these numbers after myself. So from a Q4 perspective, it was a really good finish to the year for us. I think from a growth perspective and an operating performance, we ended the year strongly. We were $2.1 billion of sales for the quarter, which is up 7% when we exclude both currency and Remy. And our EPS performance on a comparable basis is about $0.75 with strong performance and also the operating margins reported at 12.6 but significantly when we exclude Remy that was an impressive 13.2%. If I break Q4 out by segment, Engine sales were about $1.4 billion, which is a growth of 1% on a reported basis but 10% when we exclude currency. That was primarily driven by very strong turbocharger sales. On the Drivetrain side for the quarter $735 million that's up 20% but clearly Remy is a big influence there when you strip out Remy, it was about 1% growth. Two things that impacted the growth on the Drivetrain side we had very strong all-wheel-drive growth in North America and that was offset by lower growth on transmission in Europe. For the full year sales reported $8 billion, that's down 3% from 2014. But when we exclude Remy and FX and Wahler, it was up 4.3%. EPS 270, when we exclude non-comparables and Remy was $3.02 per share. Operating margin for the full year 13%, again, when we exclude Remy, an impressive 13.2%. And I think key for the business is we continue to drive investment for the growth for the future of the company and in the two key metrics, I focus on to make sure we are driving the growth, CapEx came in at 7.2% for the year and R&D was about 4% when we exclude Remy both of those give me strong confidence that we are investing for the future. Now, 2015 is behind us. And we are into 2016. So let me move and give comments on 2016. I would say as we started into the year and as we've gone into the year, we have an optimistic view on the year. We feel good about the year ahead of us. Today, we are reiterating our guidance both for Q1 and the full year that we announced in Detroit last month, and again, Ron will provide detailed commentary around that in a moment. I'm also pleased that we have largely got the restructuring efforts that we put a lot of work into over the last 18 months behind us so we can get that benefit as we go into the year. And we are heading into the year on pace to deliver mid-single digit growth and strong operating performance. The last thing I would like to address is just some highlights around growth for the company. Let me just start and make a few comments about Remy. We are very, very pleased with the acquisition. I think from a strategic perspective this was a really critical transaction for BorgWarner and we're going to talk more about that through the year. The integration on a pragmatic basis is going very well both from an operating perspective and a financial perspective. But I think I want to comment positive we are about the technology and as I mentioned earlier, we got multiple customers engaged in discussions around the combination of the Remy product line and the BorgWarner product line, particularly a lot of discussion around the combination of Remy's rotating electric motor machines and our clutch technology around hybrid vehicles a lot of emphasis and a lot of momentum we're gaining. Couple of other recent growth announcements that we made, we did announce the GEN-5 electro hydraulic all-wheel-drive coupling that will be on the Volvo XC90 vehicle. And we also announced engine timing and VCT product lines on the Hyundai V6 gas engines. I would say that I quote and our booking cadence remain strong and solid and is in line with our growth expectations. And as I mentioned earlier, the drive on electrification around the power train momentum continues for us. So I would summarize it this way. 2015 we had some challenges in 2015. We acknowledge that. And we're now going forward into 2016 with a lot of confidence. The business is operating very well. And we are heavily focused on driving the growth that we made through the adoption of our technology. And I think the last and most importantly, we are upbeat and we're positive about delivering on the guidance that Ron is going to take you through right now. So with that, I will turn the call over to Ron. Thank you. Ron Hundzinski : Thank you, James. And good day, everyone. Before I begin reviewing the financials, I would like to commend all of our employees for their hard work in the quarter and more specifically a great finish to the year. Also as Ken mentioned, I will be referring to the supplemental financial slide deck that is posted on our IR Web site. I encourage you to follow along. Now on to our financials. Let's start on Slide 3. Sales on a reported basis were up 6.6%. However, to get a clear picture of how the core business performed, we exclude impact of FX and Remy. And excluding those items, sales are up 7.1%. Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 21% in the quarter or 21.4% excluding Remy, up 70 basis points from a year ago. SG&A as a percentage of sales was 8.4%. Again, excluding Remy, SG&A was 8.2% of sales, 30 basis points improvement from a year ago. R&D spending, which is including SG&A was 3.6% of sales. I would like to point out Remy did impact that number by 20 basis points. It was probably 3.8% without Remy. Now, let's look at the year-over-year comparison for operating income which can be found on page -- on Slide 4. Starting on the right, fourth quarter 2015 operating income adjusted for non-comparable items including Remy was $269 million or 12.6% of sales. Excluding Remy's $8 million of net contribution to operating income, operating income was $261 million or 13.2% of sales up 80 basis points from a year ago. Excluding non-comparable items, Remy and FX, operating income was up $34 million or $141 million of higher sales. That gives us an incremental margin up 25% -- 24% in the quarter. A reconciliation of the reported operating income to operating income adjusted for non-comparable items plus Remy can be found in the appendix on page -- Slide 9. For full year, our incremental margin excluding non-comparable items, Remy and impact of currency was 19%, very good performance despite some operation inefficiencies related to the Drivetrain restructuring activities earlier in the year. As you look further down the income statement, equity and affiliate earnings was about $12 million in the quarter in line with last year. Interest expense and finance charges were $18 million in the quarter up from $10 million a year ago. The increase is primarily related to the $1 billion and \u20ac500 million fixed rate seniors notes issued in the first and third quarters of 2015 respectively. Provision for income taxes in the quarter, on reported basis was $61 million. However, this included $12 million of net tax benefits associated with the non-comparable charges and an $8 million favorable tax adjustment. You can read about these items in our 10-K, which will be filed later today. But excluding these items, the provision for income taxes was $81 million or an effective tax rate of 30.7% in the quarter. Our effective tax rate for the full year was 29.8% or 30 basis points above our estimate. Net earnings attributable to non-controlling interest was about $10 million in the quarter up slightly from $8 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. That brings us back to net earnings which were $125 million in the quarter, net earnings excluding the non-comparable items but including Remy was $173 million or $0.77 per diluted share. Now for comparisons with prior periods, net earnings excluding non-comparable items in were $168 million or $0.75 per diluted share. Let's take a closer look at the operating segments in the quarter. So, beginning on Slide 5 of the deck, as James said earlier, reported Engine segment net sales were about $1.4 billion in the quarter. Sales growth for the Engine segment excluding currency was 9.8% compared with the same period a year ago. Turning to Slide 6. Adjusted EBIT was $230 million for the Engine segment or 16.5% of sales. Excluding currency, the Engine segment's adjusted EBIT was up $19 million on $136 million of higher sales for incremental margin of 14%. Turning to Slide 7 and starting with the right side, Drivetrain segment net sales were $735 million in the quarter. Excluding Remy and FX, sales growth for the Drivetrain segment was 1.3% compared with the same period a year ago. As James said earlier, higher all-wheel-drive sales in North America were offset by lower transmission component sales in Europe. On Slide 8, adjusted EBIT was $81 million for the Drivetrain segment or 11% of sales. Excluding Remy, adjusted EBIT was 12.5% of sales, an impressive 180 basis points from a year ago. Excluding Remy and FX, the Drivetrain segment's adjusted EBIT was up $12 million on $8 million of higher sales for an incremental margin of 156%. I would like to remind you that in Q4 2014, we incurred about a $5 million to $6 million headwind through restructuring inefficiencies which are behind us now. Drivetrain's 12.5% adjusted EBIT margin matches it's best quarter performance ever. It was just three years ago that Drivetrain margins were running around 9%. At that time, we committed to improving the margins in the segment and we are pleased with its progress. Now let's take a look at the balance sheet and cash flow. We generated $868 million of net cash from operating activities in 2015 up $66 million from a year ago. We had a very strong finish to the year generating nearly $400 million of cash in the fourth quarter driven by exceptional working capital management. Capital spending was $577 million in 2015 up $14 million from a year ago. As James said earlier, capital spending in 2014 and 2015 was above our trend. We expect to return to normal spending levels beginning in 2016. Free cash flow which we define as net cash from operating activities less capital spending was $290 million in 2015 up $52 million from 2014 and $41 million above the high end of our guidance range provided in October. This positive trend is expected to continue. We expect to generate between $400 million and $475 million of free cash flow in 2016. At the midpoint that is up 50% from 2015, $200 million to $300 million of free cash flow will be used to repurchase shares in 2016. Looking at the balance sheet itself, balance sheet debt increased by $1.23 billion and cash decreased by $220 million. In 2015 compared with the end of 2014, the $1.45 billion increase in net debt was primarily driven due to Remy acquisition, capital expenditures, dividend payments to shareholders and share repurchases. We spent $315 million repurchasing 8.1 million shares in 2015 and that's on schedule for executing our 1 billion share repurchase program by the first quarter of 2018. Our net debt to capital ratio was 35.4% at the end of 2015 up from 12.8% at the end of 2014. Net debt to EBITDA at the end of the year on a trailing 12 month basis was 1.4x. Now, I'd like to spend some time on our 2016 guidance which is unchanged from our initial announcement. I'm going to go through the same numbers presented at the Deutsche Bank Global Auto Industry Conference that we did a couple of weeks ago. I would ask to please bear with me. I think as a management team we thought this is really important to go through this and it will be very detailed but nonetheless we think it's very important that I do this. So, let's start with sales growth guidance for the full year. I want to remind everybody the baseline for 2015 net sales excluded Remy, which was just under 7.9. So, starting point is without Remy. So net new business pricing and market rate growth are expected to drive 2.5 to 5.5 sales growth. Currency is expected to reduce sales growth within a range of 230 basis points at the low end and 80 basis points at the high end of the range. Those two items combined to equal 0.2% to 4.7% of expected sales growth for our base business in 2016. The Remy acquisition should add 13 to 13.5% growth leading to 13.2% to 18.3% growth for the total company. From an operating performance perspective, we are expecting an 18% to 20% incremental margin on our core business sales growth. Included in this are $15 million to $25 million of tailwinds from the Drivetrain restructuring and increased efficiency related to the completion of that activity. These tailwinds will be partially offset by about 5 million in higher compliance and other corporate expenses. On a comparable basis, we expect -- comparable basis, we expect our operating margin to be greater than 13% up from the prior year for the 7th year in a row. The Remy business is expected to deliver mid-single digit margins this year. Its net distribution to operating income includes cost synergies and purchase accounting adjustments. So our consolidated operating income margin is expected to be above 12%. We expect earnings of $3.11 to $3.32 per share on a consolidated basis, which includes about $0.13 per share from Remy. Excluding Remy, we expect earnings to be $2.98 to $3.18 per share. Now, let's review the first quarter guidance starting with sales growth. Again, this has been unchanged from what we gave guidance a little while ago. We expect new business pricing and market related growth of about negative 3% to a positive 2.7%. As we said in January, we do expect higher light truck related volumes in North America but this will be partially offset by two European transmission programs that begin phasing out in the fourth quarter. We are also layering in risk associated with the market volatility in China. Currency is expected to reduce sales growth between 380 basis points at the low-end and to 240 basis points at the high-end of the range. In 2015, the euro was at its highest point during the first quarter. If our currency assumptions for 2016 are correct, impact on currency will be relatively severe in the first quarter but less throughout the year. Those two items combined equal minus 4.1% at the low-end and 0.3 at the high-end of our core business. The Remy acquisition should add 12.4% to 13% growth leading to an 8.3% to 13.3% growth for the total company. We expect earnings of $0.75 to $0.79 per share on a consolidated basis, which does include about $0.03 per share from Remy. Excluding Remy, we expect earnings to be $0.72 to $0.75 per share. So let me summarize 2015. 2015 was a good year for BorgWarner. We grew mid-single digits. We expanded our operating margins, we also completed the Remy acquisition. We completed the Drivetrain restructuring and we made capital investments that set the stage for continued growth and improved operating performance going forward. Now, as we look into 2016 and beyond, we see improvements in a number of key areas. First and most important is the intensity around new product development to support the impending electrification trend James mentioned earlier. I have never seen this intensity higher in this company since I have been here. There was no question in my mind that this will drive growth for many years. Second, operating income and cash flow will go higher. And finally, the future is bright for BorgWarner. So, with that, I would like to turn the call back over to Ken. Ken Lamb : Thanks, Ron. Now, let's move to the Q&A portion of the call. Melissa, please remind everyone of the Q&A procedures. Q - Deepa Raghavan : Good morning. This is for Deepa Raghavan for Rich Kwas. A few quick questions. What is your incremental margin assumptions by segment for 2016? James Verrier : We don't provide that kind of guidance by segment. We just give the total company guidance which is on the deck that I was referring to earlier. Deepa Raghavan : Okay. Secondly, could you also give us early read on integration synergies from Remy? James Verrier : Sure. Back in the announcement in last July, I believe it was, we gave guidance that the synergies on the cost side were going to be $15 million. I would say we were on track of hitting that goal at this point. We didn't give any synergies at this point on the sales side but we are getting momentum there as well and now we have more clarity as we go forward. Deepa Raghavan : Okay. This is for 16 -- 2016? James Verrier : The cost synergies were 2016. Deepa Raghavan : Okay. Thank you. That's all I have. James Verrier : And to be more specific, we will realize half year savings of the $15 million in 2016, the run rate in 2017 would be $15 million, I need to be more specific there. Operator : Your next question comes from Brett Hoselton with KeyBanc Capital. Your line is open. Brett Hoselton : Good morning. James Verrier : Good morning. Brett Hoselton : Let's see here. Can you talk about Remy as we look into 2017 and 2018 and specifically your revenue growth expectations and your margin expectations? James Verrier : Yes. I can -- let me take a shot at that, Brett. From the revenue perspective, I would say our outlook for growth is pretty similar to BorgWarner in general. So mid-single digit growth as we see it today Brett into 2017 and 2018. And from a margin perspective, what we are starting around that mid-single digit growth that's the start point is mid-single digit growth. And I believe -- and again, it's a little early in the process, but our belief is that we will be able to take that up to high single digits over the next two to three-year period. Brett Hoselton : And as you move into high-single digits, is part of that purchase accounting or is it, basically doing -- is it more restructuring oriented or is it some combination of the two? Ron Hundzinski : I would say it's not purchase accounting coming off. It's more operational driven. Brett Hoselton : Is there a step function improvement as a result of purchase accounting at some point in time in the near future? Ron Hundzinski : There is but I think its 18 -- maybe 18 or 19. Some of the stuff comes off after three years, some of its 10 years. There is a long tail for that. So we won't see some of those benefits for some time. Brett Hoselton : Okay. So hopefully we will be on a beach by then. The 2017 margin drivers in general direction, what are the -- maybe the key one, two, three margin drivers and then just do you, is it likely that they are going to go up or down. It seems like it should go up. But, I just want to know what your thoughts are? James Verrier : So Brett, you are saying 2017, not 2016, right? I want to make sure I get the right -- I would say some of the -- as you know, we always target mid-incremental margins, mid-teens incremental margins on our sales growth. And that is above our nominal value right now. So that would drive increased margin expansion. Then you still have -- I will admit Drivetrain is still not where the Engine group is. So we still probably have more tailwinds there. Trying to think what else, probably the Remy what we just talked about as well. And then Wahler; Wahler as to also contribute more going forward. So I don't have all the numbers there Brett but I would say there are a lot of tailwinds I just mentioned. Brett Hoselton : Okay. Do you see any particular headwinds? James Verrier : We don't see headwinds now. Commodity prices is still -- I think we are predicting those to stay flat, right? Oil prices and so on and so forth. I don't see them right now, no. I don't see anything right now. Brett Hoselton : Let's go. And then very quickly share repurchase what did you do in the quarter and what's kind of the run rate -- your expectation for run rate going forward? James Verrier : Before we did 220 million a quarter, 350 for the full year, obviously, we are very heavily weighted in the fourth quarter. We purchased a lot. We intend to stay at a healthy pace right now as well, I would say that in the first half of this year, 2016. Brett Hoselton : Well, I guess my question is, that I mean, you did 39 million in the first I think and 25 in the second and 67 in the third and then you did 220 million in the fourth. And so do I model 50 million per quarter or do I model 200 million per quarter. I mean if you were me, what would you do? James Verrier : I think at this point it may be more linear at this point to model, okay. Brett Hoselton : I guess, I'm not sure what that means. James Verrier : Well, like 50 :50 number you gave out, I would say at this point. Brett Hoselton : Okay, cool. Perfect. Thank you very much gentlemen. James Verrier : Appreciate it, Brett. Operator : Your next question comes from Joe Spak with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Joe Spak : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for some of the -- first for going over the guidance again and also, I think adding a touch more color on some of the regions and some of the different puts and takes you see. If we sum it all up, though, and I think you even said you are sort of close to IHS, I just want to make sure the right way to think about the sales growth for this year is that an industry volume level it looks like you are probably looking for 1.5% to maybe 2% volume growth which may be offset, you know, the annual price downs. So if we look at the midpoint of your organic growth guidance, that is still about 4% which is -- if we look at it another way basically what you think you guys are adding in terms of content to the city? Is that a fair assumption? James Verrier : Yes. This is James, Joe. That's a really good summary. I think markets are close enough to offset each other, which implies about 4% of organic growth. That is a good summary. Joe Spak : Okay. And then, so, it was in the range it's mostly volume or sort of timing of some of the programs come on that are going to take us from the high-end to the low-end? James Verrier : Yes. Let me, maybe, if I can try to give it -- on this way. What's driving that organic growth obviously is the net new business. I think just to add a little bit of color to it, it's stronger obviously in China and Asia particularly. We are seeing some good launch activity in North America maybe a couple of good key program launches in Europe. So that's what's driving the growth. I think as we outlined in Detroit, Joe, as we built this up, we have been fairly prudent around the volume and the cadence of those launches to make sure that it's more pragmatic and we embedded in that number, we asserted some macro pressure as well which we again talked about in Detroit. So, it's has it was in Detroit, if that helps you, Joe? Joe Spak : Yes. Okay. That is helpful. I guess just -- sorry, if I missed this one, but the -- just the incremental flow through volume on power train in the quarter, well over 100% -- maybe -- sorry if I missed what drove that? If you can just review that? But then also, can you just remind us how we should think about the cadence of some of the European restructuring that you have done, how that should flow through this year? I believe you should be sort of at the right run rate in the back half? Is that the right way to think about it? James Verrier : Right, Joe. Two questions. First to talk about the Drivetrain incremental margin of 156%. In my script, I pointed out that in Q4 of 2014, if you go back to transcript you will see $5 million to $6 million headwind. And you would have saw that actually sales erupt and incremental margins down a year ago. That's behind us. So what you're getting, are you're getting $6 million of flow through that we didn't have a headwind on in the fourth quarter of this year versus last year. Joe Spak : Okay. James Verrier : So that $12 million, half of it is in one area right there. Then as we go forward into 2016, if you recall, if you go back in our notes, Q1 of 2015 was about a $9 million headwind -- $3 million headwind. And then we had another headwind in the second quarter as well. So, obviously, we're going to have those headwinds behind us in the first half of the year and we'll get tailwinds there -- they have strong incrementals and then we level off like you said in the back half of the year to more normalized margins. Hopefully that helps. Joe Spak : Sorry, but those headwinds you faced last year were for some of the costs associated with moving equipment and some other restructuring. I guess what about the benefits from the actions you've taken like when do those start coming in like aside from the non-repeats of the costs you incurred? James Verrier : Well, right now they are starting to coming in. Remember, I also said -- Joe Spak : Okay. James Verrier : -- that we were running at 9% margins. We are up in the 12s, right? So we have been getting benefit quite frankly over time then this volume comes into play. So we are seeing the benefits now and then we are also seeing the inefficiency headwinds going away, so it's a combination of both that's uplifting those margins to the -- in this 12 range right now. Joe Spak : Okay, great. Thanks very helpful. James Verrier : You're welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from John Murphy with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. John Murphy : Good morning, guys. James Verrier : Good morning. John Murphy : Just a first question and I don't necessarily you won't agree that we are facing down the barrel of the abyss in the cycle here but clearly the market is indicating some extreme concern of a downturn hitting very soon. So, if we were to think about a downturn of 5% in volume and then maybe 10% in volume, could you just sort of run through how would you think about reacting from an operating standpoint as well as maybe capital allocations standpoint? James Verrier : Yes. I can -- let me John take a short at the operating side. First of file, so the good news for us as we look around the world of the company and I compare it to some of the last, our temporary employees are in much healthier state. And depending on the region, John 10% to 20% of our workforce is temporary and that allows this opportunity to react pretty quickly flex on the labor side. Europe we -- I think we have more progressive agreements in place we had before. So, I feel comfortable on the labor side that we can adjust. And I think the other area that we got pretty proficient in this, if we need to flex on discretionary spend, we, how to do that from prior cycle. So that probably the two dials that you would move pretty quickly all leading to target and detrimental sales at around the 20% rate is where we look to manage the business to. But I would just add anecdotally John, for each other operations around the world have those plans in place kind of on the shelf in a lot of detail by region and by plant. So, bottom-line I feel pretty comfortable, if there is pressures we will be ready. Ron Hundzinski : I understand capital allocation depending on the cash flows, we will have to reassess what we do with capital allocation, 5%, 10% might have some impact I think, we would have to watch, John. But I don't know 10% will become more stressful, I guess, 5% probably wouldn't. John Murphy : Okay. And then just a second question, I mean Ford announced this morning that they are launching four new SUV's in the North American market and actually maybe beyond that. FCA is talking about adding truck capacity or changing over car capacity to truck capacity. So it just seems like the whole world is moving towards these cross-over in trucks. That should be good for your content. Can you talk about what you are seeing in the market and what kind of potential you have both in engine and Drivetrain as we see the shift going forward? James Verrier : I think your thought is right, John. For us and I'm talking obviously, just North America at the moment. The truck to car mix generally speaking the truck mix is slightly favorable for us. I think it's pretty well known we have, you know -- it varies a little by customer. So we are well contented clearly on the Ford platforms and F1 50 platform in particular. FCA were well positioned, GM would have a little less well positioned but we are taking steps to address that. And I would say to you it's pretty well-balanced both on Engine content and Drivetrain content. On the Drivetrain side we are well positioned on the transmission content, but clearly the transfer capability that we have there is strong. And on the Engine side, I would say one of the big shifts has been more turbocharged engines for those vehicles which we benefited from, which is a bit positive for us and on Engine timing also were picking up good content. So net-net it's a positive tailwind for us. John Murphy : And on margins, any color there on the delta between the car and cross-over and truck? James Verrier : Not really much of a difference there for us, John. It's pretty consistent cars to trucks and region to region actually which we've set fairly consistently so it doesn't change that much for us. John Murphy : Okay, great. Thank you very much. James Verrier : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Brian Johnson with Barclays. Your line is open. Brian Johnson : Good morning. Yes, I wanted to talk a little bit about the transmission business. The short-term question like a mid-term question, the short-term question is, what's behind the lower transmission component in Europe. You talked about maybe some programs being phased out, there are replacement programs coming later in the year. Are there any trends we need to think about in terms of AMT versus traditional, planetary versus CBT going on? James Verrier : There is a couple of moving pieces on that transmission Europe aspect. One aspect is, one of our German customers did inventory shifts in Q4 and we saw a little bit of that in Q1 on transmission related products. And you have seen that's been in the news publicly so you probably know that. That was an element of it. The other element of it was European transmission programs that are phasing out for us. The replacement programs, I would say net neutral to negative for BorgWarner. It's hard for me to speak to the exact detail because of the customer. Importantly these were planned, this is all part of our net new business assumption. It was all expected for us, so it's not a surprise. It's nothing knew. And I would say a high level brain it's a signal of a significant shift in transmission architecture. This is not people making massive moves between stepped automatics to DCT or automated manual. I think it's more specific program by program for a couple of customers. Brian Johnson : And then, second question which you kind of touched on but maybe just kind of pull the pieces together, X Remy a fairly incremental margin which means pricing or restructuring or some benefit. Can you kind of elaborate on the margin improvement ex-Remy and the Drivetrain and the cadence of that as we think about the rest of the year. Ron Hundzinski : Okay, Brian, so, the incremental margin for the quarter 24% was primarily driven by the Drivetrain segment being up 156%. Brian Johnson : Yes, that's 156 in Drivetrain. James Verrier : So the Drivetrain really drove the full company, right? Although we had 14%, 15% in engine. I would say that there is about $6 million or $5 million last year of headwinds that we didn't see. So, of that $12 million increase in operating income, half of it alone was just not having those inefficiencies in our face quite frankly. The other half I would just say is that the business is improving. There is a whole point of the restructuring. As we go forward, remember, we had -- Q1 and Q2 of last year we still have these headwinds coming. It wasn't until 3 and 4 that the headwinds dissipated and the incremental margins started returning. So the first half of 2016 should have good tailwinds because we don't have those inefficiencies in front of us any more and then they will level off in the second half to more normal incremental margins. Brian Johnson : Yes. Then finally within Drivetrain is there a way to think about the Remy contribution in terms of an engine -- the Remy contribution in terms of traditional Remy products versus new growth in terms of getting them into new areas or kind of showing efforts together and how that is begun to shape up since you closed the deal? James Verrier : Yes. Let me talk to that a little bit, Brian. I think what we have alluded to so far, we feel comfortable, as we look out into the next couple of years that Remy is going to deliver good mid-single digit type growth for us. As you can imagine, that's primarily driven off the existing portfolio products into new channels. So what I mean by that is, this two primary channels of growth for us with the current portfolio. One is customers. They have a relatively narrow band of customers. With BorgWarner's breadth of coverage on customers that's going to drive content with their existing products. The second growth driver for us is a regional play where they have a strong position in North America, they are well positioned in China but quite weak in Europe. So that's going to be a series of opportunities for us to sell current portfolio of products. And that will drive the content growth over the next two or three years. Then to your point in parallel to that, there is a lot of discussions that we are having with customers around combination products of the Remy architecture and BorgWarner architecture. I'd say there is a number of areas and we can talk more about this offline. But the most prevalent area of discussion right now is the notion of a P2 hybrid architecture, so combining clutching know-how together with the motor know-how and we got a lot of interest in that. That's likely to be a revenue stream that's probably four to five years out but it's very active and driving it. So hopefully that gives you a sense of both the shorter term growth levers then the longer term growth levers. Brian Johnson : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Rod Lache : Hi, everybody. A couple of housekeeping things first. Just I apologize for asking this again, but in the Drivetrain business, can you clarify what the combined benefit is of the non-recurrence of the headwinds plus the restructuring savings that you expect for 2016? Ron Hundzinski : If you go back to our guidance full year, I think it was on slide deck -- that we gave at Deutsche Bank, Rod, remember? There is a slide in there that shows that we have about $10 million to $20 million tailwind for the full year -- that was a headwind in 2015, okay? So, it's $10 million to $20 million as a full year. It's in that deck. And that's what drives the 18% to 20% incremental margins for the company for the full year. Normally it's mid-teens. But the tailwinds are driving it around to the 20% range. Rod Lache : Right. That part I saw. That's the non-recurrence of the headwind. I just -- there is an additional part that you were asked about earlier on the savings from some of the restructuring actions you have taken. Ron Hundzinski : Sure. If you go back in time -- this goes way back in time. We said that the benefits were going to generate about $30 million of operating income benefits going forward. What's really happened over time, was we probably incrementing and getting some of that as we go forward and the margins have lifted up over time from 9% to 12%. So we have been getting a little bit of these benefits as we go forward because the labor cost are lower for example so and so forth. So we have been getting some of these benefits. But it's over 3 almost -- three years now, right? So, that math looks a little bit more difficult. But basically its absolute rise in the margins as well that we are getting. Rod Lache : Okay. So, a lot of it is -- we are seeing it in the numbers on that part of things? Ron Hundzinski : Yes. Rod Lache : And can you remind us what your R&D assumption is for 2016? Ron Hundzinski : It's still -- well, all right, so, it's 4% but I will be honest right now with the Remy coming on board, it might be 10 basis points lower. I'm splitting hairs right now. Rod Lache : Okay. Got it. Ron Hundzinski : But I've got it 4%, all right? Rod Lache : Okay. And then, just lastly on the organic growth, is it correct in, you know, if we are looking at 2.5% to 5.5% that's basically all engine this year because the transmission programs that are phasing out? And when we look at the organic growth over the course of the year, it's starting off obviously below the full year forecast. So, what kicks in over the course of the year that causes the acceleration? James Verrier : Rod, this is James. It's absolutely both Drivetrain and Engine. So we are delivering growth on both segments. Those two phase-out programs I talked about are relatively small actually. They are in there. Just to give you a sense, to put a bit more color there to help you, it's -- we drive upwards through the year. So, our launch activities are a little backend loaded which is not unusual for us. But it's across both Engine and Drivetrain. So, we are launching for example DCT uplift in China. We're launching Solenoid activities in China. We've got all real drive launches with another Chinese OEM that's Asia. If I talk about North America, we got a super duty launch. So it's a real mixture, Rod, I wouldn't want you to think its only engine. It's certainly both. And I would say it's weighted to China and North America which is consistent with the net new business announcement. Rod Lache : Okay. Great. Thank you. James Verrier : Thanks, Rod. Ron Hundzinski : Thank you, Rod. Operator : Your next question comes from Patrick Archambault with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Patrick Archambault : Yes. Hi, good morning. A couple from me. Just on Wahler, if I have this right, I think you had extended the timeframe to become -- for margins there to converge with the corporate average I think over three years. And this is, I believe probably the last year, right? And, so, how much of a tailwind is that in the walk that you presented for your guidance, was it included in that 18% to 20%? Because I didn't really see it broken out and conceivably that would be yet another area that would be over earning from an incremental perspective relative to other things. Ron Hundzinski : Sure. So, the guidance that we've issued implied about $8 million nominal value of extra operating income related to Wahler. The other thing I want to clarify is, when we purchased Wahler, we said two to three years. And we also said after we got into the business it was going to be more like three years, not two years. And that would still take us into 2017. It's where the run rate would be where we are happy where the business should be. Patrick Archambault : Got it. And that $8 million is -- is that sort of incremental -- I mean, is that just the contribution -- how do we think about it, is that kind of the margin contribution piece of it I guess? Ron Hundzinski : Yes, the margin improvement, correct. Patrick Archambault : Got it. Okay. And then the other question I had is, I think James in your comments earlier, you had spoken to not really seeing any changes on the regulatory front and there does seem to be an initiative by some OEMs to try and change the cafe standards right at the mid-cycle review which I think is happening this year. It's not to say that that may not have as much of an impact on internal combustion engines as it will on perhaps EVs but you just -- wanted to get your opinion. Is that sort of incorrect or do you have a view that that initiative is not going to be successful? I mean just a little bit more perspective would be helpful. James Verrier : I would be happy to do that. And let me give you some commentary. Our view is that there will be the mid-cycle review obviously that's all planned. Our view based on the multiple different inputs we get is -- we are not anticipating significant adjustments or change to the plan. There is going to be sure robust discussion. That's obviously even more robust with gas at less than two bucks a gallon. So I think there will be discussion. But I think significantly or changes I don't think are going to happen is our view of the world. So we think it's going to continue on as planned frankly speaking. What we do see, which I alluded to in part of my comments, Pat is, there is absolutely a push for a spectrum and alternative types of power trains. So, we are not seeing people at all step away from advanced IC engines. That's absolutely front and center. There is a tremendous amount of activity and launches around advance gas engines. Yet we see a strong push for the pure electrics which we are right in the middle off and high breads as well in the many different configurations of hybrids. So I think there is a general March towards execution of the standard maybe with a few tweaks and each of the OEMs getting a suite or spectrum of architectures that they can get to deliver on those numbers and we are right in the middle of all of those architectures in discussions with them. So that's our view of how we see it right now, Pat. Patrick Archambault : I mean it sounds like it's more based on what you are hearing from your customers rather than an opinion on sort of regulators? James Verrier : Yes. I would say it this way, Pat. Clearly we are engaged very deeply with all of our customers. That's a real strength source. But we talk to regulators, we talk to different business groups, different industry groups. So we are taking a large variety of inputs, it's not just our own narrow self view, if that makes sense to you, but it clearly is driven off a lot of what the customers are doing. Because they are the ones that are working with us on what the architectures need to look like. Patrick Archambault : Got it. Okay. Thanks for the color guys. James Verrier : Thanks Pat. Ron Hundzinski : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Ryan Brinkman : Hi. Good morning. A couple of questions on backlog, first on China. Now for the tougher backlog developments in China in 2015 which included delay of some vehicles, lower sales in production of others. I'm curious if the stronger trend of sales and production in China in 4Q and So far in 1Q might be possibly impacting your backlog in anyway. Are you seeing any signs that earlier delayed vehicles might be coming back on the schedule or vehicles from which you've trimmed yourself in production expectations or maybe selling faster being produced in higher quantity? James Verrier : I would say, I will give you this sense that Q4 is a good quarter for us in China. We had about 20% growth in the quarter in China very strong and as I alluded to earlier, part of that was some of the incentives. And we are seeing that strength roll into Q1. So, it's still early in the year. We feel comfortable in the net new business announcement. We feel comfortable with our guidance around growth. I'd say if anything I feel incrementally a little more positive about China than I did a few weeks ago. How much of that is going to translate into real revenue by quarter and by backlog, we will see how that plays out. But I would say I'm feeling more comfortable around China after a strong Q4 and the incentives flowing into Q1. And you know, Ryan, a large part of our backlog is China related. So I think it's a net help for us right now. Ryan Brinkman : Okay, great. Think this is the last question on backlog relative to Remy, on the revenue synergy which you talked about earlier, given your comment that you are making progress there but haven't quantified the opportunity, is it fair to say then there are not any such sales synergies included in the backlog through 2018? And then what is the timeline for realizing such synergies if they occur. Is there a chance it could positively impact the backlog within the present window or would the benefits more likely accrue beyond 2018? James Verrier : Okay. So in the net new business we delivered a couple of weeks ago, we didn't have those -- those synergies were not in, Ryan. And the reason just to be transparent with that, we only owned the company a few weeks. It was premature. I think give us a little bit of time is what I would say is, as we walk through that this year. But if I was thinking out loud, I would say, as we get our arms around that, I think the contribution to the net business as we go forward will be stronger from Remy than it was in this one. And again, you got to hopefully give us a little of time to flush that detail through and go after meetings with the customers et cetera. But I think we will see a step up in contribution from Remy in terms of growth when we do the next new business. When that will play in and how much, Ryan, we need a little time there, but I will tell you direction, I feel very positive about it. Ryan Brinkman : Okay. That's great color. Thanks a lot. James Verrier : Thank you. Operator : We have time for one final question and that question comes from David Leiker With Robert W. Baird & Company. Your line is open. Adam Schmitz : Hi, guys. This is Adam Schmitz on the line for David. James Verrier : Hi, Adam. Adam Schmitz : Just first on the Remy cost synergies, can you outline some of the low hanging fruit that you expect to occur in 2016 and now that you had the business in house for a few months what are the longer term opportunities for cost synergies? Ron Hundzinski : So when we made announcements about a year ago, we identified corporate governs cost is a really easy one to grab. Obviously, they don't have a Board of Directors any more and the executive group is gone. That was one. Another was cost synergies on our purchasing side. That's the one that will take more long-term, I would say. Over time, we'll get those benefits. But those are the two main ones we pointed out at the time. Then there was another one, just basic redundancy, I would call active corporate, not the corporate officers but corporate staff itself, some redundancy cost there. We said that we need to get about $15 million full year run rate which in 2016 we would see about half of that. Adam Schmitz : Okay. And then last one from me, James, as you alluded to the company saw a kind of number of market headwinds in 2015 outside of just China, off highway, Brazil among others. Can you just talk about some of the biggest headwinds you saw in 2015 and kind of where you see those affecting the company in 2016? James Verrier : Yes, the -- you covered the two big ones which was the China was a lower absolute growth market for China and everybody. That was weighted because of our launch activity and commercial vehicle was the other significant headwind we faced. In commercial vehicle, and I would say that was globally. But Brazil to your point was probably the worst. As we come into this, our assumptions are based off 3% to5% light vehicle production growth in China. No growth in commercial vehicle globally. Those are our two macro assumptions and that's how we are going into the year and that's how we built our guidance. So -- Adam Schmitz : All right. Thanks, guys. James Verrier : Thank you. Ron Hundzinski : Thank you. Ken Lamb : I'd like to thank you all again for joining us. We expect to file our 10-Q before the end of the day -- excuse me, 10-K before the end of the day which will provide details of our results. If you have any follow-up questions about our earnings release, the matters discussed during this call or our 10-K, please direct them to me. Melissa please close out the call. Operator : That does conclude the BorgWarner 2015 fourth quarter and full year end results conference call. You may now disconnect.",

You'll find the link at the events and presentation section beneath the notice for this conference call. We encourage you to follow along with these charts during the discussion our results. With that, I will turn it over to James. James Verrier : Thank you, Ken. And welcome to everybody. Thanks for joining the call today. Ron and I will spend a little bit of time with you going through Q1 2016 and then obviously we'll get in share with some of our thoughts around the outlook for the rest of the year. So you can see on Slide 2 let's start there and let me give you some our perspective on some of the bigger picture issues little bit around the macro-environments and then the industry in general. I think the headline for us as we look at the macro in the industry. This as we know there is a lot of uncertainty out there in the world and whether that's Federal Reserve issues, China monetary policy, oil Middle East the list is pretty extensive and we do see a general tone of uncertainty in the general macro-environment. That said our view is all those are relatively stable and I'll get into more color on that. So we see an unstable macro, but all those are in pretty good shape actually. If I take that down a little further and talk more specifically about our view on the market, I'll start with the light vehicle view and we will continue to remain pretty plus realign with IHS as we've done through the year actually. So that points us to a projection for 2016 light vehicle growth in Europe of about 2%, North America around 4%, China somewhere around 5% to 6%. So we continue to share a similar set of views to those of IHS. If I switch over to commercial vehicle which is obviously a key market for BorgWarner, we still see that very challenge, we\u2019re not seeing a lot of uplifting news frankly speaking on the environment around commercial vehicle. On a macro, global level growth is really very little if any and one of the evolution I would say in the commercial vehicle space is we do see some of the new programs that were targeted for the out years coming into a little of question and review and so we're paying a lot of attention to that. As we look out into 2016 from a high level perspective, on the last call I wanted to alert you to the areas of watch that we're paying attention to as we continue to move forward in the year and I'd like refresh what we're watching and paying a lot of attention to commercial vehicle I already alluded to, the second area where we're watching and paying a lot of attention to is China and particularly what we mean by China is, I think we all benefited from some good tailwinds around the incentives that were put in place at the end of 2015 and we're paying attention to how that evolves particularly into the second half of the year. So what that means is are we seeing any path forward in the first half of the year or do we see continued strength from the incentives, and I would say there is some questions there. Specifically, from the BorgWarner point of view we're paying attention to I would say China and Europe relatively to our biggest German-based customer and how that may play out as the years unfolds. And then I think like all of our -- we're going to pay a lot of attention to inventory builds and inventory building schedules in North America. So those are just some of the areas, with that said things have gone well for us well so far and we're optimistic and positive about our guidance for the year but there are some watch points and I think it's prudent of us at least share with you what those watch points are from our view points. Still on the same slide, let me reference some of areas that maybe of interest for you around the regulatory and technology trend area. We continue to see a strong drive for fuel economy and emissions regulations that are pulling our powertrain technology programs. I would articulate so the group here on the call the intensity we see around product development activity, innovation activity is at least at the same level and potentially probably a little higher than it was several months ago around technology for fuel economy and emissions. So I just wanted to point that out we're not seeing any slowdown if anything we're seeing a little bit more work around meeting fuel economy and emission standards for powertrain technology. We've engaged in some meaningful dialogue in the last quarter directed with the EPA and our view of the world is that we have not anticipating meaningful change to the 2025 CapEx standards. That's not to say that maybe some minor adjustments and clearly the process that\u2019s to play out with further discussion, but our view at this stage is we're not seeing meaningful change. Just like other suppliers in the space and the OEMs that you talk to, the transition to electrification of the powertrain continues to evolve and I would accelerate. We noticed that a couple of years ago and we've see that trend playing out and we continue to see that intensify. Clearly for BorgWarner right in the middle of the that electrification evolution and whether that's 12-volt, 48-volt hybrid EVs, we see a lot of activity around many different architectures and I would say to the group here not just for the long-term 7 or 8 years out, but we're seeing meaningful evolution in that space in the next 2 to 3 years, so more to come on that in my later comments. I also wanted just to anecdotally mention as this electrification trend continues, I know one of the hot buns for the Company is how does play out for you from electric vehicle. We talked on the last call that we were very proud of our EV transition program with Remy that will run at somewhere around by 15,000 units in 2016. I can tell you we've been awarded two additional electric vehicle programs for the company. I'm not in a position to announce the details today, we need to work with our customers to get that, but those announcements will be coming out in the next few months and we view them as significant in how we will play in that space. Finally around the regulatory technology area let me make a couple of comments around diesel, I know that's on people's minds. I would say it\u2019s a similar story to what I shared with you in February. We're not really seeing any meaningful mix shifts at this point we do know and we believe that the diesel gas mix will slowly evolve and shift a little more to gas over the next couple of years, I think that's consistent with others viewing the space. We see that as a somewhat neutral event for BorgWarner as that technology continues to get adopted to the gasoline products at a similar level to diesel. Let me shift from the macro and the industry perspective and give you a little bit of a snapshot of, from a BorgWarner viewpoint. First of all let me start with Q1 and obviously Ron will give you a lot more color and details in his commentary. But I would tell you from my seat I was very pleased with our Q1, I think we delivered some good growth, a little bit above expectation which was good to see and as you'll see in the details a very strong operating performance across the segments. So I went into the quarter feeling good, I come out of the quarter feeling very good. It was a good solid quarter for us. Versus our expectations the revenue I would say on a regional basis, China was -- China played out about as we had expected overall, Europe a little lower than what we had expected and I can give a little bit of commentary on that later and North America and Korea a little better than we had expected. But no meaningful big shift, it was just little bit of nuancing and overall that led to a good quarter. That quarter totaled up to 2.3 billion in sales which when we exclude FX and Remy that's about 4.5% growth. The EPS of $0.80 which includes the non-comparable it does of course include Remy and our operating margin of 12.2% again for comparable thoughts when we exclude Remy on the core business for BorgWarner it was 13.2%, strong performance. If I break that down a little further by segment engine came in at 1.4 billion which grew at 1% as reported or 4.5% when we exclude currency. Primary drivers of the growth, good growth in engine with turbo and VCT Variable Cam Timing on the engine timing side of our business. Our drive train sales 879 million, that's up an impressive 44% but obviously we get the benefit of Remy, when we exclude Remy and currency we grew at 5% in the drive train segment. That was primarily driven by very good all-wheel drive sales in North America and also in Europe. So again good quarter, as we look out for 2016, you'll see that we did tweak our guidance just a little for the full year, but generally it's pretty much unchanged and I'll let Ron give the necessary detail around there. I did want to comment on the Wahler restructure because you see that in some of our walks as it comes up. I want to say this I think the Wahler transaction we did strategically we feel very positive about it still, it was -- we're very comfortable with the technology we're comfortable with the customer reaction, customer were pleased with the growth. The restructuring element of it is taking longer than what we had anticipated and that's a little frustrating from a BorgWarner viewpoint. Let me just maybe give a high level summary of why that is so you have a sense. What it really is, it centers around our European facilities, the Asia and South America and North America are doing great actually. The European piece, we're in the process of having to make a lot of product moves, we're closing the plant, we're opening the plant, we're building the plant up and there is multiple moves of products as part of the restructuring with our customers, it's taking a little longer than we'd anticipated but we're going to come through it and get back on track with Wahler. So our adjusted guidance does reflect a little less tailwind then expected for Wahler, but as you can see we didn't change the total company margin or EPS guidance. I also want to share my view a little bit on as we look to the second half of the year and maybe some, I think what I would say to you is we have opportunities and we have risks, I would say the risks a little outweigh the opportunities as we see the world at this point.  And let me maybe share what I see those as. You know I mentioned earlier that China, second half of the year, we do have a little bit of angst that some of that incentive benefits that we're getting is being potentially pulled into the first half, and as you know our back half for the year is very heavily weighted to a lot of launches particularly in Q3 and some of those are very significant and we see a little bit of risk there. And commercial vehicle is kind of little bit hard to read, it's hard to imagine it getting much worse than what it is but we do pay attention to that. And I think the last comment I would make relative to the risk to the second half is our largest German based customer and is there additional risk there in China and Europe from a market share pressure point of view. So we've reflected that into our guidance we believe that's the right thing to do, that's the prudent thing to do. But I do want to be very clear, I'm very comfortable and I'm very confident about reiterating our ability to achieve our full year guidance. We're off to a good start and we'll deliver on our full year guidance. And that guidance of course is a good mid-single digit growth and strong operating performance. Let me just share couple of highlights around growth that you can see on the screen. First of all Remy, the Remy deal, I would say the high level -- the integration is actually going well for us and I would say to you financially and operationally we're performing about as expected which is pretty good. The reaction from our customers around the technology is very positive. We have multiple customers already engaged in discussion around not just the core Remy business, starters, alternators, belt alternator-starter systems, but a lot of activity, a lot of discussion, a lot of quoting activity around the combination production. And I would point you to the largest part of that, is our activity about the combination of the formal Remy motor, the BorgWarner clutching system, the hydride vehicles. Some of you on the call may that know as the P2 hybrid architecture, we feel very positive about where we stand on that position and more to come on that. Away from the Remy integration, I will tell you the quotes and our booking activity remain strong and solid very much in line with our growth expectations, so we feel good about our win rates, we feel good about the actual overall quoting activity and all that building up nicely for our future growth. And I said earlier the intensity around the electrification continues and BorgWarner is right in the middle of that. So if wrap up with that and summarize before I turn it up Ron, we're up to a good start to the year, really good solid Q1. The business is running well. We continue to be heavily focused on driving our growth through adoption of technology and we're up beat and confident about our delivery our full year guidance. So with that let turn the call over to Ron who can provide more color and detail around the financials. Ron Hundzinski : Thank you, James, and good day, everyone. Before I review the financials detail, I would like to provide you some of the financial highlights as I see them for the quarter. As James said, we have experienced expected sales growth for the quarter. We also expanded our free margins on a comparable basis and we flowed through that additional sales, but more importantly for me on the cash side we saw return to normal CapEx spending. So now as Ken mentioned I will be referring to the supplemental financial slide deck as we posted on the IR website, so I do encourage you to follow along. So let's start on Slide 3, on a reported basis which includes the change in sales due to market growth price, net new business, FX and Remy that's a mouthful by the way, segments were up 14.3%; however, to get a clear picture of how the core business performed, we have to exclude the impact of FX and Remy. So when you exclude those items, sales were up 4.5% which was above the high end of our guidance range. Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 20.5% in the quarter. On a comparable basis or excluding Remy, gross margin was 20.9% which is down 70 basis points from last year caused by plant startups and borrowed restructuring inefficiencies as James talking about earlier. SG&A as a percentage of sales was 8.3% but on a comparable basis SG&A was 7.8% of sales or 70 basis points improvement from a year ago. The Company did a good job of executive cost controls to offset the gross margin decline. R&D spending, which is including in SG&A was flat from a year ago at 3.8% in sales; however, if you do exclude Remy engineering was at 4.2% or actually a 30% increase in absolute spend. Now let's look at the year over year comparison for operating income which can be found on Slide 4. Starting on the right fourth quarter 2016 operating income adjusted for non-comparable items but including Remy was 276 million or 12.2% of sales. Excluding Remy's $11 million of net contribution to operating income, operating income was 266 million or 13.2% of sales and that's up 10 basis points from a year ago. Excluding non-comparable items Remy and FX operating income was up 14 million and $90 million in other sales and that gives us the incremental margin of 15% in the quarter. Now, I would like to pause for a second and point out that there is a reconciliation of reported operating income or GAAP basis to operating income adjusted for non-comparable items plus Remy and can be found on Slide 15, this is very important and that is GAAP reported different there. Now I can move. As we look further down in the income statement, equity and affiliate earnings was about 9 million in the quarter which is up slightly from last year. Interest expense and finance charges were 21 million in the quarter, up from 10 million a year ago and this increase is primarily due the $1 billion and \u20ac500 million fixed rate seniors notes issued in the first and third quarters of 2015 respectively. Provision for income taxes in the quarter, on a reported basis was 80 million. However, this included 1 million tax benefits associated with our non-comparable charges plus an additional 1 million favorable tax adjustment. You can read about each of these adjustments in our 10-Q which will be filed later today. So if we exclude those items the provision for income taxes was $82 million for an effective tax rate of 31% and I should note this is up from our guidance of 30%. Net earnings attributable to non-controlling interest were about 9 million in line with the first quarter of 2015. Let's take a look at our diluted earnings per share on Slide 5. Net earnings excluding non-comparable items but including Remy was $0.80 per diluted share. For comparisons with prior periods net earnings excluding non-comparable items and Remy was $0.77 per diluted share. Now let's take a closer look at our operating segments in the quarter, begin on Slide 6 of the deck. Reported income for the -- I'm sorry reported engine segment net sales were just under 1.4 billion in the quarter. Sales growth for the engine segment excluding currency was 4.5% compared to same period a year ago, primarily due to higher turbo charger and variable cam timing systems. Turning to Slide 7, adjusted EBIT was 233 million for the engine segment or 16.7 % of sales excluding currency, the engine segment's adjusted EBIT was up 10 million on 63 million of higher sales for an incremental margin of 15%. Turning to Slide 8 and starting from the right drive train segment net sales were 879 million for the quarter. Excluding Remy and FX sales growth for the drive train segment was 4.8% compared to same period a year ago primarily due to higher all-wheel drive sales. Now on Slide 9, adjusted EBIT was 84 million for drive train segment or 9.5% of sales reported, but it exclude Remy adjusted EBIT was 11.7% of sales which is up 10 basis points from the prior year. Excluding Remy and FX, the drive train segment adjusted EBIT was up 5 million and $30 million of higher sales for an incremental margin of 15%. Now let's take a look at our balance sheet and cash flow. We generated $35 million of net cash from operating activities in the first quarter which is typically our lowest quarter for cash flow. Our investment in working capital ramps up for the first quarter to match higher levels of business activity compared with end of the year. Capital spending was a $104 million in the first quarter down from a $140 million a year ago. Capital spending was above the trend in 2015, but we are returning to normal spending levels of 5% to 6% of sales this year.  Free cash flow which we define as net cash from operating activities less capital spending was an outflow of 69 million in the first quarter. That's a $38 million improvement from a year ago. Again this is a typical seasonal occurrence. We still expect to generate between 400 million and 475 million of free cash flow in 2016. At the mid-point that's up 50% from 2015. 200 million to 300 million of this free cash flow will be used to repurchase shares in 2016. Looking at the balance sheet itself, balance sheet debt increased by 48 million and cash decreased by 185 million in the first quarter compared with the end of 2015. The 233 million increase in net debt was primarily due to investments in working capital and share repurchases. We spent $80 million repurchasing 2.1 million shares in the first quarter, ahead of schedule for executing an expected 200 million to 300 million of share repurchases this year. Our net debt to net capital ratio was 37% at the end of the first quarter. That's up from 35.2% at the end of 2015. The net debt to EBITDA at the end of the year on a trailing 12 month basis was 1.5 times. Now I like to discuss our 2016 guidance which is slightly modified from our initial announcement. Returning to the slide deck, let's start with our sales growth guidance for the full year on Slide 10. Note that the baseline of 2015 net sales excluding Remy which was just under 7.9 billion. All in we expect growth between 12.7% and 17.5% which is down slightly from 13.2% to 18.3%. This change is primarily due to lower growth expectations from Remy's commercial vehicle business. We're seeing the same effect in Remy and commercial vehicle we're seeing in our core business. Currency is unchanged and net new business pricing and market related growth is also unchanged at 2.5% to 5.5%. Looking at our operating income guidance on Slide 11, from an operating performance perspective we are expecting 16% to 18% incremental margins on our core business sales growth which is slightly down from our previously guide of 18% to 20%. The change is due to slower progress of the Wahler restructuring as James mentioned earlier in this remarks. Our previous guide included $8 million tailwind from Wahler restructuring this year which is has been reduced to 3 million. On a comparable basis we still expect our operating income margin to be 13% or greater. And as including Remy our operating income margins still expect to be around the 12% range. Now on Slide 12, we have our EPS guidance we still expect earnings of $3.11 to $3.32 per share on a consolidated basis which includes about $0.12 per share from Remy. Excluding Remy we now expect earnings to be $2.99 to $3.19 per share. Now let's review of effective quarter guidance issue this morning starting with the sales growth on Slide 13. All-in we expect to grow between 10.6% and 16% in the quarter including about 12 percentage point due to Remy. Excluding Remy our growth in the quarter is expected to be between minus 1.5% to be positive 3.8%, but includes a negative impact of currency. Currency is expected to over sales by 290 basis points at the low end and 100 basis points on the high end. So if excludes Remy in currency the impact of net new business pricing and market related growth would drive growth between 1.5% to 4.5% in Q2. Now turning to Slide 14, we expect earnings of $0.78 to $0.83 per share on a consolidated basis in the second quarter which includes about $0.03 per share from Remy. Excluding Remy we expect earnings to be $0.75 to $0.80 per share. I would like to make a few concluding remarks, we had a good first quarter. Sales growth exceeded our expectations and we flowed this through to our operating income. But more importantly the first half of 2015 was a challenging year for us and we were having a difficult time setting our sales guidance because of the market index in that we have in BorgWarner and as a result this impacted earnings expectations last year, however, over the last three quarters we have settled this down and we have achieved our sales and earnings expectations. So as we look at the rest of the year, we expect to continue on this path solid sales growth, strong operating margins and improved cash flow for a year. I remain confident that we will deliver our 2016 guidance similar to as James expressed earlier. And with that, I will like to turnover call back to Ken. Ken Lamb : Thanks Ron. We're now going to move to the Q&A portion of the call. Melissa, please remind everyone of the Q&A procedures. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Rich Kwas : James following up on your comments regarding risk and opportunities and more risks here maybe versus 60 to 90 days ago, if we look at first quarter you came in better on organic growth versus your initial expectation, you didn\u2019t change the full year organic growth rate, but is it fair to say that you've taken some of these incremental risk into account through the second half of the year as it relates to the items you cited earlier? James Verrier : Yes, it's a good way to think about it Rich. Yes that is the good way and that\u2019s kind of the way I thought it would be useful to at least let you know what some of them could be, we're not necessarily saying that it will happen, but we just thought it was prudent and it does get back a little bit through to China, story a little you know that we've seeing some acceleration in the first half on these incentives that made way a little bit on the backend. Clearly, we have the Volkswagen business with China particularly and Europe for the market share risk point of view and just on that one Rich as an example we saw some of that way on us in the first quarter with China -- in Volkswagen in China. You can see the numbers. They were down in the production pretty significantly in the first quarter and still 20 plus percent of that business. So I mean the last Rich is we got some pretty big launches which we talked about on the prior calls with us penned to start with the super duty the Duramax and so. These are all -- I would say, these are kind of pretty small nuance and things, it's not big but when we add all of those up, we just see slightly skewed to the risk side than the opportunity side. We just think it\u2019s prudent reflect that and then play it from there. Rich Kwas : And then in North America inventory appear to be elevated here and we need some real descent flow through on the sale side over the next few months to justify that IHS number that you've referenced, what are you seeing on schedules at this point here in North America and it doesn't seem like you've factored in much on the North American front on the back half, but just curious on how you see things potentially playing out here? James Verrier : You're right Rich, that one we didn't reflect into our numbers in the back half of the year. We pretty much left that alone. I think what we're seeing is largely what you do, you know builds are -- you know the first quarter came in where it did. I think everybody's kind of looking at the second quarter as a kind of key one in terms of where we're stacking between production builds and inventory levels and that's going to give us a -- for me I think it's a pretty key quarter across all the OEMs. Generally, we're seeing build rates pretty good in general Rich, we're seeing not a whole lot of volatility, they're coming out pretty much as we'd anticipated. So we're not seeing I would just -- and that's why we didn't do anything with the back half guidance Rich. We left it alone. It's just an area like you and all of us were just paying attention and I think we'll get a little bit of a better readout to when we can look at the second quarter data and see what went on with the inventory and what went on with the production build. But we need the production builds to stay pretty strong and so far I would say they're holding pretty good and they hold like that we should be okay. Which is why we didn't adjust the back half. Rich Kwas : And then just last one, thanks James by the way. And this is the last one, Ron, I think it was referenced that Europe was maybe a little bit below expectation and I don't recall if you said exactly why maybe it was Volkswagen share, but what was -- volumes are coming better at least so far for 2016, just curious on what drove the [indiscernible]? Ron Hundzinski : It was -- we're just trying to get most of them and get actually for what it\u2019s -- we see Europe running pretty well in general. If you recall Rich in the fourth quarter and we had some transmission programs that we\u2019re running out and so you get a little bit of that noise flows through as those programs run off, and we did see a little bit of transmission build adjustment on VW which I obviously talked about. We saw a little bit of, little bit of share challenge from a VW perspective so that was, I mean it was a little lower than what we wanted, it wasn\u2019t a big number but there was a little bit of noise there and each -- those are the two big ones Rich, VW and transmission roll offs, those are the two for us. Operator : Your next question comes from Brett Hoselton with KeyBanc, your line is open. Brett Hoselton : I wanted to kind of take a step back and just ask a longer term conceptual question, you've obviously provided the backlog guidance of 4% to 6% through 2018, my question is this. As you kind of looked that backlog number that growth number, ideally how should we think about kind of upside versus downside. Upside opportunity versus downside risk and then secondly as you look out beyond that three year time horizon is that a pace that you anticipate maintaining or would it -- is it likely to decelerate or accelerate? James Verrier : That\u2019s a great thought -- let me take a shot at it okay. So first thing I would say, we're in the first year of the net new business and that's where we're communicating. We're comfortable, confident and feeling pretty good about this year okay. So that's what we think. As we look out, I'm going to say a couple of things. Are we comfortable internally as a company with the projection we made? Yes. Do we like it? Not really. I'd rather be much higher than 4% to 6% and we're working like crazy to get higher than 4% to 6% and as we get through this year we'll have a better read on what that looks like, and obviously we need a little bit more time. So our focus right now is we're comfortable with what's out there. We're going to execute and perform against which I think we're starting to do, which is really good. And I would say incrementally as I look out we will go up from mid-single digit growth at some point if not yet. That's kind of the way to think of it Brett, we will. And I don't anticipate that. It's certainly not '16 and I don't yet think it would be '17 either. I want you to know BorgWarner is not happy being a mid-single digit growth company. We're going to go -- we're not, we're going to focus like crazy to go higher than that. But it's too early Brett, we got to deliver and we got to execute on the mid-single digit growth. I think the Investor Day will, that's later this year will help provide some clarity and color on why we believe there is opportunity to transition up. But it is too early at this point Brett, we need a little more time to execute, deliver and do our work. Brett Hoselton : Okay, fair enough, and then switching gears, thank you James. As we think about M&A activity obviously you're digesting Remy and fairly large acquisition for you. As you kind of think about M&A activity should we think about it as kind of subsiding for another, for the next quarter or two, three, four quarters till you digest what you've bitten off so far, or can we expect maybe some additional bolt-on through the remainder of this year into next year? James Verrier : I think, you're right Brett. Priority one really is flawless execution on the Remy deal which I'm pleased with how that's going. You know from a financial perspective you know we feel comfortable if another deal came along, we could do it and we would do it. So I don\u2019t feel too inhibited from a smaller size bolt-on acquisition, I'm pretty comfortable there, and I think from a resource perspective we feel comfortable. So what I am saying to you is we're not slowing down our efforts to look at smaller bolt-on related deals whether it would be this year or next year, you always know that's kind of hard to predict the accurate timing, but I wouldn't wind you to think or anybody to think that we've done Remy, that\u2019s all we\u2019re doing and we've stopped kind of looking and working and talking about deals because that's not the case. We are, they would be clearly smaller than obviously the Remy transaction and they would be likely bolt-on complementary type technologies to what we have. So if that helps you Brett, that's where we're thinking. Operator : Your next question comes from Chris McNally with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Chris McNally : Thanks so much, guys. This is Chris McNally. It seems like the first half this you're on a pretty good track to execute your new plan, on the second half comments I am just very curious, you didn't mention mix and that's one of the areas of that everyone is trying to figure out, particularly in North America. Sedan production schedules sort of moving down replaced by rising truck, could you just walk through how that may affect numbers or particularly some of the programs you're associated with? James Verrier : Yes, sure, this is James again, Chris. As I mentioned earlier Chris, we've not really done anything relative from a guidance perspective to reflect any meaningful shift in North America. As I alluded to earlier, it is watch point for us more fundamentally inventory and production ratios as opposed to car-truck mix, if that helps you. I would say if let's say second half of the year, trucks stays a little bit stronger. It's probably a little bit favorable for BorgWarner, but it's not a big shift for us, we generally get a little better if its truck weighted versus car weighted. But it's not a big more for us, if that helps us. Chris McNally : And any specific program within truck that we should pay attention to whether for launches or just the largest amount of content or incremental margin? James Verrier : We have a lot of attraction for the F150. Ron Hundzinski : And the super duty launch. Operator : Your next question comes from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Good morning everyone. This is [Indiscernible] standing in for Adam Jonas. Just a couple of questions and apologies if this has been address earlier, but in the past you've highlighted how Remy has a narrow band of customers and you're planning to leverage your relationships with existing BorgWarner customers especially in Europe, how have those conversations evolved in the past few months? James Verrier : I would articulate it this way, think of it in two way, the core ex-Remy business starters, alternators, et cetera, and we're engaged in those conversations with customers that as of today have not in the past years from a Remy product and those conversations are going on, we're only a few months in. But I would say the opportunity for us is good, I mean we've served a lot of customers that Remy didn't, it's a little early to know how that's going to translate into revenue, we need a little more time. But I would articulate the conversations have been open and productivity and good thus far. As I alluded and mentioned in my opening comment already, the energy intensity excitement around the combination of products and future technology packages combining former BorgWarner is as probably exceeded our expectation from when we did the deal. As we've already said that\u2019s a longer term revenue play, those are 3 to 5 years offerings. But I would say to you those have been extremely positive. Unidentified Analyst : Understood and just a broader question on content going into cars. Obviously a lot of fuel efficiency content with ICE and electrification and there is also a lot of active safety content expected to get into cars, both clearly very important. And even with some content coming out, you would expect to see big net increases in cost that's in the median term, any thoughts how the consumer prioritizes different content and is actually able to afford all this increase in cost? James Verrier : I can comment on that for sure. I think I mentioned earlier that we're not seeing any slowdown in the dialogue and the discussion around the need for technology to drive better fuel economy emission and vehicle performance. I know there is a little bit of perception out there that that's going to slow down and so dollars can be shifted over to these other technologies. We have not seen that. Our activity is as good as it's ever been in terms of working with our OEMs and the business equation has not changed, it's purely a value equation of how can the OEM meet their feel economy and emissions standards at the minimal cost frankly. So that minimizes any impacts on the end consumers. So when I look across the suite of BorgWarner product to do that, we're in a very-very good position that's why we're delivering the strong mid-single digit growth we're. The adoption rates for our products remain very strong and they will do because there are very good cost effective solutions that get the automakers where they need to in a way that they can support their end consumer. Operator : Your next question comes from Richard Hilgert with Morningstar. Your line is open. Richard Hilgert : Couple of questions please. In your comments James, you talked a little bit about the commercial truck outlook and how that's impacting BorgWarner. Is commercial truck still going to be viewed by BorgWarner as being you know a core market or is commercial truck something that BorgWarner might start to move away from? James Verrier : Now in commercial truck, Richard, is a key part of our business and clearly it's challenged right now in terms of the market conditions, you know we'd seen you know globally you know no real growth in that sector if you wish for a while, but we're in there. You know BorgWarner has continued to grow in that sector, obviously we grow at a much faster pace on the light vehicles side of the business. So now the commercial vehicle businesses still remain very core to us. We have a number of our products across the portfolio that play in commercial vehicle, clearly the Remy transaction we did has a strong presence in commercial vehicle and that was attractive to us. So we remain committed to commercial vehicle, I think what we'll always see is with 80 plus percent of our business pass car related and a lot of growth in pass car as an end market, you're going to see that that growth generally outweighs in light vehicles over commercial vehicle, but that doesn\u2019t step us away from focusing commitment around commercial vehicle. Richard Hilgert : With the emissions legislation the Clean Air legislation around the world getting more stringent not only on passenger cars but also on commercial as well as stationary applications or marine applications whatever the case might be, are there any types of fuel efficiency or things that are attractive to BorgWarner on the commercial side that can be adapted from passenger or some new technologies that might fit in with BorgWarner's strategy on commercial? James Verrier : Yes, absolutely Richard, that's what we do today actually. You know if you think about you know the lot about what you could say commercial vehicle oriented turbo charger technology, we can and we do apply to the light vehicle side of the business and vice versa by the way. We run our turbo businesses as an example as a very integrated business that's very -- creates a lot of synergies from a technology perspective between the commercial vehicle and the light vehicle. Another great example is you know we apply that dual clutch transmission technology that emanated from light vehicle if you know with Volkswagen and you know we're applying that to the Eaton trucks, so that's another very good example. Our cooling thermal, cooling technology you know fans, fan drive, pump technology, cooling pumps, you know we apply those across both light and commercial vehicles. So it's definitely and if you think of the global situation Richard, where you know a lot of trucks commercial trucks that is, are getting smaller, think of life's little delivery van type technologies and you thinking some markets, you know light, so called light vehicles are getting bigger. You know large pickup truck type vehicles and SUVs, there is a blend of technologies that comes together that can offer competitive position, I think we do that actually very well. Richard Hilgert : Okay very good, turbo and diesel were kind of like hand-in-hand you don\u2019t usually handle one without the other. James Verrier : That's right Richard. Richard Hilgert : That makes sense. Operator : Your next question comes from John Murphy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. John Murphy : Just one question here I mean in the press release you guys were talking about the Gilly or Jilly EV7 initiative and you kind of allude to that it's designed for emerging high volume electric vehicle market. It sounds like a little bit of a change intrayear perception of the EU market, is that really focused on growth and the push for NEVs in China or is that sort of a broader statement about the global industry. James Verrier : John I'll take that. I'll say a couple of things, obviously we do see the EV market evolving. Our macro perspective is you know we generally pointed to you know a \u201920-\u201925 timeline of about a couple of percent of the fleet the world fleet would be EVs. We've always said that could be a percent too high or a little low, but in that range 2% or 3%. We're not moving at this point away from that view John. I would say incrementally we see more energy enthusiasm intensity in China around electric vehicles. I would say the bigger message we\u2019re trying to get across, John, is you know this overhang with EVs BorgWarner doesn\u2019t have anything, is simply not true. And that's kind of what we're trying to articulate that we will serve that market. And this is a great example of hard parts and assets that are going into electric vehicles leveraging BorgWarner's technology and it\u2019s in China and it's a reasonable volume, whether it\u2019s 15,000 this year. So macro not really changed on EV John, 2%-3% likely in the future, China probably getting incremental a little more aggressive that way, but the key message is BorgWarner is going to be in that space and play. John Murphy : That is very helpful and then just a follow-up question, I know you guys commented that shift from cars to crossovers might not have to big an impact on content directly in the short run. But I was just wondering if can comment if we see shift towards more body on frame trucks, specifically the F150, if that could be a real positive mix shift for you and also there maybe longer term as these crossovers are pushed towards all-wheel drive systems for active safety and just for the content could there be a step in content from that vantage point as well? James Verrier : I think as I mentioned earlier that we've done anything with our guidance to move away from any meaningful truck mix, truck-car mix in North America. And I said if we see a stronger second half where trucks a little better than what's expected today, I mean in general that helps us a little bit, we've been quite open that F150 is a very strongly contended vehicle for BorgWarner so that clearly helps and you have driven for us and I think you know this John, as that truck mix goes and they stop putting meaningful four-wheel drive or all-wheel drive transport capability and turbocharged engines. That starts to step up the content pretty meaningfully for BorgWarner. We have to watch and we do the GM truck share ratio because well our content is very strong on the Ford side, it\u2019s much less so on the GM side, to be transplant with you. Operator : Your next question comes from Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Joseph Spak : First question is with respect to Wahler and the commentary there, can you provide is there any updated timing and can you still get to the ultimate goals you originally see or this can take longer or are we now to assume that this is going to be structurally lower than initially thought? James Verrier : If you recall and I am sure you do, when we did the acquisition we've talked about 2 to 3 year transition period to get double-digit margins and then as we went through last year and forward a little bit of change on the restructure. We kind of pushed that, and so it\u2019s certainly going to be closer to three. I think two things, one I think will be challenges to get it done in three, but we will get there, now is that 3.5 is it 4, it 4.5. I would ask you give a little bit more time until we can through some of this heavy lifting on the restructuring that we\u2019re right in the middle of, but structurally we'll get there, we'll get to the double digit margins. We don't do it in the 3 year period, but we're going to get there. And give us a little more time as to whether that\u2019s a 6 months push out or 1 year push out, just because we\u2019re going to get through some of the challenges that we're in right now. But we will get there, I am not worried about that. Joseph Spak : Okay and then on the guidance, so I understand that the change in revenue from Remy, the EPS is there and I know you've sort of baked in a lot of additional risk for the year. So should we read in that holding EPS guidance, you're eating into that a little bit or was there something else that I missed, maybe that\u2019s a little bit better that allows you offset some of that softness? James Verrier : What I would say Joe, is it's within the range and we're talking about 2-3 cents here, I don't think it's worth going through a lot of hoops basically for kind of immaterial at this point. You're right. The sales guidance was all driven by Remy, commercial vehicle. Now you get some moving parts on the EPS and I won't go in detail, but for example tax rate went up that was negative, right. Now we had some offset in the core business which was more positive, but then it was offset by some negatives in Wahler. So there is a little bit of walk, but at the end of the day we're in the same range. Joseph Spak : And then last one, there has been lot more talk on 48-volt, I know that's something you guys have been incremental more excited about, are you seeing any uptick in quoting activity related to that? Ron Hundzinski : I would say Joe from our viewpoint, I would say the quoting activity in general across all electrification architectures is very strong and probably getting even stronger. A lot of the dialogue we will be in because this is where BorgWarner operate is, many time with the dialogues with the customer will be, they're not sure whether they want a 12-volt or a 48 or 12-and 48-volt. People like BorgWarner can help them find that conclusion. So I am not necessarily in the view that there has been a massive uptick in pure 48-volt architecture. I think it's definitely going to move up in electrification architecture which we talked about for a while and I think this imply sort of a win, which is James\u2019 view, the ones that conserve it\u2019s flexibility between 12-and 48-volt and not rely on either one. And we have a bunch of products to do that. So whether that\u2019s electric turbocharger, whether that's former Remy motor technology, just a name couple. So it's stronger and we\u2019re right in the midst of it. Operator : We have time for one final question and that question comes from David Leiker with Baird. Your line is open. Adam Schmitz : Hi, guys. This is Adam Schmitz on the line for David. On the two additional two additional logic vehicle programs that you won, are there any additional details you can give maybe in terms of products their content where you've won those programs? James Verrier : Adam I would to but I would get in trouble. With my -- the customers and give us a little bit of time and we'll get out for you. I just really wanted to convey that we continue to get momentum on these electric vehicle programs. I know understandably you want to data, if you can just give a little bit of time we'll get the clarity once we get our customer aligned with us and get that out for you okay. Adam Schmitz : That's fair worth a shot, and then I guess you've mentioned the higher level OME activity over the past several months, I mean just kind of seeing across the entire business are there maybe any products or geographies where you're seeing a strength? James Verrier : I think it's pretty linear actually pretty consistent Adam we're seeing that and quoting activity is strong across pretty much all of the business and our win rates are good and booking rates are good. I think incrementally the one I talked to a couple of time today is the electrified or electrification efforts, are incrementally a little higher and continued to go higher which is good news for us. But general it's strong, what I didn't want to convey, Adam was that all the causing activities higher strong on with electrified products and the core business is strong too. Ken Lamb : I would like to thank you all again for joining us. We expect to file our 10-Q before the end of the year which will provide detail to results. Any follow-up questions about our earnings release, the matters discussed during this call or our 10-Q, please direct them to me. Melissa please close out the call. Operator : That does conclude the BorgWarner 2016 first quarter results conference call. You may now disconnect.",

We will have product displays to demonstrate some of our newest technologies and vehicles available for you to experience these technologies first hand. Our senior leadership team will be present and available to answer questions throughout the event. We\u2019ve set up an RSVP link for you to confirm your attendance. You can find the link in a press release that we sent out on June 13 or send me an email and I\u2019ll get you the information. Please join us for what we expect to be the most meaningful investor event in our history.  Now, back to today\u2019s earnings release. Before we begin, I need to inform you that during this call, we may make forward-looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties as detailed in our 10-K. Our actual results may differ significantly from the matters discussed today. Now, moving on to our results, James Verrier, President and CEO, will comment on the industry and provide a high-level overview of our results and expectations for 2016 and Ron Hundzinski, our CFO, will discuss the details of our results and guidance. Please note that we have posted an earnings call presentation to the IR page of the website.  You'll find the link at the events and presentation section beneath the notice for this conference call. We encourage you to follow along with these charts during our discussion of our results. With that, I will turn it over to James. James Verrier : Thank you, Ken and welcome to everybody. As Ken said, Ron and I are really pleased to share our results from the second quarter with you and also talk about what the rest of the year looks like.  What I\u2019d like to do is, just start and make a few high-level comments on some of the bigger picture perspective as we look out into the macro industry or the macro environment in our industry and you can see a couple of points here on Slide 2 for those following along.  I think the theme I would talk the most to in terms of the macro view is the notion of uncertainty out there out there in the world. And whether that\u2019s some of the civil unrest issues that we see particularly in Europe.  We see tense political environment recently in Turkey, Middle East, pending U.S. elections and of course fairly recently the Brexit vote. All of that creates, I think, we all realize a sense of uncertainty at a macro view.  But interestingly, when I look at the world of autos, we\u2019ve generally seen a pretty stable steady as you go type environment and things playing out pretty much as we had expected. And as we look forward, I think that macro uncertainty will continue, but I do see the auto sides remaining fairly stable. And as I articulate that a little further and talk to you about the market outlook, first of all from a light-vehicle perspective, I would say from a BorgWarner viewpoint, we are pretty well aligned with IHS.  We see the China market growing in that mid single-digit 5% to 6% type range. We see Europe in a 2% to 3% growth environment range, and we see the US in that 2% to 3% range of growth, the light-vehicle production.  We do see and we acknowledge that the US plateau, its effect is certainly on the horizon and we are very mindful of that. From a commercial vehicle point of view, we still see that space challenged for sure and as you look around globally, that there is really not a lot of growth at all and we do see some pretty continued strong weakness around off-road.  Some of that translates into a lot of new programs under further review and consideration. So as I look at that, I would like to share with you, what are the leading indicators or the areas of watch for us as a company at BorgWarner and the ones that can be most relevant to us.  So I would characterize the North American market, how is the plateau going to play out, how is the inventory production level is going to play out and we pay good attention to that.  And I\u2019ll talk about how these relate to our guidance shortly. VW remains a critical customer and a very important customer for us and we have to monitor the share for VW around the world.  And like everybody, we are going to pay attention to the potential impacts of volumes in Europe in light of Brexit and we will obviously monitor the commercial vehicle weakness.  Now all that said, I would say, so fast things have absolutely planned up for our guidance and as you'll see in the guidance going forward, we still feel good about our guidance and we are building these in and going forward with good guidance. So, yes, we are watching, but we are also performing as expected and we expect to perform strongly going forward.  Let me comment a little on the regulatory or the technology aspects of the business. First thing I would say to you is, the pull and the drive for fuel economy and emissions regulations, absolutely unchanged and the pull for powertrain technology remains as strong as it did last quarter, the quarter before that and the quarter before that.  So we are not seeing any slowdown in customer engagement and programs that are driving and pulling advanced technology as we go forward. We do see the strong shift to increase powertrain electrification continues and we know that because we are right in the middle of it and we are talking to customers literally every day around the world in terms of working with them on solutions for them in that additional electrification content.  That applies across the board. That is 48 volt architectures, it\u2019s all the hybrids and it\u2019s electric vehicles and we have content and discussion there and not just for the long-term, but products in the short run as well. I would say also relative to electrification our quoting activity remains very strong, multiple customers, multiple products, and we will be making further announcements on specific programs in the coming weeks and months.  But I would just say this, I feel very pleased and very happy where we are at in terms of the level of engagement around new technology aligned with electrification. And as Ken alluded to in his opening comments, we plan to showcase a lot of those products, a lot of those technologies at our upcoming Investor Day on September 7. So let me kind of give us some high-level view here on the BorgWarner summary and let me start off with Q2.  And needless to say Ron is going to provide a lot more detail and commentary in his comments. But I would just say this we had a really good quarter. I was very pleased with our second quarter. The growth came in at the high-end of our guidance and we delivered strong operating performance.  Breaking that down a little further, it was $2.3 billion in sales, which is up 3.5% when we exclude FX and Remy. Regionally, it came in about as we had expected, which really was characterized by stronger growth in North America, and a particularly strong quarter in Korea, which was balanced with the lower growth as we had expected in Europe and China. EPS came in at $0.84 a share when we exclude non-comparables and that does include Remy. Operating margin 12.4% when we exclude Remy, 13.2%, the word I would use is impressive.  Breaking that down by segment, engine sales $1.4 billion, so we grew at about 2.2% on a reported basis, or 2.8% when we exclude currency. Primary drivers of the engine growth were Turbo and Variable Cam Timing.  Switching to drivetrain, sales of $895 million, that\u2019s almost 43% but when we exclude currency and Remy still a good quarter of 5.4% growth. Largest part of the growth came from strong all-wheel drive sales in both North America and also in Europe.  So let me shift gears and talk a little bit about the outlook for 2016, and again Rob will provide more color on this. Basically, we\u2019ve narrowed our guidance range to the high-end of our previous range, which we think is very good news.  We also have highlighted through the last couple of quarters four major launches this year that we\u2019ve talked about that are very critical to our success in the second half of the year. And just to remind you folks, it was the Pentastar Engine, Ford Scorpion, Ford Super Duty, and the GM Duramax. All of these programs have launched except the Duramax which will launch in September. And I would say to you that the launches have been probably slower than the original assumptions, but here is the good news, this is exactly what we had anticipated and planned for in our guidance back in January. That\u2019s why we did it and as a result of that, our launch activity remains on track.  So the outlook on the second half of the year, if I talk about that, I would characterize it to you that I think our risks and our opportunities are pretty well balanced. I alluded earlier in my comments, there are some risks and some watchpoints out there but I also see some positive aspects too and in general, I see what balanced and with that that\u2019s why we feel confident in our full year guidance at mid single-digit growth and continued strong operating performance. Let me make a few comments around growth in general and give you a little bit of an update on the Remy acquisition and integration. First of all, from an integration perspective, it\u2019s going well and I think it\u2019s fair to characterize it that both financially and operationally, it\u2019s performing very much as we had expected.  We remain very positive about the technology that came with the acquisition, and we have had many, many discussions with our customers, particularly around the combination products where we are going to leverage the rotatum electrical capability of Remy with our clutching capability.  So that\u2019s very much on track and you will see that hardware for those of you lucky enough to be with us on September 7. In general, our quoting and our booking activity remains strong and very good about the win rates on our booking business and all of that leads to inline expectations are on track for growth. So let me kind of wrap up before I turn over to Ron. We had a good first half to the year and we feel very good about we delivered what we said we would. I think the business is operating well.  We continue to be heavily focused on driving growth through the adoption of our technology, and we remain upbeat and positive about delivery and our full year guidance. So with that, let me turn the call over to Ron. Ron Hundzinski : Thank you, James and good day everyone. Before I review the financial details, I would like to bright you some of the highlights as I see them for the quarter. In summary, we saw solid growth, great operating performance and a return to normal CapEx spending and free cash flow generation.  Now as Ken mentioned, I will be referring to supplemental financial slide deck that is posted on our website. So I do encourage you to follow along. But first, I\u2019d like to focus your attention on Slide 2, I am sorry, Slide 3.  Throughout the presentation I will highlight certain non-US GAAP measures to provide a clear picture of how the core business performed and for comparisons with prior periods. Specifically, we will be excluding the impact of FX, Remy, and non-comparable items from certain US GAAP measures.  So when you hear me say on a comparable basis, that means excluding the impact of FX, Remy and non-comparable items. When you hear me say on a reported basis, that means US GAAP. Now with that our of the way, let's move forward. Let\u2019s turn to Slide 4. On a reported basis, which includes the change in sales due to market growth, price, net new business, FX, and Remy acquisition, sales were up 14.6%. On a comparable basis, our sales are up 3.5%, just above the midpoint of our guidance.  On a reported basis, gross profit as a percentage of sales was 21.3% in the quarter, on a comparable basis, gross margin was 21.4% up 30 basis points from last year. On a reported basis, SG&A was 8.7% of sales.  On a comparable basis, SG&A was 8.2% of sales or basically flat from the same period a year ago. R&D spending, which is included in SG&A was 3.6% of sales. However, this did include the impact of Remy. So on a comparable basis, R&D spending as a percentage of sales was flat year-over-year. Now let\u2019s look at the year-over-year comparison for operating income which can be found on Slide 5. Starting on the right, second quarter 2016 operating income excluding non-comparable items but including Remy it was $288 million or 12.4% of sales. If you also exclude Remy\u2019s $13 million net contribution, operating income on a comparable basis was $275 million or 13.2% of sales up 30 basis points from a year ago and yes, James, that is impressive. On a comparable basis, operating income was up $16 million on $71 million of higher sales. That gives us incremental margin of 23% in the quarter, outstanding performance. As you look further down the income statement, equity and affiliate earnings was about $10 million in the quarter down slightly from a year ago.  Interest expense and finance charges were $21 million in the quarter, up from $18 million a year ago, the increase is primarily due to the $500 million Euro fixed rate senior notes issued in the third quarter of 2015.  Provision for income taxes in the quarter on a reported basis was $84 million. However, this included $2 million net tax benefit related to our non-comparable items and a favorable tax adjustment. You can read about each of these adjustments in our 10-Q which will be filed later today. Excluding these items, the provision for income taxes was $86 million for an effective tax rate of 31%, which is inline with our full year guidance. Net earnings attributable to non-controlling interest was about $11 million, up $2 million from the second quarter of 2015, this line item reflects our minority partner share in the earnings performance of our Korean and Chinese consolidated joint ventures.  Now let\u2019s take a look at our diluted earnings per share on Slide 6. Net earnings excluding non-comparable items, but including Remy were $0.84 per diluted share. On a comparable basis, net earnings were $0.80 per diluted share. Now let\u2019s take a closer look at the operating segments in the quarter beginning on Slide 7 of the deck.  Reported Engine segment net sales were just over $1.4 billion in the quarter. Sales growth for the Engine segment on a comparable basis was 2.8%, primarily due to Higher Attributable Charger and Variable Cam timing sales, partially offset by weak commercial vehicle markets around the world.  Turning to Slide 8, reported adjusted EBIT was $235 million for the Engine segment or 16.3% of sales. On a comparable basis, the Engine segment adjusted EBIT was up $8 million on $39 million of higher sales for an incremental margin of 20%, again solid performance for the Engine segment. Turning to Slide 9 and starting from the right. Drivetrain segment net sales were $895 million in the quarter. This included $240 million of sales from Remy. Sales growth for the Drivetrain segment on a comparable basis was 5.4%, primarily due to higher all-wheel drive sales.  On Slide 10, reported adjusted EBIT was $93 million for the Drivetrain segment or 10.4% of sales. Excluding Remy, adjusted EBIT was 12.2% of sales, up 70 basis points from the prior year.  On a comparable basis, the Drivetrain segment\u2019s adjusted EBIT was up $10 million on $34 million of higher sales for an incremental margin of 29%, very good performance for the Drivetrain segment.  Now, let\u2019s take a look at our balance sheet and cash flow. We generated $362 million of net cash from operating activities in the first half of the year, which is up $43 million from a year ago. Capital spending was $235 million in the first half, which is down $15 million from a year ago. Capital spending was above our trend in 2015, but we have returned to normal spending levels. As a percentage of sales, CapEx was 5.1% in the first half at the low end of our historical range of 5% to6% of sales. Free cash flow which was defined \u2013 which we define as net cash from operating activity less capital spending was $127 million in the first half, up $93 million from a year ago. We are still on track to generate between $400 million and $475 million of free cash flow in 2016 and at the midpoint that\u2019s up 50% from 2016.  Looking at the balance sheet itself, balance sheet debt increased by $85 million and cash decreased by $83 million. In the first half, compared with the end of 2015, we purchased \u2013 our debt increased $168 million, which is primarily due to share repurchases. We spent $100 million repurchasing 5.4 million shares in the first half, they have scheduled for executing expected $200 million to $300 million of share repurchases this year.  Our net debt to net capital ratio was 36.3% at the end of the second quarter, up from 35.2% at the end of 2015. Net debt to EBITDA at the end of the year on a trailing 12 month basis was 1.5%.  Now I'd like to discuss our current 2016 guidance, which has improved from our previous guide, as James mentioned. So returning to the deck, let's start with our sales growth guidance for the full year, on Slide 11.  Note that the baseline 2015 net sales exclude Remy. We have raised the low end of our guidance range by 100 basis points, all in, we expect to grow between 13.7% and 17.5% this year, up from 12.7% to 17.5% previously. Helping the improved outlook is due to greater comfort with volume and launch-time assumptions in our net new business.  The other half is because we expect the impact of currency to be less negative, compared with our previous guide. Market-related growth and new business growth net of pricing is now expected to be between 3% and 5.5%.  Now, let's look at our operating income guidance on Slide 12 from an operating performance perspective. We are expecting 15% to 17% incremental margin on our core business sales growth, which is slightly down from our previous guide of 16% to 18%. This is nothing excited about just a few minor adjustments after taking a closer look at the remaining part of the year.  On an incremental - incremental margins will be lower in the second half, then the 19% we delivered in the first half, primarily due to a tough comparison in the third quarter last year. In the third quarter 2015, we implemented sharp cost controls in response to the macro uncertainty we saw last year.  That spending has returned to normal making the year-over-year third quarter comparison challenging. On a comparable basis, we still expect our operating income margin to be greater than 13%, and including Remy, our operating income margin is still to be expected to be greater than 12%.  On Slide 13, we have our EPS guidance. We now expect earnings of $3.16 to $3.32 per share. This includes $0.12 per share contribution from Remy, up from the $3.11 to $3.32 previously. The primary driver of the change is a lower share count which raised EPS by about $0.04 across the range.  Raising the low end of our sales guidance range added another penny per share to the low end and at the high end of the range, the lower incremental margin and other minor adjustments offset the lower share count.  Now let's review our third-quarter guidance issued in this morning starting with the sales growth on Slide 14. All in, we expect to grow between 13% and 21% in the third quarter, excluding 13 percentage points due to Remy. Excluding Remy, our growth in the quarter is expected to be between 0.3% ad 7.6% but this includes a negative impact to currency.  Currency is expected to lower sales by 220 basis points at the low end and 10 basis points at the high end. On a comparable basis, we expect to grow between 2.5% and 7.5% in the quarter. Our growth is improving in the second half, primarily due to major truck launches with GM and Ford.  From an earnings perspective, as shown on Slide 15, we expect earnings of $0.74 to $0.81 per share in the third quarter which includes about $0.03 per share from Remy. Excluding Remy, we expect earnings to be $0.71 to $0.78 per share.  So in conclusion, we had a very good second quarter. This is the third quarter in a row of exceeding our EPS and sales goals. And as we look forward at the rest of the year, we expect to continue on this path. Solid sales growth, strong operating margins, and improved cash flow from a year ago, I absolutely remain confident that we will deliver our 2016 guidance. And with that, I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Ken. Ken Lamb : Thanks, Ron. We are now going to move to the Q&A portion of the call. Chrissie, could you please remind everyone of the Q&A procedure? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Rich Kwas from Wells Fargo Securities. Rich Kwas : Hi, good morning everyone. James Verrier : Good morning, Rich. Ron Hundzinski : Good morning, Rich. Rich Kwas : So I just wanted to follow-up on, on the launches here. So Ford indicated some issues on their end, at least with Super Duty, you indicated that it launched on your end and so, is there \u2013 as you look at it right now, and what have you factored into potential incremental risk for the launches into the back half of the year? James Verrier : Yes, I think, Rich, what I would say is, let me try and take it this way with you. So as we started out the year, we \u2013 obviously, we had a lot of launches and what have you and the approach we took was sort of \u2013 build some judgment into the launch cadence, right, by the timing and volume and then, obviously, we have factored in some macros. So I am getting confidence, if you look at the first couple of quarters, where we\u2019ve gone through other launches around the world. Clearly, the second half is a little more weighted, as I sit here today, I feel, we\u2019ve done a pretty good job of factoring in the launch cadences as we see today.  So, it\u2019s never perfect right, you don\u2019t know, but I think we\u2019ve continued that mantra of applying some judgment to the both - the timing and the volume ramp. And I think as we sit here today, we are as good as we can build in terms of forecasting it up. Rich Kwas : Okay and then within Ford and VW, two of your most important customers, when you look at Ford within North America and then VW within Europe, what\u2019s changed since the beginning of the year in terms of outlook? Ford looks to be a little heavy on inventory in particular F-series has been. Have you factored any additional risk as it relates to some of the key programs for both those customers? James Verrier : Yes, I think, again if I think of it in the first half, second half, Rich, as a good example, actually the first quarter we talked about VW run light in China, you remember that, but that is tough timing in China. But in the second quarter in China, we anticipated some challenges there and we still delivered. So again, it gives me some comfort and I think it\u2019s fair to say, we\u2019ve built in some judgment factor here about whether it\u2019s VW market share, whether it\u2019s volume ramps and I think at this stage we feel pretty well covered by it. Rich Kwas : Okay, and then, just a last quick one for me on the fuel efficiency standards. Those got initial proposal or updated proposal for mid-term review got released a couple of weeks ago. James, you indicated that the discussions are still very healthy around Powertrain and whatnot. Anything that the changes seem to be pretty modest, at least if they go through as detailed? So, what are your updated thoughts now that we have something on a piece of paper that we can debate? James Verrier : Yes, I think you captured it really well, Rich actually, it\u2019s very modest changes. The only thing that\u2019s a little different us, it was \u2013 obviously the truck comp mix is a little different in North America, so that kind of moves things around in our company to look at their overall fleet averages. But fundamentally, I mean, the standards are not changing of any note, have you. I would say the pull for the types of technologies that we have to deliver on those standards is as strong as it was six months, twelve months or eighteen months ago. So we are not seeing any pullback at all in terms of these iron drives for the types of technologies that we have and I think our best guess is we engage with EPA and others is, there could be some nuancing and some modest minor tweaks to the standards. But we have not seen anything material enough that changed the direction of the OEMs and what we are doing with them. Rich Kwas : Okay. Thanks, I\u2019ll pass it on. I appreciate it. James Verrier : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Leiker from Robert W. Baird & Company. Your line is open. Adam Schmitz : Hi guys, this is Adam on the line for David. Ron Hundzinski : Good morning, Adam. James Verrier : Good morning. Adam Schmitz : I appreciate we are still several quarters away from you guys giving a bookings number, but as we sit here halfway through the year, can you give a little more color on the pace of new bookings over the past several years and kind of how they have trended relative to 2015? James Verrier : Yes, I think, you are right, we will do our net new business update as we go into January. So it\u2019s a few months away. If we reflect back on the current backlog of net new business, we \u2013 this year it was a mid single-digit type growth and as you can see so far we delivering against that. So that gives us comfort. It stepped up just a little into 2017 and 2018, but still in that mid single-digit range. And I think, we will give a lot more color as we get closer to it. But, I don\u2019t think there has been any material shifts to sway us away from sustained mid single-digit growth at least for the next couple of years. So that\u2019s typically how I think about it Adam. Adam Schmitz : Great, great. And then on the strong incremental margins in the quarter kind of driving your margin gains, how sustainable are these moving forward, just given some of the restructuring actions you've taken and then some of the improvements and Wahler and Remy, et cetera? Ron Hundzinski : A good example Adam, just if you take a look at Drivetrain segment, which is nearly 30% incremental margins. There is a portion in there of the restructuring activities benefit that we are getting. So, when you go to a comparable basis, eventually year-over-year, that\u2019s going to moderate back to a normal mid teen type of incremental margins. I think we expect a little bit of that still in this year, but as we go into next year is when you start to see it moderate. I think the Engine segment at 20 was actually a better performance probably we anticipate it going in, just a great job. Our target still is mid-teens, but I think the majority of that really was the benefits of the restructuring cost year-over-year Adam Schmitz : Great, and then just lastly from me, you guys have one of the largest European businesses across the auto supply space. Just wondering what you are hearing from your customers, post-Brexit? James Verrier : Yes, I think, you are right. First of all the second quarter was a good quarter for Europe in general pretty much across the board with most of the OEMs, it was a good solid quarter.  But I would characterize year-to-date it\u2019s been actually stable and good in Europe. I would say from a post-Brexit perspective, we anticipate, I think like everybody else that the UK car production itself will have some impact as we go forward into 2017 and 2018. From a BorgWarner perspective our UK content is very small.  How much of that then will flow into Europe in general, I think we need a little more time. I think everybody needs to kind of digest that. So we are watching it and I think it\u2019s a little early from a \u2013 how does it impact Europe in general. I would tell you we\u2019ve not seen any impact thus far in schedules and relationships and those types of things.  So, I think it\u2019s going to be more of a 2017 type event and a 2016 event for Europe and the UK will trim itself up, but again that\u2019s \u2013 but that 1% of our revenue is in the UK. So, we feel pretty good where we are at right now. Adam Schmitz : Great. Thanks, guys. Ron Hundzinski : Thank you. James Verrier : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris McNally from Evercore. Chris McNally : Hi, guys. Thanks so much. I wanted to go into a little detail on the Drivetrain margin, which is extremely strong for the quarter. You guys discussed that the incremental margin maybe in the second half will be a tougher compare, particularly in Q3.  Could we just go into that in a little bit more detail some of the costs that you took out and where costs may be coming back and also can we start to think about the Drivetrain margin sequentially throughout the year? Is this sort of ex Q3 seasonality or it\u2019s a little bit down? Is this sort of a good level going forward? Ron Hundzinski : So let\u2019s talk about the Drivetrain incremental margins for the second quarter first, okay. If you look at \u2013 I\u2019ll go back to Slide 10, you get this 29% incremental margin which is about $10 million, probably little bit less than half of that is because of the tailwinds that we are having for the full year from the restructuring activities, so it will cost $4 million for example.  So, that\u2019s the benefit we are getting from the restructuring. If you take a look at the full year guidance, you can see $15 million roughly. I think we are $7 million year-to-date of restructuring tailwinds. So, we had about two I think it was in the first or something, sort of remaining in the second quarter.  That\u2019s going to continue through the rest of the year. We will get that other 7, say rounding numbers here through the rest of the year and now the third quarter might be a little bit tougher, but the fourth quarter will get that through the year. I think we are on track in that range that we have for tailwinds. So that\u2019s Drivetrain, okay, which the best, we are on track.  Now, the other issue that we are dealing with is the year-over-year, I mentioned in my script that we took some cost controls primarily in SG&A last year, when we saw some difficulties in the macro environment we are facing.  So some of this SG&A spending is going to come back in the second half of the year, specifically, probably in the corporate spending rates will uptick about few million bucks here and there in the next two quarters. So that\u2019s what you are going to see going forward sequentially in the SG&A side, primarily in the corporate. Chris McNally : Okay. Perfect. Thanks so much. Ron Hundzinski : Thank you, Chris. James Verrier : Thank you, Chris. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson from Barclays. Brian Johnson : Yes, good morning. James Verrier : Good morning, Brian. Brian Johnson : Just have some questions. One, kind of third quarter, more housekeeping-ish, and second more strategic. On the third quarter, fairly wide range of revenue estimate for the guide. Can you talk maybe a little bit more about the factors around that plus or minus that 5% swing that it could be? Ron Hundzinski : Yes, Rich, I mean, sorry Brian, and actually what I would say Brian, good observation, because it is a wide range and it\u2019s there intentionally for several factors. First, James mentioned, our launch cadence. There is a lot of still uncertainty on the launch cadence. We are comfortable with our guidance as far as the range, but they could swing fairly wildly because, some of it is new conquest business, it\u2019s not carryover business. So those have a significant impact on us. The second item is, we are going through the third quarter where you have customer shutdowns and although they say one thing, they may behave another way and it could be \u2013 that could be plus or minus. There is uncertainty on shutdowns.  And then the third, I would like to point out, James talked about, just the general uncertainty, a good example is Ford this morning in their announcement and then James gave all the macro political issues going on. So when you factor in auto variability we kept the range wide quite frankly, because there is a lot of variability going on right now. Brian Johnson : Okay and second question, and I know you\u2019ll discuss this more at the Investor Day on September 7. What did you say in terms of booking activity during the quarter around 48 volt and hybrid systems? And certainly, we noted Valeo a couple of days ago had some very strong momentum in that segment of its business in terms of the pipeline. What are you seeing around that? James Verrier : Yes, Brian, we will show you, as you said, we will show you in a few weeks, a little bit more around that. But, we have a wide range of activities going on. Our quote activity is strong. And I would quote it in a lot of products both across pure EVs, hybrids in general and then 48 volt architectures.  So we are \u2013 we continue to see strong activity. We are limited as to what we can say on specific business wins, Brian, just because of the customer approvals and communication, but it\u2019s a wide range of products ranging from belt alternator starter systems, E-booster technology, P2 hybrid clutching control modules.  It\u2019s a wide range and the activity is very, very strong to be open and it\u2019s across a wide spectrum of products that is all leading to generating growth. Now what we will show you as we get to the Investor Day, Brian is, what\u2019s the ramp and the cadence of that growth, because obviously it\u2019s not this quarter or next quarter, these are programs that are going to kick in, in the next couple of three years. But we will take you through that basically, product-by-product and growth outlook that summarizes the specific question, quote activity is very strong and robust and we are winning pretty good share of what we want. But more to come in September Brian, is that\u2019s fair? Brian Johnson : And just to hit me, one quick follow-up, on Ron's comments about the third quarter. Ford indicated the need or we wouldn\u2019t necessarily argue there is a need to work down Ford inventory. So as you put together your guide, were you thinking in terms of what you would consider to be conservative Ford schedules as you thought about Q3 in second half? James Verrier : The way I would articulate it Brian is, the way we have been modeling for our business was, sequentially a step-down in the second half of the year versus the first half of the year.  So that\u2019s how we had modeled it. I think it\u2019s fair to say, through the first half of the year, we had modeled might be a little lighter than customer relations and schedules and as you see we\u2019ve done well in the first couple of quarters. So I think, we are pretty well aligned at this stage.  Obviously, inventory adjustments and those things can be a little choppy and can create some noise, but I think, thus far we\u2019ve done a pretty nice job of anticipating and modeling in a pretty \u2013 in a balanced way, Brian, is the way I would characterize it. Brian Johnson : Okay. Thank you. James Verrier : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman from JPMorgan. Samik Chatterjee : Hi, this is Samik Chatterjee on for Ryan. The first question I had, a lot of discussion today on the call about the Ford Super Duty launch. So just wanted to get a context here from you I know, you have roughly indicated what sort of revenues from Ford, but, okay, are you able to share what ballpark for the Ford Super Duty is in terms of revenue for you guys? James Verrier : Yes, I can give you a couple of thoughts here. So, if you look at what \u2013 our business and let\u2019s focus a little bit on North America, because I think that\u2019s really where the majority of the action is here. So, if you look at what our percentage is there, it\u2019s high single-digit of our total company.  So, rough numbers, you can think of all of BorgWarner with Ford in North America maybe about an $800 million, $900 million revenue number for the year. So half of that\u2019s gone, right. So we are talking about a 400-ish number in the second half. I said that, earlier that, sequentially we are at a little lower, so you south the $400 million in the second half of the year.  So let\u2019s just play that out and maybe that moves down a little bit based on some inventory true up, what are you, $20 million, $30 million, $40 million type of a number for our things. So it\u2019s important for us. We are not dismissing it, but it\u2019s also scaleable and manageable from a BorgWarner point of view.  It\u2019s the way I would think of it. Specifically on the Super Duty, as Ron alluded to earlier, it\u2019s important to recognize that\u2019s conquest business for us. So, we go from zero to whatever. But our view is, at this stage is, we\u2019ve been following the schedules from Ford pretty well and we anticipate a good second of the year on Super Duty. Samik Chatterjee : Got it. The second question, just pretty wide ranges for organic growth both in third quarter and probably implied for fourth quarter as well. I was wondering what are you really embedding in that guide for the commercial vehicle markets in the second half and what is the degree of risk you see in that market? James Verrier : Yes, now that\u2019s good thought. We\u2019ve \u2013 I think, we\u2019ve factored in overall a very low growth environment at all for commercial vehicle. We\u2019ve built in a pretty low Class-8 build for the North America and so that\u2019s a pretty strained area.  I would say, a low to no growth environment in China and continued weakness around all highway pretty much globally and then a little bit of a growth in Europe over the road. And then Brazil remaining very challenged. So that\u2019s kind of what we are saying and I would say for us, what we\u2019ve seen in the first half of the year is, commercial vehicle is coming pretty much where we had anticipated for both Q1 and Q2. So I don\u2019t, and those have been some choppy orders. So I wouldn\u2019t expect this to be far off as we look into Q3 and Q4. Samik Chatterjee : Just a final housekeeping one. I got to be trying both on incremental margin in the Engine segment year-over-year, just going sequentially and looking from 1Q to 2Q, the margins did sort of decline slightly, even on higher revenue. So, I was just wondering what that probably was attributable to? James Verrier : Yes, that was what we just discussed this previously. SG&A costs will sequentially probably tick up. So that will probably bit more incremental margins more into \u2013 what I would call the normal range for us, which is mid-teens. So that\u2019s what\u2019s driving that is the SG&A spend sequentially. Samik Chatterjee : Okay, thanks. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Pat Archambault from Goldman Sachs. Dave Tamberrino : Hi, good morning. Hi, it\u2019s actually Dave Tamberrino on for Pat. A couple quick questions from us. One, as we are unpacking the revenue growth of the two segments, looking at Engine being up 2.8% versus Drivetrain up 5.4%.  Traditionally, you'd think about the Engine business with the turbochargers being really the growth engine here. Wondering what\u2019s kind of creating this dynamic where Drivetrain is growing faster than Engine? Is it just the commercial vehicle weakness that you spoke to earlier, Ron, in Engine, and the all-wheel drive growth that you are seeing in Drivetrain that\u2019s driving it or is there something else there? James Verrier : Yes, this is James, let me take a shot at that for you. I think, obviously, you will see quarters bounce around a little bit. Sometimes we are a little up in \u2013 higher in Drivetrains, sometimes it\u2019s Engine, it moves around a little bit. But in terms of why Engine was a little lower than some of our historical quarters, you are right, commercial vehicle was clearly a factor that only applies for our Engines segment.  There is no commercial vehicle revenue in Drivetrain. So that was a key weight for us. I would say the other area that weight a little bit on us is China where some of our larger customers in China, so I am talking about Volkswagen, I am talking about Great Wall, I am talking about Ford and GM. I had pretty low growth quarters if you aggregate those four, actually it was no growth. So, that weighed more on Engine than Drivetrain as well. And those are two of the biggest things. It doesn\u2019t really concern us, as I say, because we do have bounces from quarter-to-quarter. So, I think it\u2019s explainable and it\u2019s kind of frankly speaking what we had anticipated in our guide. Dave Tamberrino : Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. And then just lastly, if we are thinking about the European production guide that\u2019s kind of under or production cadence that's underlying your guidance.  There \u2013 it didn\u2019t sound like there is any softness as you are seeing or hearing, and there is not much as you\u2019ve really predicated into 2016 of any contagion from slower European sales growth as a result of the UK referendum. Is that the correct way to think about it? James Verrier : Yes, that\u2019s actually a good summary. As Ron alluded to, there is always a little noise around shutdowns. That obviously plays its part, but we feel we\u2019ve got that pretty balanced and as I said earlier, I think the UK referendum impact will play itself out over the coming months and probably even into next year. So, yes, I think, you captured that pretty well. Dave Tamberrino : Thank you very much. I appreciate all the detail. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brett Hoselton from KeyBanc. Your line is open. Brett Hoselton : Good morning, gentlemen. Ron Hundzinski : Good morning, Brett. James Verrier : Good morning, Brett. Brett Hoselton : I wanted to ask you a longer-term strategic question and I know you\u2019ve talked about this some, but there is, I have got a number of questions from clients with regards to Remy and I was hoping you could provide us with some specific examples of how Remy helps you get into the electrification of the powertrain specifically?  Secondly, do you anticipate it resulting in maybe, some sort of a hockey stick improvement in your revenue growth rate or does it just kind of allow you to continue to grow in the current range?  And then finally, if you do actually see some sort of an uptick in your growth rate, what\u2019s kind of the timing on that? If I remember correctly, it\u2019s kind of a few years out, but go ahead. James Verrier : Okay, Brett. That\u2019s happy to talk about that. So, let me talk a little bit about sources of growth for Remy. I think that was kind of your key question. I would encourage you and the investors to think of two channels of growth, first for Remy.  First, channel of growth is primarily through their existing off-the-shelf technology for vehicles and applications that are in service today. What I mean by that is selling more belt alternator starters, starters and motors and generators to than they shell today.  And what I mean by channels is on light vehicle, today they ship to Hyundai and General Motors and that\u2019s it and we see you leveraging the BorgWarner channels and the BorgWarner Relationships.  But there is no reason on the planet why we come installing starters and alternators and belt alternator starter systems through other customers beyond their current. And regionally, they have almost no presence in Europe and clearly Borg has a big presence, so that\u2019s a regional play where we can accelerate our European relationships to grow what I would describe, Brett, as their core existing product line business.  So that\u2019s a source of growth for us that we will leverage. And you would anticipate that can be done in a shorter horizon only because this quoting activity today and we have product to put on those vehicles. So that\u2019s the first source of growth. The second source of growth is where you are alluding to is to help take us further into electrification and there is a number of potential opportunities there.  First of all, they have the motor technology that you could use either in a hybrid vehicle or a pure electric vehicle and that\u2019s the traction motor of sorts that we can use. The second path for them is to combine the rotating electrics of the motor coupled together with our clutching technology to offer hybrid vehicle solutions, where we need to bring together the motor and the clutching technology. So we can offer engagement or disengagement between the motor and the combustion engine. We have product on the shelf to do that today and we are quoting that activity. The third leg of opportunistic growth is the more advanced starter \u2013 belt alternator starter systems that will emerge as a lead for stop-start technology and hybrid technology and Remy has a number of products in that space that we will be pushing forward on to hybrid applications.  The last area I would say just in general they bring motor technology that helps us on other product applications, so if you think of \u2013 I talked about earlier about an e-booster technology, which is the turbo charger with a boosting device compressor device, it requires power electronics and motor know how, Remy can bring that knowledge to us.  All of that said, Brett, so where does that all translates to into dollars of growth? We are working our way through that. But there is certainly absolutely no reason why Remy wouldn\u2019t grow at least at BorgWarner levels. You got to give us a little bit of time to lay that out for you in terms of cadence and pull all of that together and we\u2019ll get through that over the next few months.  So what we are going to do, Brett is, we\u2019ll use this September day to showcase the technology for you and some of the \u2013 and what we are dong on it and then we\u2019ll pull all of that together in the January net new business to lay out for you what the next three years of growth looks like from \u2013 for Remy both from conventional products and the combination products with BorgWarner products. Hopefully, that helps you a little bit. Brett Hoselton : That was very thorough, James. That\u2019s perfect. Thank you very much. Have a great day, guys. James Verrier : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Stover from SIG. Matt Stover : Thank you very much. A question just to clarify again on the Drivetrain margins. When you spoke to the second half compare, Ron, you referenced incremental margins. So, we should expect that your incremental profitability should improve in the second half? You did have quite a heavy third quarter period there last year or am I misunderstanding it? Ron Hundzinski : All right, there is two topics here. One is, the Drivetrain segment will continue to get tailwinds from the restructuring activities that we did. If you look at the full year guidance from tailwinds, the majority of that tailwind is Drivetrain related.  And we haven\u2019t seen all those benefits yet go through Drivetrain. So we will continue in the Drivetrain segment on the tailwinds. Now when you step back and it\u2019s the total company, what\u2019s often it offset that a little bit is probably SG&A spending that\u2019s coming into the business.  So you have two dynamics going on. One is Drivetrain benefits tailwind, somewhat offset by SG&A spending coming back on a comparable basis. Matt Stover : Okay. And then the second question is on just the equity and affiliates. I would assume, although this may be incorrect, that the Japanese profitability was up year-to-year in the second quarter, how should we then think about the profit contribution from the other geographies? Ron Hundzinski : That line item doesn\u2019t really move that much. It fluctuates, what $1 million to $2 million historically, although it\u2019s been trending up over time. I wouldn\u2019t put a lot of focus on that line item.  It\u2019s been a little bit ball \u2013 there is other things that come into play, FX comes into play and the production of those areas. But I would say that in general, if you are going to have a bias I guess, from that line item I would bias it maybe to the positive side at the end of the day. Matt Stover : I am just - I am trying to figure out the regional variables in this. I would assume that with the strength in the yen year-to-year, the NSK-Warner profit contribution would have improved. And I am just trying to think through what happened with Korea and the other equity affiliates? Ron Hundzinski : Right, that\u2019s I was referring to the FX impact. So, you can see favorable impacts from Japan, but the one is softer a little bit. So they get somewhat upset. So there is a lot of variability up and down in that item and it doesn\u2019t really move that much.  The underlying production for us has been fairly positive. But it gets more offset by the FX variability quite frankly is what happens. So as you are trying to model it, what I would do is I would just try to model it where it\u2019s been and it\u2019s biased maybe to the positive side. Matt Stover : Thank you. Ron Hundzinski : Thanks, Matt. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Murphy from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. John Murphy : Good morning, guys. And I apologize, I got on the call late. So, if any of these are duplicative, please let me know and I can follow-up. Just first, as we look at the Super Duty launch in the second half of this year, I was wondering if you could indicate how much your content is going up on this new truck? And if you could give us a relative indexing or maybe even absolute of Super Duty content versus the F-150 for you on Drivetrain? James Verrier : Yes, John, so, Super Duty first thing, that\u2019s kind of good to know is it\u2019s \u2013 so this is conquest for us. We got \u2013 so it\u2019s zero. So you should probably think in the $400 to $500 range of content for us on that vehicle. It\u2019s probably a good reference point, John. John Murphy : Okay, and relative to the F-150? James Verrier : Depends \u2013 it\u2019s less than the F-150. If you think of the F-150 with all of our stuff on, transfer case, turbocharger, some variable cam timing product, you are kind of getting up kind of 2x versus the Super Duty. But it does depend a little bit obviously not all F-150s take a transfer case. So \u2013 but directionally, it\u2019s - F-150 is meaningfully higher than on content for us versus the Super Duty. John Murphy : Okay. Thank you. And then a second question and just very simplistically, on Remy and you may have talked about this, I mean, the margin progressioning and cost performance, I mean, where is that relative to your expectation? And was that a significant driver to, maybe some of the upside we saw in margins in the quarter? Ron Hundzinski : Yes, obviously, the Remy performance second versus first quarter has improved almost about 100 basis points, which is quite frankly, was what we expected given the synergies that we talked about when we did the acquisition. So, long story short, I would say, John, we are pretty much on track on executing those synergies right now. John Murphy : Okay. And then just lastly, I mean, some of the tone of the sort of the macro environment or industry environment from the automakers seems to be changing a little bit, a little bit less positive, not necessarily negative yet, but a lot less positive.  Are you seeing any change in your relationship on bidding or pricing with the OEMs at this point? Or is there is just really no change in the environment relative to some of the macro pressures that might be seeping into the industry? Ron Hundzinski : I would say, John, really no meaningful change. I mean, not to the labor, products and environment is always competitive, it\u2019s tough. But we are not seeing any movement there. I think I alluded earlier, John, maybe in terms of quoting activity, we are not seeing that tail-off or anything like that. R&D reviews, technology programs, advanced engineering programs, all pretty much continuing on as is so to speak. So, yes, we are not seeing any meaningful shift to your question. John Murphy : Great. Thank you very much guys. James Verrier : Thanks. Operator : We have time for one final question and that question comes from Joseph Spak from RBC Capital Markets. Jacob Hughes : Hi, this is Jacob Hughes on for Joe. I just had one final question. I was wondering if you could just comment on the M&A pipeline and as well as what you are assuming in your guidance for the buyback for the rest of the year? James Verrier : I\u2019ll take M&A pipeline first if you wish and then Ron can make some comments relative to the stock buyback program. So, M&A we\u2019ve talked about in recent calls, our primary focus obviously is to do successful integration of Remy. That\u2019s our priority one. You heard from Ron and both \u2013 Ron and myself that that\u2019s playing out well and as expected.  So, that\u2019s kind of moving along well. We remain active and very interested in additional M&A activities. I\u2019ve alluded in earlier calls that our primary focus is around electronic software, power electronics type place and we have a number of things moving forward in that space and then other areas of interest as we\u2019ve talked in prior calls around valvetrain and we\u2019ve also talked about boosting our thermal management capabilities.  So, yes, we remain active and if a deal is there for us, we would move forward. But again, priority one is successful integration of Remy. Relative to buybacks, Ron can give a clear format. Ron Hundzinski : Yes, buybacks, real quick. Our guidance for the year was $200 million to $300 million. If you took a look at our year-to-date, which is about $180 million. Obviously, I would say that we are into the high end of our guidance range right now where we are trending and short. Jacob Hughes : Yes, thank you. James Verrier : Thank you. Ken Lamb : All right, Jacob. Ken Lamb : So, I would like to thank you all again for joining us. We expect to file our 10-Q before the end of the day, which will provide details of our results. If you have any follow-up questions about our earnings release, the matters discussed during this call or our 10-Q, please direct them to me. Chrissie, please close out the call. Operator : That does conclude the BorgWarner 2016 Second Quarter Results Conference Call. You may now disconnect.",

Now, back to today's earnings call. Before we begin, I need to inform you that during this call we may make forward-looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties as detailed in our 10-K. Our actual results may differ significantly from the matters discussed today. Now moving on to our results, James Verrier, President and CEO, will comment on the industry and provide a high-level overview of our results and expectations for the remainder of 2016 and then Ron Hundzinski, our CFO, will discuss the details of our results and guidance. Please note that we have posted an earnings call presentation to the IR page of the website. You'll find the link at the events and presentation section beneath the notice for this conference call. We encourage you to follow along with these charts during our discussion of our results.  With that, I'll turn it over to James. James Verrier : Thank you, Ken, and welcome to everybody, to the call. Ron and I are really pleased today to share our third quarter 2016 results with you as well as give you some thoughts and outlook for the rest of the year.  I'd like to start, actually, by sharing a few thoughts on the macro environment in the industry in general, and you can see that on slide 2 if you're following along. So just a few thoughts on the macro state of the world. I think the word that we think about is still -- there's a level of uncertainty in the macro world. I think the slowing economic growth around the world is still on everybody's mind and that's presenting some challenges. You know, the world is still not without a lot of tenseness around some of the political climate. You think of the Middle East, you think of US election and those types of things, so there's still an environment of uncertainty.  But with that said, you know, what we've seen in the auto space is things have been moving along pretty well as anticipated and as expected, particularly in the third quarter. If I turn a little more specifically to the outlook around the auto space, let me start with some comments around light vehicle 2016 calendar year. Generally, our view on the marketplace is well aligned with HIS, which is calling for approximately a 7% growth in China on light vehicle. We see about 2% growth in Europe and the US is somewhere in the 2% to 3% growth. And we, like HIS and I think many on this call, we certainly acknowledge that the US cycle is maturing and in a slower growth mode.  If I reflect where we are on commercial vehicle, I think I would characterize the global commercial vehicle space as still challenged. We see North America and South America still down and challenged for sure. We do see a little bit of improvement this year running through Western Europe and China also. So while it's a mixed bag globally, overall this space is still challenged.  I always like to start these calls and talk a little bit about areas of watch that we think are particularly relevant to BorgWarner. And I would point, for us, to three in particular. The North American mature cycle I referenced earlier, and how that's going to play out with inventory. Recently we saw Ford aligning its inventory to match sales with their production schedule reductions. I think from a BorgWarner perspective, we felt that was well contained within our guidance. But we're going to pay close attention of will there be further adjustments as we go through the fourth quarter.  The second area of watch that we pay a little bit of attention to, for sure, is diesel penetration in Western Europe, or in Europe in general. And that's true this year. If we look at how 2016 is playing out versus 2015, we see about a 2 percentage point drop in diesel penetration in Europe. And we've talked about this for a long time, we've been watching this trend of a decline in diesel, and I think we're very well prepared as BorgWarner as we've been aligning our products closely around gasoline and hybrid technology.  The third area we're paying close attention to is China. We're enjoying some strong growth in the third quarter, and we're going to look to see what happens with the incentives as that phases out towards the end of this year and how that plays into next year. All of that said, I would say two things so far have been going very much as planned for our guidance, and naturally we're excited to discuss our performance. So let me talk a little bit about one other aspect before I get into our detailed numbers and that's in the regulatory and technology trend area. We still see a very strong drive around fuel economy and emissions regulations and the pull for advanced propulsion technology is not changing. There is a very robust intensity around the pull for advanced propulsion technology.  I would say within the last quarter, we've seen a notable acceleration in discussions on gas and hybrid and EV technology, and that is playing itself out. And as that transition to electrification continues, we remain very active here. Multiple customers working with us on electrification solutions, whether that be a 48-volt architecture, hybrid architecture and EVs. Not just long term, this is also for products in the here and now.  At our recent investor day, we highlighted there that we had approximately 19 new customer awards in the hybrid and electric vehicle space and I can assure you that number continues to grow. Our quoted activity remains robust with multiple customers and multiple products. As normal, we will publicly announce additional new business awards in this category when we receive additional customer approvals. But I will say, again, I'm very pleased with our bookings.  Our win rates remain strong and the diversification of our bookings is also exciting for us. Both regionally it's well balanced, customers it's well balanced and we're pleased with the booking rates across the combustion, hybrid and electric space. And last but certainly not least, we're also pleased with the profitability that we're booking that new business at.  So let me give a little bit of color on the financials and, obviously, Ron will step through this in a lot more detail. So I start with the third quarter at a BorgWarner level, and the conclusion for me is I'm very pleased with our third quarter. We delivered growth towards the high end of our guidance range and solid operating performance with sales of $2.2 billion, that's up 6% when we exclude FX and Remy. I think that's pretty impressive when you look at the global light vehicle production, essentially it was flat around the world with the exception of China that was a strong growth market.  Regionally it played out pretty much as expected from a BorgWarner point of view, which resulted in strong growth in China and North America and Korea, partially offset by Europe aftermarket and CV. We delivered $0.78 EPS excluding non-comparable items. And our operating margin at 12%, when we exclude Remy, that's 12.9%. Strong operating performance for us.  If we break that down by segments, the engine business was at $1.36 billion, which grew just under 4%. Primary drivers there were turbo and variable cam timing. And from a drivetrain perspective, we were $866 million reported, that's up 48%. But when we exclude currency and Remy, we grew at an impressive 11.4% in the drivetrain segment. That was primarily driven by strong all-wheel drive sales in both North America and in Europe.  Now turning to our outlook for the rest of 2016, you see we did narrow our guidance around the center of the previous range. Ron will give you more details there. I would also say as we've gone through this year we've talked to you about some major launches that BorgWarner has been actively involved with. That's the Pentastar, with FCA, Ford Scorpion, Ford Super Duty and the GM Duramax. All have launched, and in our view, all are on track.  So the outlook for our Q4, as we step into Q4, I would articulate that our risks and opportunities are pretty well balanced. We see good strong growth in China and a slowing North America, but we think our risks and opportunities are balanced, and the punch line is we feel confident in our guidance of 3% to 5% organic growth for the quarter and continued strong operating performance.  Just a couple of comments around growth highlights, and I'll start with Remy. Ron will talk a lot more about the detailed financial aspects of the light-duty aftermarket transaction that we recently announced. I think this is a really good deal from a BorgWarner perspective. The primary thing for me strategically is this really allows the team to focus on what I would describe as the core Remy business and combining that rotating electrical expertise with the BorgWarner product offering. So this is a good transaction that we're going forward with.  I would characterize the integration going well. I think operationally and financially it's performing as expected albeit with sales coming in a little lighter, primarily driven by CV and aftermarket. We remain very positive about the strength of the technology, multiple customers are engaged with us in discussions about the combination products, particularly, again, around the motors and clutches for hybrid vehicles that we talked extensively about at our investor day.  Also a comment about M&A. The M&A pipeline remains very strong for us, very active, considering things. And as I mentioned at investor day and on prior calls, power electronics is the big priority for us as a Company. So let me kind of summarize. I think, so far I would characterize it as been a very good year for us so far. We've delivered what we said we would do, and with my count, and this is four very strong quarters for us consecutively where we meet or beat both the top line and the bottom line.  The business is operating very well and we're heavily focused on executing the short-term performance, but also securing the growth for us in the future. Key for me is I absolutely believe we have a winning strategy that's going to focus on delivering advanced propulsion technology for combustion, hybrid and electric vehicles that will deliver the mid- to high single-digit growth that we've committed to. Finally I remain upbeat and very positive about delivering our 2016 guidance.  So with that let me turn the call over to Ron. Thank you. Ron Hundzinski : Thank you, James, and good day, everyone. Before I review the financial details, I'd like to provide you some of the highlights as I see them for the quarter. First, we saw good growth. Second, we delivered solid operating performance, and third, we continue to see improvement in CapEx spending and free cash flow generation. So now, as Ken mentioned, I will be referring to the supplement financial slide deck that is posted on our IR website. Please follow along.  First I'd like to focus your attention on slide 3. Throughout the presentation I will highlight certain non-US GAAP measures to provide a clear picture of how the core business performed, and for comparisons with prior periods. Specifically, we will be excluding the impact of foreign currency, Remy and non-comparable items from certain US GAAP measures. When you hear me say on a comparable basis, that means excluding the impact of foreign currencies, Remy and non-comparable items. When you hear me say on a reported basis, that means US GAAP.  So let's turn to slide 4. On a reported basis, which includes the change in sales due to market growth, price, net new business and currency, and the Remy acquisition, sales were up 17.5%. On a comparable basis, our sales are up 6.1% toward the high end of our guidance range. On reported basis, gross profit as a percentage of sales was 21.3% in the quarter, but on a comparable basis, gross margin was 21.9% of sales, up 70 basis points from last year.  On a reported basis, SG&A was 9.5% of sales. R&D spending, which is included in SG&A, was 4% of sales. On a comparable basis, SG&A was 9.1% of sales which is up 120 basis points from a year ago. There's three reasons for this increase. First, R&D spending on a comparable basis was up 40 basis points from a year ago as we continued to invest in the future. I would like to point out, it was still at 4% of sales. Second, as we discussed in our second quarter earnings call, we implemented sharp cost controls in the third quarter of 2015 in response to macro uncertainty making the year-over-year comparison challenging, so about 40 basis points of this increase was due to that rough comparison. The remaining 40 points is that increase is due to higher administrative costs in the Company.  Now, let's take a look at the year-over-year comparison from operating income which can be found on slide 5. Starting on the right, third quarter 2016 operating income excluding non-comparable items, but including Remy, was $265 million or 12% of sales. If you also exclude Remy's $7 million of net contribution, operating income on a comparable basis was $259 million or 12.9% of sales, down 40 basis points from a year ago. On a comparable basis, operating income was up $8 million on $115 million of higher sales, that gives us an incremental margin of 7% in the quarter. This performance is below trend, but was expected due to the higher SG&A spending. From an operations perspective, or if you look at the segment levels, another way of saying it, incremental margins were up actually 14% in the quarter. As you look further down the income statement, equity and affiliate earnings was about $12 million in the quarter, up from $9 million last year.  Interest expense and finance charges were $22 million in the quarter, up from $15 million a year ago. The increase is primarily due to the $500 million fixed rate senior notes that we issued in the third quarter of 2015. Provision for income taxes in the quarter, on a reported basis, was $49 million, however, this included a $31 million tax benefit related to our non-comparable item and other favorable tax adjustments. You can read about each of these adjustments in our 10-Q, which will be filed later today. Excluding these items, the provision for income taxes was $80 million for an effective tax rate of 31%, which is in line with our full-year guidance. Net earnings attributable to non-controlling interests were about $10 million, up $1 million from the third quarter of 2015. This line represents our minority partners' share in the earnings and performance of our Korean and Chinese joint ventures. So let's take a look at our diluted earnings per share on slide 6. Net earnings, excluding non-comparable items, but including Remy, were $0.78 per share. On a comparable basis net earnings were $0.76 per diluted share.  Now let's take a closer look at our offering segments in the quarter beginning on slide 7 of the deck. Reported engine segment net sales were $1.36 billion in the quarter. Sales growth for the engine segment on a comparable basis was 3.8%, primarily due to higher turbo charger and variable cam timing sales, partially offset by weak aftermarket and off-road commercial vehicle markets around the world.  Turning to slide 8, reported EBIT was $218 million for the engine segment or 16.1% of sales, excluding currency, adjusted EBIT was 16% of sales, down 20 basis points from the prior year. On a comparable basis, the engine segment's adjusted EBIT was up $6 million on $50 million of higher sales for an incremental margin of 12%.  Now turning to slide 9 and starting from the right, drivetrain segment net sales were $866 million in the quarter. This includes $215 million of sales from Remy. Sales growth for the drive train segment on a comparable basis was 11.4%, primarily due to higher all-wheel drive sales. Strong growth for the drivetrain segment.  On slide 10, reported EBIT was $87 million for the drivetrain segment or 10% of sales. Excluding Remy and currency, adjusted EBIT was 12.4% of sales which is up 40 basis points from the prior year. On a comparable basis, the drivetrain segment's adjusted EBIT was up $10 million on $67 million of sales for an incremental margin of 15%. Now let's take a look at the balance sheet and cash flow. We generated $593 million of net cash from operating activities in the first nine months of the year, and that's up $123 million from a year ago. Capital spending was $355 million for the first half, which is down $64 million from a year ago. As a percentage of sales, CapEx was 5.2% of sales in the first nine months.  Free cash flow, which we define as net cash from operating activities less capital spending, was $238 million in the first nine months, up $187 million from a year ago. We are still on track to generate between $400 million and $475 million of free cash flow in 2016, at the midpoint, that's up 50% from 2015.  Looking at the balance sheet itself, balance sheet debt increased by $65 million and cash decreased by $59 million in the first nine months compared with the end of 2015. The $124 million increase in net debt was primarily due to share repurchases. We spent $250 million repurchasing just under 7.3 million shares in the first nine months, already achieving our expected $200 million to $300 million of share repurchases this year.  Our net debt to net capital ratio is 35.6% at the end of the quarter, up from 35.2% at the end of 2015. Net debt to EBITDA at the end of the quarter on a trailing 12-month basis was 1.4 times.  Now, before we move on to guidance discussion, I'd like to review the sale of the Remy's light vehicle aftermarket business announced earlier this month. As James said, strategically the business was not core. While aftermarket is an important segment for us, this aftermarket business sells to big box retailers, which is a very different business model from our aftermarket business, which sells to wholesalers and distributors.  The deal is a win-win for both the buyer and BorgWarner. The buyer has a strategic focus in this market segment. They will invest in this business and combined with this existing business gain a scale advantage. BorgWarner will retain the rotating electric components that complement our strategic focus on hybrid and electric vehicle propulsion systems.  We sold the business for $80 million, which is a fair price. From an accounting perspective, we recorded a pretax loss of $106 million due to the revaluation of the business reflecting current market conditions. There are two additional favorable outcomes of the deal. First, it is accretive to margins. Year to date, Remy's margins have been just over 4%. Excluding the light vehicle market business, Remy's margins would have been 100 basis points higher.  Second, due to the payment terms with its customers, that business factored the majority of its receivables, which is considered debt by the rating agencies. With the sale of that business, our debt as calculated by the rating agencies is reduced by $75 million.  Now I'd like to discuss our current 2016 guidance. Returning to the slide deck, let's start with our sales growth guidance for the full year on slide 11. Note that the baseline for 2015 net sales excludes Remy, which was just under $7.9 billion. We have narrowed our sales guidance range around the center of the previous range. All in, we expect to grow between 15.2% and 16% this year compared to 13.7% and 17.5% previously.  A few points on updated sales guidance. Our outlook for organic growth has improved. Market-related growth and new business growth net of pricing is now expected to be 4.3% to 4.8% compared with 3% to 5.5% previously and we expect the impact of currency to be less negative than it was before. However, these favorable items are offset by a weaker outlook for Remy sales, as James said earlier, primarily in the commercial vehicle and the aftermarket business. Net-net, the midpoint of the sales guidance range is unchanged, and I'd like to make one other point here. The assumption is that the Remy aftermarket remains at BorgWarner throughout the end of the year because of uncertainty of exactly when the closing date is going to be on the sale.  Now let's take a look at our operating income guidance on slide 12. We are now expecting 13% to 14% incremental margins on our core business sales growth, which is slightly down from our previous guide of 15% to 17%. Incremental margins were about 14% through the first nine months of the year, and we expect our fourth quarter incremental margin to be in the low- to mid-teens as well. On a comparable basis, we still expect our operating income margin to be above 13%, and including Remy, our operating income margin is still expected to be greater than 12%.  On slide 13 we have our EPS guidance. We expect earnings of $3.24 to $3.28 per share, including a $0.12 per share contribution from Remy, up from $3.16 to $3.32 previously. An improved outlook on the impact of currency and a lower share count are driving the change.  Now let's review our fourth quarter guidance, which is simply the remainder of what's left in our annual guidance, starting with the sales growth on slide 14. All in, we expect to grow between 14.3% and 17.8% in the quarter, including between 10 to 12 percentage points from Remy and about one percentage point due to favorable currency. On a comparable basis, our organic growth is expected to be between 3% and 5% in the quarter. From an earnings perspective, as shown on slide 15, we expect earnings of between $0.82 and $0.86 per share in the fourth quarter, which includes about $0.02 per share from Remy.  So in conclusion, we had a solid quarter. As James said, this is the fourth quarter in a row of exceeding our EPS and sales goals, and as we look at the remainder of the year, we expect to continue to be on this path. Solid sales growth, strong operating margins and improved cash flow from a year ago.  So with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Ken. Thank you. Ken Lamb : Thanks, Ron. Now let's move to the Q&A portion of the call. Chris, could you please remind everyone of the Q&A procedures? Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Richard Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. Richard Kwas : So a question -- so on the incremental margin on a core basis, so the 13% to 14%, is the target as we think about longer term in a stable production environment, is that still mid-teens, Ron? Ron Hundzinski : I'd say it's still mid-teens, Rich, but the question is how you define mid-teens, is it 16, is it 14, 15? It's in that range, 14 to 16 is what I would say, all right? Richard Kwas : Okay. And then just -- I know you're going to give the outlook for '17 in January, but last year when you updated the backlog, it appeared you took more sane view of the market and your outgrowth over the longer term, and so when we think about '17 and '18, and we think about now that we're 9, 10 months into the year and have a little bit of better view on how '17 may play out at least, anything that we should think about from a macro standpoint as it would potentially effect '17 and '18 for your backlog contribution? James Verrier : Yes. Let me try to take a shot at that for you, Rich. So I think I would say, you know, maybe a couple of things that may be helpful. Let me say the discipline and the methodology and approach that we used for '16, we feel good about, and the reason we feel good about that is Ron and I both alluded to, we've been hitting our numbers pretty well with some fluctuations in the market. We've seen noise in the market place, we've seen launch noise and macro noise and we've been executing really well in that mid-single-digit organic growth area or range. And so we'll be applying that same approach, that same methodology as we march towards '17 and '18. I would say a general level launch cadence, launch volumes has played out pretty much, you know, there's obviously puts and takes, so that gives me at least comfort that the methodology is solid, the business strategy is very solid, the win rates are very solid. So we'll go through all of that mathematics, as you can imagine, in the fourth quarter as we get ready for January. But I would say at a high level, there's nothing fundamentally there that's different than where we were thinking a year ago, and I would just say you and we should take comfort in the way we've executed this year, both on the top line and the bottom line as we get ready for a net new business in January. Richard Kwas : And then James, just one last quick one, thanks for that color, on China, what's kind of the going assumption at this point? Is it that come year end the government goes cold turkey with the subsidize or is there any expectation just internally as you're thinking about it, there may be some additional subsidy or some kind of incentive that continues into '17? James Verrier : Yes. Our thought Rich right now is that it would continue, you're right, through the fourth quarter. And we're continuing to test and question and evaluate whether that will -- whether there will be any continuation of that into '17. It's a little early, we don't know. Our modeling would probably suggest that it will not continue on into '17, but things can move in that part of the world very quickly, as you well know. But we're more in likely won't continue incentives into '17, but we're watching it closely, Rich, in case that moves Operator : Your next question comes from Brian Johnson with Barclays. Your line is open. Brian Johnson : I have two questions, one kind of shorter term and one just revisiting some topics from your Investor Day. On the short to midterm, can you maybe give us a little color within the engine segment? I think a number of investors were braced for even slower growth there given the Ford production pressures and the European diesel shift mix, so can you give us -- as well softish commercial vehicle, can you give us a sense of some of the puts and takes within the drivers of engine revenue? James Verrier : Yes. I can talk a little bit about that, Brian. So you're right, commercial vehicle is not helping. I mean, frankly, the puts and takes amongst commercial vehicle, but commercial vehicle is essentially no growth, so that's the one that impact on the engine business. I talked a little bit about diesel mix and so if you do it year-to-date comparable, Brian, from '15 to '16, Western Europe it's down a couple of percentage points, and I think we've been fairly consistent through the year that that's not -- that doesn't move the needle for us materially when it moves a percent or two down. The question is you look at will that trend continue down, our view is it will and we feel we're well prepared there with the growth that we're delivering on gas turbos. In the quarter itself, the two big drivers for growth on engine were turbo and Variable Cam Timing, those were strong and I would say that was on a pretty global basis, so it wasn't one region particularly that stood out. And, you know, relative to Ford, Brian, if we go back to the prior earnings call, I know there was a lot of concern on that day of Ford's lowering expectations or lowering projects, what are you going to do. We felt we had that pretty well contained in our guidance and we delivered and I think some of their recent announcements through the last few weeks, we would like to believe that we feel pretty comfortable, we've got that covered as well as we go into the fourth quarter. So hopefully that gives you a little bit of color that's useful, Brian. Brian Johnson : Yes. Now on the longer term, a number of investors have remarked, in fact, we have new power train forecasts that have EVs in China in particular as well as Europe well ahead of the IHS projections, Mary Barr [ph] said on the call yesterday said she expects China's EVs to be growing faster than -- be the sresgsion with the most deep penetration in the next decade. I guess a couple things. You know, one, you know, you did talk being neutral to those, but are you seeing any evidence in your quoting activity and any in China vis-\u00e0-vis EVs, are they going to skip the hybrid step and go right to EVs, and then kind of within that, as a non-Chinese player given a lot of the market in China tends to -- subsidies tend to favor the hometown players. How do you see kind of playing in the emerging new energy vehicle market in China? James Verrier : I think if you go back a little bit to Investor Day, and I can maybe use that as a reference point, I would say nothing has materially changed since Investor Day which is not a surprise because that's only a few weeks out. I would say from a China perspective we'll see a combination, it will use hybrids and electrics. I don't think there will no hybrids in China. I think there will be a balance, but I would tend to agree with you that the intensity and the drive towards pure battery electric vehicle is probably strongest in China than any other region of the world. That's not to say it's not going to get adopted in Europe and North America, but there is a strong push for pure electrics in China, and we've been announcing that we're benefiting from that. You know, a single space transmission technology is adopted on a number of those vehicles that are out there and we've got other products going on it, but directionally, I would agree, Brian, that it's the fastest area which is penetrating the most from a pure EV, but I would not say it's without any hybrids because I think there will be hybrids for sure in China. Brian Johnson : Okay. And then in terms of your position, you know, is what you're saying maybe even if there's favoritism towards local battery suppliers or at least locally-made batteries, things like the transmission and other elements you might involve with are more of or at least a level playing field? James Verrier : Yes. We may be just -- to that point, Brian, when we were articulating it at Investor Day, in simple numbers, the compound annual growth rate for pure electric vehicles globally from now through 2023 was in the mid-20% percent and BorgWarner in the 50s. So, yes, we're going to benefit from EV adoption in China and it will be transmission is today where we're shipping those today on electric vehicles, but I feel more management products will play there together with some of the other products we highlighted on Investor Day. So we feel good about the drive to pure electrics in China. It's helpful for BorgWarner, Brian. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris McNally of Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Chris McNally : This is a follow-on to questions on pure electrification. Could you just maybe discuss how you balance the risks given that some of the targets [indiscernible] been thrown out by maybe some of the Germans which I think we all see as somewhat aggressive. There's been a history in the industry of overestimating penetration for electrification, given consumer adoption has seemed to trail what regulators and some of the emissions would call them ideal. It seems like you're taking a very gradual pace, but just how do we think about sort of the pace of investment if, let's say in 2020 some of these volumes are less than expected? James Verrier : Yes. It's a very good thought, and I would refer us back to the conversations we had at Investor Day, and it goes something like this. BorgWarner has an extremely clear strategy around being the leader in propulsion, in advanced propulsion technology for combustion, for hybrids and electrics. And to your point, Chris, we know that those penetration rates of the different hybrid vehicles and the different electrics are going to move around. Nobody has a crystal ball to know exactly what the penetration rate is on any of those platforms, what we're doing, and we will continue to do is position ourselves to offer product offering for all of those architectures and support the customers as needed and we're putting ourselves in a position with the portfolio that we have that if hybrids accelerate a little faster than electrics or electrics go a little faster than hybrids, we will be great because we're going to grow with any of them. We're going to grow on hybrid content, we're going to grow on electric and we're going to grow on combustion. So I appreciate your point. I think there is some uncertainty out there, and that's what we're looking frankly speaking to take advantage of by offering a broader portfolio than anybody else, that we can participate and it will play out as it plays out. BorgWarner will continue to grow in that mid-to high single-digital growth rate independent of ships with the different propulsion architectures if that helps you. Chris McNally : No, that's great. Is it fair to say from your initial comments about some of the conversations accelerating clearly over the last six months or a year, is that fair to say that\u2019s both in call it mild, hybrid, 48 volt as well as sort of higher voltage plug-in and EV that you\u2019re seeing accelerations in both categories? James Verrier : Yes. It's a good thought. If I go back, maybe look at a six-month period, Chris to use your reference point, I would say generically the shift away from diesel is intensified and increased. We don't see it as a clip event, but I think it's fair to say the shift away from diesel has probably increased over the last six months. I think that the focus on 48 volt mild hybrid and plug-in hybrids is about the same. I think that's a strong trend and it's continued strong. And I think we've seen a stronger voice in Europe and China around pure electric vehicles, probably the move is if you wish over the last six months and again, we feel very good about that. Again, it reconfirms the fact that there will be these shifts and we're well positioned to take advantage as the shifts occur. Operator : Your next question comes from your Emmanuel Rosner of CLSA. Your line is open. Emmanuel Rosner : So I apologize I joined the call a little bit late, so maybe some of this color has been provided before, but so as we see these slightly faster shift away from diesel that you just described, in the near term, I understand in the mid-term obviously you\u2019ve a lot of [indiscernible] hybrids and electric vehicles, but I guess in the near term can you just remind me what sort of the content impact is between if it's an automaker replaces a diesel vehicle with a gas vehicle, what would be sort of that near term content impact? James Verrier : So you're right. What I alluded to earlier, Emmanuel, I'm not sure if you were on the call. Our view of Europe, is if you look at a '15 year to date versus the '16 year to date, the diesel share or the diesel penetration is down about 2%. Our view is that, that will continue to creep down. We're not seeing a cliff-type event. So we see that trending down. I think fundamentally what we are seeing is those -- so the question is really what are those diesel vehicles being replaced with. And I would say the vast majority in our view are those with turbocharge gasoline vehicles, so that obviously plays well for BorgWarner. We are not seeing a shift from diesel to naturally aspirated [ph] vehicles so much. We're seeing turbo charged gasoline and sometimes turbo charged gasoline hybrids, so near term it's pretty small impact for us, you know, obviously it affects a lot of -- some of our emissions products a little, but net-net for BorgWarner, Emmanuel, it's relatively small impact for us as it shifts from diesel to gas, particularly if it's at a gradually pace that we've seen thus far. And just to reinforce I think your other point is we get to the mid-term, let's say three years plus out, then it's not an issue at all for BorgWarner. So small is kind of the conclusion, Emmanuel, if that helps you. Emmanuel Rosner : That definitely helps. So I guess in this context where I guess the mix shift seems manageable, so if you're invested anywhere, essentially suggesting a mid to high single-digital organic growth rate going forward that would imply obviously a bit of acceleration versus your guidance for this year and sort of like 4% to 5% as you look to I guess we're entering 2017 do you feel comfortable about being able to get this acceleration in organic growth even with sort of like some of these small mix head wind? James Verrier : I think a couple of points, Emmanuel I would point to. First of all, we feel very good about where we're at right now. You know, it's coming towards the end of October, we still will talk to you in January about our guidance and we're delivered on that. We're in four good quarters now. So we feel good that we're hitting our stride on executing that mid-single-digit growth organically which is excellent. I think one of the things that I would say is as we start to think about '17, '18 and '19, one of the things we articulated at Investor Day is I want people to think that we're going to operate in a band of mid- to high single-digital growth rate. So that means that maybe a year or two where we're at high, there may be a year or two where we're at mid. It's not a linear upward curve or arrow if that makes sense to you Emmanuel. I don't want think people we\u2019re going to be running 3, 4 or 5 and then we got a 6 and then we got a 7, then we got an 8, then we got a 9, it's not that way. What we\u2019re saying is we\u2019re confident and comfortable in our strategy, in our portfolio and our technology that we will consistently able to deliver in a mid-to high single-digital band and external factors will move us a little bit in the band, Emmanuel, of that mid to high single-digital band. Does that help a little bit for you? Emmanuel Rosner : Yes, absolutely but just to be -- you're not expecting a hockey stick within it, it's essentially any given year, should be in the mid to high single digits, am I right? James Verrier : That's a good way to think of it, Emmanuel. Yes. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Murphy of Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. John Murphy : I apologize I got on the call a little bit late, so I've got a few questions that you may have talked about a little bit already. Just first on schedules here in the near term, particularly in North America, there appears to be some disparity strategies where some companies like Ford are cutting production pretty quickly, you try to adjust inventory down relative to demand and some companies are not. I'm adjust curious what you guys are seeing as far as schedules and volatility and as you look, you know, on 30 and 60-day releases, are there significant changes that have been occurring or volatility that are tough to handle or is it really pretty consistent and they're giving you a good heads up and seem logical so far? James Verrier : I would say in general, visibility is about the same as it typically kind of was, if you like, 45, 60 days. I think in general we've been getting good communications and good visibility from all of the OEMs here. We're not getting too much last minute kind of cuts and those types of things. Obviously like you and everybody, we're going to pay a lot of attention to this because as you start to come towards the year-end, but I would say to use a phrase, you know, the discipline around scheduling and releasing has been pretty good. An example for us would be, when we had this exact same call last quarter that was at a time when Ford was kind of suggesting releases, reductions, etcetera and we talked about it then that we believed we had that well contained in our guidance and I think it's fair to say we delivered on that, so that's encouraging. And I mentioned earlier in the call, John, I'm not sure if you were on, the latest news from Ford so to speak, we feel that's contained in our guidance which essentially was unchanged as we went into this quarter. So I think generally, John, it's reasonably well disciplined. We watch it and pay a lot of attention to it, but so far so good. John Murphy : Then underlying the results, I mean Remy seems to be doing relatively well, maybe little bit ahead of expectations, is there anything that's changed there as you're getting deeper into it or is it really, running in line with your internal expectations? James Verrier : Yes. I would say, John, generally it's running well. Overall it's running well. The top line has been a little softer through the year. We saw that, but that was pretty much end market driven on commercial vehicle and after markets, so that's just you know the macro driven. But on the OE side pretty much as we expected. I think from an operating point of view, John, it's been running well and I think I would say we're incrementally positive on our dialogue with the customers, particularly around, the combination of Remy's rotating electrics with mechanical know how around P2 hybrid modules that we talked about at Investor Day, I think that continues to go extremely well for us globally, by the way, Europe, Asia and North America. So overall really good Ron gave a couple of comments earlier, John, if you weren't on, you know, it's a really good thing that we can completely this transaction on the light duty retail aftermarket business, that's just not core to us and I think that will allow us to focus more on the core, so I think that's another incremental step forward with Remy. As Ron alluded to, that helps the margin profile as well of the business. So, yes, it's going well, John. You know, a lot of work ahead of us, but it's going well. John Murphy : Okay. And then just lastly, as we think about cap allocation run, I mean, there's a growing concern that we're getting closer to peak and given how strong items [ph] are, it's hard to argue that, we might have some more upside, but we're getting close, and there's a lot of concern about what the down side could mean here in North America or in Europe with the Brexit risk or China ultimately slowing down. With all of those kinds of, sort of potentially choppy environments that may or may not occur, but thinking about them, would you consider maybe getting a little bit more conservative on capital allocation, meaning maybe building up a little bit larger of a cash cushion to take advantage of whatever opportunities might, you know, prevail themselves as the cycle ultimately does turn? James Verrier : So, John, you're correct, I can tell you that internally over probably the last four months or so we've had discussions about liquidity. I'll use the term liquidity, right, because that's what it comes down to at the end of the day and how you preserve liquidity through a cycle and how much liquidity do you need going through a cycle and so I think you're absolutely correct. I know inside BorgWarner we are looking at the liquidity numbers and making sure that we're very liquid through a cycle. So, yes, you're correct, we are looking at this. John Murphy : Okay. But would you favor potentially building that up pretty significantly relative to buybacks now so that you could potentially take care of more advantageous opportunities over time? I'm just trying to gauge how you're going to allocate capital here in the near term, ultimately rather than the longer term. James Verrier : Yes, I know what you're getting at, John. So let's refresh ourselves here. We are about 2/3 into the $1 billion buyback program, correct? And I think it's safe to say that we're going to give a lot more color here in January as far as what we're thinking, and I think you're right, in the context, I would say that we are considering maybe a more conservative posture, but we have to weigh that against other items, maybe M&A activity potentially and also the peak cycle that we're in, and there's a couple other factors we have to look at as well, so I would say, though in general we're probably more bias to the conservative side right now, but we'll give more color in January. Operator : Your next question is from David Leiker of Baird. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : This is Joe [indiscernible] for David. I don't want to steal your thunder giving the '17 updates, but if I use those backlog numbers you provided last January, it would kind of foot to a number that would be closer to 3% after price, and so I just want to make sure your comments on targeting mid to high, is that something that returns talking about revenue growth that returns as soon as '17 and does that imply that maybe the backlog numbers are trending a bit better than what you provided at the beginning of the year? James Verrier : This is James. Ron can weigh in after me. You're right, we're going to do it in January, so we got a little bit of time here, and we're going to work our way through it. The way I view it strategically, Joe, is we talked a lot at Investor Day that with our propulsion technology, we're comfortable that we're going to be a mid-to high single-digital growth company on an organic basis and we reminded everybody I think at the Investor Day it will fluctuate in that band of mid to high single-digit growth. I would say there's been nothing materially or substantially that's changed for us to change that view. So what that all translates in exact dollars and percentages of organic growth for '17 and '18, Joe, we've got a few more weeks of work to get to that point, but we're comfortable in this mid to high single-digit organic growth for the future. Ron Hundzinski : I'm going to add just a little bit color in the numbers, Joe. I believe the mid-point of the back of 2017 was $500 million of sales. I don't know what your starting point is, but I get quite a bit higher number than the one you just gave us on the call when I did the quick math here. I was not as low as you were, so you may want to fine tune your number crunching here a little bit. You should get a higher number. Maybe, Ken and you can talk about that later, all right? Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And then one more, if I shift back to '16, it would seem like the contribution from new business has to be stronger than those original numbers for just talking this year because you have customers that probably haven't produced what the plan said they would at the beginning of the year of highway markets have been weak. Is that fair? And if it is, can you maybe provide some color on what's tracked better within the new business backlog this year? James Verrier : I would say, Joe, you're right, the net new business for '16 has run a little better than what we'd expected, and I think you summarized it pretty well. You know we didn\u2019t remember, we didn't factor much in at all for commercial vehicle, so we weren't expecting much, and guess what we didn't get much. You know, if you look at it regionally we've run pretty strongly in North America and Korea has been pretty good and China has been pretty good. So I wouldn't say it's one product or region, but intuitively, you're right, we're running a little better on the net new business for '16 and what we guided to at the beginning of the year. Operator : We have one last question, and that question comes from Joseph Spak of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Joseph Spak : Guys, maybe just to elaborate on that last point, so, again you don't sort of provide the backlog today, but if you could sort of back into at least directionally where it's trending and it does seem like it's coming in better. So I was wondering if you could maybe high level sort of critique your own sort of internal approach you've taken towards given the forecasting and whether that should give us confidence in some of the prior or the outer year backlog numbers you gave earlier this year? James Verrier : I think the way I look at it is from my perspective, Joe, you know, we rolled out what our methodology and discipline was as we went into the year, and you recall, right, we took a more prudent approach to the launches in terms of both the volumes and sales in the cadence of the launch and then we also made the judgment to be a little bit more -- apply a little bit more of a macro factor to the number, our view and where our little bias, Joe, is we think that was a smart call because I think as we have gone through the year we have been consistently hitting our numbers in that just around that mid-single-digit growth rate. That would imply, and I think you're right, the backlog is running a little better than we'd anticipated which is good, and I said earlier on the call, Joe, that we'll be utilizing that same discipline and methodology as we go into '17, and I think if we look at what the three of you of the backlog that we went into this year was, you know, in that mid-single-digit growth. I think 4 to 6 was the range for the three-year period, and we're executing in that range this year, so it gives us comfort as we go into the process for '17, '18, '19. So we got some work to do, Joe, on the detail, but I gain comfort from our strong execution this year in delivering the growth that we set out to do. It helps me get comfort and help you get comfort as we go into the years. Ron Hundzinski : Let me give you some numbers. I believe that in January we gave mid-point guidance of about $315 million of backlog and I think the current guidance is around 355, 360, so we are performing better than we indicated in January, that's nearly a year ago, so we're some $40 million - $50 million higher in numbers. Joseph Spak : Right, despite a number of adversity and headwinds. Ron Hundzinski : Yes, despite a lot of puts and takes as James was saying. At the end of the day we still performed better than we anticipated in January. Joseph Spak : Okay. A last quick one, there was a report earlier this month which indicated that some automakers, and this gets back to sort of engine shifts in Europe, that they may have to meet real-world emissions scraps smaller engines and upsize engines to help meet those standards. And I always thought that your content generally moves with the size of the engine, so, A, is that true, is that a potential benefit for you, and, B, have you seen any of the future sourcing actually revert back to some larger engines? James Verrier : That's a good thought, Joe. I'll give you a couple of thoughts. The term that we're hearing a lot is right sizing which is a good way to think of it. So it's right sizing the engines. What I would say is it's not dramatic shift, so it's not like they're taking one liter engine and replacing it with a 2.5 liter engine. So it's subtle shifts they make out from 1.6 to 2 or a 1.8 to a 2 so we\u2019re seeing that. We\u2019re seeing that adjustment is a good word for me, and what we see is fundamentally the technology on the engine is very similar. So if it's a turbo charged direct injection engine with Variable Cam Timing they are shifting that from maybe a 1.6 to 1.8 or a 2 and that's helping us. Generally speaking, your observation is a good one, Joe, the larger engines are generally slightly beneficial for BorgWarner, so this is a net-net a good move for BorgWarner, it's a helpful for BorgWarner, I'll put it that way. James Verrier : So I'd like to thank you all again for joining us. We expect to file our 10-K before the end of the day which will provide details of our results. If you have any follow-up questions about our earnings release, the matters discussed during this call or our 10-Q, please direct them to me. Chris, please close out the call. Operator : That does conclude the BorgWarner 2016 third quarter results conference call. You may now disconnect.",

You'll find a link in the Events and Presentation section beneath the notice for this call. We encourage you to follow along during our discussion. With that, I'll turn it over to James. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thanks, Pat, and good morning, good afternoon to everybody. We appreciate you all joining us for our call here today. As Pat said, Ron and I are really pleased actually to share our results both from Q4 2016, but also some commentary about 2017. I thought where would be good to start off is just share a few thoughts around the macro environment and some of the general industry trends, and talk a little bit how some of those play out specifically for us at BorgWarner. So I think the headline for us, and I think all of us on the call here, we're operating, we continue to operate in a sense of uncertain times globally, both I think from a political perspective and on an economic perspective. Whether it's the transitions in Europe and Brexit, China economic stability and growth, and obviously here in the U.S. with the new administration, it's somewhat of an uncertain time. If I take the areas that I think are most relevant to us from a BorgWarner perspective and I'll talk about, I think the two most meaningful things that are on people's mind. And I would say, it's the border adjustment or the NAFTA agreement here in the U.S. and also CAFE. So I just want to spend a couple of minutes proactively sharing some of our thoughts on those two topics with you. So let me start off with border tax or NAFTA. First thing is to calibrate us all, obviously about 25% of BorgWarner's revenue is in North America, so now puts it a little bit into context to you. The second thing when you looked, when you break down that revenue, it's really critical that we all kind of understand that we produced most of our products, the vast majority of our products both in the United States and in Mexico. So we're very well balanced, which gives us the flexibility to adjust production levels between the two countries. If you actually look at border flow, a traffic of our products and what products that move North or South of the border, the net-net of all of that is about $200 million. So our view of the world is, now you heard about $200 million on a $9 billion annual revenue total, that's quote for us, that's manageable, that's a manageable situation, particular with our flexibility of our footprint. So we continue to track the topic closely of course, but I \u2013 my message to you from a BorgWarner perspective, we feel well-positioned around border tax and NAFTA. The second subject that relates strongly to us, obviously, is around CAFE, and you know what if anything may evolve in that space. And I think, we're all aware that there's been, you know some discussion in the \u2013 particularly in the fourth quarter around revisiting the standards and adjusting the standards through the auto alliance recommendations. I think our view very simplistically produced that the line is going to continue to creep up. We're going to see more stringent fuel economy and emissions regulation. I think there could be some tweaking and adjustments of the line and the acceleration of the line, but there is no doubt in our mind, there would be a continued push for increased efficiency around fuel economy and emissions, and that plays really well. What is critical is as that slope evolves, it may or it will influence that the mix of hybrid, electric and combustion. That's really what fundamentally will go on, and that's why it's been so important for us as a company over the last couple of years, to position our portfolio that is well balanced for combustion, hybrid and electric, so we'll become agnostic to the change. So, more to come on CAFE, but our belief is the standards will continue to drive forward, and we're well positioned. So net-net these two big issues, that we track I think are very manageable for BorgWarner. The only other comment I would just highlight from a macro or industry perspective is \u2013 and I'll give a little color around market growth projections for 2017. I think we all should remind as of, we're operating in a pretty healthy environment from an auto perspective, something close to 94 million light vehicles produced this year, that's a pretty good number and a healthy basis to run our business from. So staying with slide five, where I started, let me give a little bit of color on the market outlook, as we see it into 2017. So from a light vehicle perspective, I would characterize our view is very much aligned and similar to IHS's view. So we're seeing 1% or 2% growth projection for China. We see Europe growing modestly at about 1%, and then North American production down about 1%. So it's a low to no-growth environment overall, but as I said, that's off a very, very healthy base of 93-plus million light vehicles. From a commercial vehicle perspective, I would characterize it as still a challenged space. We still see North America and Europe in a little bit of a down environment. We do see stabilization and a little bit of positiveness in South America, and we do see China getting better. But net-net, overall it's still a pretty challenging environment around commercial vehicle. Now as we go into the year and we follow the year, I always like to share on these calls. One of the areas of watch that we're particularly paying a lot of attention to at BorgWarner that can move our numbers around, I would characterize three key areas of watch for the company. One is, we recognize we're in the mature cycle in North America. So what's going to transpire around inventories and schedules, thus far we're seeing schedules playing out pretty much as we had hoped for. But we will obviously, like everybody, keep a close eye on the inventory levels as the year unfolds. I would say the second area of watch is diesel penetration share in Europe. We did see from 2015 to 2016, we saw about a 2% downshift in that mix between diesel and gas, and we do expect the penetration to continue to decline of diesel share in Western Europe versus gasoline. The good news for us as a company, even with that little bit of a downshift last year, we still delivered our growth numbers and we're finding a way to offset that shift down in diesel. And as you look forward for us as a company, with the advent of our product evolution around content on gasoline and hybrid vehicles, that's going to put us in a very good position as diesel shifts down. Last but not least, the other area we focus on, particularly with our strong backlog in China, is we're expecting modest growth in China. And we need to keep paying attention to that market a lot as well with \u2013 which is coming off the Chinese New Year. we keep a close eye on China, but I would say so far the signs are early but the signs are encouraging from a China market perspective. All of that said, summarizing that view of the market outlook, we're very confident in our growth that we projected for 2017 by some of the demand for our products and what we're seeing in releases. Let me just make a couple of comments on the regulatory or technology trend area. As I said earlier, we continue to see a very strong drive around fuel economy and emissions regulations, and the pull for advanced propulsion technology is as strong as I've ever seen it. So no change, no backing off on the drive and the pull for advanced technology. We see that around gas, hybrids, and EVs. I would also like to just highlight that I think one of the really critical things that we see is that drive for advanced propulsion is very much globally playing out. So we see big pull in Europe and we see a very strong pull around hybrids and electrics also in China, but we also see continued advancements around combustion technology as well. So as we look at our focus on electrification, our Q4 new business bookings continued to show a very positive trend for us in terms of the business we were winning with a wide range of customers and regions. And we did receive new awards in all three categories of propulsion systems, combustion, hybrids, and electrics. Now I know many of you on the call like to keep score and keep track of numbers, so let me share a couple of numbers with you around awards. If you could cast your mind back to last year when we did our Investor Day, we talked about that we had 19 awards as a company for hybrids and electric programs that would be rolling out. And I would say to you in the fourth quarter, we added another handful to that list, so we're now sitting comfortably in the mid-20s type number of hybrid and electric vehicle program awards for the company. And our quoting activity remains very strong for other additional programs and customers. So the message there is still the strong pull for advanced technology and BorgWarner is winning. Let me turn now for a little bit if I can and talk about financial recap. I think I would characterize for Ron and I both and the rest of the management team, we were very pleased both with our Q4 performance and full-year 2016. For 2016, our growth came in toward the high end of our guidance range and very solid operating performance. So we feel very good about how we delivered 2016. If I give a little more color, if I can on Q4, and obviously Ron will provide a lot more detail here. So for Q4, $2.3 billion was our sales number. That's up 6.6% organic excluding FX and Remy. If I compare that to how we did versus the market, when I do comparable end markets for us, it was about 3.6%, which is solid outperformance of about 3% growth for us in the quarter. Regionally, it was pretty much as we had expected. We benefited from very strong growth in China, as we saw a very strong environment in China for light vehicle. And we had very strong growth in North America also. I would say Europe for us was pretty flat, and this was a little bit offset also by some modest declines around the rest of Asia excluding China, aftermarket, and commercial vehicle off-road. All of that transpired into us delivering EPS of $0.85 when we exclude the non-comparable items, and that does include Remy. Our operating margin came at 12.6%, which we view as yet another solid quarter that we delivered. If I take down the Q4 numbers by segment for a moment, so engine sales were $1.39 billion, so growing just over 1.3%. In the quarter, there was a little bit of headwind from light vehicle, diesel, and also I would say commercial vehicle weighed a little bit on our growth for the Engine segment, but you also see some really, really strong operating margin performance from the Engine group, which was really good to see. Drivetrain sales coming in at $883 million, that's up almost 17% organically, which was a really strong quarter from Drivetrain on the growth side and the really good news around that, that was strong all-wheel drive sales, but also on our transmission business. And I would say it was pretty much around the world, but primarily in North America and Europe where we saw very strong growth in the Drivetrain segment. If I turn now and talk a little bit about 2017 outlook, the first thing to reinforce is our outlook is unchanged from the guidance we provided just a few weeks ago last month when we were in Detroit. So recapping that a little for you, that's organic growth of 3.5% to 6% year over year, which we feel good about coming off of relatively flat market, that's good growth for us. Our consolidated operating income margin is expected to grow about 40 to 50 basis points, and that will drive EPS guidance range of $3.35 to $3.45 per diluted share. I think the key point I would like to stress right now is we felt good and very confident about that guidance when we were with you in Detroit, and we feel exactly the same today. And on a slightly longer-term basis, we continue to believe that we're very strongly positioned to achieve that mid to high single-digit organic growth over the long-term. As Pat said in his openings comments, I just wanted to take a moment to share a little bit more color around some of our growth and some of our recent winnings. And if you look at the slide, you'll see highlighted some key products on those slides. And the message here that I'm trying to convey is, you'll see winning business in combustion, hybrid and electric. And I'm just going to pick a few examples that highlight what I'm talking about. One of the key products that we announced in the fourth quarter was our first electric drive module with an integrated transmission and we're going to be launching that on two EV vehicles for major Chinese OEMs and production will begin in the summer of 2017, which is pretty soon. Great example of our leadership position in propulsion for electric vehicles. You also see silent chain. This is really cool with Suzuki on their Solio hybrid vehicle where we're actually taking out chain technology, we're using two chains to transfer power from the electric motor to the transmission to power a hybrid vehicle. So it's a cool story of taking somewhat conventional combustion R&D technology from BorgWarner and applying that to a hybrid vehicle. You also see we talked about advanced turbocharger technology for hybrid, electric vehicles, and the example here is the BYD in China. And I think this is a particularly relevant point because I think we showed you together in the Investor Day that we have seen a very strong adoption rate of turbochargers on hybrid vehicles. To give you a snapshot, as we look out to the middle of next decade, around 2026, we believe 56% of hybrids will be using turbochargers. The fourth example that we've got up there is our advanced engine timing system for Alfa Romeo and that's on their 2-liter gasoline engine and this is a good example of some really advanced timing system technology that we've brought to the market that will continue to advance efficiency in the combustion powered vehicles. So this is as I said is just four examples, it just gives you a little bit of a snapshot. Overall we continue to see very robust quoting activity with multiple customers, multiple products. And I'm very happy with what I see in our bookings, I'm very happy what I see in our win rates. And I really like the diversification and the balance across the portfolio of electric, hybrid and combustion. And I also like the profitability numbers that I see that are coming with those business wins. So the message really is our balanced approach to drive in a broad variety of technology is absolutely working for us. So let me try and wrap up and summarize a little bit for you. I think 2016 was a really good year for us. We delivered what we said we would. We knew going into 2016, it was super important that we delivered four good quarters and we did it. We did it on the top-line and we did it on the bottom-line and we feel very good about that, that just gives us confidence as we go into 2017. I think the business is operating very well and we continue to be focused on executing strong short-term performance, but also laser focused on delivering the growth for the long-term. Comment also about M&A. M&A pipeline remained strong and active for us, and we're working very hard on that with our key focus on power electronics. So we really believe and we continue to believe we have a winning strategy that focuses us on delivering advanced propulsion technology for combustion, hybrid and electric vehicles that will absolutely deliver that mid-to-high single-digit organic growth that we've talked about. Before I turn it over to Ron, I just did want to take just a quick moment to recognize in our press release, the details we've put in around asbestos. And Ron will clearly give a lot more detail on that, but I just wanted to give at least a comment from my office as the CEO. And I feel very good about the clarity that we're bringing to this issue, both internally and in our external disclosures. We really understand this issue very well and we also understand the impact on our business, and now Ron will talk about that. I think for me what's really fundamental that I want to make sure is clear, is it is no change at all on our cash flow generation and how we go about running this growth company going forward. So with that, let me stop there and turn the call over to Ron. Thank you. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thank you, James, and good day, everyone. Before I review the financials, I'd like to provide you some of the highlights as I see them for the quarter and the full-year. First, we had a solid growth in the quarter and we were slightly above our guidance for the quarter. We saw great operating performance with the 17% incremental margins. And our 2016 free cash flow improved by nearly $245 million or almost doubled from 2015. And we exceeded our 2016 guidance by about $100 million at the midpoint. So I think we had a very great year. Now as Pat mentioned, I will be referring to the supplemental financial slide deck that is posted on our IR website and I do encourage you to follow along. First, I'd like to focus your attention on slide 9. Throughout the presentation I will highlight certain non-U.S. GAAP measures to provide a clear picture of how the core business performed and for comparisons with prior periods. Specifically, we will be excluding the impact of FX, net M&A and Remy acquisition and divestiture of the light-duty aftermarket business and other non-comparable items from certain U.S. GAAP measures. So when you hear me say on a comparable basis, that means excluding all those impacts. When you hear me say on a reported basis that means U.S. GAAP. So let's turn to slide 10. On a reported basis, sales were up 6.4%, but on a comparable basis, our sales were up 6.6% or nearly 7%, again solid growth. On a reported basis, gross profit as a percentage of sales was 22.2% in the quarter, up 110 basis points from last year. On a reported basis, SG&A was 9.6% of sales. R&D spending, which is included in SG&A was 3.8% of sales in the quarter. On a comparable basis, SG&A was 9% of sales, up 80 basis points from a year ago. There's three reasons for the increase. First, R&D spending, as I mentioned was up by 10 basis points, 40 basis points is related to a stock-based comp true-up for the quarter, and a remaining 30 basis points is related to various increases in compliance cost. So now let's look at the year-over-year comparison for operating income, which can be found on slide 11. On a comparable basis, Q4 operating profit improved to $284 million, or 12.6% of sales compared to $269 million in Q4 of 2015. Where on an organic basis operating income was up $24 million on a $139 million of higher sales, that gives us an incremental margin of 17% in the quarter, a great finish to the year. The full-year incremental margin on a comparable basis was 15%. As you look further down in the income statement, equity in affiliate earnings was about $11 million in the quarter, down from $12 million last year. Interest expense and finance charges were $20 million in the quarter, which is basically flat from last year. Provision for income taxes in the quarter on a reported basis was a benefit of a $183 million primarily, because of the asbestos charge. However, this \u2013 the non-comparable item is really asbestos. You can read more about each of these adjustments in our 10-K, which will be filed later today, but if we exclude all the non-comparable items to provision for the income taxes was about $85 million for an effective tax rate of 11.5% for the quarter, or for the full-year effective tax rate of about 30.9%, very close to 31% that we guided all year. Net earnings attributable to non-controlling interests was about $12 million, up $2 million from the fourth quarter 2015, this time it reflects our minority partner share in the earnings and performance of our Korean and Chinese consolidated joint ventures. Earnings per share on a reported basis was a negative $1.39. On a comparable basis, net earnings were $0.85 per share. So let's switch to the segments now, which begins on slide 12. Reported Engine segment net sales were $1.39 billion in the quarter. Sales growth for the Engine segment on a comparable basis was 1.3% as demand for our light vehicle OEM products were offset by a weak aftermarket and off-road commercial vehicle markets around the world. Adjusted EBIT was $248 million for the Engines segment, or 17.9% of the sales. On a comparable basis the Engines segment adjusted EBIT was up $24 million on $18 million in sales for incremental margin of a 133% due to strong cost performance in the quarter. Turning to slide 13 and starting on the right, Drivetrain segment net sales were $883 million in the quarter. This includes $37 million of net sales from Remy activity, when I refer to the activity, I'm talking about the purchase last year and then the subsequent aftermarket sale in the fourth quarter of this year. So sales growth for Drivetrain segment on a comparable basis was up 16.9%, primarily due to higher all-wheel drive and transmission component sales, as James mentioned earlier. This is a very strong sales growth for this segment. Adjusted EBIT was $91 million for the Drivetrain segment, or 10.3% of sales. Excluding Remy and currency, adjusted EBIT was 11% of sales, flat from the prior year. On a comparable basis, the Drivetrain segment's adjusted EBIT was up $13 million on $123 million of higher sales for an incremental margin of 11%. Now, let's take a look at our balance sheet and cash flow. We generated $1.035 billion of net cash from operating activities in 2016, which is up by $168 million from 2015. Capital spending was $101 million in the quarter, down $77 million from a year ago. CapEx was 5.5% of sales. Free cash flow, which we define as net cash from operating activities less net capital spending was $545 million in 2016, which is up $250 million from a year ago. Again, like I said in my opening remarks, this exceeded our 2016 guide as a midpoint by $100 million, we had a great cash flow year and quarter. Looking at the balance sheet itself, balance sheet debt decreased by $331 million and cash decreased by $134 million, compared with the end of 2015. The $197 million decrease in net debt was primarily due to the settlement of a 10-year senior note coming due, lower revolver debt offset by share repurchases. We spent $288 million repurchasing just under 8.3 million shares in 2016. Our net debt-to-capital ratio is 35% at the end of 2016 and that's down from 35.2% at the end of 2015. Net debt-to-EBITDA at the end of the year was 1.15 times. Turning to slide 14 now, in Q4, as James mentioned, we recorded a charge of $441 million net of tax and expected insurance recoveries for estimated asbestos-related liabilities for historical automotive products that went out of production in the late 1980s and were manufactured by a legacy legal entity of ours. This amount primarily relates to estimated pending and potential future claims for an additional 50 years. This is net of estimated insurance recoveries. I do encourage you to read the disclosures in our 10-K, which is planned to be filed later today. The important details around this charge are as follows. First, it's non-cash charge net of our insurance recoveries. Second, it's not a discounted value, the number is nominal. The impact on cash flow should be viewed like this. We have paid claims since 2004 more than we have recovered from insurance companies, and the cash amounts have been reflected within our operating cash flows since that time. While we continue to collect from insurance companies under existing agreements and continue to litigate and pursue settlements with those, we have not reached agreement with every single insurance company. We expect that the annual future cash outflows for the next 5 to 10 years will be closely mirrored to what we have seen in the recent past and handle it in the same manner. And finally, none of this currently impacts our strong operating performance, our strong revenues and cash flows. Again, I would refer you to the disclosure in our 10-K that covers all the details around this. And in addition, Pat and I will welcome your calls later on. All right. Switching gears. I think it's important that we go over our 2017 guidance in detail again, despite the fact we did it at a conference earlier in January, just so everybody can be clear on this. So let's start with our sales growth for the full year on slide 16. Backlog, pricing, and market-related growth are expected to drive 3.5% to 6% organic sales growth. I'd like to note the net unfavorable market growth pricing amount in that number. Our assumption is that our weighted average market growth is about 0.6% with a negative pricing of 1.4%. Currency is expected to reduce sales by $320 million, or 360 basis points. All this nets to 2017 sales at the midpoint of $8.925 billion. Next, I'll walk our operating income on slide 17. From a performance perspective, we continue to expect mid-teens incremental margin on our sales growth. Included in this are some tailwinds and headwinds. The tailwinds include continued improvements from Wahler and Remy, offset by expected headwinds from commodity prices and corporate costs. We do expect an inflationary environment in commodities and rising compliance cost. Our consolidated operating income margin is expected to expand by 40 to 50 basis points. To finish up, our full-year guidance, please turn to slide 18. EPS guidance range is $3.35 to $3.45 per diluted share. Free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx, is expected to be in the $450 million to $500 million range. Capital spending, which does include tooling, is expected to be in the range of $475 million to $525 million. We expect to continue executing our share repurchase program, targeting about $100 million or plus depending on our M&A activity in 2017. R&D spending as a percentage of sales is expected to be about 4%. The tax rate is expected to be up slightly at about 32% due to more cash repatriated from Asia. Our assumption for the dollar-to-euro exchange rate is $1.05 for the full year, although I'd note that it is slightly higher right now. As a reminder, for every $0.01 change in the dollar to euro exchange rate equals about $30 million to $35 million of sales for us on a full-year basis. Now I'd like to switch to slide 20 to talk about the first quarter guidance, first sales. Note that Remy light vehicle aftermarket sales divested are about $70 million, so the starting point is at the base of $2.2 billion. Net of new business, pricing and market related growth are expected to drive organic sales growth of about 2.5% to about 6.5%. Currency is expected to reduce sales growth between 270 basis points. Therefore, 2017 Q1 sales is expected to be $2.24 billion at the midpoint. From an EPS perspective on slide 21, we expect negative $0.01 to $0.02 per share from operations perspective. This doesn't include the headwinds from commodities and corporate costs, which are more weighted to Q1 from a comp perspective. Foreign currencies are expected to lower earnings by about $0.03 per share in the quarter as well. Below the operating income line items are expected to contribute about $0.02 per share. Primarily, it's related to the lower share count, offset by a little bit higher tax. On a consolidated basis, we expect earnings of $0.81 to $0.85 per share. So let me summarize a few things right now. When we look back, 2016 was a great year for us. We executed very well on the top line, slightly above our guide, and basically hit our metrics on the top and bottom line. We grew mid-single digits, like I said, and exceeded the sales guidance. We expanded our operating margin by about 10 basis points on a comparable basis. I'd like to point out that even with the dilutive aspect of Remy in there, we significantly improved that cash flow as I went through in the script here. In addition, we returned about $400 million in capital in the form of share buybacks and dividends to shareholders. Now as I look forward to 2017 and beyond, we see improvements in a couple key areas. Again, single-digit growth despite being in a flat environment, and we also expect our margins to expand as well in 2017. So first and foremost, it is important that the intensity around our new product development to support the impending electrification trend has never been higher, as James talked about, and actually gave you some clarity around some of the more recent wins that we've been seeing. There is no question in our mind that we'll drive growth for many years going forward. So with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Pat to lead some Q&A. Patrick Nolan - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thanks, Ron. Denise, we're open for questions. Operator : Your first question comes from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great, thanks for taking my question. Can you talk a little bit about your sales performance in China in the quarter? How it tracked relative to your own expectations versus the industry? Maybe remind us of any disproportionate over- or under-exposures you have there to certain automakers or segments that maybe performed better or worse than the industry overall? James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Yeah. Let me take a shot at that Ryan. So I would characterize it this way, I think where we landed in the fourth quarter versus where we thought we would at the beginning, if that makes sense to you is we got, it was a stronger quarter than what we had anticipated going into the quarter. And I think that's pretty consistent to what others have said. We did go in and expecting to outperform and grow at a double-digit number in China and we did a little better than that. So we grew well above the market, I don't have an exact percent for you Ryan, but Pat can get that to you offline, but we went in, expecting very strong growth and it came in even better than that and our market outperformance held even in that stronger environment, if that helps you. And again, Pat can get you. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: Ryan, I actually have that number, James. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Okay. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: It grew about nearly 30%. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, Ron. Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Wow \u2013 it's impressive. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: In China. Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Very good, thank you. And then last question from me : you've been pretty clear about your desire to expand your engine electronics capabilities, maybe via inorganic. I mean can you just talk about what the acquisition environment in general looks like out there right now? Has it been affected much by the increase in the equity markets since your last earnings call? Then, is it also maybe your capital allocation decisions, could they be impacted by any sort of holiday on taxation of repatriation of cash overseas, et cetera? James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Let me say a couple things, Ryan. First and foremost, in terms of adding and expanding our capabilities around electronics and power electronics, it's important actually to know it's both organic and an M&A play, so we've been continuing to build and add capability and capacity organically, fundamentally through hiring the folks and we continue to do that, but specifically we were also looking to add through M&A. We do have a number of targets that were \u2013 we see and we're engaged in various levels of dialogue. I would say there's nothing externally in the marketplace that would be holding us back, if that makes sense, Ryan. So it's just purely a function of identifying the right technology capability within the company and then convincing them to sell, I mean that's the fundamental issue. So there is nothing \u2013 there is no overhang in terms of regulatory environment, in terms of as Ron alluded to, in terms of that capital deployment. We're ready to go do what we need to do. And the team is doing a great job of pursuing a number of targets. And it'll just be a case of getting one or more of those over the line as we can, Ryan. Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thank you. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Brian Johnson with Barclays. Your line is open. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yeah. Now I have a couple of questions. First, can you \u2013 this is more housekeeping. You mentioned in Detroit about the \u2013 couple things related to what may happen with taxes. First, you did say, you could repatriate some cash this year. That's behind your higher-tax rate guidance. Yet the prospects for tax reform are certainly out there. Do you have flexibility to wait to get clarity on the new administrations tax fund? Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: All right. This is Ron, Brian, okay. First, let's talk about the current environment that we operate for BorgWarner. We've worked very hard over the last couple of years to put in place what I would say is a very liquid repatriation strategy. And as I said, we bring cash back from Asia and we are bringing cash back from Europe, and we are comfortable where we sit right now to be able to bring cash back, if nothing were to change now. We all noticed something is going to change here. Going forward, there is two bills that everybody knows is the blueprint and then there is the Trump. We've analyzed it very carefully. There are some friction costs, as you get into this tax structure. It's going to be very complicated and create a lot of friction issues. Our perspective is in the long run, I think it's net-net benefit for BorgWarner, but it would take some time to get to that benefit. Now James has also said that in his opening remarks that we are very flexible in North America and we can compensate for that tax cover to change very quickly. We could start taking some flexibility actions that would put us in a more neutral position. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. But is that just looking at the border tax part of it and not the 20%... Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: Right. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: ...offset, because I thought you said in Detroit that he might pay more on imports but could be offset by a 20% tax rate. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: Right. So I was referring to a just a border tax rate... Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Right. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: ...that we would have to adjust our potential manufacturing footprints in North America, that's one aspect to it, but we have that flexibility. And then as you get into the absolute corporate tax rate, whatever you picked the 15% or 20%, once we get there to the friction transaction part of it, that I think coupled with the repatriation would basically be free to come back in the future. In the long run, it's very beneficial for us. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. So two quick follow-up questions. First that, I have seen a number, I think from Detroit, around $200 million of U.S. net imports. Is that the right starting point to think about? Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: That's correct. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Second, I guess my question back, and thank you for all the detail on border adjustment tax, was simply : if you start seeing bills in Congress that would lower the corporate tax rate and provide a repatriation holiday, could you defer that tax repatriation, the cash repatriation plan for this year, and hence not get the cash this year but not suffer a higher effective tax rate? Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: I understand the theory behind what you're saying there, Brian, that's something we'd have to take into consideration and that there was certainty where that tax is actually going to be passed then we would probably take something. The most important part is that we can be flexible depending on what we see actually is going to happen in the tax code. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Okay. So it's not some strange required distribution. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: No. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And then just final question, and I will just throw it out there, and I'm sure will you go into more detail on other questions. That 133% incremental margin over an Engine, clearly with flat revenue there's a lot of cost take-out that drove that. Is that the new base of operating costs that we ought to think about? Or is there a reason not to get too far ahead of where op margins would go when there's actually rev growth. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: Brian... Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Which I assume we're not going to model at a 133%? Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: I don't model at a 133%. I think a different perspective than focusing on the quarter is really the focus is on the full-year margin that that segment did, and the margin expansion was actually pretty impressive. So I would model a full year and then I would also model for the full year margin \u2013 some margin expansion probably in top of that. Okay. But, no, don't launch the fourth quarter, that's \u2013 I wouldn't go there with that. Okay? Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from David Leiker with Baird. Your line is open. David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Good morning, all. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Hey, David. David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: I have one question on this asbestos charge. It would seem to me, and we've seen some other companies take a similar charge to this, that you are in a position that you can estimate this out, going out 50 years versus whatever did you before, and that, that's the majority of what the charge is for? James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Correct. David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: So there's no adverse experiences? James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: No. So okay, I see you what you're getting at, David. Let me just take a moment maybe and give a little bit more color around this instead of just answering quickly. So basically, over the last several years, management has done some strategic initiatives on the defense side of this and put some stringent litigators in place, that's resulted in a very predictable environment for us on that side of it. That coupled with a very stabilized tort system came together at the same time, so that we're able to take a look at some actuary's people come in, some other professionals and have a very predictable stable environment. We're now \u2013 we're comfortable and actually making a 50-year estimate. In the past, we didn't have that type of environment. So it's kind of a convergence of several things coming together, that's mostly predictable. That's the most important word that I'm going to say here, it's predictable now. David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Yes. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: It wasn't predictable before. David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Yes, there are a couple of other companies in the same position who have done something very similar to this. So thanks on that. I was hoping that we could dig a little bit deeper into the revenue number here, a touch. Is there a way for Q4 and for 2016 to give us some sense of the geographic revenue performance, North America, Europe, Asia? James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Yeah. I can \u2013 let me \u2013 I'll try and take a shot at it for Q4, David. So as I think earlier, if you caught the earlier questions, from a China perspective, let me stop there. Ron said that, we grew it about 30% in the quarter year-over-year, which was pretty amazing. Obviously, if you look at what their production numbers were in China, that represents obviously very, very significant outperformance from us. We grew just about double-digit in North America, which again represents pretty solid outperformance. Europe, I would say, we would kind of below the market \u2013 light vehicle market in Europe, but that's a little bit history, where we have commercial vehicle in aftermarket revenue, a lot in Europe. So that's kind of a quick characterization. We can \u2013 Pat and I or Ron can give you a bit more of a full year view if you want offline, David, or in a follow-up call. I just don't have a good visibility on that in front of me. But that gives you a little bit of a sense for the quarter. Strong in \u2013 strong outgrowth in North America and China, and Europe about in line slightly down, it would be a way to think of it. David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Great, thanks. And then just one last one. On slide 7, where you labeled the recent product announcements. A bit curious, six months ago now or so that we talked about at your Analyst Day and trying to put some numbers around these types of products. I'm curious as you're booking the contracts and you get deeper into this process of building the backlog in these non-internal combustion products whether your content, your market share, the size of volume, unit volumes \u2013 just some characterization there of how that's tracking relative to what you would have talked about back in September. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Yeah. I can spend a couple minutes on that David. So just a real quickly recap, obviously we talked about the three architectures combustion, hybrid and electric. What we basically said around combustion back at Investor Day was this is \u2013 the combustion is a flat market basically, it's about 88 million vehicles in 2016, and it stays about that slightly down, BorgWarner's revenue growth is about 5% over that same period 2016 through 2023, and we get that two ways, we get that through increased penetration rates, and we also ramp-up a little bit on our content per vehicle. So combustion goes from 185 to 250. So if you bear with me, and if I do that same kind of approach on hybrid, David, we have a compound annual growth rate of about 50%-something, over that period 2016 through 2023. Again that's delivered through significant penetration \u2013 vehicle penetration, where we go from about 20% up to 40%-something, and again content per vehicle climbs significantly. Similar story on electrics, where we continue to see significant growth content per vehicle evolves there as well. The upshot of all of that David, is if I was to say where are we sitting here today in February versus where we were, when we were in Investor Day. I would say we're on track, if anything slightly better or slightly ahead of where we thought we were back in September. And slightly ahead means, what I'm actually seeing as get over the line in bookings in hybrids and electrics and combustion. So we feel probably slightly more comfortable than what we even did back in September based on the evidence over the last four months or five months of booking. In all three areas David, that's the key all three. David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. Great. Thank you very much. Patrick Nolan - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thanks, David. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: You're welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from David Kelley with Jefferies. Your line is open. David L. Kelley - Jefferies LLC : Good morning. And thanks for taking my questions. Just a couple of follow-ups here. Maybe if you could provide some additional color on the Remy business, maybe how it's progressing relative to your expectations, areas of outperformance, underperformance; and what you think about the Remy opportunity for 2017 would be great. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Let me take a shot if I can, David. I would say we were about a year into this. And so real briefly, I would say fundamentally it's performed pretty much as we'd expected. Top line is pretty much there other than a little bit of end market weakness. Operating-wise, it performed pretty much as expected. I would say the technology strength and depth that we've been pleased with in terms of the breadth and the strength of the product portfolio. I think the one incremental area that I would say is a little better than what we thought from when we went in is we're seeing the opportunity to combine the Remy product with the traditional BorgWarner product to differentiate ourselves with our customers on technology solutions, and we saw that with the electric drive module would be a great example very recently. So I would say that's how I would characterize that. I think the other element that we feel very good about was the divestiture of the non-core light vehicle aftermarket business. I think that was a really important move for us in a number of fronts, so we feel good about that. So now as we go into this year, the focus, David, just to give you a number in the three-year backlog, we characterize the rotating electric portion of our backlog was about 12%, which was up significantly from a year ago. And that's coming from two aspects. One is what I alluded to earlier, which is the combining of the Remy core technology with the BorgWarner technology to offer system solutions for our customers. And then the second area is finding ways to gain share with the more legacy product set of Remy, so basically selling more starters and alternators. Now we've got to leverage with BorgWarner than Remy did in its former life. So net-net all around, David, we're feeling very good about it. It's contributing from a top line perspective in a good way. And we're starting to get some traction on the margin improvements. Remember, when we started this business, it was about a 4% operating margin business. We'll get some incremental uplift this year without having the non-core aftermarket business, and we're comfortable we can expand margins on the core Remy business. So hopefully that gives you a little bit of color, David, to help. David L. Kelley - Jefferies LLC : Great, I appreciate the color there, just a quick follow-up on turbochargers and then I will pass it along. Regionally, how do you view the category opportunity heading into 2017? What could be markets of outperformance or underperformance? And along that note, if we're thinking about the eBooster technology ramp, how is that progressing? Where are we over the next two to three years with eBoosters? That would be great. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: So just from a turbo perspective in its general sense, the core story there really is we're seeing obviously significant penetration uplifts in North America and China. That's where the growth story is playing out. Europe is obviously pretty much a saturated space in terms of turbocharger penetration. And I would say to you that's playing out as we expected. We're seeing rapid adoption rates in China and in North America. And Pat could give you some detail numbers offline if it's helpful, David. So we're seeing that play out. From our BorgWarner perspective, our market share expectations are playing out exactly as we thought. So we're winning where we thought we would win and we're doing well from a share perspective. So I would say that's encouraging too. And eBooster, we continue to get more and more traction there. We have a couple of production awards \u2013 or in production I should say in 2017 with a couple of key customer programs, and we see continued pull and demand for eBooster programs that we're quoting on and doing very well with. So we see that trend continuing from a technology point of view, and we're getting our share and doing quite well in winning that business. So hopefully that gives you some sense, David. David L. Kelley - Jefferies LLC : All right, perfect. Thanks again. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Brett Hoselton with KeyBanc. Your line is open. Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Good morning. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: Good morning, Brett. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Hi, Brett. Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: A 30,000-foot question, and it's just this. Combustion, hybrid, electric, it seems like regionally we're seeing them grow at different pace, and China seems to be focused heavily on electric. So can you talk about the combustion, hybrid, and electric growth rates in the different regions? James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: I can take a shot at that, Brett, at least start on that for you. I would say first, your assumption is right where the lead space, if I can call it that, for electric is in China. So we are seeing more focus, more drive around pure electrics in China regionally than other parts of the world, but we are obviously seeing electric production rates in Europe and North America also. I would say all three regions somewhat equally are looking to optimize combustion technologies, so we're seeing that. And I would say that's pretty uniform around the world in terms of refinement optimization on combustion. Hybrid, also I would say regionally there's a pull, probably an equal pull for hybrids in the different regions of the world. Brett, what I would say to you on hybrids, where there's not a lot of difference regionally, you are getting different customer strategies around hybrids, and that's where Borg is playing a really key role because they're looking at different hybrid architectures, different ways of getting there, and that's where we're playing a strong role in helping them. So a little bit of regional variation, but I think ultimately I would say, Brett, the critical 30,000th point for us is, we've seen all the OEMs needing a balance of the three architectures and we're there to help them with that balance of the three. That's the really critical part. Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thank you very much, James. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thanks, Brett. Operator : Your next question comes from Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning, everyone. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Good morning, Rich. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Just two quick ones. On the regional split of these new wins, James, just as a follow-up, any difference? Is that pretty spread evenly? And then the second one would be for Ron on the buyback. The $100 million-plus, what moves that up meaningfully from there? What would you have to see? What's the scenario? Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: I'll go to buyback quickly. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Yeah, sure. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: As I said on the buyback, it's all going to depend on our M&A activity, Rich. We have some things that we're looking at right now. And if they look like they're not going to materialize till end of the year or next year, we would move it up. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: In terms, Rich, of the new wins, so to speak, it is pretty balanced regionally. I put those four examples up, Rich. I see that's a good characterization or a good representation of actually how it's playing out. So you've got a really advanced electric vehicle system that's in \u2013 at a China. You've got the latest and greatest turbocharger technology that's in Asia and China. Suzuki, as you see Alfa Romeo is a European, but I wouldn't be surprised when I show you the \u2013 in the next call, another four. They could be North American or whatever, see. I'm \u2013 it is pretty balanced. Both regionally, Rich, but also across the combustion, hybrid and electric propulsion space. It's pretty balanced. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay, thank you. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thanks, Rich. Operator : Your next question comes from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks, everybody, just a high-level question. Your OEM customers have recently been fairly outspoken in putting real money behind the propulsion changes, and obviously you're seeing that in your order and quoting activity. But sometimes when we have conversations with them, they suggest that, that could create some volatility in their results as they make the pivot from internal combustion to EVs. If I'm not mistaken, the message you've been giving pretty consistently now is that, while not easy, you're confident that you can make that pivot while maintaining the incremental margins kind of like phase-in, phase-out, without really any blip. I'm not holding you to like exact science here, but it seems like your current level of this 17%, 18% with an engine, for example, that we're not going to be in a position a year or so from now where, due to that pivot and some of the internal investments, expenses, you don't think that, that's \u2013 you don't see that, have visibility of that creating a near term and necessary blip to capture this great revenue opportunity going forward. Is that accurate from a perspective? James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Adam, it's James. So I would say, that's a pretty \u2013 a pretty good description you gave, and I would give you a little bit color of \u2013 kind of why I think that is, because I think it's a \u2013 if I can say it this way, it's an incremental evolution to the end game. They're not \u2013 and I think, you've seen this yourself, that it's not a light switch, where we're turning off from \u2013 turning off combustion and turning on the light, it's a \u2013 it's a \u2013 it's kind of a journey and it's an evolution. And the reason that's important, that does a couple of things, that allows us to be thoughtful and balanced in terms of making our investments, and evolving the portfolio as opposed to throw all of it away and bring a brand-new third on that we've never done before. And that's why we have the comfort and the confidence in the kind of evolution, because it's not a light switch type event. The other quick comment I would make Adam, that gives us incremental confidence is, as I've alluded to sort of last year, we are in production with hybrid technology, we're in production with electric vehicle technology. And we've been doing that over the last three years to four years, and still delivering the incrementals over that period of time. And what we're also seeing is the financial performance of those electric and hybrid vehicles is very good. So I don't want to characterize Adam, that this is easy, I don't want to tell you that, but I would tell you, we feel comfortable that this is more of an evolution than an event and we're comfortable, we can manage through it and deliver what we're saying we're going to do. Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks, James. Thanks, team. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Joe Spak with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Good morning. Thanks for fitting me in here. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thank you. Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC : James, just I guess very high level : there was a smaller turbo competitor out there that's up for sale. I think it confirms a lot about what you have been saying about this market over the years. I was curious, is that helping you at all on the margin in bidding, given uncertain future ownership there? And does that have any \u2013 does that asset have any strategic value to BorgWarner? James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thanks for bringing that up, Joe. I think your note characterized it actually pretty well, frankly. So Bosch Mahle rough numbers is about 4% to 5% market share. And I think what it really, really confirmed is the barriers to entry in that turbo space a pretty hard, it's pretty tough and I think you alluded to that and we would confirm that. So lot of technology, lot of IP, lot of manufacturing capabilities et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, investment business. And yeah we defend that very, very strongly. And I think you see there is some, it's a tough space for them to do. In terms of how it plays out, I think we'll have to see candidly. We will see what plays out in terms of what happens with that asset. We do feel extremely positive about our position frankly speaking in turbo and we have about a third share. We talked about that, win rates are good, our booking rates are good, our technology leadership we feel really, really good about. And, yeah, so we're feeling good about it is the quick answer, Joe, but in terms of the specifics about deal plays out, we'll have to give that a little bit of time. Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay, thanks a lot. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thanks. Patrick Nolan - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thanks, Joe. Operator : Your next question comes from Brian Sponheimer with Gabelli. Your line is open. Brian C. Sponheimer - G. research LLC : Hi, thanks for sneaking me in here. Just one confirmation, Ron, on the asbestos charge. Looking back to your 2015 10-K there was some discussion about insurance recovery. This is in no way any sort of comment about your ability to recover from insurance companies what you expect to receive, correct? Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: Correct. All we really did is, we \u2013 that there are two types of liabilities out there, one of them when people file claims, we had to do an estimate of what we expected those settlements to be, which we've always had out there, and we had an asset and liability. What we did is we true that up, but then more importantly, we took a look at the universe of what we call IBNR incurred, but not reported yet. What we did is, we took a look at that as well, and what we did is we took a look at for 50 years, put that on that balance sheet and then our insurance receivables are still out there. I'd encourage you, really to take a look at the 10-K that we filed today, it gives more clarity around it, and also it gives you more of what the asset values and liabilities are on the balance sheet, okay. I don't want to spend a lot of time on the call going through all those details, but there's there is a lot of clarity, I think in the K that we're going to put out today, around this issue. Brian C. Sponheimer - G. research LLC : Great. Thank you very much. Much appreciated and I'll look at 10-K. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: Okay. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thanks, Chris (sic) [Brian]. Operator : We have time for one final question, and that question comes from Chris McNally with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Chris McNally - Evercore ISI : Thanks very much, guys. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Good morning. Chris McNally - Evercore ISI : I just wanted to get a little divisional detail. Obviously, the strength in Drivetrain. Could you talk a little bit how we should think about growth split, maybe between the divisions in 2017; and as the follow-on, how to think about incremental margins by division over the next couple of quarters? James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: I would say, Chris, if you think of what we did in the three-year backlog, where we broke out, the products actually by discrete products, but then also you can clearly see what's Engine and what is Drivetrain. My sense is, I would think that's probably a pretty good barometer for \u2013 on an annual basis, is a good way to think of it. So we provided the detailed breakdown there by product and by segment for you in the three-year view. I don't think you'll go too far wrong if you view the one-year view somewhat similar to the three-year view, if that's helpful for you. Chris McNally - Evercore ISI : Okay. So there shouldn't be any weird comps in terms of the growth as we think about over 2017. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: No, I don't think this \u2013 no, it would be my quick answer. Chris McNally - Evercore ISI : Okay. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: And in terms of the margins on the \u2013 quick answer, from an Engine point of view, we're pretty high up there, right? So there's we're kind of keeping pace at an incremental bases and absolute are pretty much there. We've talked on the Drivetrain side. We've always said there's a little bit of room for incremental uplift there and we continue to drive that for sure. Chris McNally - Evercore ISI : Okay. Perfect. Thanks so much, guys. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thank you. Patrick Nolan - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thank you. Patrick Nolan - BorgWarner, Inc.: With that, we're going to end our call. I'd like to thank you all for participating today and thank you for your helpful questions. Denise, you can close the call. Operator : That does conclude the BorgWarner 2016 fourth quarter and full-year results conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Then Ron Hundzinski, our CFO, will discuss the details of our results as well as our guidance. Please note that we posted an earnings call presentation to the IR page of our website. You'll find the link in the Events and Presentations section below the notice for this call. We encourage you to follow along through these slides during our discussion. With that, I'll turn it over to James. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thank you, Patrick and good day and welcome to everybody. Thank you for joining our call. As Pat said, Ron and I are really pleased to share our results from first quarter 2017 and update you on how we're progressing towards delivering our 2017 targets. So I'm going to start by sharing a few thoughts on the macro environment in the industry. And for those of you following along, I'm now going to be on slide five. So, from a macro perspective, we recognize and see \u2013 there is instability out there in many aspects. But I think what's interesting and key for us is in general, the outlook for the auto industry has been good and remains good. If I talk a little bit about global light vehicle production in Q1, growth was strong. In Europe, light vehicle production rose about 6%. China light vehicle production was up close to 7%, which was well ahead of our expectations as we went into the quarter. And in North America, light vehicle industry production increased low single digits with continued strong mix. As I start to think about the outlook for the market, let me start light vehicle 2017 calendar year. And I would say we're closely aligned with HIS' view, which is calling for about 2% growth in China. We see Europe up about 1%, and we see North American production down between 1% and 2%. Now if you look at that on a weighted basis from a BorgWarner perspective, that would imply global production growth of slightly less than 1% for us. A word about commercial vehicle where we are seeing signs of improvement; in North America, we see orders and medium-duty sales improving. And as we look towards China and Europe, the outlook has improved, and we think it's going to be stronger. So, it's a good environment, as I mentioned earlier. But as ever, you would always keep your eye on things that could go against us a little. So a couple of things, one is the North American cycle itself. And we recognize that we're kind of towards the higher levels. We've seen a little bit of modest softening in North America schedules since the beginning of the year, and we'll continue to monitor and watch inventory level. Diesel gas mix in Europe shifted in Q1. And as we look at it, diesel share declined about 360 bps year-over-year in Q1. And we expect this diesel-gas mix to shift throughout the end of the decade. The really good news for us though is we're offsetting that in the near term. And I'm going to talk a little bit more about diesel-gas mix in the next few slides. I'd say the other area we keep paying a lot of attention to is China. We're still expecting modest industry growth in 2017. But I think more importantly for us, our growth over the market remains very strong due to increasing share and content per vehicle. So, let me wrap all of this up. I want to be really clear. We're confident in our outgrowth of the market in 2017 based on the continued strong demands for our products. Let me make a couple of comments in regards to the regulatory and technology area. We still see a continued strong drive around fuel economy and emissions regulations and the pull for advanced propulsion technology continues to be strong. I would say the activity is accelerating particularly around gas and hybrid vehicles and also in electric vehicles. And for us as a company, our transition to the increased electrification continues. As I look at our Q1 new business bookings, it was strong. It continued to show additional awards with a range of customers, very balanced regionally and across all propulsion system architectures. And for those of you that may be keeping track, we'd shared that we had about mid-20s awards for hybrids and electric platforms at year-end, and we've added a couple more to that during Q1. And we plan to provide a more detailed update around this at our Analyst Day in August. So as I mentioned earlier, diesel-gas mix is kind of a key topic, and we do get a number of questions on this. So I'd like to give you some additional color around this, and I'm on slide number six at this stage. So as we started out this year, we had assumed 100 bps to 200 bps annually shift in Western Europe diesel-gas mix through the end of the decade. And as you look at the chart on the screen there, you will see that Q1, that mix shifted more and a little faster than we'd anticipated. So, let me give you a little bit of a perspective on what does that really mean for BorgWarner. One of the best ways to think about this is, today, the net revenue impact for BorgWarner with 100 bps shift from diesel to gas mix is about a $20 million to $25 million annual number. If you think of that in the context of a $9 billion company, that's very manageable for us. And in addition to that, by the end of our backlog period, we expect that gap will close significantly as our content per vehicle continues to increase on gas-powered vehicles. So our view is the mix shift is a minor issue for us now, and over the midterm, it becomes negligible. If you take a look at slide seven, here's a good way to think about the shift from diesel to gas impacts our business. There's three fundamental products that are diesel oriented. I'll start with turbo. So in Western Europe, pretty much all diesel vehicles are turbocharged 100%. Gas, it's about 75% to 80% and increasing, and pricing is pretty much similar. So for us, as the gasoline turbo penetration grows, this becomes a very negligible issue. The second product line light vehicle diesel versus EGR product line; and what we're seeing there is as transition moves to gasoline vehicles, there will be more and more gasoline EGR content on those vehicles. The third area is glow plugs, which are diesel-centric products, and they're going to be offset by a strong growth in variable cam timing on the gasoline \u2013 advanced gasoline engines. So again for us, the revenue impact is neutralized by the end of the backlog as we gain content on gasoline-powered vehicles. Let me turn now to slide eight and give you a little bit of a financial recap for us. And Ron, as Pat said earlier, will provide a lot more detail on this following myself. So as I look at the first quarter for BorgWarner, I have to say I was very, very pleased, particularly around our growth. Our growth came in well above the guidance, $2.4 billion of sales in the quarter, which is a record for us. That's up 12.8% organically when we exclude FX and REMY. And this compares to our end market growth exposure, which was about 4.5%, so strong out-performance. Regionally as we'd expected, we did get strong growth in China, strong growth in North America and the European growth was just modestly ahead of our industry growth. This light vehicle growth was also supplemented by positive revenue trends in commercial vehicle, particularly off-road. These all helped us deliver EPS of $0.91 excluding non-comparables, which I think is very strong performance, and an operating margin again at 12.2%. And again, Ron will provide a little more color on that. If I look at it from a segment perspective, the most powerful thing for me as I looked at our Q1 performance was the growth across all of our products. It was really incredible. All of our product lines were growing at a very strong rate. That helped us deliver engine sales of $1.5 billion. So that's growth of just over 9.5% organically, very strong. And that again is in light of the diesel mix shift that I explained earlier. We've still got that very strong top line growth. Drivetrain \u2013 Drivetrain sales at $925 million, that's up almost 19% organically. So you could imagine we saw a growth across almost every aspect of Drivetrain business. We had strong all-wheel drive growth, strong DCT growth and strong transmission growth in most regions of the world, so a super quarter for growth in Drivetrain. Let me give a little bit of a view on our outlook for 2017. So revenue and operating margin outlook is unchanged from the guidance we provided last quarter. That has us landing with organic growth of mid 3.5% to 6% year-over-year. And again, that's in a market that's growing less than 1%. Our consolidated operating income margin is expected to expand 40 basis points to 50 basis points and our EPS guidance range is $3.50 to $3.60 per diluted share. That's up from our prior guidance due to favorable taxes, which Ron will talk you through in a few moments. I do want to talk a little bit about growth highlights. And we had a number in the quarter, and I'm just going to dwell on a couple of them for you, and you can see that on slide 9. DCT clutch and control module for ChangAn was a really big win for us. That's ChangAn's first self developed DCT transmission and we will be providing a lot of content there. Also, good to see us supplying our HY-VO chain technology on hybrid and plug-in hybrid technology, you can see that. So, this is a snapshot of just four leading-edge technologies that are providing growth. And again, the key message I wanted to share with you is it continues to be across the balance of combustion, hybrid, and electric platforms. We also have another couple of announcements that will be coming out in the next couple of weeks that I think will also give you a lot of excitement in terms of our bookings for new business. So the key message here, our balanced approach around propulsion systems for combustion, hybrid and electric is strong. We're winning and its driving long-term growth for us. So let me summarize before I turn over to Ron. Q1 was a really strong top line quarter for us. And again, I'm really pleased that we're seeing strong growth across all of our major businesses. From an operating perspective, I think the business is absolutely operating in line with our expectations, which is really good to see. And with that, we feel very comfortable about our ability to execute toward the high-end of our growth expectations for the year. We believe the company's positioned to deliver mid-to-high single-digit growth over the long term. In a nutshell, the future is very bright for BorgWarner, both in the short term and in the long term. And with that now, let me turn it over the Ron to provide some more detail. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thank you, James and good day, everyone. Before I review the financial details, I would like to provide you some of the highlights as I see them for the quarter. As James said, I think the first one is outstanding growth, and it significantly was above our guidance for the quarter. And I will even give you more color on that a little bit later. Our operating performance was as expected for us for the quarter. And most importantly, the quarter positions us stronger towards our full year guidance. So as Pat mentioned, I will be referring to supplemental financial slide deck that is posted on our IR website, and I do encourage you to follow along. First, I'd like to focus your attention on slide 11. Throughout the presentation, I will highlight certain non-U.S. GAAP measures to provide a clear picture of how the core business performed and for comparisons with prior periods. Specifically, we will be excluding the impact of FX, net M&A of the Remy light vehicle aftermarket divestiture and other non-comparable items from certain U.S. GAAP measures. When you hear me say on a comparable basis, that means excluding everything I just mentioned; when you hear me say on a reported basis, that means U.S. GAAP. So now let's turn to slide 12. On a reported basis, sales were up 1.6%. On a comparable basis, our organic sales were up 12.8%. This was approximately 600 basis points ahead of the high-end of our guidance. Our weighted average industry production was about 4.5%. Our guide was set at 0.5%. So we saw 400 basis points tailwind from production. Our expectation for China growth was low double digits. Our growth came in at 29%, resulting in about 150 basis points of tailwind. Commercial vehicle was a benefit as well, contributing more than 100 basis points of tailwind. The primary headwind versus our expectations was the diesel-gas mix in Western Europe. Before I move on to operating profit, I would like to discuss our gross profit and SG&A line items. Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 21.5% in the quarter, which is up 100 basis points from last year, great performance. On a reported basis, SG&A was 9.1% of sales. R&D spending, which is included in SG&A, was up to 4% of sales. SG&A was up 80 basis points from a year ago and there's three main reasons for the increase. First, R&D spending was up 20 basis points from a year ago as we continued to invest for the future. 20 basis points is related to variable stock comp that was not accrued until the fourth quarter of last year. So it was a difficult comp. And there is some 30 basis points as related to various increases in compliance costs, tax planning and other professional fees. And finally, there is a modest headwinds as some Remy costs were reclassified from cost of goods sold to SG&A. Now, let's look at the year-over-year comparison for operating income, which can be found on slide 13. Q1 operating profit was $293 million or 12.2% of sales compared to $276 million in Q1 of 2016, which was also 12.2% of sales. On an organic basis, operating income was up $25 million on $277 million of higher sales. That gives us an incremental margin of 9% in the quarter, although this was in line with our expectations. So I will discuss incremental margins more after I go through the segment performance numbers. As you look further down the income statement, equity in affiliate earnings was about $10 million in the quarter, up slightly from last year. Interest expense and finance charges was $18 million in the quarter, down $3 million from last year due to lower debt levels. Excluding $3 million onetime tax adjustment, the provision for income taxes was $83 million for an effective tax rate of 29% for the quarter. We have updated our full year guidance to reflect a full year effective tax rate of 29% versus 32% previously. The reduced tax rate is the result of lower statutory tax rates in Hungary and Japan, along with obtaining a lower tax rate for high tech status for our China facility. Net earnings attributable to non-controlling interest was about $10 million, up $1 million from the first quarter 2016. This line reflects our minority partner share in earnings performance of our Korean and Chinese consolidated joint ventures. Earnings per share on a reported basis was $0.89 per diluted share. On a comparable basis, net earnings were $0.91 per diluted share. Now, let's take a closer look at operating segments in the quarter beginning on slide 14. Reported Engine segment net sales was $1.495 billion in the quarter. Sales growth for Engine segment on a comparable basis was 9.5% as demand for light vehicle OEM products was supplemented by growth in our commercial vehicle business. Adjusted EBIT was $247 million for the Engine segment or 16.5% of sales. On a comparable basis, the Engine segment's adjusted EBIT was up $16 million on $133 million of higher sales for an incremental margin of 12%, which we expect to accelerate later in the year. Turning to slide 13 and starting from the right. Drivetrain segment net sales were $925 million in the quarter. This does include a reduction of $90 million of sales from the divestiture of the Remy light vehicle aftermarket. Sales growth for the Drivetrain segment on a comparable basis was 18.8%, primarily due to higher all-wheel transmission components and strong DCT growth in China. Adjusted EBIT was $105 million for the Drivetrain segment or 11.3% of sales. On a comparable basis, the Drivetrain segment's adjusted EBIT was up $20 million on $149 million of higher sales for an incremental margin of 13%. Like I said earlier, I'd like to take a moment to discuss incremental margins. Our total company incremental margin for Q1 was 9%, which is below our long-term goal of mid-teens but in line with our Q1 expectations. In order to better understand this, there are a few items we should highlight. First, segment incremental margins. The Engine segment incremental margins were 12% or about $5 million of headwind towards our incremental goal of mid-teens. Our realignment emission (21:12) products in Europe, which includes the Wahler acquisition, continues to see operational headwinds, but should improve in the second half of the year. Our Drivetrain segment incremental margins were 13%, which was up from 11% in Q4 as we continued to launch DCT plants in China. So, the question is that Engine incremental margins were 12% and Drivetrain were 13%, why is the total company at 9%? In a nutshell, it's corporate and other costs. So first, if you take a look at the reported segment income statement in the press release, which is on page 6, you will note a $5.3 million charge for the early termination of a lease. In addition, corporate costs incurred and additional stock-based comp I mentioned earlier and various advisory fees and tax and legal planning. Adding back these items would generate approximately 500 basis points in improvement incremental margin, which gets you basically back to the mid-teens growth \u2013 incremental margin. Now, let's take a look at our balance sheet and cash flow. We generated $60 million of net cash from operating activities in Q1, up $26 million from Q1 of 2016. Q1 is typically our lowest quarter in cash flow generation. Our investments in working capital wraps up the first quarter to match higher levels of business activity compared to the year-end. Capital spending was $131 million for the quarter, which is up $27 million from a year ago. Free cash flow, which we define as net cash from operating activities less capital spending, was a negative $71 million, basically flat from 2016. Looking at the balance sheet itself, balance sheet debt increased by $76 million, and cash decreased by $85 million compared with the end of 2016. The $161 million increase in net debt was primarily due to the seasonality of increased working capital to support higher level of business. Our net debt to net capital ratio was 35.8% at the end of the first quarter, up slightly from 35% at the end of 2016. And net debt to EBITDA at the end of the quarter was 1.24 times. Now, I'd like to discuss our 2017 guidance. At the high end, our revenue and margin guidance is unchanged from last quarter. So, let's start with our sales growth guidance for the full year on slide 17. Backlog pricing and market-related growth are expected to drive 3.5% to 6% organic sales growth. I'd like to note that the net unfavorable market growth/pricing amount on the slide is negative. Our full year assumption is that our weighted average market growth is slightly less than 1% and price reductions are in line with historic levels. Currency is expected to reduce sales by $310 million or about 350 basis points. Adding all this up and incorporating our Q1 performance, our full year revenue is tracking at the high end of our guidance range. Next, I'll walk our operating income on slide 18. From a performance perspective, we continued to expect mid-teens incremental margins on our sales growth. Included in this are some tailwinds and headwinds. Tailwinds include continued improvement in Wahler and Remy, offset by expected headwinds from commodity prices and corporate costs. We do expect an inflationary environment in commodities and rising compliance costs. Our consolidated operating income margin is expected to expand by 40 basis points to 50 basis points full year. To finish up our full year guidance, please turn to slide 19. EPA guidance \u2013 EPS guidance range is now $3.50 to $3.60 per diluted share. The $0.15 increase is primarily driven by the lower tax rate I mentioned earlier. Free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx, is expected to be in the $450 million to $500 million range. Capital spending including tooling is expected to be in the range of $475 million to $525 million. We expect to continue executing our share repurchase program, targeting $100 million-plus depending on M&A activity. R&D spending as a percentage of sales is expected to be 4% in 2017. The tax rate is now expected to be 29%, down from 32%. Our assumption for the dollar-euro exchange rate is $1.05. As a reminder, every one cent change in the dollar-to-euro exchange rate equates to about $30 million to $35 million of sales. Our second quarter guidance starts on slide 21. First, sales. Note that Remy light vehicle aftermarket sales divested are $80 million. So the starting point base is $2.25 billion net new business. Pricing and market rate growth are expected to drive organic sales growth of 3% to 6.5%. Currency is expected to reduce sales by 510 basis points. And therefore, 2017 Q2 sales is expected to be $2.24 billion at the midpoint. From an EPS perspective on slide 22, we expect $0.03 to $0.07 per share from the backlog, market and pricing, with about $0.01 of headwind from corporate and other costs. Foreign currencies are expected to lower earnings by about $0.05 per share in the quarter. And below operating income line items are expected to contribute $0.07 per share from a lower share count and a lower tax rate. On a consolidated basis, we expect earnings of $0.87 to $0.91 per share. So, let me summarize quarter one. Quarter one was a great start to the year. Comparable sales growth was nearly 13%. And even after subtracting strong industry production, we grew in the high-single digits. The sales growth was seen in all of our products and segments. Although our incremental margins were slightly below our mid-teens goal, they were as we expected, and we anticipate this improvement in the second half of the year on top of it. As we look at 2017 and beyond, we continue to drive intensity around new product development to support the impending electrification trend. There is no question in my mind that that won't drive growth for many years. And with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Pat. Patrick Nolan - BorgWarner, Inc.: Sharon, we're ready for questions. Operator : Your first question comes from Colin Langan with UBS. Please go ahead. Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Hi. Great. Thanks for taking my question. Why \u2013 and if you're indicating (28:54) the high end of sales guidance is likely, but given your very strong organic growth out of the gate, why not raise sales guidance? I mean, actually, I'm surprised like things are fairly flattish from here on out. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Yeah. Good morning, Colin. This is James. Fair question. First of all, thanks for the comment on a strong Q1. We really did feel good about that strong organic growth. A couple of things to think about. It's only one quarter in, and I think we need to calibrate that. As we alluded to, there are a couple of things that we're paying attention to \u2013 the diesel/gas mix, the China and North America. So we've got to watch those a little bit. So I think it's just a prudent thing at this stage to get another quarter under our belt. With that said, as Ron and I both alluded to, we are comfortable that we're certainly trending towards the high end of our guidance. And let's get another quarter under our belt is kind of a key thing, I would say. Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. And on your comments, you've indicated China was very strong, a big outperformer. What's driving that? And any update on the DCT joint venture in China? Is that finally starting to kick in? James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Yes. No. Ron explained it. I think it was 29% growth for the first quarter, so well above the market. The really good thing, Colin, was it was pretty much across all of our product offering, we saw that growth in China, so both on the engine side and the Drivetrain side. I think, from a, let me say, a strategic perspective, we are starting to see the strong acceleration of DCT in China. I know for many of you that have been following us for a while, that's been a little bit long in coming. But we did see a notable uplift in DCT revenue in China, which is a big part. But really it was across the whole product portfolio we saw strong growth in China. Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. All right. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on a good quarter. Patrick Nolan - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thank you. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thanks, Colin. Operator : Your next question comes from Rod Lache from Deutsche Bank. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning, everybody. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Good morning. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Had a couple of things I wanted to ask. One is just on the backlog, if I add the first quarter and then your forecast for the second quarter, your first half backlog contribution is $350 million, $400 million. Your full year is $410 million to $590 million. So, it looks like 85% of it is happening in the first half. Is that a timing issue? Is the first half taking away from something that you had in the back half? Or is that just conservatism? James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Yes, Rod. This is James. I'll take a shot at it and then Ron can add as needed. I think the way I look at it at least is we feel good about the backlog. The first quarter is coming in a little bit ahead of what we thought. Second quarter backlog looks pretty good too. I don't think it's so much of a pulling. I think it's a little bit of a, let's give ourself a little bit more time to see how things play out, frankly speaking, before we would want to readjust the backlog number. There's nothing materially pulling in from a launch perspective, Rod. It's not a big shift of product mix, launch or anything like that. I think it's just Q1 came in stronger than we'd anticipated. We're digesting that. We want to see how that runs into the second quarter. And then we'll have a better view of what the second half backlog looks like. But no fundamental shift kind of is the point, Rod, in terms of technology, adoption, launch cadence, those types of things. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: The only thing I would add, Rod, is sometimes, you hit on all cylinders and it was one of those quarters where we actually hit on (32:51) cylinders, in the past, we have some positive news and then we have some negative news. This is one of those quarters where everything just, quite frankly, came in positive, right where we hoped it would come in and it did. So, it was a great quarter. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. And then secondly, just given the magnitude of the diesel decline that we're seeing in Europe, it would seem that the European market broadly may actually be seeing a rise in CO2 emissions rather than a decline, just given that CO2 is less for diesel. So, I'd imagine that they'd be scrambling, your customers would be scrambling for technologies to help offset that. And I was hoping you might be able to give us some kind of a quantification or a sense of what is actually happening, what's the pace of contract awards that you're seeing this year versus maybe last year? Is there anything that we can take away from that vis-\u00e0-vis your growth and as you get out towards \u2013 closer to 2020? James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Yes, Rod, I'll take a shot at that for you. I think you're right. First of all, we do as we showed in the chart there that the diesel decline has accelerated faster than I think what everybody was anticipating. So that's moved down that 350 bps in the first quarter versus our expectation of 100 bps or so. We do see that potentially going down further through the rest of the year. So, we're seeing it accelerate a little faster move to gas more a little faster. It's certainly going to put pressure on 2017 CO2 attainment for sure. What we're seeing from a more, I don't know, medium-term perspective, Rod, I would say it's fair that we are seeing even more increased development activity in contracts around gas, advanced gas particularly, and hybrids and less focus on diesel development. I don't want to portray that there's not optimization in programs going on for diesel, because there is. But it's fair to say that we've seen an uptick in focus on EV architecture discussions, hybrids and particularly a lot of work around optimizing the advanced gasoline engines. So, hopefully that helps a little bit, Rod. I think where it all ends and settles, we'll have to see how it plays out during the year. From a Borg perspective, we feel good. We feel well-positioned because we're participating on those hybrid architectures, the gas architectures and obviously EV architectures too. So, more to come, Rod, but I think the key message is, it's accelerating. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yes. And just lastly on a housekeeping item, can you give us your expectation for raw materials for the year? And what was the dollar headwind from light vehicle diesel and tailwind from commercial vehicle in the quarter? Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: I'll talk about the commodity. Commodity headwind was $10 million for the full year. But it was mostly weighted to the first quarter. But, what really happened in the quarter, Rod, is we saw the inflationary environment. And as we said before, roughly 65% is contractually passed through. And then we typically do better than that on negotiations, and what happened is we did better than that. We were able to negotiate more pass-through. So, therefore, you didn't really see any kind of headwind in the quarter in commodity. But, inflationary environment is there, I'd like to point that out. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: (36:29) for the year? Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: Pardon? Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: What are you expecting for the year in terms of inflation? Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: It was $10 million of \u2013 this was the commodity impact-wise, and that includes some corporate, as well, cost in there for the full year, Rod. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: That's what you're expecting for the full year. So, okay, great, thank you. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: Right. You got another question on commercial vehicle, what was your... Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yes. So can you quantify the commercial vehicle tailwind in terms of revenue in the quarter and the light vehicle diesel headwinds, just in terms of ballpark? Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: We can give you more numbers later on, but I'll tell you the magnitude. We saw low double-digit growth in that segment to give you an idea of how much of a tailwind it was, All right? So, that's on top of, we haven't seen growth now for three years or four years. So, I mean, it definitely was a nice tailwind. And then I think in the script, it was about 100 basis points of the outgrowth that we had, okay? Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thank you. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thanks, Rod. Operator : Your next question comes from Brian Johnson with Barclays. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Yes. Thank you. Couple of questions. First around diesel, I see the slide in terms of the back \u2013 the shift in the backlog from diesel to advanced gas. Can you give us a sense of, A, the manufacturing footprint for those substitute products, and, B, what that implies about the decrementals, incrementals, as you ramp down diesel, things like turbos and EGR and ramp up the gas equivalents? James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Yes, Brian, I can take a shot at that. So, for us, what it implies is, when customers, OEMs shift capacity from diesel to gasoline turbos, we're in a good place. Most of the capacity that we have is generic between a gas turbo and a diesel turbo. There are some unique things within the supply chain. But that's manageable. Likewise, on the EGR technology, those products migrate from a diesel EGR platform to gas, it's transferable. I would say the (38:41) is a little sticky that's really not that transferable, but that's a smaller one of the three and our VCT capacity ramp is well underway. So, for us, it's not a big deal, really, and we'll be able to move much quicker and much more flexibly than the OEMs. That's for sure, Brian. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Second question, if we look at the organic growth, impressive in Drivetrain for last several quarters, and take out that DCT launch, what is roughly the organic growth rate (39:12) markets that's in? And is there any one driver or is it everything from chains to clutches and so forth? James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: No, good question, Brian. It's the full spectrum in Drivetrain. So, let me give you a few examples or a few highlights. We clearly benefited from the truck mix in North America as an example. So transfer case technology is clearly in the Drivetrain segment. So. we're seeing growth there. We're seeing growth on the rotating electrics from the ex-Remy business across regionally. We're also gaining on our, what I would call our core transmission business, so as we move forward with friction plates and clutch packs, that's driving growth. And then DCT, particularly in China, where we're seeing growth, both with the domestics and the global guys. So, not one product, Brian. The good news for us, it's a balance across all of the Drivetrain products we're seeing growth and it's balanced regionally also. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And then can you give us a number of Drivetrain ex-DCT growth? James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: I don't know. We can probably get that for you later, Brian, (40:28) some calculations, All right. We'll get back to you, Brian. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Ryan Brinkman from JPMorgan. Unknown Speaker : Hi. This is (40:43) on behalf of Ryan Brinkman. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Good morning (40:47). Unknown Speaker : Good morning. There are some news articles recently that suggested that Continental and Delphi are considering combining their powertrain businesses. So, the articles are suggesting that Delphi and Continental would retain themselves (41:01) seemingly like growth here, electrification enabling technologies, while contributing to some sort of joint venture than more conventional products, the ones that would boost efficiencies for internal combustion engines. Now, you made clear a couple of times on many occasions that BorgWarner is definitely very strongly levered to all different types of powertrains and Drivetrains. My question just relates to the more conventional product areas, the ones that would solely boost the efficiency of internal combustion. So, do you think these are also growth areas? Like for example, like turbochargers' (41:41), so we know there's a lot of growth in electrification and hybrids. But what about the just conventional combustion optimization technology, so are these also growth areas? Thanks. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Yes. Yes, sure. It's a good thought. Let me give you a couple of comments. First of all, I want to be clear, I'm not going to make any comments regarding Conti or Delphi. That's not my place to do that. What I can do is talk about why we're excited about the growth of BorgWarner in our propulsion business. To specifically get to your quick question of do we see growth in combustion or internal combustion-related business? Yes, we do. We do. And when we published our data towards the end of last year in our Investor Day, the way to think about the combustion space is it's essentially a flat market as you look out the next five years to seven years. So, there's no real growth there in the market. BorgWarner expects to grow in mid-single-digit growth and that's primarily driven through content adds (42:42) and more increased penetration around turbochargers, EGR technology and variable valve timing technology. So we do see growth for BorgWarner in the mid-single digits for combustion-related products. That's why we're so excited about it. And we also leverage then on top of that the growth in hybrid products and electric products that makes for us, propulsion's absolutely a great business for us to be in. Unknown Speaker : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from John Murphy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. John Murphy - Bank of America- Merrill Lynch : Good morning, guys. You did a great job of kind of delineating through the revenue shift when you look at the diesel shift to gas in Europe. Just curious, as you look at the profit returns in that, are they similar or are they better on the gas side? And then also as we think way out in the future as Remy really grows, and our expectation takes off, will we see better profit returns from that content, or will it be similar? Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: So, John, this is Ron. The mix from diesel to gas are similar in margins. If you take a look at the manufacturing process and the components, as James said earlier, there's not a lot of investments to be made. You're going down the same production lines. Turbocharger still has a compressor wheel in it, for example. And the EGR products are very similar. So we don't see any kind of negative movement or positive movement either way quite frankly, in the mix from diesel to gasoline. John Murphy - Bank of America- Merrill Lynch : And then with electrification (44:16)? James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Yes. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: Yes, so electrification, as you know, we are shifting products in electrification, so we have experience already in what the cost looks like, what the sales prices are. And they go through a very rigorous review as far as approval, quite frankly, to make the capital investment. And they've all passed, which means that they line up with the current profile of return on invested capital in this company, and the margin profile is very similar. So again, we don't see any negative impact by the movement into that area. John Murphy - Bank of America- Merrill Lynch : And any early read on the GM Europe sale to PSA, what that means sort of positively, negatively or from an opportunistic standpoint for you guys? James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Yeah, not \u2013 we haven't really seen anything at this point, I would say, John. To be fair, we've historically done well with GM in Europe and we've done well with PSA in Europe. So our thought is it'll be okay for us, it will be good for us. But we haven't really seen anything materially emerge if that's the right way to think about it, John. But when it does, we feel pretty good about it. John Murphy - Bank of America- Merrill Lynch : Great. Thank you very much. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thank you, John. Operator : Your next question comes from Chris McNally from Evercore ISI. Chris McNally - Evercore ISI : Thank so much, guys. And really appreciate the extra detail on the call. Just a further question into \u2013 sorry to beat a dead horse on the Drivetrain growth. Since we saw the step up come in Q4 of last year, it's now been two really strong quarters. Is there also something within there on client mix? Meaning, you had some of the launches, I think it was on the Super-Duty in Q4. So could we expect as we sort of comp through that for a year, we can have roughly high growth in the Drivetrain? And then obviously once you comp through that in a couple of quarters, growth would come back down, more in line with Engine and Drivetrain growing at the same rate. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Yeah. I'll take a shot for you. I think, first of all, we feel very good about the traction we're getting in around Drivetrain growth. It's positive. It is pretty broad across a lot of different platforms and products. So, it's difficult to single out one platform or one type of thing. As I would say to you, I think the bigger move \u2013 the things that are going to move it around will be think of truck mix in North American definitely moves it because that's transportation (46:53) content. DCT in China will move or move it up and down fairly quickly. And the growth of ex Remy starter alternator business will also move it. So I hope that gives you some sense. We do expect strong growth, as we've said, in Drivetrain. It's going to continue, but it's a little bit difficult when you try and break it down by vehicle platform or get too granular because I think there's just a lot of broad growth regionally and across a lot of different customers and platforms now. But the punch line is, Drivetrain is a strong growth part of the company and which we feel very good about. Chris McNally - Evercore ISI : Okay. That's fantastic. And then is it fair to say at least when we look at the really strong growth in Q1 and we'll see in Q2, that probably the first half we are benefiting, at least, from one of those three truck mix is pretty strong, I mean, in the first half? And we'll see the builds in the second half, that's at least maybe one of the reasons you're just holding off. You want to see a little bit more of the production schedule for the second half of the year before you're able to make more of a comment on full year Drivetrain growth being at this level? James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Yeah, I think that's a fair perspective. And in addition to that, I would say China DCT also. Those are the two that are going to \u2013 another quarter is really going to help us get more clarity for the rest of the year for you guys. Truck mix and China DCT are the two that are going to move the most, and we want to just get a sense. Just to give you a little bit of additional color, part of the truck mix is relatively easy to track. China DCT, remember that a lot of these are in launch and start-up volume mode. So that's a little bit trickier to predict, if that helps you. That's kind of what drives a little bit of the uncertainty is how fast will the launch go, what's the vehicle adoption rates in China. But generally, as you can see in the first quarter, we're off to a good start and feeling good about it. Chris McNally - Evercore ISI : Got it. That's great. Thanks so much guys. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets. Jacob Hughes - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hi. This is Jacob Hughes on for Joe. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Hey Jacob. Jacob Hughes - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey, how are you doing? I think Great Wall Motor (49:17) announced they'd start manufacturing dual-clutch transmissions in April. Is that a change versus prior? Or are they just doing the final assembly? Or what's the impact there? James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Well, they've talked obviously publicly about building dual-clutch transmissions in China for themselves. So they've talked about that publicly, and I've talked about that ramp. At this stage, I'm not really in a good position to give you clarity and detail on what that means for BorgWarner. Jacob Hughes - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: But I \u2013 yeah, I can confirm that \u2013 as they've already confirmed that they're moving towards DCT. And frankly speaking, it's not a surprise. As I put in my comments this morning, China (50:05) has launched its DCT with BorgWarner content. And we're seeing more acceleration and adoption of DCT in China. So that's what I can tell you at this point. Jacob Hughes - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. And then on diesel, are you seeing more pricing pressure on legacy diesel content as you bid for electrical content with those same customers? James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: I would say, in general, the pricing environment is fairly consistent with historical levels. So there is generally, as you know, that pressure exists in the market. We have a \u2013 historically, we've done about 1.5% to 2% price down. That's a little better than the industry based on our strong market position. And we think that will continue on. Jacob Hughes - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Thank you. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from David Kelley with Jefferies. David L. Kelley - Jefferies LLC : Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a quick one on the organic growth in the Engine business and despite the European diesel mix shift here. You mentioned strength kind of across the board in China. Just maybe wondering if you could talk about turbocharger penetration in China and maybe North America as well. Are you seeing any accelerated adoption there in either market? And how it compares maybe to your expectations going into the year so far? James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Yeah, David, good thought. I think in general, it's playing out pretty much as we had anticipated in terms of both China and North America for turbo penetration numbers. I don't have the number in front of me. Maybe we can get back to you, David. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: Penetration in China is 35%. North America is 20%. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Okay. But I would say it's pretty much in line, David. And that's obviously what's driving good growth for us in those two regions. But no acceleration or deceleration in terms of adoption rate from what we had anticipated at the beginning of the year, if that's helpful for you. David L. Kelley - Jefferies LLC : Okay, great. Thank you. Very helpful. And then kind of switching gears here, it'd be great to get some commentary on the Autotech Ventures investment, maybe kind of the thought process behind the move, how you plan on leveraging the investment, and is there any specific segments or high-level secular opportunities you're actively looking for that may be that investment might help connect you to? James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Yeah. No, thanks for bringing that up, David. It's \u2013 yeah, it's really exciting for us. What it fundamentally has done for us is given us a very, frankly, effective and efficient way to get access to a lot of start-up business and operations focused on ground transportation. So this is not a highly broad-reaching area for ground transportation. So it's focused in our space. And it basically gets access to start-ups in \u2013 around the world. So, it's not just a \"Silicon Valley Initiative\". We see start-up ideas from Tel Aviv. We see them from Europe. We see them \u2013 and we have the ability to engage with these start-ups in very different ways. Key to us, though, is getting access to some of those start-up technologies that can help our business, could be disruptive to our business, and making sure that we don't ever get surprised with some new inventions that are coming out of there that we're not part of. We want to get in on the front end of it. So, yeah, it's pretty exciting, it's pretty early for us. But we're really, really encouraged by both the amount of start-ups that are coming through and the relevance to our propulsion space. So there'll be a lot more to come on this, David, but it's very exciting and we're off to a good start with it. David L. Kelley - Jefferies LLC : All right, great. I really appreciate the color. Thanks for taking my questions, guys. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thanks. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thank you, David. Operator : Your next question comes from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey, everybody. So the first question is in reference to Continental's Capital Markets kind of powertrain day, a couple of days ago. They had disclosed that they were loss-making in their EV efforts, and perhaps temporarily so as they're kind of ramping up. I'm just wondering, is that \u2013 as \u2013 they think they're working on their last-generation internal combustion engine. I don't know if you agree with that. But can you, at least, if you isolate the EV efforts for passenger car propulsion \u2013 I'm excluding the core business of Remy, let's say, that you acquired, is it reasonable to assume that as you kind of invest and build that up, at least temporarily, there's some losses that won't be covered by revenue for a number of years before the payoff comes? James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Yeah, Adam, let me take a shot at that for you. We don't see that is the quick punch line. We're not \u2013 and there's a couple of data points here. We've been invested into hybrids and electrics for a number of years. And if you think about it, our R&D percentage has kind of trended around that 4% through that period. So that's one indicator. And if you look at our after-tax ROIC numbers over that period, they're not coming materially down. They're bouncing around that 15% area. And as we look today at the products that we're shipping today in boxes to customers, single-speed transmissions and other products, those are all at the BorgWarner-type levels. So we are not experiencing any headwinds as we migrate the portfolio to more hybrids and more electrics for the company (55:35). We're not seeing that at all. Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks, James. And just as a follow-up, what is your working assumption of when the cost of owning an EV becomes lower than owning an internal combustion engine? James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: You asking for the when, Adam, what year or what... Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah. Well, I mean, like roughly. And I know you can't pinpoint a year. But do you have a working assumption of when your customers \u2013 or the end customer is going to find an EV to be more affordable to own than an internal combustion engine? James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Yeah, I would say this way, Adam. We have \u2013 we \u2013 for sure, we model out the various propulsion architectures over time and look at those kind of variables. We don't have a pinpoint number that we look at. What we look at is what do we see as the future of a hybrid propulsion system costing and what are the drivers behind that, same with the pure EV. But, candidly speaking, we're not in the game of deciding the when and the what. We're going to participate across all three architectures and be well positioned there. So for us, it's not a big, big driver either way, what that mix is between hybrid and electric and combustion products. Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: That's it (56:48) James. Thank you. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thank you. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thanks, Adam. Operator : Your next question comes from Richard Kwas from Wells Fargo Securities. Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning, gentlemen. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: Good morning, Rich. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Hey, Rich. Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Just a few quick follow-ups, hopefully. So, Ron, CV assumption for the year, my recollection was within the initial guidance, it was kind of flat. Is that revised higher at this point? I would assume it had. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: Rich, you're right. First of all, the guidance was flat. And I would say the guide at this point \u2013 we had a good quarter, but at this point, the guide still is flat, Rich. This market's fooled us in the past and we got to see \u2013 like James said earlier, we got to see another quarter of continued improvement before we get really excited about it. Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And what's China heavy truck for you now, as a percentage of the commercial vehicle, your commercial vehicle business? James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: I'd say about 15% or 20% for the total CV business, Rich. Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. All right, great. And then \u2013 also within the guidance is the diesel penetration closer to down 200 basis points for the year? Is that what's embedded? I know you've said 100 to 200 basis points annually over the next few years, but are you embedding a more slightly conservative outlook? James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Yeah. I would say as we came in 100 to 200 basis points, we're probably at 300 to 400 basis points now, Rich, is what we're thinking. Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And then last one just longer term on EGR, my recollection was gas EGR had a pretty low penetration, single-digits, but my numbers are stale going back a few years ago. Where are you now or at least the industry is now with regards to adoption of EGR and gas? James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Yeah, your recollection was right, Rich, it's \u2013 it's single-digit-type numbers, but we're finding it's starting to climb. So we're starting to see more quotes, more interest, and more applications. And so, I would say, it's pretty much in line with what we were at six months ago. And I would tell you the perspective is we feel good about win rates in that space. That's the other area I'm feeling pretty good about. So it's a climb up, Rich, from single-digits and it's just going on keep on climbing up over the period. Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Is there a number by 2019 that we should think about as the.... James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: We can get that for you, Rich. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: (59:07). Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. That's fine. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: (58:09) number. Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : All right, we'll take it offline. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: We look at that. Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Yeah. Thanks so much. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: All right, thanks, Rich. Operator : We have time for one final question. And that question comes from David Leiker with Baird. Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. This is Joe Vruwink for David. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: Good morning, Joe. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Hey, Joe. Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Morning. Just one question, one thing we hear a lot \u2013 and I think you guys have said in the past as well as when an automaker picks up the phone and is thinking about electrifying the powertrain, that first call is typically to the mechanical component supplier. And the question is, can you handle the electrical piece with the mechanical? It's not the inverse? Do you agree with that sentiment? And is that still accurate? It would seem like your current competitors that ultimately \u2013 even though you're typically butting up against five and six good suppliers. It would seem like that narrows even a bit more, because obviously the companies that can handle both are certainly fewer. Just your thoughts on both of those? James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Yeah. I'll take a shot at that for you, Joe. I think the first and most important thing that's on the OEM's mind is to call the guy that understands the propulsion system and all that comes with that, the interface between engine and transmission and the vehicle. And I think it's fair to say a lot of that resident knowledge, expertise generally as a \u2013 in general, will start or lead with the mechanical \u2013 electromechanical aspects, but they absolutely want somebody to understand that, the electromechanical, the system, the power electronics, and the motor. And that makes us one of a few \u2013 a small group that can offer them that support and that capability. And the last point I would make, Joe, that's really important is they want to make that call whether it's a combustion propulsion, a hybrid, or a pure EV propulsion, because they want that partner to help determine with them what propulsion mix they should be working forward with (61:21). And that's definitely BorgWarner in our perspective over the last couple of years. Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Great. Thank you. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thanks, Joe. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thanks, Joe. Patrick Nolan - BorgWarner, Inc.: With that, I'd like to thank you all for your questions today and thank you for participating. Sharon, you can close the call. Operator : That does conclude the BorgWarner 2017 first quarter results conference call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Sharon and I will be your conference facilitator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BorgWarner 2017 Second Quarter Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. I would now like to turn the call over to Patrick Nolan, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Nolan, you may begin your conference. Patrick Nolan - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thank you, Sharon. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We issued our earnings release at 6 :30 AM Eastern Time. It's posted on our website, borgwarner.com, on our homepage and on our Investor Relations homepage. The replay of today's call will be available through August 10th. The dial-in number for that call is 855-859-2056, and the conference ID is 49070364, or you can listen to the replay on our website. With regard to our Investor Relations calendar, we'll be attending several conferences between now and our next earnings release. Please see the Events section of our Investor Relations homepage for a full list. I did, however, want to highlight of our upcoming Investor Day on August 7th. This will take place at the New York Stock Exchange and will feature presentations by James Verrier, our President and CEO; Ron Hundzinski, our Executive Vice President and CFO; as well as Christopher Thomas, our Chief Technology Officer. The registration deadline is the close of business tomorrow, so please contact me for registration details if you'd like to attend. Before we begin today's call, I need to inform you that during this call, we may make forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties as detailed in our 10-K. Our actual results may differ significantly from the matters discussed today. Also during today's presentation, we will highlight certain non-GAAP measures in order to provide a clear picture of how the core business performed as well as provide comparison with prior periods. When you hear say on a comparable basis, that means excluding the impact of FX, net M&A and other non-comparable items. When you hear say on a reported basis, that means U.S. GAAP. Now, on to today's call. First, James Verrier, our President and CEO, will comment on the industry, provide a high-level overview of our Q2 results as well as discuss some of our recent product wins. Then Ron Hundzinski, our CFO, will discuss the details of our results as well as our guidance. Please note that we posted an earnings call presentation to the IR page of our website. You'll find the link in the Events and Presentations section beneath the notice for this call. We encourage you to follow on during our discussion. With that, I'll turn it over to James. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thank you, Patrick, and good day to everybody. Thanks for joining the call. Ron and I are obviously very pleased today to be able to share our results from Q2 2017, and we'll obviously update you on our progress towards delivering our targets for 2017. I'd like to start, if I can, by sharing a few thoughts on the macro environment in the industry. For those of you following along on the slideshow, this will be slide number 7. So what we've seen really is, we do still recognize some instability in many aspects from a macro perspective. But I would say, in general, the outlook for the auto industry is, I would say, in line or modestly weaker than our expectations going into the quarter. So let me break that down a little bit. Global light vehicle production flattish in Q2 with production down about 1.5% for our adjusted geographic exposure. We saw European light vehicle production declining approximately 4%, which actually was slightly better than our expectations as we headed into the quarter. China light vehicle production was down about 1%, slightly weaker than our expectations going into the quarter. And North America light vehicle industry production declined about 3% against slightly weaker than our expectations going into the quarter. If I give a little bit of an outlook for the market as we see the rest of this year playing out, as usual, we are closely aligned with IHS. So we see light vehicle production in China at about 1% growth, we see Europe up around 2%, and we see North American production down a little over 2%. If you weigh that for that global production for our geographic exposure, that means growth of less than 1% for us. A word on commercial vehicle. We see the outlook for Europe and China continuing to improve. I would say that we have seen expectations for North America growth moderate a little. Just to share a few thoughts on what we're probably paying a lot of attention to. I would say, obviously where we are in the North American cycle is pretty clear in our minds. We do see schedules have weakened a little bit, although I would describe it as pretty modestly, and we continued to watch and monitor inventory levels. Clearly for us diesel/gas mix is important in Europe, and we continue to see that shift occurring during Q2. So what we see is, diesel share declined approximately 390 bps year-over-year in Q2, and we expect diesel/gas mix to continue through the end of the decade shifting. The good news out from a BorgWarner perspective is, we continue to offset that headwind. China, we still look forward to modest growth in the year 2017. But more importantly, from a BorgWarner perspective, that growth above that market continues to be very strong, driven by increase in share and content per vehicle. So all of this said, if you wrap it altogether, we remain very confident in our outgrowth of the market in 2017 based on the strong demand for our products. Let me spend a moment on regulatory and technology outlook. The strong drive for fuel economy and emissions regulations does not slowdown at all. We continue to see a pretty hard pace of movement there, and it's all around advanced propulsion technology. We see activity increasing particularly in gas engine technology, hybrid technology and EV technology and, rest assured, we're very busy in those fields with all of our customers around the world. And we see the transition to electrification continues. Our Q2 new business bookings continue to show additional awards with a wide variety of customers, regions and propulsion systems. And rather than dwell on that too much today, what we plan to do is share a lot more of that detail with you at the upcoming Investor Day, that Pat referred to, on August 7th. Let me now move to slide 8 and talk a little bit about a financial recap. And clearly, Ron will take you through a lot more detail than I will, but let me just start out by talking about our Q2. I was very, very pleased with our Q2 performance. Our growth exceeded the high end of our guidance, and our operating performance was very much in line with our expectations. $2.4 billion of sales, that's representative of 7.8% organic growth when we exclude FX and Remy. And that compares to our light vehicle and market exposure, down about 1.5%. So, a very, very strong top-line performance. Regionally, it was pretty much as we had expected from a BorgWarner point of view with strong growth in China, driven primarily by DCT, and we grew very well in North America both through new business and mix. Europe for us was flattish, which is strong performance when you look to the industry production declines. And this light vehicle growth was supplemented by positive revenue trends in commercial vehicle off-road. That led us to a strong EPS performance of $0.96 when we exclude non-comparable items and an impressive operating margin of 12.5%. If I look at it a little deeper by segment, the highlight for me was, I was really excited to see the growth across all of our products. So, from an engine perspective, $1.4 billion was our sales, which represents 4.5% organic growth. Some of the highlights, we did see very strong growth in timing systems and thermal products. And again, despite the changes to the diesel/gas mix shift, we've seen top-line growth in our engine business. Drivetrain sales came in at $921 million, which is up 13.9% organically. This was driven by strong all-wheel drive, DCT and transmission sales in North America, China, and Europe. Let me move forward and talk a little bit about the outlook for 2017. I'm pleased to say we're increasing our revenue and our earnings forecast for 2017. We now expect our organic growth to be between 6.5% to 7.5% year-over-year versus our prior guidance of 3.5% to 6%. Again, this compares to the market growing less than 1%. Our consolidated operating income margin is expected to expand 30 basis points to 40 basis points, and our EPS guidance range is now at $3.65 per diluted share to $3.70 per diluted share, which is up from $3.50 per diluted share to $3.60 per diluted share previously. If we can turn to slide 9 for those of you who following along, I'll just highlight a couple of key growth areas. I just thought it would be worthwhile spending a moment to focus on two of the product announcements that we've got there. The dual-clutch and control modules for Great Wall Motors is a really important one for us, and this business is now ramping nicely. I had the pleasure to be in China just a couple of weeks ago to see this in action, and I was really impressed to see the move forward on DCT in China. The 48-volt eBooster, critical technology launch for us with Daimler on their 3.0-liter gasoline engine, and this is a very important technology for hybrid vehicles. And one of the things that's important about this, it's a great example of BorgWarner at its best. So we've got our leading-edge turbocharger technology for integrating our power electronics knowhow, so we can offer Daimler a real true systems solution. These are just two examples. I could go on and on, and we won't. Again, we'll share more with you at Investor Day. But the message really for us is, our balanced approach is working. We continue to see very good win rates across all types of propulsion systems, combustion, hybrid and electric. On slide 10, let me just recap or share a few highlights on our recent announcement on the acquisition of Sevcon. This is a really important move for us. Sevcon is a global player in electrification technologies, including power electronics. And I really believe this acquisition supports our existing strategy to supply leading technology for all types of propulsion systems; combustion, hybrid and electric. And we consider the power electronics design and development knowhow to be a core expertise, and we believe that Sevcon complements BorgWarner's existing or power electronics capabilities. Also very importantly for us, we believe the acceleration of our power electronics capabilities strengthens our position to satisfy the customers by providing more electrified systems that they are sourcing both near- and long-term. So more to come on this at a later date. We do expect the enterprise value at about $200 million. And we anticipate closing this in Q4. More to come on that later. So before I hand over to Ron, let me just kind of summarize from my perspective. Q2 is a very good quarter for us. We exceeded our expectations for both top-line growth, and operating performance is in line with our expectation. And given our strong first half performance, we feel comfortable about increasing our revenue and EPS guidance for the year despite a modestly weaker industry production outlook. We absolutely believe that the company is positioned to deliver mid-to-high single digit growth over the long-term, and I look forward to meeting with many of you in \u2013 August 7 in New York, where we can share more details with you. And with that, let me turn the call over to Ron. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. Before I review the financial details, I would like to provide you some of the highlights as I've seen for the quarter. First, it was another strong quarter, actually it was a great quarter. Second, operating performance was as we expected. And finally, given the strong first half of the year performance, we are confident in raising our full year guidance. Now as Pat mentioned, I will be referring to the supplemental financial slide deck, which is posted on our IR website. I do encourage you to follow along. Let's turn to slide 12. On a reported basis, sales were up 2.6%. On a comparable basis, our organic sales was up 7.8%. This was approximately 130 basis points ahead of the high-end of our guidance. Our weighted average light vehicle industry production was down more than 1%. So we saw also a 25% growth in China, against a production market that was down about 1%. Commercial vehicle was of benefit as well, contributing more than 100 basis points. The primary headwinds versus our expectations were diesel/gas mix in Western Europe and market share loss by our largest Korean customer in China and North America markets. Before I move to the operating profit, I would like to discuss our gross profit and SG&A line items. Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 21.5% in the quarter, up 20 basis points from a year ago. SG&A was 9% of sales. R&D spending, which is included in SG&A, was 4.4% of sales. SG&A was up 30 basis points from a year ago, primarily driven by R&D and the timing of stock-based compensation. Now let's look at the year-over-year comparison for operating income, which can be found on slide 13. Q2 operating profit was $300 million or 12.5% of sales compared to $287 million in Q2 of 2016, which was 12.3% of sales, resulting in a 20 basis point improvement. On an organic basis, operating income was up $18 million on $176 million of higher sales. That give us an incremental margin of 10% in the quarter and in line with our expectations. As you look further down the income statement, equity and affiliate earnings was about $14 million in the quarter, up $4 million from last year. Interest expense and finance charges were $18 million in the quarter, down about $3 million from last year due to lower debt levels. Excluding the $10 million one-time favorable tax adjustment, the provision for income taxes was $86 million for an effective tax rate of 29% for the quarter. Net earnings attributable to non-controlling interest was about $9 million, down $2 million from the second quarter of 2016. This line item reflects our minority partner share in the earnings and performance of our Korean and Chinese consolidated joint ventures. Earnings per share on a reported basis was $1 per diluted share. On a comparable basis, net earnings were $0.96 per diluted share. Now let's take a closer look at our operating segments in the quarter beginning on slide 14. Reported Engine segment net sales were $1.482 billion in the quarter. Sales growth for the Engine segment on a comparable basis was 4.5% as demand for our light vehicle OEM products was supplemented, again, by growth in our commercial vehicle business. Adjusted EBIT was $244 million for the Engine segment or 16.5% of sales. On a comparable basis, the Engine segment's adjusted EBIT was up $12 million on $65 million of sales for an incremental margin of 18%. Turning to slide 15 and starting from the right. Drivetrain segment net sales were $921 million in the quarter. This includes the reduction of $77 million of sales from the divestiture of the Remy light vehicle aftermarket. Sales growth for Drivetrain segment on a comparable basis was up 13.8%, primarily due to higher all-wheel drive transmission components and strong DCT growth in China. Adjusted EBIT was $110 million for the Drivetrain segment or 11.9% of sales. On a comparable basis, the Drivetrain segment's adjusted EBIT was up $16 million on $133 million of higher sales for an incremental margin of 14%. I'd like to take a moment to discuss incremental margins a bit more. Our total company incremental margin for Q2 was 10%, which is below our long-term goal of mid-teens, but was slightly improved from our quarter one performance. In order to better understand this, there are a few items we should highlight. First, segment incremental margins. The Engine segment incremental margins were 18%, which is good performance. We were particularly happy with the performance here as we continue to have operational issues in our emissions business. Our Drivetrain segment incremental margins were 14%, which was up from 13% in Q1 and 11% in Q4, strong performance as we continue to ramp launching programs in this business. As a result, the segment incremental margins were 15%. So, corporate costs were basically flat sequentially and are expected to moderate in the third and fourth quarters, but was up about $9 million year-over-year. The drivers of this increase continue to be the timing of additional stock-based compensation cost and various advisory fees for tax and legal planning. These items unfavorably impacted incremental margins by approximately 500 basis points in the quarter. Now, let's take a look at our balance sheet and cash flow. We generated $399 million of net cash from operating activities in the first half of the year, up $37 million from the first half of 2016. Capital spending was $254 million year-to-date, up $20 million from a year ago. Free cash flow, which we define as net cash from operating activities less net capital spending, was $145 million, up $17 million from 2016. Looking at the balance sheet itself, balance sheet debt was flat and cash decreased by $57 million compared with the end of 2016. The $57 million increase in net debt was primarily due to return of capital activities. Our net debt to net capital ratio was 33.2% at the end of Q2, down slightly from 35% at the end of 2016. Net debt to EBITDA at the end of the quarter was 1.16 times. Now, let's discuss our 2017 guidance, which we have increased. So let's start with our sales growth guidance for the full year on slide 17. Backlog, pricing and market-related growth are expected to drive 6.5% to 7.5% organic sales growth. Currency is expected to reduce sales by $100 million. The first half backlog was very strong, and this amount is flowing through in our increased guidance. So, I'd like to note a few items which are impacting our second half organic growth relative to our first half as I suspect many of you will ask questions on this. So, first, North America mix changes from the key North American programs, some of which are changeover-related or having modernization issues on us in the second half. Diesel production relative to sales are also having an impact to us in the second half. Continued volume reduction from our largest South Korean customer in China and North America, and North America commercial vehicle modernization from the first half are all the items that we see in the second half of our guide. Many of these items are timing related when you look at the first half and second half. Overall, 6.5% to 7.5% organic growth for the year is very strong, given the industry backdrop and stronger than our expectations going into the year. Next, I'll walk our operating income on slide 18. From a performance perspective, we continue to expect mid-teens incremental margins on our sales growth. Included in this are some headwinds from corporate costs, and we continue to expect an inflationary environment and compliance cost. Our consolidated operating income margin is expected to expand by 30 basis points to 40 basis points. To finish up the full year guidance, please turn to slide 19. EPS range is now $3.65 per diluted share to $3.70 per diluted share. The $0.12 increase is driven by our sales guide increase. Free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx, is expected to be $450 million to $500 million. Capital spending, including tooling, is expected to be in the range of $500 million to $550 million, which is up slightly to support several program lists basically that increased earnings and cash flows being offset by the increase in CapEx and cash flow. Given our announcement of Sevcon, acquisition of our share repurchase program will be about $100 million in 2017. R&D spending as a percentage of sales is expected to be 4% in 2017. The tax rate is expected to be 29%. Our assumption for the dollar to euro exchange rate has been adjusted to $1.10 from $1.05. As a reminder, every $0.01 change in the dollar-to-euro exchange rate equals about $30 million to $35 million. I'm aware that the exchange rate is about $1.16, but $1.10 is an average rate for the year. Our third quarter guidance is starting on slide 21. First, sales. Note that Remy light vehicle aftermarket sales divested are $68 million. So, starting at a base of $2.146 billion, net new business, pricing and market-related growth are expected to drive organic sales growth from about 3% to 6%. Currency is expected to reduce sales growth by about $36 million. Therefore, 2017 Q3 sales is expected to be $2.2 billion at the midpoint. From an EPS perspective, on slide 22, we expect $0.03 to $0.06 per share from backlog, foreign currencies are expected to lower earnings by about $0.02 a share in the quarter. Below the operating income line items are expected to contribute $0.05 per share from lower share count and a lower tax rate. On a consolidated basis, we expect earnings of $0.84 to $0.87 per share. So, let me summarize the quarter. It was a strong second quarter and the first half for the year as well. Organic sales growth was nearly 8%, despite declining industry volume. Incremental margins improved slightly sequentially and then as we expected. We anticipate this to improve in the second half of the year. As we look at 2017 and beyond, we continue to drive intensity around new product development and support it with acquisitions to participate in the impending electrification trend. There is no question that this will drive growth for many years. And with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Pat. Patrick Nolan - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thank you, Ron. Sharon, we're ready for questions. Operator : Your first question comes from Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets. Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks. Good morning, everyone, and congrats on the quarter. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Good morning, Joe. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: Good morning, Joe. Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC : I guess, I just wanted to \u2013 the one thing which I guess has changed a little bit was margin expansion for the year a little bit less, it looks like there might be \u2013 and some of the FX flow through, is that some of the transaction along with the translation impact or is there something else going on there? Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: That's correct. What happens with FX even though there is a benefit from our prior guide, we only pull about $0.12 on the dollar, 12% incremental versus operating incremental of mid-teens. So, there tends to be a drag on us on margins going forward from the incremental margins. Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Right. Right. Right. And then, you clearly saw point into the margin expansion for the rest of the year. It looks like based on your guidance a little bit more fourth quarter than the third quarter, so I was wondering what \u2013 is that just mostly volume that's driving that? I mean, and also by segment, maybe you could provide a little bit more color, because I think you've got some tougher incremental margin comps in Engine, but some easier ones in Drivetrain, so I just wanted to get a little more of the picture there? Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: Yeah, Joe, a lot of parts moving. So, first of all, your question about the fourth quarter is correct, more margin expansion in the fourth. One item, I keep talking about the corporate cost, we love to have corporate cost. And we may even be lower than the prior year in corporate cost. So we get the full benefit of the operating segment's contribution margin. So that would be more of an uplift in the absolute margin for us in the fourth quarter. Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC : You're talking about the fourth quarter corporate costs? Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: Yeah, yeah. This is mostly... Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Of last year. Right. Okay. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: Yes, it's most in the fourth quarter. And then also we get a little bit of volume that the DCT plant's really starting to hum along. So once that starts coming along, that might get a little higher incremental for us as well, which is in the Drivetrain segment. So, a combination of few items. Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Thanks a lot. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thank you, Joe. Operator : Your next question comes from Rod Lache from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning, everybody. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Hi, Rod. How are you? Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: A couple of things, just \u2013 maybe you could just talk about on the guidance for the year. Noticed that the midpoint of your backlog guidance is $715 million, and you've done about two-thirds of that in the first half. And the backlog is only \u2013 the assumption is only $100 million to $150 million in Q3. Is there some conservatism that you're baking into that number or are you including, for example, I think, a significant amount of the backlog right now that's being driven by China? Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: So, Rod, it's Ron. You're right. The original guidance was \u2013 I'm going to round numbers a little bit on you. It was $0.5 billion \u2013 $500 million, and now the organic guide implies about $715 million, you're right. So, it's about $200 million increase. What we're seeing in the second half? I listed a bunch of items in there. We're seeing some that wasn't anticipated actually until just recently. One of our largest Korean customers is having a difficult time, especially in the back half of the year in China and North America. We're anticipating that commercial vehicle is going to moderate as well. We also have a changeover that's in North America in one of our largest customers' platforms that they've announced quite frankly yesterday, that's also going to be a little bit of a headwind for us. So we're seeing a few things in the back half of the year that are headwinds. But if you really go back to our original guidance, that guidance include about $100 million per quarter, roughly $125 million, of backlog. So, we haven't adjusted that, right, at the end of the day. So, it's still outgrowth and we haven't really adjusted from the original guidance. I think you got to look at the full year organic growth is how you got to look at it, not the cadence by first half, second half. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: I understand, but maybe just to clarify, when you talk about these headwinds from diesel or a crane customer whatever, do you put that into the market growth in bucket or do you put that as a net against your backlog bucket? Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: That would net out of \u2013 a little bit in market, but we probably net it out of the backlog number. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Yeah. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: For Korea, there were some launches we anticipated, and was hard to bifurcate between the two buckets. We're just kind of splitting hairs here. So we can get back with you on that, Rod. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And just secondly, the margin improvement in Drivetrain. As I recall, there were two factors that were a pretty big drag on Drivetrain; one was the DCT plant in China that was ramping, and you also were, I think, shifting some capacity to Eastern Europe. Are those now behind you, and how should we be thinking about the margin targets for Drivetrain and what kind of timeframe should we be thinking? James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Yeah, Rod, this is James. In terms of your couple of points on the activity around Drivetrain, the transition into Eastern Europe is kind of done and behind us, that's all done up. And the ramp in China for DCT is, it really starts to move forward a lot more in the second half of this year or certainly in the fourth quarter, and we'll really see more of that benefit even more so as we go into 2018. So I think, they're both largely behind us now, Rod, and we've got forward momentum. Where that takes the Drivetrain margin for the longer-term? I tend to think of it is, we're just going to continue at the mid-teen incremental type of a rate in Drivetrain, and that will just continue to follow-up, which is we deliver on that volume. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thanks, Rod. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thank you, Rod. Operator : Your next question comes from David Leiker with Baird. David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Good morning. How are you doing? James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Morning, David. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: Good, David. David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: I guess, two things, just on the diesel/gas, open Pandora's box here. Now to the extent that diesel declines and, yeah, you're seeing some \u2013 I mean, we talk to people, I'm sure you talk to people, who say, vehicles are going to banned, what's going to happen. The reality though is, this gas/diesel shift can't happen quickly, because the capacity is not there, is it, to replace diesel engines with gas engines in the next two years? James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: So, yeah, let me give a bit of color on that, David. Obviously what we've seen this year is that acceleration obviously has continued. It was 400 \u2013 close to 400 bps in the quarter. And we do see that shift moving on. There is some kind of \u2013 to your point, some natural limit of timing of how this plays out. We can't just convert everything over from diesel to gas. There are capacity constraints, et cetera, et cetera. I think, the bigger important issue is so as they shift from diesel to gas, what are they doing? And they're using that... David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Right. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: ...in many cases as an opportunity to put \u2013 to accelerate some of the advanced gasoline engine program timing. They're looking to pull forward some of the hybrid program timing, and that's a benefit to BorgWarner, because we're going to be content additive on those products versus diesel. So that's what we're seeing play out. In the short run, it's a little bit of noise, and you see we've more than overcome that again in the second quarter. And on a go-forward basis, it's certainly neutral to positive for BorgWarner. David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Do your customers in their Engine plants have the ability to switch over? Let's say there's an Engine plant that's got four diesel lines? Can they shift one line at a time? Or do they have to do the whole plant at a time? How does this \u2013 strategically how does that play out? James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Yes. I think probably each one is somewhat different to be open, David, but I think obviously the first call is utilization of existing gas capacity. And they have to get that filled up and utilize that. And then, it just gets into the detail of what individual customer has in terms of capacity utilization. But to go invest in a brand-new engine gasoline line obviously is a pretty hefty lead time on that type of move, which is I think what you're inferring. So that the play right now is leverage and utilize fully the gas capacity. And then beyond that, obviously that's a longer \u2013 a little bit of a longer lead time for them. David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: And the, the last item here is, if you look at \u2013 as your customers do \u2013 that they're probably going to take down the lower efficiency diesel and shift them over to higher efficiency gas. And as they do that transition to a fully-loaded downsize turbocharged DDI, EGR engine, how does your content differ between those two? James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Yeah. David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Not just current Engine business, but what they would replace it with? James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Yeah. A couple of thoughts, Dave, just \u2013 I think, you're right, to clarify. So where the acceleration is obviously on the diesel decline is in the smaller engines. In terms of the bigger engines, two-liter and above, we've not seeing such a dramatic shift. But clearly, you're right, what they're doing with those smaller engines \u2013 what they're going to look to do is to make those advanced as possible. So that's more variable about timing, that's putting gasoline EGR technology on those vehicles, more advanced turbos. That's going to be net positive for BorgWarner, because we're going to put more content on those than smaller diesels that we have today. David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay, great. Thanks for your time. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thanks, David. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thanks, David. Operator : Your next question comes from Brett Hoselton with KeyBanc. Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Good morning. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Good morning. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: Hey, Brett. Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: You talked about the organic revenue growth and kind of the cadence through 2017. I'm wondering how do we think \u2013 if we're exiting 2017 maybe at a little slower pace, how do we think about 2018? James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Yeah. The way I would think about it, Brett \u2013 and again, we'll talk a little more about this in New York in a couple of weeks. But as you can see even in the first two quarters, there's a little bit of a spread there, right, in terms of our organic growth. And then, that's also a little different in the backup. What I would suggest you do is think of it as the full year of 2017 is a good basis way to think of it, because there is some little bit of volatility and noise through the quarters. So if you just take the 7% organic growth, which is the midpoint of our new guide, on a full year basis, that's how I would be thinking of it in terms of a launch into 2018 and beyond. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: I'd like to add something, James. And then the reason, Brett, is unlike last year where our backlog was concentrated on maybe four, five heavy launches. This year it's more dispersed. It's a wider width of launches that are going on. And that breadth is \u2013 it's hard to predict by the cadence exactly through the quarter, and it was more front-end loaded. So the two years are different years in backlogs. But James is right, I think you got to look at the full year as you go into 2018, what we did for 2017. Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: And as far as incremental margins into 2018, is there anything that you think of that may be a significant tailwind or headwind, FX, that sort of thing? Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: One area is the emissions business. It's been a continue issue for us, it's not performing well. And we're going to have to fix that. That's one that comes very quick to mind is that business. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: But I would \u2013 Brett, I wouldn't be thinking much different to admit. We don't see anything coming off our mid-teen incremental margin approach at all as we go into 2018. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: Yeah. You're right there. Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thank you, gentlemen. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thank you. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thanks, Brett. Operator : Your next question comes from John Murphy with Bank of America. John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Good morning, guys. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Hi, John. John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Just a quick question. I mean, obviously the schedules in the quarter maybe deteriorated a little bit, I mean, and there's lot of concern about what's going to happen with the cycle in the U.S. and potential risk in China. As you react to these changes, just curious if you can remind us what sort of leverage you have to pull through to really react? But also, very importantly, as we're seeing mix shift away from cars and towards crossovers, what kind of benefit is that highlighting to you? Because it seems like you maybe disconnecting more from these aggregate schedules than you have been in the past few years, and this mix might be a huge benefit, all up sort of that 25% growth in China against the negative 1% market, it seems like you're really disconnecting? James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: John, if you think \u2013 the two markets you're referring to China and North America, very candidly what it means for us right now, if we see moderations in shift and schedule, we just slow our growth a little. And that's kind of an important thing for us. It's not like we're going into reduction modes. So we've been running mid-teen growth in China. So if there's a little bit of a softening there, you can run 10%-ish type growth, and we've been outperforming in North America too. So, it's not that we're not paying attention, John, because we are, and we'll tweak as we need to locally at schedule levels and plant levels. But fundamentally for the company, we're in growth mode in North America, we're in growth mode in China. We got to be thoughtful about it, but that's kind of how we're outpricing as a company in 2017 and likely into 2018 as well, John. John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : I'm sorry. But also the mix change, I mean, it seems like you're kind of sloughing the stuff of, because mix seems to be improving and your backlog is coming through. I'm just curious that the things which you're getting from mix... James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Yeah. Sorry, John, I missed that one. Net-net, we're a little bit beneficial with truck mix in North America. Vehicle mix in China is less noise for us. But North America, we get a slight benefit with truck mix, but it's not huge. Because generally our content is pretty equal across cars and trucks. We just get the added benefit of transfer case technology going on to the trucks, which kind of gives us a bit of a lift there. But it's not \u2013 to your point, John, it's not moving the needle dramatically for us, which is a good thing for us. John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, great. Thank you. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thank you, John. Operator : Your next question comes from Colin Langan with UBS. Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Can you give us any color on your commercial traffic merger? I know, in the past, there was almost 10% of sales. Is it still substantial today and is that recovery a nice underlying help to results here, given it seems like those commercial on-off highway markets have improved? James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Yeah, Colin, this is James. It's about 12% of revenue. For us, it's a total company for 2017. And it's split pretty equally between on-road and off-road is the way to think of this. We have about a third North America, a third Europe, and then the other third is split between China and South America. And as I've said in my comments earlier, Colin, what we've seen is, it's been a tailwind for us, particularly in China and in Europe. I'd say, we got some benefit in the first half from North America, but probably that's moderated a little bit as we're looking to the second half, particularly on-road in North America. So net-net, and obviously South America has been a tailwind as well for us, Colin. So, 12% of our business, and it's certainly contributed to the growth based on the recoveries. So if that helps you a little bit and if you need a bit more from a product perspective, it's predominantly a turbo business, our emissions business and our thermal business are the products that are driving that growth for us. Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. I'd like to just sneak one more in. Can you just provide \u2013 on the Sevcon acquisition, can you describe a little bit of what the powertrain electronic capabilities are that you're acquiring there in terms of what \u2013 a little more specific on actually what the product is that you're delivering and whether that acquisition is really more about cross-selling that with the rest of the business or is it about the backlog you're acquiring? James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Yeah. So, I mean, fundamentally what we're really getting with Sevcon is, we're getting tremendous design and development capability from their engineering organization. They can absolutely understand the electronics aspects of the system works. And that just coupled with BorgWarner's existing capability really accelerates it. But it's not just an engineering play, Colin, they got revenue, they run about $50 million of revenue, and they ship a lot of invertors and converter-type products. They also have some battery charging technology that they ship out. So, it's basically buying a lot of very strong engineering capability coupled with an existing revenue platform that is accelerating as they take that capability, add that to our capability, and we can offer a complete system solution to the light vehicle customers as well as the commercial vehicle customers. Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thank you very much for the color. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thank you, Colin. Operator : Your next question comes from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Elad Hillman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. This is Elad Hillman on behalf of Ryan Brinkman. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Good morning. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: Good morning. Elad Hillman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Good morning. Can you just comment on the margin progression at Wahler? Now that the outlook for commercial vehicle production seems to be improving, can you get any progress there? Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: I'm sorry. Can you repeat the question? I didn't hear the beginning of the question. Elad Hillman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah. Sorry. So, just wondering about the progression on the margins for the Wahler transaction, now that the outlook for commercial vehicle seems to be better? Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: Hey, yeah, Wahler, okay. That business we acquired several years ago. And if you go back in time, it was low single-digit. And our expectations were to get that to migrate into high single-digit and hopefully ultimately get into double-digit. I would say, we're behind that schedule for numerous reasons. In particular, we had a lot of product moves that we anticipate of doing from one of our facilities that we had to slowdown. And as a result to that, we haven't been able to get to profitability where it needs to be. If we deal deeper into it, that acquisition was about valves, the valves and rivet business for us and valve market share that we have in Europe. But I would say, the operational performance at this point is somewhat of a headwind it has been for the last couple years it is this year, and we need to fix that going forward. So, as we go forward, I was saying earlier on the call that would be maybe one of the little tailwinds that we can get going forward, and we're working on it very hard. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: And, just on \u2013 sorry, just to add on to Ron's comments, which was a great summary. The broader question you asked him in terms of commercial vehicle overall from a BorgWarner perspective both growth and operating margin performance, we're very happy with our commercial vehicle business, it's contributing well to our performance. But, Ron's right, we've got an isolated issue within the ex-Wahler business that we need to fix, and we will. Elad Hillman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you very much. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Brian Johnson with Barclays. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes. Wanted to talk a little bit about the backlog. As mentioned earlier that it's coming ahead of the original guide, certainly understand some of the back half conservatism. But as we roll forward to next year, you guided 460 to 670 \u2013 was the conservatism and risk adjustment around potential launch delays that you baked into the regional backlog? Is some of that now dissipating and that number could wind up being higher? Just another way of putting it, which you probably won't answer is, what sort of a gross backlog and then the discount for delay launches you've applied this year and how is it shaping up for next year? James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Yeah. Brian, I'm going to take a shot at it, and then if Ron wants to jump in, we'll let him. Let me start with a couple of points to backlog. First of all, I'm thrilled with the first half of the year, first of all. It's exceeded our expectation a little bit. It's been a terrific first half of the year. The second half is moderated. It's basically the same as what it was from the prior guide. We've not really changed too much on the second half guide. Ron articulated some of the headwinds that we're going to pay attention to as we go into that. And all of that rose up to this strong 7% midpoint organic growth for the year, and you can see the full year backlog number. You're right, it's a little too early to give you 2018 numbers. We will talk at the Investor Day a little bit on how we've seen our growth rates looking out over the next two years, three years, five years. So that will probably give you a little bit more of a sense. But we're going through our process, Brian, as we get ready for 2018, but certainly there's nothing to be fearful of in terms of what we gave you last year, that's for sure, because we're executing very well against that target this year. So, I don't know whether that helps you enough, but that's how I'm thinking about the backlog. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: So, Brian, I will add a few things. As you know, we changed our process a couple of years ago. And what we do is, we'll take a look at the gross backlog number and we will make subjective adjustments. And given markets and given products and given customers to those numbers like we did this year and last year, and that process has done very well for us, and we'll continue doing that process into the next year backlog as well. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And can we look at the backlog and say, most of the growth we saw first half was due to just the risk factors not being needed or were there launches that were upsized or bigger magnitude than perhaps you originally... James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: I would say, Brian, it was launch cadence and volume. That's where the uplift \u2013 or the outperformance, so to speak, has been in the first half, less macro, if that makes sense to you. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yeah. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: So, the number of launches is the same. I would just say, it's a combination of summer coming in a little earlier or kicked in a little better or some of the volume assumptions that we've loaded in have run a little bit better, which I think, to back to Ron's point, Brian, kind of points to how we wanted to do it going into the year. And I think it's prudent, and it's paying off actually. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. I've got more strategic questions, but I'll save them for a couple of weeks. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Okay. Look forward to that, Brian. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yeah. Operator : Your next question comes from Chris McNally with Evercore ISI. Chris McNally - Evercore ISI : Morning, guys. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Good morning. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: Good morning. Chris McNally - Evercore ISI : Maybe just a little bit on market share in electrification, particularly 48-volt and plug-in. Do you have a better sense, it's been about a year that you've been taking strong orders for 48-volt or actually a little bit more, but a sense for what market share could be in the core product like eBooster, you didn't really exclusively give guides on the last Analyst Day, but you can kind of back into the numbers that it seem like a number between 15% and 25%. And it just seems like you may have some more market intelligence now that 48-volt seems to be gaining some momentum? James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Yeah. Chris, this is James. Let me give some answers there. First and foremost, just to be open \u2013 we'll share quite a bit more detail on the some \u2013 hard numbers, so to speak, as we go into Analyst Day in a couple of weeks. But what I would say you directionally is, the activity level around hybrid and electric has both increased pretty significantly from a year ago, and our activity certainly increased pretty significantly across hybrid platforms and electric platforms. I think your intuition is right, on the 48-volt model, hybrid is becoming a very strong platform for growth, as is plug-in hybrids, I think those are the two that are really accelerated in the last year. What I can share with you from a BorgWarner point of view, we feel very, very good about the win rates we're experiencing around that technology. So, again, we'll share you more detail in a week or two. Your point on market share as well, Chris, is right on. We \u2013 in a conventional combustion business, we generally have a market share in the low-20%s is a good reference point. And the way we've modeled our business in terms of communicating outlooks, we've modeled a little bit of a lower market share assumption in the 15% to 20% range for hybrids and electrics, because it's a little bit of a newer space. And we want to give our self a chance to see how that will play out. So hopefully that gives you a little bit of a sense, Chris, of what's going on. And again really looking forward to sharing much more detail on that with you in a couple of weeks. Chris McNally - Evercore ISI : That's fantastic. And just one quick follow-on in terms of \u2013 again, just from a qualitative standpoint. I mean the market tends to get very worried about these new businesses, whether they're going to be more competitive in terms of the more traditional powertrain. Even though a lot of the players are the same, is it fair to say that expectations from kind of a \u2013 whether it's a pricing on a margin standpoint from a BorgWarner, when you look at your backlog, it's tracking as you thought and these continue to be, I think, as you indicated at the Analyst Day sort of corporate average-type margin businesses? James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Yeah, absolutely is the quick answer, Chris. And I'll give you two data points. One is, the business that we're quoting and winning on hybrid and electric type applications are absolutely meeting the BorgWarner typical threshold of 15% after-tax ROIC in their corporate margins. So we're very comfortable there. But I think more important \u2013 or as importantly from a year ago, a lot of those products we talked to you about last year are now in production. So we can actually see real life data, if you wish of how they're running down the production lines, and the operating margins are coming in right where we'd expected them to. So no dilution of margin performance as we go forward with new products on hybrids and electrics. Chris McNally - Evercore ISI : That's fantastic. Thanks so much, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from David Kelley with Jefferies. David L. Kelley - Jefferies LLC : Hey. Good morning, guys. Just a quick follow-up to that \u2013 yeah, a quick follow-up to that 48-volt question prior here. Maybe could you give us some color on the eBooster system content per vehicle opportunity in your minds? And maybe how that might compare to your traditional turbocharger content in gas and diesel? And also just on the earlier Sevcon discussion, how do we think about the incremental add to your addressable hybrid content opportunity, now that you're adding Sevcon into the fold here? Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: Yeah. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Yeah. David, let me quickly mention the Sevcon piece first. I think, fundamentally what it's doing is, we already have a good basis of power electronics and electronics and software capability in the company. This is basically scaling us up and adding to that, which is super important. But in addition to that, it's actually given us some hard products basically. They already build and ship inverters and those types of products. So we'll get that. And they've obviously got some existing customer relationships. So that's the real power. But the real power is going to be when BorgWarner and Sevcon as a united group walk into the customers and can talk and offer a complete integrated system. Just to give you an example, take a P2 Hybrid as an example. We'll be able to take BorgWarner's clutching technology, we'll be able to take the former Remy motor technology, and then the third element to that system is the power electronics. And that's the piece that Sevcon will bring to the table. So that's going to be a very, very powerful story. It's a little early to know how that \u2013 what that's going to look like. But we'll get clarity around that. But from a strategic fit, it's a super thing for us. eBooster is still in the early phase of adoption, but we're seeing tremendous interest from a lot of customers. Typical rough number for an eBooster is about couple hundred bucks, but don't forget you're adding that is plus the turbo, not just on its own. So a conventional turbo, I think couple hundred bucks, turbo plus and eBooster, $400. So we're seeing a lot of interest, David. We see a lot of growth in there. And most important, from a BorgWarner perspective, we absolutely believe we're the leader in eBoosting technology. So, yeah, a lot of excitement around both of those, David. David L. Kelley - Jefferies LLC : All right. Perfect. Appreciate the color. Thanks, guys. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Richard Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities. Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hey. Good morning, everyone. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Hey, Rich. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: Hey, Rich. Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hey. Just I want to follow-up on the Sevcon. So in terms of power electronics, does this satisfy your need for scale with that acquisition once it closes? Or are there other opportunities, other areas within power electronics you would look to add? James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Yeah, Rich. I think obviously we want to get a closer look once we've got the deal done and all of that good stuff. It's additive. I don't think we stop there. I don't think we stop there either organically or through acquisition. This certainly helps us, but I would love more, both organically and acquisition. It's just going to be a function of focus on integrating Sevcon first, keep looking for other opportunities and other targets and add them. So we're going to scale up even beyond Sevcon in power electronics and electronics for sure, both organically and acquisition. Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay, great. Thanks, James. And then just two quick housekeeping, Ron. The increase in CapEx, I might have missed that, but what is that related to? And then, just thoughts on steel prices. There has been a lot of discussion around Harris (56:30), et cetera, rising prices, some headwinds in some other areas of the economy, other industrials. What are your thoughts on price there within steel? Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: Right. So, first the CapEx. As you know, our backlog is \u2013 really came in strong in the first half. And some of that backlog is the DCT plant in China. So what we're doing is, we're going to put in some more capacity to continue those ramp ups from our customer there, so that's the DCT. And a little bit more in the four-wheel drive area. On commodity prices, we came into the year anticipating inflationary environment. We saw some of it. Our operating folks did a very good job passing that up through to our customers on pass-throughs. The question around what is going to happen on steel prices once the administration makes a decision on tariffs and imports and all that, I think whatever happens there, just say that they do go forward and put something in place to benefit the U.S. producers. Again, that would flow through our normal process of pass-throughs and contract negotiations we have with our customer, Rich. So, yeah, that would be for the industry itself a headwind, but I think for BorgWarner itself, we could navigate through that. Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay, great. Thank you. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thank you, Rich. Operator : Your next question comes from Matt Stover with Susquehanna. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Matt, good morning. Matthew Stover - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Most have been asked, but two things. One, could you just kind of bucket all the factors that favorably \u2013 that impacted the Drivetrain comp year-to-year? I know you mentioned in a bunch different places, but I just want to make sure my head is straight on that. And then, I wanted to ask you something about pricing after that? James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Okay. We have no problem. So, from a Drivetrain perspective, what's been pushing the growth, it's primarily coming from the backlog, so it's launching of a lot of new products. We've certainly gained a little bit, as I mentioned early, with the truck mix in North America helping our transfer case business. Our DCT ramp is certainly accelerated, which has been good. We've seen all-wheel drive growth hovering in Korea as well. So it's kind of a combination of all of the above if that helps you, Matt. Those are the big drivers up. Matthew Stover - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Okay. And the second thing is on pricing. Going into the quarter, one of your German peers had talked about industry pricing and it kind of provoked a question. I'm wondering if it's rising commodity prices, falling volumes you're seeing OEMs push back harder or push harder on price or is it more just a case of the dog ate their homework? James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: I would articulate it this way, Matt. The pricing environment is tough, it's always tough, and we know how to operating in that environment. I wouldn't say it's got any incrementally tougher than it was last year or the year before. The good news from a board perspective is, we got a great discipline in place around cost reduction to offset a lot of that price pressure. But we're not calling out or seeing any shift in the pricing environment at this stage for sure. Matthew Stover - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Okay. Thanks very much. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thank you, Matt. Operator : We have time for one final question, and that question comes from Emmanuel Rosner with Guggenheim. Emmanuel Rosner - Guggenheim Securities : Hey. Thanks for squeezing me in. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Good morning, Emmanuel. Emmanuel Rosner - Guggenheim Securities : So, wanted to get your take on a couple of developments that could sort of impact the industry. The first one is sort of noise from the new administration that they could sort of freeze the standards at the 2021 level, and I wanted to know, in your opinion, is that a good, bad or neutral thing? James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Emmanuel, from a BorgWarner point of view, you're asking or...? Emmanuel Rosner - Guggenheim Securities : Yeah. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Yeah. I think, our view, Emmanuel, is that the standards are going to continue to climb. There is a good chance, so there could be some moderation at the standard a flattening out, so to speak, of the line in the outyears. And our strategy that we put in place two years to three years ago have been well balanced between combustion, hybrid and electric. We're kind of okay either way frankly, because all that happens with acceleration of more aggressive standards. You just shift the mix between hybrid, electric and combustion. And when we've got content per vehicle growth in all three, we're in a good place either way. So, I would say, neutral to slightly positive is our view, if that helps you on that one. Emmanuel Rosner - Guggenheim Securities : Okay. That's helpful. And then, I guess, the second thing seems be sort of like a lot of movement in sort of the assets that are around in the combustion engine area. We see Delphi is spinning off their Powertrain business. They were seeing some noises from some of the German competitors that are they're flexible or looking at sort of options. Do you expect some sort of consolidation of the combustion engine powertrain competitive landscape or do you think that the deals going forward will be mostly limited to electrical exposure? James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Yeah. That's a good thought, Emmanuel. I'll give you my take on it. I read the same stuff you do, and I can see the action some people are taking. I'll only tell you this. I just love our propulsion business. I love the growth that we have now. And when I look at the outlook for us from a \u2013 with that portfolio and what we're adding to with Sevcon and others to come, I love it. I mean, we're going to grow mid to high single-digit organic growth. That's going to flow-through to EPS and we're in a really, really good spot. So, I can't speculate and speak for others. I can only tell you I love our business. Emmanuel Rosner - Guggenheim Securities : And I guess, within BorgWarner, would you have appetite for additional \u2013 acquiring additional combustion engine powertrain revenues or will your deals be mostly focused on the... James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: I would say, yeah \u2013 Emmanuel, I would say, our bias is primarily adding technology around electronics. It might be software, it might be power electronics, and accelerating on the on the hybrid and electric vehicle type technology. You never say never to a combustion asset, you always look at those. But our focus is adding and continuing to build system capability, so we can offer complete solution for all types of propulsion vehicles. And I feel really good about how that's working out for us so far. Emmanuel Rosner - Guggenheim Securities : Great. Thanks for the color. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thank you, Emmanuel. Patrick Nolan - BorgWarner, Inc.: Sharon, you can close up the call. Thank you all for your great questions today. Operator : That does conclude the BorgWarner 2017 second quarter results conference call. You may now disconnect.",

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Patrick Nolan, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Nolan, you may begin your conference. Patrick Nolan : Thank you, Sharon. Good morning, everyone, and thank you all for joining us. We issued our earnings release at 6 :30 AM Eastern Time. It's posted on our Web site, borgwarner.com, on the homepage and on our Investor Relations homepage. The replay of today's call will be available through November 10. The dial-in number for that call is 855-859-2056, and the conference ID is 49072509, or you can listen to the replay on our Web site. With regard to our Investor Relations calendar, we'll be attending several conferences between now and our next earnings release. As always, please see the Events section of our Investor Relations homepage for a full list. Before we begin, I need to inform you that during this call we may make forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties detailed in our 10K. Our actual results may differ significantly from the matters discussed today. Also, during today's presentation, we will highlight certain non-GAAP measures in order to provide a clear picture of how our core business performed, and for comparison purposes with prior periods. When you hear say on a comparable basis, that means excluding the impact of FX, net M&A and other non-comparable items; when you hear us say on a reported basis, that means U.S. GAAP. Now, back to today's call; first, James Verrier, our President and CEO, will comment on the industry, as well as provide a high-level overview of our Q3 results. James will also discuss some of our recent product wins, and our recently completed acquisition of Sevcon. Then Ron Hundzinski, our CFO, will discuss the details of our Q3 results as well as our updated 2017 guidance. Please note that we posted an earnings call presentation to the IR page of the Web site. You'll find the link below the notice for this call. We encourage you to follow on during our discussion. With that, I'll turn it over to James. James Verrier : Thank you, Pat, and good day to everybody, and we appreciate you joining us this morning for our call. Ron and I are very pleased to share our results from Q3 2017, and also update you on our progress towards delivering 2017 targets. I'd like to start actually by sharing a few thoughts on the macro environment and the industry. And for those of you following along on, that would be on slide number six. We do recognize there is still instability in many aspects from a macro perspective as we look around the world, but I would say, in general, production volumes were only modestly weaker than our expectations as we went into quarter. And let me break that down a little bit for you. So, from a global light vehicle production was up about 2% in Q3, when you look at that prior adjusted geographic exposure, production was flat. European light vehicle production increased about 4.5% which was slightly better than our expectations going to the quarter, China light vehicle production was also up about -- was up about 1% and that was roughly in line with our expectations as we went into the quarter. North American light vehicle production declined by about 10%, which was a little more than our expectations as we went into the quarter. If I talk a little bit about the market outlook, let me talk about light vehicle 2017 calendar year first and we are pretty closely aligned with IHS which is calling for about a 1% growth in China, Europe up a little over 3%, North America production down about 3.5%. And this implies global production growth of less than 1% when you adjust for geographic exposure. Market outlook relative to commercial vehicle, the outlook for Europe and China continues to improve and we also see orders in North America have improved since our last outlook update and I would say we're cautiously optimistic that this strength will continue. If I was to characterize what we're keeping an eye on and watching as we play out the rest of the year, I would point to three things really, the first one is the material cycle here in North America and North American schedules have continued to weaken albeit modestly and so far production adjustments have been pretty much in line with our expectations but clearly will continue to watch that closely. The diesel gas mix in Europe obviously we continue to pay a lot of attention to that, I would say diesel share declined by approximately 530 basis points year-over-year in Q3 and we do continue to expect diesel gas mix to shift through the end of the decade, the good news for us at BorgWarner is we continue to offset that. China we will also pay close attention to and we're still expecting modest industry growth in 2017, more importantly for us at BorgWarner add growth over the market remains very strong due to the content for vehicle increases, so what they said we remain very confident in our strong outgrowth of the market in 2017 based on the continued strong demand for our products. Let me share a few highlights around technology and I think I start with the first key point which is the strong drive to fuel economy emissions regulations and the pull for advanced propulsion technology continues. Activity in hybrids and EVs continue to accelerate no slow down at all, if I break that down a little further, let me talk about what we see in hybrids, I would say the interesting 48-volt hybrid continues to gather speed and gain momentum and grow, I would say the most activity we're seeing is predominantly Europe but we are seeing increasing interest and pick up in both North America and in China. From an electric vehicle perspective, we see the Chinese OEMs continuing to move at a rapid pace, I would say to work with the Europeans continues to increase and we've seen increased activity around Beijing, North America also. So continued efforts there, but let me share a key takeaway that I've seen over the last few months as I've engaged with more and more customers. I think the key is all of our major customers that are exploring a wide variety of options, we see there's no one solution and for each of the customers it depends on their vehicle fleet mix, regional balance and some of the specific propulsion strategies of the OEMs. What we clearly see though is they all have a balance of combustion hybrid and electric propulsion in that portfolios and we continue to work with them every day of the week frankly on two things, one is helping them to define the optimum mix of combustion hybrid and electric and also discussions around the specific propulsion technologies that they require to get where they need to. Let me move to Slide 7 and as Pat alluded to, I wanted to share a few highlights of growth for us in the quarter and I'm going to talk about four key announcements here that you saw, the transfer case win for us on the new Range Rover Velar program, their SUV was a great win for us and a sign of our continued growth in the all-wheel drive business for us. Our two-stage Turbo for Honda's new three cylinder one liter engine gasoline directed was another significant win for us because this is a great story of growth for us with Japanese OEMs. Our cabin heating technology for a new electric vehicle is another significant we did push for electric vehicle growth and this is with globally known EV automaker. The fourth one there you see is our electric motor technology at Scania on the new city wide hybrid bus for urban areas again points to another good win in commercial vehicle and electric vehicle technology. So the key takeaway there is you look at the four is a really great mix of business growth and this is another evidence for me in yet another quarter that confirms our strategy of a balanced approach continues to work and we see win rates across all propulsion systems for combustion hybrid and electric products. Now let me move to Slide 8 and thought give you a little bit of a financial recap and obviously Ron will take you through a lot more detail when he goes and speaks in a few minutes. So I'll start with the Q3 outlook and results for BorgWarner and let me start maybe with the obvious, I'm very pleased with our Q3. Our growth exceeded the high end of our guidance and our operating performance was in line with expectations. Sales of $2.4 billion is up 10.8% organically when we exclude FX and Remy. And this compares to our light vehicle end market exposure which was basically flat in the quarter. Regionally, it was pretty much as we had expected, strong growth in China particularly with DCT and North America with new business and mix, our Europe light vehicle revenue was up mid single digit despite the gas diesel mix shift and this light vehicle growth was supplemented by positive revenue trends in commercial vehicle both on and off road. EPS of $0.95 excluded non-comparable items is a really good result for us and again Ron will share more of that with there and our operating, adjusted operating margin of 12.3% was solid, solid performance. If I break that down a little further by segment, really the key for me was I was very excited to see strong growth across all of our products, so engine sales of $1.5 billion that's 8.7% growth organically which is strong, some of that strong growth came from Turbo and timing systems and our thermal products and again despite the change to the diesel gas mix we're seeing solid top line growth in the engine segment. Drivetrain $920 million in the quarter, that's up 14.4% organically, strong all-wheel drive, DCT and transmission components sales in North America, China and Europe. Let me spend a moment and give you a high level view of the 2017 outlook and I'm really pleased to talk about a rise again in guidance. We're increasing our revenue and earnings forecast for 2017, we expect organic growth of 9.0% to 9.5% year-over-year and this compares to our prior guidance of 6.5% to 7.5%. And this again compares to a market that is growing less than 1%. Our consolidated operating income margin is expected to expand 20 to 30 basis points and our EPS guidance range is now 381 to 383 per diluted share which is up from the 365; 370 previously. Let me now move to Slide number 9 and as Pat alluded to I wanted to share a little bit of commentary on the Sevcon acquisition that we completed in the end of the quarter, first of all we're really excited to add this business to the BorgWarner portfolio, we really believe that Sevcon complements BorgWarner's existing power electronic capabilities and affected doubles our number of dedicated power electronics engineers in the company. Now near term this business will have a revenue run rate of about $60 million at year end and it will be modestly dilutive to 2018 results but the real story is what Sevcon is going to add to our top line over the long term by integrating their technology with our current product portfolio. So before I turn it over to Ron, I just wanted to share a few of my comments relative to the restructuring of our emissions business. I know we've discussed in the past few quarters this business continues to not meet the expectations of BorgWarner. So this quarter, we announced a $12.6 million restructuring charge for this business, we do expect additional restructuring over the next several quarters and as we formulate our plan, there are two items that we are addressing, most significantly there are product lines within our emissions business that we have determined are non-core. We plan to rationalize the footprint related to these products and will also explore our strategic options for these product lines as well. The second part of the plan now is we will also take steps to improve the overall competitiveness of our remaining European Emissions business and again Ron will provide a little more color on that shortly. So let me bring all that together and summarize for us, Q3 was an excellent quarter, we exceeded our expectations for top line growth and operating performance was in line with our expectation. And given our strong year-to-date performance we're increasing our revenue guidance for the year despite a modestly weakened industry production outlook So in summary for me I believe the company's position to deliver a mid to high single digit growth over the long term by continuing to execute our strategy of propulsion system leadership across combustion hybrid and electric vehicles. So with that, let me turn the call over now to Ron. Ron Hundzinski : Thank you, James and good morning everyone. Before I review the financial details I would like to provide you some of the highlights as I see them for the quarter. First it was another strong quarter. Second average performance was as we expected and finally given a strong performance year to date we are confident raising our full year guidance again. Now is Pat mentioned I will be referring to supplemental, financial slide doc as posted on our IR website. I encourage you to follow along. Let's turn to Slide 11 on a reported basis sales were up 9.1%. On a comparable basis our organic sales were up 10.8%. Very strong performance compared to our weighted average light vehicle industry production for the quarter as James mentioned which was flat. We saw 34% growth in China against the production market that was up 1%. In Europe revenue was up 7% so I think better than the 4.5% production growth in the quarter. North America revenue was up low double digit versus the 10% production decline in the quarter. Commercial Vehicle was a benefit again contributing more than 200 basis points. Diesel and gas in Western Europe was ahead when but lower than we expected going into the quarter. Before I moved to the operating profit I would like to discuss our gross profit and SG&A line. Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 21.6% in the quarter up 30 basis points over last year. SG&A was 9.3% of sales R&D spending which is included SG&A was 4.2% of sales. SG&A was down 20 basis points from a year ago driven by leveraging higher sales. Now look at the year-over-year comparison for offering income which can be found on Slide 12. Q3 adjusted operating profit was $298 million or 12.3% of sales compared to $265 million in Q3 of '16 which was 12% resulting in a 30 basis improvement. Our organic basis operating income was up $32 million and $232 million of higher sales that gives us an incremental margin of 14% in the quarter and in line with our expectation. And was an improvement from the incremental margins we saw less than 10% for the first half of the year as you look further down the income statement equity in the affiliate earnings was about $14 million in the quarter up $2 million from last year. Interest expense and finance charges were $18 million in the quarter down over $4 million from last year due to lower debt levels. Excluding a $5 million favorable tax adjustment the provision from income taxes was $86 million for an effective tax rate of 29% for the quarter. Net earnings attributable to nine controlling interest was about $10 million flat from the third quarter last year. This line represents our minority partner shared earnings performance in our Korean and Chinese consolidated joint ventures. Earnings per share on a reported basis for $0.88 per diluted share on a comparable basis net earnings were $0.95 per diluted share. Now let's take a closer look at our offering segments in the quarter beginning in slide 13 of the deck. Reported engine segment net sales were $1.506 billion in the quarter. Sales growth for engine segment on a comparable basis was 8.7% as demand for a light vehicle OEM products was supplemented again by growth in the commercial vehicle business. Adjusted EBIT was $239 million for the engine segment or 15.8% of sales. On a comparable basis the engine segments adjusted EBIT was up $16 million on a $118 million of sales for an incremental margin of 14%. Within the segment strong performance and our terrible and timing systems was partially offset by continuing operating headroom's in the emissions business as James mentioned earlier. We announced initial restructuring charge of our emissions business $12.6 million in the quarter. We expect additional restructuring over the next several quarters as we formulate our plan to improve this business for going the levels of returns. The total cost of this restructuring could vary widely depending on the strategy we optimally pursue, respect to give you an estimate of these costs in the coming quarters. Now turning the slide 14 and starting on the right hand side. Drivetrain segment net sales were $922 million in the quarter. This includes the reduction of $68 million of sales from the divestiture of the remaining light vehicle aftermarket. Sales growth for Drivetrain segment on a comparable basis was 14.4% primarily due to higher all wheel Drivetrain transmission components and strong to a clutch transmission growth in China. Adjusted EBIT was $112 million for the Drivetrain segment or 12.1% of sales on a comparable basis the Drivetrain segment adjusted EBIT was up $22 million and $115 million of higher sales for an incremental margin of 19% this is a very strong performance and reflects the successful ramp of new programs. Now let's take a close look at our balance sheet and cash flow. We generate $624 million of net cash from offering activities in the first three quarters of the year messed up $31 million over last year. Capital spending was $300 million year-to-date up $35 million from a year ago. Pre- cash flow which we defined as net cash from operating activities less net capital spending was $234 million which is basically flat from 2016. Looking at the balance sheet itself balance sheet debt was up and cash decreased by $29 million compared with the end of 2016 to $205 million increase in net debt was primarily due the purchase of economy. Our net capital ratio was 33.6% at the end of Q3 which is down slightly from 35% at the end of 2016 and the net debt to EBITDA at the end of the quarter was 1.22 times. Now I like to discuss our 2017 guidance which we have increased so let's start with our sales growth guidance for the full year on slide 16. Backlog pricing and market related growth are expected to drive 9% to 9.5% organic sales growth. Note this excludes the Sevcon acquisition which is expected to add $15 million of sales in Q4.  Currency is expected to be a small tailwind now. From a performance perspective let's turn to slide 17 again. We expect low teens incremental margins on our sales growth. Included in this our headwinds from corporate costs reflect in year to date headwinds as well as the Q4 approvals based on a stronger top line and earnings. Our consolidated operating income margin is suspected to expand by 20 to 30 basis points. To finish our full year guidance please turn the slide 18, EPS guidance ranges now $3.81 to $3.83 for diluted share versus our $3.65 to $3.70 previously. The increase is driven by our sales guidance and increase in a lower impact of foreign currency for the full year. Free cash flow which define its net cash provided by at varying activities the CapEx is expected to be $450 million to $500 million now. Capital spending included tooling is expected to be in the range of $525 million to $575 million which is up modestly to support several program uplifts. R&D spending as a percentage of sales is expected to be about 4% in 2017. The tax rate is expected to remain at 29% as well. Our assumption for the dollar to euro exchange rate has been adjusted so 1.25 to 1.10 as a reminder everyone sent change in the dollar to euro exchange rate equals about $30 mllion to $35 million sales. Our fourth quarter guidance let's turn to slide 20. First sales note that remain after market divested are about $20 million and we have added about $15 million of Sevcon sales so starting at a base of $2.239 billion. Net new business pricing in market related growth are expected to drive organic sales growth of about 5% to 6.5%. In addition currencies now expected to increase sales growth by about $85 million. Therefore, 2017 Q4 sales is expected to be $2.47 billion at the mid-point. On Slide 21 is our EPS walk for the Q4, as I have already walked to our full year walk, I will not go through all the details, so for Q4 we expect earnings of $0.99 to a $1.01 per share, this includes about a $1 I'm sorry about a $0.01 unfavorable impact from Sevcon. So let me summarize Q3, it was a strong third quarter, organic sales growth was more than 10% despite flattish industry volume, incremental margins improved sequentially as we were expecting, as we look forward to 2017 and beyond, we continue to drive intensity around our new product development and support it with acquisitions to participate in impending electrification trend. So with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Pat. Patrick Nolan : Sharon, we're ready to open up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Colin Langan with UBS. Colin Langan : Thanks for taking my question. I actually wanted to follow-up on Slide 7, you highlighted sort of two things that were interesting, the cabin heater opportunity; any quantification of who are the main categories there? I haven't heard too many people talk about trying to target that market, and what kind of content opportunities there? And also the turbocharger opportunity with Honda, I mean, are you seeing -- it feels like there has been more headlines from the Japanese OEMs, are we seeing that opportunities start to increase there with Japanese moving feel little bit more engines outside there? James Verrier : Yes, good morning, Colin. Yes this is James. So let me start on the Turbo one first if that's okay, we had seen increased adoption rates with the Japanese OEMs on Turbo, that's probably evolved over the last I would say five years, four or five years and we see that trend continuing and we see that trend continuing on both combustion powered vehicles and also on hybrid vehicles where they're utilizing turbo in both of those configurations. So we have seen that, we've been particularly pleased with win with Honda, we've developed a really strong partnership there and launching some of our latest two stage technology on that one liter engine on the gas engine has been that's been a big success for us. So yes we're seeing more and more usage of Turbo with the Japanese OEMs. The cabin heating opportunity we're really pleased about that, that that was the technology that came to us through the BERU acquisition a few years ago and this is our first significant win with the U.S. And if you think of competitors in that space I would say [indiscernible] is probably the most well-known that you would probably know in the cabin heating space, we also see what Astro played in that space as well, so those are two of the most well known ones that I would point to Colin but we're pleased with how that's progressing for us, we would like the technology and as we've alluded to it's a good growth platform for us on peer EVs. Colin Langan : Okay. And just any color on emissions restructuring, I mean when do you get the benefits from the actions that you're taking? And any sense that you said you're considering trade you might actually sort of divesting some of the products in there, is that right? James Verrier : Yes Colin, let me kind of give a little bit of a high level answer to that and then Ron could supplement it with any any specific details. Again I think this again there is two dimensions so to speak to what we're doing here, the one is we have identified a couple of non-core product lines and we're evaluating all of the strategic options associated with those. So that's the one aspect and then the other aspect is a more generic footprint optimization as well, we're still in the process of working through those details Colin as Ron had said to you. It could one option could be divestiture, one option could be restructure the sort of different options here and as Ron and I thought about this until we got a little bit more clarity around that we need a little more time to be candid, but it does include all options are on the table frankly. And we're going to work our way through that through the fourth quarter and I think we will have more color for you when we come back on to the earnings call in February of next year. Colin Langan : Great, thank you very much. James Verrier : Thanks Colin. Operator : Your next question comes from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Ryan Brinkman : Thanks for taking my questions, just a follow up on that, have you discussed which sort of sub-segments of emissions is considered non-core and how that differs from the portion of emissions business that is still core, does it relate in any way to for example dollars? Ron Hundzinski : Yes I can add a little bit of clarity there Ron, so the two product lines that we were viewing as non-core tool from a BorgWarner perspective, think of thermostats and think of pipes, it has nothing at all to do with core EGR business, EGR bowls, EGR modules, EGR coolers, those are fantastic businesses that are doing really, really well for us. So it's in that the thermostats and pipes. When we look at the level of technology differentiation that BorgWarner excels in I don't think they bring that kind of technology differentiation, they don't bring the growth profile so much as a BorgWarner product line. So those are the two product lines that we're referring to. Ryan Brinkman : Okay, that's really helpful and just lastly from me then on the expected sequential deceleration in year-over-year growth as you go from 3Q to 4Q, you did 10% in 3Q looking for 5 to 6.5 in 4Q, very simplistically I look at like North America production that was kind of a drag in 4Q down 10%, IHS was something more like minus 3% in 4Q. So, just curious what drove incremental headwinds are that you seem to be something specific with your backlog or something and if not maybe you think that potential of risk skewed to the upside organic growth in 4Q? Ron Hundzinski : Sure Ryan. This is Ron. I'll give you three of the high level, first of all is diesel mix in Europe like we mentioned on the call, we're not seeing the headwind that we anticipated in Q3, so that gets pushed into our Q4 where the sale starts to show through the production levels, we assume that could be as much as 300 basis point headwind for us in that fourth quarter, that's one item. Korea has been an issue for us as well, that can swing to a negative in Q4 again over last year and then if you remember last year, we had some really good launches in the fourth quarter, the Duramax for example and F250 and we're going to lap those, so we're going to see not have that as a tailwind as well going into the fourth quarter, so three of them at high level. Ryan Brinkman : Okay, very helpful. Thanks a lot, congrats on the quarter. Ron Hundzinski : Thanks Ryan. Operator : Your next question comes from Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank. Rod Lache : Good morning everybody. First just wanted to ask about backlog it was that shows $268 million in the quarter, your guidance was 100 to 150 and it seems like every quarter it's coming in a bit higher than your guidance, so I'm wondering whether there's any reason why we shouldn't be thinking about upside to the number for next year, the 460 to 670, you did kind of enhance that, there's been some program uplifts and that's affecting CapEx, so it seem to suggest that? James Verrier : Hi Rod, this is James. So couple of thoughts from my end at least you're right, we've been tracking ahead of what we've come into the year expected and that's a good feeling obviously and that's that is predominantly backlog related. To your point about next year, I would reiterate my comfort and confidence in the 7% CAGR number that we put out there but obviously over the next few weeks, we're going to -- we're going to take a good look at that and then as we come into January into Detroit we would obviously give you more specificity around 2018 backlog and obviously the three year period as well. But I would think of it this way rather the way this year's transition for us just gives me at least builds a lot more confidence and comfort of the numbers as we go into next year. Rod Lache : Okay, great. And just secondly, I was wondering if you thought there were any competitive implications from the strategic changes that that were announced by your biggest competitor in Turbos, we've seen that actually happen in other segments where multi industry companies have announced divestitures, so any kind of high level thoughts on what have they been running the business today, how that's affected you and how that maybe run into future? James Verrier : Yes I would say from my point Rod that Honeywell has always been an excellent competitor, very strong, strong player and I don't see that really necessarily changing, we will see how it plays out, the most important part for me though that I would want to reiterate is we just continue to see two things strong penetration growth at turbos internal so we still see the turbo business as a strong growth engine for BorgWarner and we still see our one-third market share position that we have very solid, very solid as we look this year and we look at a three year and a five year view. So, for us, it's kind of no change is the way I look at it right we feel great about the turbo business. We love the growth and we love our strong competitive position and I think he will do what they need to do. Rod Lache : Okay, great. Thank you. James Verrier : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from John Murphy with Bank of America. John Murphy : Good morning guys. May be just a follow up on sort of the backlog question Rod just asked me, you kind of highlighted in Drivetrain it's programs running a little bit better than you're expecting as far as new program are certainly your rate cap action, Ron, you tend to be pretty conservative or tight with capital. So it seems like something really positive is it is going on I think that is compliment around what's happening there I mean is it higher volumes and you're expecting our new programs or their actual wins they're manifesting faster than what you thought or say just pull ahead of launches and I'm sure we understand, what's going on there. James Verrier : Hey, John, by the way, Ron really took that as a big compliment. He loves that comment. So, I think it's a little bit of all frankly I think we've got some of the launches this year a come on maybe are faster ramp some of the volumes have been a little stronger. So it's now one thing John it's been a combination. I would say the biggest link though between for me between backlog strength on the Drivetrain side. Is the seat a China that's the biggest kind of mover if I can say that way John and that's a function of a real good BCC adoption and success for us in China both with the Chinese domestics and the global guys and that's just pulling forward a little bit as the capital in life for us. And I would say that's probably the biggest piece but generally from the backlog it's been, its strong both cadence and absolute volume. Ron Hundzinski : John had a couple things. James mentions in the call. This year we're seeing every one of our product lines are growing really well in the past you have a couple product lines that have really good launches and then maybe the other ones are in a cycle where there launches are not hitting this year's here is where every one of our businesses all the launches are hitting and they're hitting at that time that we would hope they would get which is good. And we're getting just tremendous growth across the whole of portfolio and then addition we don't have the headwinds of commercial vehicle to [indiscernible] so it just cost everything. John Murphy : Okay, that's helpful. Second question on acquisitions I mean Sevcon looks interesting I mean just curious that just you think about Sevcon in potential future acquisitions, you looking for more human capital or products and if you can kind of just linear may be in Sevcon I mean there sounds like double, double your engineers focused on electric Powertrain so, that's sounds good but there also are product suite becomes along with it or you really wasn't to be engineers you're going after an acquisition. Ron Hundzinski : Yes, that was a good thought John I would say the Sevcon is an example is kind of combination so it brings a revenue stream right if it brings an order book. They bring real product that they have put in boxes and shipping sort us be so it's not just a pure engineers perspective but I would also say clearly they bring to us terrific people capability on the engineering side particularly they bring a lot of that so it's both. And I would say as we look forward John I'm thinking you know more of the same our acquisition focus would be around electronics, power economy capability and we look to obviously add people and talent but our preference also is where we can actually have physical product content where we can particularly around electronics and power electronics. So that's how we thinking about it obviously priority one right now John is to integrate Sevcon and get that up and running well which we're confident in but we're going to keep our eyes and ears open for additional opportunities as well. John Murphy : And just a one last final question; I mean it looks like a lot of your peers are deepeners or expect going in the opposite direction where there is splitting up ice and sort of electric powertrain components and what kind of position you think that you'll have competitively in the market which you go head-t-head with these folks and will you be advantage or disadvantage by having a full products we have been somewhat agnostic to where Powertrain goes? James Verrier : Yes, we then obviously I'm a little biased John right but I think we have an incredible advantage. I really do because we're the -- I don't want say the only one but we one of the very few that can go in and discuss with the OEMS. One of the tradeoffs between you knows combustion hybrid and electric architectures and we do it we have those dialogues because we can help them understand. If you put this type to hybrid application into this set of vehicles and you can go electric on this. We are engaged in those conversations because we play across this space and then the other part of the differentiation for us is we then bring the technology that helps them get there. And what they see in a BorgWarner John which I think is really interesting is they know we're not in a lobby and into for in our overly influence them on a pure evil platform or 48 hybrid platform because we play on both so they view us as a neutral partner in that respect but we then follow it up with the content because we have electric motors we have successfully transmissions. We have cabinet and we have all the suite of combustion products and hybrid products so I think and again I'm biased we have a big vantage. John Murphy : Okay, thank you very much. James Verrier : Thank you, John. Operator : Your next question comes from the Joseph Spak from RBC Capital Markets. Joseph Spak : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. First, just wanted to talk a little bit about the change in backlog relative to the change in CapEx because backlog I think is 50% higher than what you indicated that beginning at the midpoint CapEx is only 10%. So, is that greater efficiency or does it speak to maybe there was just more conservatism on the revenue side versus the capital side? Ron Hundzinski : Joe this is Ron. Remember that capital that goes in is a ramp cycle of what's happening right. So it's not a direct relationship with the sales increase so it's not fair to say that for a 10% increase in sales you need to 10 % of capital it doesn't work the way you're putting capital over several years. So, the capital tends on the rent side would tend to lag the sales increase because in that my comment as that they was primarily due to ramp increases right net new programs so that tends to lag the sales increase is that clear. Joseph Spak : Yes. Ron Hundzinski : It's uplift. It's not new programs yes. Joseph Spak : Okay, well what about can you reach sort of help us I mentioned how much capital was put in place for a backlog coming in future years or it would seem like not much based on a comment that. James Verrier : This is a long discussion Joe but typically it follows up on it and how far off with you I get some ratios that would take this offline it's a long discussion, right, Joe. Joseph Spak : Okay, perfect and I'm then just if you go to like page 11 in the bridge. And I know you made some comments on Commercial vehicle helping I tell you said by 200 basis points is at and then you mentioned market growth was the minus 36 I thought you call that just light vehicle market gross of just this commercial vehicle go in somewhere else in that walk. And then can you also let us know what you're thinking on commercially on off highway first for the fourth quarter embedded in the guidance. Ron Hundzinski : So commercial vehicle goes under the backlog in the mix the 268 on that slide okay, okay that market is typically more light vehicle; the market growth and pricing, okay. First question and the second one is where so many sort of fourth quarter is although it was a tailwind of a 200 basis points and we're going to go back more to what we saw prior in the year which is about 100 basis points improvement for the fourth quarter for commercial vehicle. Last guidance we had none, this guidance we are going to take a little bit of a tailwind for commercial vehicle but never had we seen in the third quarter. Joseph Spak : Okay, that's helpful. Thanks, Ron. Ron Hundzinski : Thanks John. Operator : Your next question comes from Brett Hoselton with KeyBanc. Brett Hoselton : Good morning gentlemen. Ron Hundzinski : Good morning Brett. James Verrier : Good morning Brett. Brett Hoselton : Let's see I'm talking about your longer term revenue outlook your organic guidance and so forth and then your backlog has been becoming in stronger than expected you're talking quite enthusiastically about some of the higher contented products hybrid electric et cetera and it kind of just begs the question. As we look out over the next five years is could we see BorgWarner's revenue growth accelerating. Ron Hundzinski : That's a good question I tell you what we laid out at the Investor Day there in New York that 7% guide over the next three years obviously as this year's played out we've just got. We were very comfortable with that outlook. I'm not in a position at this point but I want to start changing next I don't think we need to. But I think that 7% the point CAGER for us is an organic is a good number. Then let's just keep executing at that at least in the short run. We are going to take a good look at it obviously as we go into January plus and we'll provide any update from there but I think at this point I think the 7% organic CAGER is a good number to think about for us. Brett Hoselton : Okay, and then secondly as we think about the backlog unfolding not necessarily over the next three years but let's say over the next five to ten years and so forth and we think about the move in the direction of from these non IT hard trying to so forth how should we think about margins. You typically is thought about contribution margins but is there the possibility that the margins could be better or worse on these products as we kind of move out into let's say the next five, 10 years. Ron Hundzinski : So Brett this is Ron. We get this question quite often and we've been addressed in several ways and then again referencing the Investor Day that we had here in August. I had a slide in there if you go back to that presentation I think it is on the website where I gave returns on invested capital are very similar on hybridization in a pure electric products as they are in combustion. And that side was to present that and the reason why we're comfortable is because that slide represents products. That we have been awarded and are starting to ship as well and it's across customers and across regions so, the evidence that we're seeing right now of the programs that we're winning don't substantiate in deterioration in margins or returns. Brett Hoselton : Okay, excellent. Thank you very much gentlemen. Ron Hundzinski : Thanks, Brett. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from David Kelley with Jefferies. David Kelley : Hey, good morning guys. Ron Hundzinski : Good morning, David. David Kelley : Just a quick follow up on China. I believe you posted 30% growth Q4 last year the production hurdles a tough one hare you obviously wanting in areas like DCT and with some early model hybrids and electrics. I guess how do we think about some of the puts and takes as we weigh your China opportunity going into year end here and maybe a more difficult hurdle going into '18 as well. Ron Hundzinski : I would say first of all David, yes that the third quarter strong and we've been running pretty strong through the year and you're right it's driven by a lot of that the technology that you could be referenced so, we ramping well with DCT but it's also on a combustion product line as well. So things good, fourth quarters are more challenge it will be a little bit more of a challenge income but will be over the market so, I would think about a high single to low double digit over the market if that makes sense to so that's how we're thinking and going into fourth quarter and I would think that's a pretty good proxy David for going into next year as well. Think of us high single to low double digit growth over the market in China. David Kelley : Okay, great. Thanks appreciated. And just a quickly shift gears you referenced potentially accelerating diesel market declines in Q4 it's still early in the ballgame are you seeing that mix shift go to ICE or is it more towards hybrids and EVs and I know you've alluded to it before but maybe if you could remind us on how you see your longer term offset opportunity as we do see that, the mix shift ultimately switch to alternative powertrain and away from diesel. Ron Hundzinski : Yes, now in the short run David it's clearly diesel out and gasoline in sort to speak. We've talked about this before net for Borg for every hundred bips of shift from diesel to gas. In the short run is had a $20 million, $25 million annual revenue, voice for us frankly which were obviously offsetting in other areas. As it transitions over the next two, three, four years it's a couple of things one it will be even more advanced gasoline engines to be somewhat comparable to diesel technology. There will be obviously increased hybrid in Europe, so we're going to see that and then longer term in the more four, or five, six, seven year outlook you will see more pure EVs coming into the space, all of that adds up as positive news for us David, so as we go forward we got great content on hybrids and obviously we're growing our electric business. So that's kind of an outlook of how we see it, little bit of short term noise but it's transition into more advanced gas and hybrids and electrics where we'll do fine. David Kelley : All right, great, thank you. I appreciate you taking my question. James Verrier : Thank you, David. Operator : Your next question comes from David Leiker with Baird. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, good morning, this is Joe [indiscernible] for David. James Verrier : Good morning, Joe. Unidentified Analyst : I had two questions on commercial vehicles; it added two points to your growth am I correct my math would imply that's like 20% growth for your commercial vehicle business, does that sounded all right? Ron Hundzinski : I haven't broken up between off-road and on-road but that's about right Joe. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And the second question, so it almost feels like five years ago what you went through with automotive and trying to see OEMs plan around greater electrifications, the big heavy duty truck OEMs are all on that stage right now and whether it's Daimler showed a vehicle this week or the others are planning 2019, 2020 that sort of timeframe for launches, what is BorgWarner seeing from in interest perspective, the development perspective and watching either hybrid electric or peer electric commercial vehicles and by what timeframe you expect that? Ron Hundzinski : We're seeing a lot of interest actually around electrification in the commercial vehicle space, we put in the deck actually the Scania win on our drivemotor there for that particular bus application, so we're seeing increased interest Joe across the space and we see obviously Urban Bus type environment is particularly attractive, U.S. we see small and mid sized truck applications again predominantly more CDR, so we're seeing that and if you think about it, a lot of technology that we have on the light vehicle side is leveragable over to the commercial vehicle space, drive motor is being a good example of that. So we're seeing it, I think we will probably have a better view Joe when we do a backlog showing in January because you know there we'll break it down by technology and we will break it down a little bit by and talk about it by end markets. So that will be a good point to kind of break it down a little more for you but directionally we're seeing a significant increase in electrification and in commercial vehicle and we're participating strongly in it. Unidentified Analyst : Great, thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from Matt Stover with Susquehanna Financial Group. Ron Hundzinski : Hello, Matt. Operator : Matt Stover, your line is open. Matthew Stover : Apologies for mute. Ron Hundzinski : Okay, go ahead. Matthew Stover : Apologies, you addressed but just wanted to talk about it in overtime the return on capital of the company has been pretty good and over the last few years for a variety of reasons, it's sort of moved to a lower level but we're seeing some stability here and I'm wondering as you sort of think through the new revenue opportunities that are emerging for you over the course of let's say the next two to five years, if you think that there is an ability for you to sort of rethink the capital intensity or the profit profile of those businesses would allow the company to resume its previous investment class returns on capital? James Verrier : Matt, this is James. I'll give you, I guess, at least my quick high take and then Ron can weigh in, as you rightly pointed out what service company really, really well is that after tax 15% ROIC threshold and hurdle and that's not, we continue to drive that metric pretty relentlessly, so I would start there and say that through minds the core and the primary metric for us. Ron might want to add specifically around cash flow, if you want to talk about? Ron Hundzinski : Our capital deployment in general, I think with the organization going forward is going to have to do is we're going to have to take a look at our product lines and determine which product lines get more capital and which product lines started to not have as much capital as the portfolio starts the evolve and changes in different direction. But, as James mentioned, as we go through their process we will reallocate resources but we are not going to give up on the go of 15% after tax return that's not going to happen. We will redeploy our capital in the right resources in the growth to achieve the growth that we have in our portfolio. But, we are not going to give up on that return metric. Matthew Stover : Okay. Thank you. James Verrier : Thanks, Brian. Operator : Your next question comes from Richard Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities. Richard Kwas : Hi, good morning everyone. James Verrier : Hi, good morning Rich. Richard Kwas : I will take another -- a little different strategy and the backlog. So, going back at the beginning of the year the mid-point was 500 million, you are going to be not quite double have it almost I mean I am imagining it has some expectation you could out perform the top end of your initial range, but anyway to think about how what your internal expectations were versus what's actually happened? James Verrier : I mean I would say, Rich, you know, we are -- obviously first of all, we are -- obviously -- yes we are ahead its coming stronger, it's coming stronger. But what I would also say Rich is, you know, you remember the history here and how we got to the methodology around the development of backlog. And I don't want to go back all the time and in history, but, you know, we took an approach where the roll up for the data was the same, but we were maybe a little more prudent around the cadence and volumes over the launches and we also, you know, built in some, you know, macro stuff, so I think we took that approach and I think that has helped us. But, I think even with that said, from an internal perspective, you know, we are definitely running a little better ahead them what we had anticipated and I think its really what Ron said, it's a combination of, you know, across all of our products and across all of our regions we have just add, you know, the ramps either been little bit quicker or the volumes have been a little stronger and when you add all that up around the world and across the products you get to the kind of results that we are at. So, yes, it's pleasing. Richard Kwas : I know you said, your cross products and regions but DCP seems like its one the areas that probably will contribute a little bit more than average and I know there are some positive payback, which is given their delays in prior years with by customers and what not so. Is that a fair assessment? James Verrier : I think that's a good, that's a good perspective, which, you know, we have seen, you know, the ramp has been little better and stronger. And I think, you know, so your point about history probably couldn't blame as for been, you know, it had conservative in that space based on, you know, the ramp has taken a few years to get where it maybe -- but that's a fewer assessment is a good one right. Richard Kwas : Okay, great. And then, last one just on Sevcon, so we get back the penny impact the negative impacts in the quarter, do we just kind of flow that through on the quarterly basis for '18, just big picture? James Verrier : At this point, I think that's probably a good assumption Rich, we are going to find soon there are updated. We do think that you moderate a little bit going forward, but I think it -- you are going to have give me clarity probably in January. Richard Kwas : Okay, thank you. James Verrier : Thanks, Richard. Operator : Your next question comes from Brian Johnson with Barclays. Brian Johnson : Good morning. Dallas got a kind of bigger question. So, I think there has been through training and swamp on backlog, you know, the books wagons putting some of those businesses into our something that potentially could be by now I mean 20 years after the US OEMs to debt and this forma Delphi of course the Honeywell transaction, the spin-off of Delphi so just because you look at broadly the powertrain space given here that the challenge of kind of managing the transition from ice given the challenge and see a huge ACN, American Actual Data, all investing in the e-modules make that look longer, do you think that this is an industry that's going to consolidate over the next 10 years and its so, what role do you BorgWarner playing in that kind of consolidation? James Verrier : Yes, no, it's good, Brian. I am going to try and give you the best answer I can. But, I am going to stop with something that I think I said in the last -- and that is I love our proportion business, I really do, I am very, very happy with where we have positioned ourselves and the product lines that we have got. I see there is a great future for the proportion guys like us and the reason for that is, our balance again across combustion hybrid and electric. We are agnostics to those shifts Brian if there is a quick fast acceleration of EB penetration that's fine we have great products there. If hybrids becomes a predominate architecture that's fine. So, we are beautifully positioned on whatever that evolution and shift is, you know, in terms of, you know, as our plays out in terms of consolation and who wants to keep what core that I don't know, what I know the one thing that I do know is we are proportion company we are very happy with that, we don't plan to do anything different than be a leading proportion company. I get to let the other guys do what they are going to do, but we are just going to crawl the heck out of our proportion business across all of the, all of the big [technical difficulty]. Brian Johnson : As you look across creative landscape I mean are there redundant or do you mean capital investments going across competitors and OEM as it something where it could use consolidation just not so much for a strategic but just maximizing the cash flows even everyone is making roughly the same products -- product investments? James Verrier : I am not so sure. I wouldn't want to speculate too much Brian, you know, the one thing I would also use when you get down to the real core technology in portion, you know, over abundance of players in the space. So, if you think of -- think about business and think how many guys are on the planet or how many turbo guys who are on the planet for DC module -- on the planet you know, there is so many right, when you get to other, you know, less differentiated products. So, I use that example of thermostat, that's a little bit of a different story. So, I think, you know, individual discrete product lines made lend itself that but I think when you look at the core of the propulsion, whether it's a electric hybrid or combustion. There is not an over abundance of course in my opinion, Brian. Brian Johnson : Okay. Thanks. James Verrier : Thank you. James Verrier : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Chris McNally with Evercore ISI. Chris McNally : Thanks, gentlemen, and congrats again on this the good year and driving the detail on the PF side, and it's been really helpful for the call. I wanted to thank you just a follow up to the China question with a couple questions ago, you know, remembering that China was one of the issues that we only 15 on some of the new launch volumes. How do we start to think about China in 2018 but, you know we have seem that Chinese stronger growth from 18 to 25 million. Is it crazy to fuel the 2018 could be down sort of low to the mid-single digits in China and if that's the case, you know, how do you start to scenario planned, you know, around just a temporary blip in production and new launches, you know, you can start to grow again later in the year and going forward? James Verrier : Yes, I though as we get to think about 2018 heat is up, you know, I think you are going to see modest growth in large circulation production in China, you know 1% or 2% we are not certain exactly the number. Yes, the days of 6% to 8% percent I think are behind us. So, from a market perspective here in a 1% or 2% growth environment for China next year, but we are in excess of that, you know, we are going to be high single to low double-digit growth over and above that market. So, even if there was a little bit adjustment in China ran flat slightly down for a year or so, you know, we are still going to be delivering a very significant growth that driven by, you know, penetration story of about products. So, not a big deal frankly if China is off a couple of percent next year what we are focused on is launching flawlessly a products that are driving the high growth first in China. Chris McNally : I think that's great. And its fair to say that, the comments that you have been making about drivetrain with, you know, some of the all over drive and DCT growing, the launch cans, is it still pretty good specifically in China as we think about 18 and 19 but its still as good as was in sort of the last four quarters, but if China is specific for driving train, you know, still a nice a new backlog new launch cadence over the next, you know, the next year or two? James Verrier : Yes, it is, you know, specifically if you think about that we, you know, one of our big launches and the growth stories there in drivetrain is with Great Wall on a dual-clutch technology, and if you think about this really only been ramping in the third quarter and they will be ramping further in the fourth; next year that ramp is going to continue to decline, and then obviously we have been putting in capacity to support Volkswagen in China, and that's also in early ramp mode. So you are going to get that -- that's going to be a tailwind for us as we go forward. So, yes, still a lot of opportunity for growth for us in drivetrain in China. Chris McNally : Okay, thank you so much. James Verrier : Thank you. Ron Hundzinski : Thank you. Operator : We have time for one final question, and that question comes from Richard Hilgert with Morningstar. Richard Hilgert : Good morning, guys. James Verrier : Good morning, Richard. Richard Hilgert : Congrats on the quarter. Hey, I was thinking about you know, the comments earlier in the prepared remarks about you know, the phenomenon that we are seeing with crossover sport utility vehicles outside of North America, and the tremendous growth that we have seen in these products, not only in Europe, but in South America and Russia, in China. And with the changeover in powertrain to both hybrid or battery electric, given the way that the portfolio is set up now, do you envision at some point potentially more products coming on you know, the torque delivery side to match some of these new energy powertrains that we are seeing to go into the crossover segment, and is that an area that you could potentially see some additional growth rates on top of what you have already forecasted for the longer term growth? James Verrier : Yes, Richard, let me shut that up for you. I think you know, first of all, your observations are right on. We do see globally in our shift to more SUVs and obviously here in the United States light truck or truck is strong. Directionally, it's helpful for BorgWarner, because it does offer the opportunity as you say for more all-wheel drive content and transportation specifically obviously for four-wheel drive applications. So, it does. I mean directionally it does help us with larger vehicles and SUVs on the drive trend side. But so yes, I think the quick answer is yes, Richard, we do see that as a slight tailwind. I would say it's best to think of we probably factored that into our -- of data we gave back in New York. So I'm not seeing that necessarily in the short run as necessarily upside-upside, I think that's already reflected in our projections that we gave in New York, which is that 7% CAGR you know, at the midpoint for us over the next three years, Richard. Richard Hilgert : Okay. On the Sevcon side, converters, the high-voltage, low-voltage products that got there, and the software that goes behind that seems to me like you know, the battery chargers is probably the area that you might have been referring to with respect to what might not be core to BorgWarner's business, but I was wondering you know, the sort of development behind that, is there anything there that might give you some expertise on working with your OEM customers on how the battery energy flows you know, coming in and then optimizing going out for the output. Is there anything there that you would want to retain from that aspect of Sevcon that could help you further develop that business? James Verrier : Yes, so a couple of thoughts, Richard. One is the non-core product line I was referring to earlier was in our emissions business, which is thermostats and pipes. So, certainly nothing -- I'm not disclosing anything non-core at all on the Sevcon side. As you alluded to, the power electronics capabilities is particularly core to us, because that is where we are going to be able to integrate that power electronics into the products and systems and modules as we go forward, because that's critical to us. You know, the battery charging piece of the business is also very interesting for us. It's fair to say, I would describe it his way, that's the one we -- you know, we don't know so much about yet candidly. So we are going to get in and work with the Sevcon team and better understand what the opportunities are for that piece of the business. But overall, Sevcom is a wonderful acquisition for us, and it's really going to help accelerate our efforts in power electronics and system capabilities. So, positive on that. Richard Hilgert : Okay, great. Thank you very much for taking my questions. James Verrier : Thank you, Richard. James Verrier : With that, I would like to thank you all for your great questions today, and sharing it for the course of the call. Operator : That does conclude the BorgWarner 2017 third quarter results conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Chris McNally - Evercore ISI Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Operator : Good morning. My name is Sharon and I will be your conference facilitator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BorgWarner 2017 Fourth Quarter and Full-Year Results Conference Call. I would now like to turn the call over to Patrick Nolan, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Nolan, you may begin your conference. Patrick Nolan - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thank you, Sharon. Good morning everyone, and thank you all for joining us. We issued our earnings release at 6 :30 AM Eastern Time. It's posted on our website, borgwarner.com, on our homepage and on our Investor Relations homepage. A replay of today's call will be available through February 22. The dial-in for that call is 855-859-2056 and the conference ID will be 9599159 or you can simply listen to the replay on our website. With regard to our investor relations calendar, we will be attending several conferences between now and our next earnings release. Please see the Events section of our Investor Relations homepage for a full list. Before we begin, I need to inform you that during this call, we may make forward-looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties as detailed in our 10-K. Our actual results may differ significantly from the matters discussed today. Also, during today's presentation, we will highlight certain non-GAAP measures in order to provide a clear picture of how the core business performed and for comparison purposes to prior periods. When you hear us say on a comparable basis, that means excluding the impact of FX, net M&A and other non-comparable items. When you hear us say adjusted, that means excluding non-comparable items. And finally, when you hear us say on a reported basis, that means U.S. GAAP. But now back to today's call. First, James Verrier, our President and CEO, will provide a high-level overview of our 2017 results as well as our recent backlog announcement. James will then comment on the industry and some of our recent product wins. He will conclude with the key items in our outlook and provide an update on our non-core emissions restructuring. Then Ron Hundzinski, our CFO, will discuss our results as well as our guidance. We've posted an earnings call presentation to the IR page of our website. You'll find the link in the Investor Presentation section beneath the notice for this call. We encourage you to follow along with these slides during our discussion today. With that, I'm pleased to hand it over to James. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Good morning, everybody. And, Pat, thanks for that intro. As Pat said, Ron and I are really pleased, actually, to share our results for 2017. And then, obviously, we're going to talk a lot about the outlook for 2018. What I thought I would do is start by sharing a few thoughts on 2017 as we wrap that year up. And for those of you that are following along that, you can see some of that information on slide number 6 in the deck. And the headline really is 2017 was a great year for BorgWarner, $9.8 billion of sales, which is up 10.3% organically. And that's comparing to a light vehicle end market exposure for us of about 0.5% growth. Looking at that by segment, the Engine sales were $6.1 billion, which is a growth of 7.7% organically. And Drivetrain finished up at $3.8 billion. That's up almost 15% organically, a very, very strong growth on the Drivetrain side. Regionally, how it broke down. We had strong growth in China and North America. And our Europe light vehicle revenue was up mid single digit. And that's pretty impressive when you consider some of the diesel and gas mix shift that went on. That light vehicle growth was supplemented also by positive revenue trends in commercial vehicle both on and off road. Our EPS at $3.89 was up 19% year-over-year, which we're also very proud of. It's a very strong result for us. Away from the specific numbers there, we had significant launches and wins across combustion hybrid and electric vehicles. We made a lot of progress across all three platforms. And we're expecting that to continue strongly in 2018 also. We also, towards the end of last year, completed the acquisition of Sevcon which was a really important move for us strategically because that's increased our scale and capabilities in power electronics, which is a really important move for us. Also last year, we shared our 2020 revenue outlook of $11.5 billion to $11.8 billion with continued margin improvements. And as you can imagine, we're laser-focused on delivering that outlook. I also thought it would be good on slide 7 just to kind of refresh everybody's view on the backlog. You remember last month in Detroit, we announced our net new business backlog of $2.0 billion to $2.4 billion for the period 2018 through 2020. And this new business is what supports our 2020 revenue outlook that I shared earlier. I think the most important aspect of the backlog from my view is we see very good balance of growth across the product portfolio. So we're deriving growth from many, many products in the portfolio. And one of the ways that shows up, which is a really good move for us, is 50% of our backlog is related to vehicles with hybrid or electric propulsion systems. And then 50% of the backlog is related to vehicles with combustion propulsion. So that drive for combustion, hybrid and electric balance is absolutely coming through. We also have very good regional balance and also a very good customer balance. So we have a nice diversity to the growth. So it's a really, really good story. And we were proud to share that last month in Detroit. And I thought it good to just refresh everybody on that. As Pat said, I'll share some thoughts on the industry outlook turning to slide number 8. The headline really is we expect the overall global industry to be stable to slightly improved in 2018. Let me break that down a little bit for you. So from a light vehicle 2018 calendar year view, we're pretty closely aligned with the view of IHS. So really, what that looks like is China growth is about \u2013 China is about 1% growth. Europe's up somewhere between 1% and 2% growth. And we see slight growth in North American production. So this implies global production growth of about 1% adjusted win for our geographical exposure. From a commercial vehicle viewpoint, we're assuming a flattish CV outlook in 2018. Orders in North America remained strong on the Class 8 side. But we do expect more modest growth in medium duty and offset by a little bit weaker demand in China. I always like to give a sense of some of the key areas that we're paying good attention to, keeping our eye on as we go through the year. And I would say there's three really that we focus on. One is just the North American mature cycle. We're in an environment where it's pretty much flat to slightly improved production. But we'll always be watching that in terms of inventories and production in North America. And diesel-gas mix in Europe continues to shift. So diesel share declined by approximately 740 basis points in Q4 and it was 480 basis points for the full year of 2017. We're going into the year expecting a 300 basis point to 400 basis point diesel to gas mix shift in 2018 and we'll be watching that. The good news from us as a company is, as we did last year, we're offsetting that diesel-gas mix with other favorable aspects in the business. Last area we keep an eye on is China. We're expecting modest industry growth in 2018. But like all of you I think on the call, we continue to watch demand, particularly with the tax incentive changes that may occur through the year. All of that said, what we do is we expect to continue to outgrow the market strongly in 2018 based on the strong demand for our product mix. Let me just give a couple of comments on technology trends. I think again, the main message I would share with you is the activity and focus on hybrid and electric continues to accelerate around the world. In hybrids, clearly, 48-volt mild hybrids continue to be in focus. That creates great content opportunity for BorgWarner, whether it's P2 clutch modules, whether it's eBoosting, whether it's iBAS-type systems. So that's a real push for us. I would say generally Europe is probably moving the fastest on hybrids. But we continue to gain more work and interest in both China and North America. Electrics, I would say, again the Chinese OEMs continue to move at a very fast pace. And you see that flowing into our backlog with multiple awards on eGearDrives. We do see work with the Europeans increasing. And we're engaged with North American customers on electric vehicle products as well. So I think the key point for us is that we expect 2018 and 2019 to bring significant industry awards for hybrids and EVs for BorgWarner. And we're very confident that we have the right portfolio to pursue this business. So we'll continue to focus on that and you'll see more announcements and bookings through the year on both hybrids and electrics. Let me just highlight a couple of recent announcements that we made that you can see there on slide number 9. And I think these are another good indicator of what I was saying a few moments ago of the strength and the breadth of our product portfolio. So you can see there we have the on-axis P2 module development contract with a major Chinese OEM. That's a really good announcement for us. I think that's clear evidence that the Chinese OEMs are moving forward and accelerating their efforts on hybrids. And this is a great example, the P2 module, for us where we're leveraging both our clutching expertise and our motor expertise to present a unique module that very few people, if any, can do in the world. The HVH250 electric motor and eGearDrive transmission for the initial launch of the FUSO eCanter truck. We talked about that a few weeks ago in Detroit. And this is the world's first series-produced all-electric light duty truck. And this is a great example of our EV capabilities where we're basically providing the complete propulsion system for an electric vehicle truck. A great win. Last but certainly not least, the all-wheel drive coupling for Volvo's new XC40 compact SUV is a great win for us. And this is a good example of our integrated vehicle dynamics software and our ECU knowledge helping us bring a great system forward for Volvo. So it's a great example. It represents a very good balance to what we're winning across all aspects of combustion, hybrid and electric. Let me shift gears, if I can, and talk a little bit about 2018 on slide 10. So first of all, for the full-year outlook, our organic growth and margin outlook is unchanged from the guidance we provided last month. So that's we expect organic growth of between 5% and 7% year-over-year in a market that's basically flat to up 1%. Our consolidated operating income margin is expected to expand to 12.6% to 12.7%. And we've updated our EPS guidance to a range of $4.25 to $4.35 to incorporate our updated tax and FX guidance. And as you could imagine, Ron will share quite a bit of detail with you, that in his comments shortly after myself. I also wanted just to say a few words about our Q1 organic guide, because when you look at that, it's a lower number than the full-year outlook. So our organic growth for Q1 remains at 3.0% to 5.5%. And there's a few aspects of timing that I just want to point out so you guys will have a good understanding of it. First thing to think about in our Q1 number is industry production. So during Q1 of 2017, BorgWarner's weighted industry production grew approximately 4% versus less than 0.5% for the full year of 2017. So it's a tough industry comp for the year in Q1. Q1 2018 industry production is expected to be flat to in line for the 1% for 2018. We also have a North American changeover. We have a significant changeover program that will go on in Q1. So that also creates a little bit of noise. And then also if you look at Q1, diesel is an impact for us as well because we didn't really see much of that diesel-gas mix shift in Q1 of 2017. And obviously, we're seeing that meaningfully in Q1 of 2018. And then we have a little bit of noise around European launch timing. So that's what kind of helps maybe bridge you to have a better sense of our Q1 flows versus the rest of the year. That said, we're very, very confident and very, very comfortable in our full-year guide of the 5% to 7% and absolutely confident we'll execute on that number. Before I turn it over to Ron, let me just give you a couple of comments about our emissions restructuring. We did incur additional restructuring cost in Q4. And we're going to expect some level of expense during the first half of 2018. Now, after a strategic assessment and review, we've determined that a sale of the non-core business is our preferred path for the products we've identified. And in the fourth quarter, we launched a program to locate a buyer for these product lines. And as a result, we did record an asset impairment expense to adjust the net book value of this business to be fair value less cost to sell. In the event that we can't find a buyer, we will take the additional steps necessary to restructure the business to get it where we need it to be. So let me quickly summarize before I hand it over to Ron. First of all, 2017 was a great year for the company. We exceeded our expectations for the top-line growth and operating performance was in line with our expectations. And we expect that \u2013 continue the success in 2018 with another year of above-industry average growth and significant new business awards. Finally, we're very committed to delivering the 2020 outlook we outlined last month. So with that, let me turn the call over to Ron. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. Before I review the financial details, I'd like to provide you with some of the highlights as I see them for the quarter. First, the quarter was strong and it was a great finish to the year. Second, operating performance was on target. And finally, we are maintaining the organic growth and margin guidance. But we are increasing our EPS guidance based on the tax and FX benefits. Now as Pat mentioned, I will be referring to the supplemental financials slide deck that is posted on the IR website. I do encourage you to follow along. Let's turn to slide 12. On a reported basis, sales were up 14.5%. But on a comparable basis, our organic sales were up 10.2%. This is very strong performance compared to our weighted average light vehicle industry production for the quarter which was up 0.3%. We saw 25% growth in China against a production market that was down 1%. Europe revenue was up 9% compared to the 5.6% industry production growth in the quarter. North America revenue was 10% versus the 4% production decline in the quarter. And commercial vehicle was a benefit again, contributing more than 200 basis points. And then diesel-gas mix in Western Europe was a headwind but slightly lower than we expected going into the quarter. Now, let's look at the year-over-year comparison for operating income, which can be found on slide 13. Q4 adjusted operating profit was $328 million or 12.7% of sales compared to $284 million in Q4 of 2016. Our operating margin of 12.7% was 10 basis points improvement year-over-year. On a comparable basis, operating income was up $37 million on $227 million of higher sales. That gives us an incremental margin of 16.4% in a quarter, which is in line with our expectations despite incurring higher bonus accruals in the quarter. Our adjusted provision for income taxes was $85 million for an effective tax rate of 26% for the quarter. And the full-year tax rate came in at 28.2%. If you remember, our guide was 29%; so slightly better than the expectations for the full year. I would also point out that the year-over-year increase in net earnings attributable to the non-controlling interest, the growth in this line item reflects our minority partner share in earnings performance of our Chinese and consolidated joint ventures. We do expect that to increase through 2018. Now, earnings per share on a reported basis was a loss of $0.70 per share. On an adjusted basis, net earnings were $1.07 per diluted share. Now, let's take a closer look at our operating segments in the quarter beginning on slide 14 of the deck. Reported Engine segment net sales were $1.578 billion in the quarter. Sales growth for the Engine segment on a comparable basis was 8.4% as demand for our light vehicle OEM products was supplemented again by growth in our commercial vehicle business. Adjusted EBIT was $266 million for the Engine segment or 16.9% of sales. On a comparable basis, the Engine segment's adjusted EBIT was up $7 million on $117 million of higher sales for an incremental margin of 7%. This incremental margin is the result of two factors. First, this segment delivered extraordinary incremental margin performance of more than 100% in the fourth quarter 2016. So it was a difficult comparison. And second, we continued to experience year-over-year earnings headwinds in our emissions business. As James mentioned a few seconds ago, we are now exploring the sale of our thermostat and pipe product lines in the emissions business, which we believe are non-core. Now, turning to slide 15. Drivetrain segment net sales were $1.023 billion on the quarter. Sales growth for the Drivetrain segment on a comparable basis was up 13.1% primarily due to higher all-wheel drive and transmission components and strong DCT growth in China. Adjusted EBIT was $124 million for the Drivetrain segment or 12.1% of sales. On a comparable basis, the Drivetrain segment's adjusted EBIT was up $31 million on $113 million of higher sales for an incremental margin of 27%. This is very strong performance and reflects the successful ramp of new products. Before I move on to our full-year guidance, I want to summarize the charge incurred during Q4 related to the U.S. Tax Act and summarize our outlook for taxes going forward, which is on slide 16. Our Q4 tax expense was $338 million, which includes many one-time items. First, a total of $274 million is related to the 2017 Tax Act comprising of $105 million for the transitional tax, which is also known as the toll tax. Next, $64 million is the amount recorded for the reevaluation of deferred items. Also, an amount of $94 million was recorded to accrue for the anticipated withholding taxes paid to foreign jurisdictions when cash is remitted back out of those countries. And finally, there was $11 million of other tax expense related to the Tax Act for a total amount of $274 million. We are incorporating an updated tax rate of approximately 28% going forward. The largest driver of modestly higher tax rate than many of you expected is the result of withholding taxes in other countries outside the United States. However, the good news is that over time, we fully expect that that rate will likely come down further after we incorporate some structural changes. We expect cash taxes to remain in the low- to mid-20% range. Now, I'd like to discuss our 2018 guidance which we have increased from what we presented earlier in January. The increases are due to the foreign currency tailwinds and our updated effective tax rate related to the Tax Act. Turning to sales growth guidance for the full year on slide 18, we continue to expect organic growth of 5% to 7%. The Sevcon acquisition is expected to add $45 million of revenue in 2018. Currency is expected to be $170 million tailwind now. Total revenue is now expected to be in the range of $10.52 billion to $10.69 billion. Next I'll walk you through our operating income on slide 19. From a performance perspective, we expect mid- to high-teens incremental margins on net sales growth. Our consolidated operating income margin is expected to expand to 12.6% to 12.7%. To finish up our full-year guidance, please turn to slide 20. EPS guidance range is now $4.25 to $4.35 per diluted share versus the $4.15 to $4.25 previously. The increase is driven by the impacts of the lower tax rate and larger FX benefit. Free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx, is now expected to be $525 million to $575 million which is up $25 million from our previous guide. The tax rate is expected to be 28% like I mentioned earlier. Our assumptions for the dollar to euro exchange rate has been adjusted to $1.18 versus the $1.15. Just as a reminder, for every $0.01 change in the dollar to euro exchange rate equals about $30 million to $35 million of revenue. And I also want to remind you that this benefit comes through at roughly a 10% margin. So a higher FX benefit could be diluted to our full-year margin outlook. Now, our first quarter guidance can be found on slide 22. First, sales. We continue to expect organic growth of 3% to 5.5%. This is below our full-year guidance due to the launch timing and difficult year-over-year industry comparisons like James mentioned earlier. FX is expected to be a $100 million revenue benefit in the quarter. EPS is expected to be in the range of $0.99 to $1.03 and this is including a $0.02 dilutive impact from Sevcon. This guidance is based on a 28% tax rate, incorporates a $1.18 euro assumption. So my conclusion here is that the summary for Q4 and for the full year 2017 was another strong quarter and a great, great finish to the year. Organic sales growth of more than 10% despite flattish industry volumes and headwinds in the diesel-gas mix. Incremental margins improved sequentially and were just as expected throughout the year for us. And as we look forward to 2018 and beyond, we continue to drive intensity around our new product development and securing customer orders to participate in the impending electrification trend. And with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Pat. Patrick Nolan - BorgWarner, Inc.: Sharon, we're ready for questions. Operator : Your first question comes from Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning, everybody. I just wanted to ask you, the lower incremental margin in Engine, how much of that was due specifically to the underperformance in the emissions business? And can you tell us what the losses are running at in that thermostat and pipe business that's for sale? Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: Sure, Rod. This is Ron. What I would tell you is that we incurred a year-over-year headwind of about $10 million in the quarter. If you do the math a little bit, I think our margins would have been probably comparable to the prior year. So we saw significant headwinds and they actually deteriorated throughout the year. If you remember, we were seeing $5 million, $5 million, I think, $10 million, $10 million as we went throughout the year by the quarters. So it was a significant headwind for us in the quarter. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: The loss run rate from the business that's for sale? Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: Yes. The thermostats and pipes business was about a $10 million headwind for us in the quarter. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. So that is the run rate, the quarterly run rate. And can you remind us just regionally what the commercial vehicle revenue breakdown is for you today? And also just lastly, what is the size of the light vehicle diesel business after the decline that we saw in 2017? James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Yeah. Rod, this is James. So the commercial vehicle piece first. So it's about one-third. Regionally, it's about a third in the U.S. and about a third in Europe. And then the other third is split between China and South America. The other breakdown, it's about 50-50 split between on-road and off-road, if that's helpful for you. In terms of the diesel absolute number, I'm just trying to get that for you. Actually, Rod, if you don't mind, can I just unpack, kind of give that number to you offline in a separate call? Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: We can follow up with that. But back to the commercial vehicle, you said a third of it is China and South America. And that's the reason why you're expecting kind of a flat market. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Yeah, that's right. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Is because declines there. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Yeah. That's right, Pat. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: Hey, Rod, it's Ron. One more thing back on emissions. This is a higher level. So that's about a $200 million business product line for us that's incurring about a negative 10% margin. So you can do the math on that. So it's significant headwind for us throughout the year. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Right. But just on that, there are other issues that are obviously happening on the Engine business because you would have had flat margins despite the growth in the quarter. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: But take a look at last year's margins. We blew out the year in 2016, to say it politely, margins. And I remember in my script last year, I says don't model that going forward. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: It's just tough. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: It really, really didn't comp on the margins. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: Yeah. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah, got it, okay. Thank you. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thanks, Rod. Operator : Your next question comes from Chris McNally with Evercore ISI. Chris McNally - Evercore ISI : Thank you so much, guys. Just a follow-up on the diesel assumption. So a 300 to 400 basis point decline, I think that's up from \u2013 you were talking about roughly 200 to 300. As you said, the market, just the rate of decline could be something like 500 basis points. Could you just help us understand some of the precautions you're doing? How you're thinking about what if we continue to see the declines that we're seeing in the UK and Germany roll out to some of the other markets? What are the implementation plan? James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Yeah, sure. So, Chris, this is James. So the first thing, just to be clear on. So our assumption on the diesel-gas mix is the same as what it was when we gave our update in Detroit. So we're projecting a 300 to 400 basis point shift through this year. Potentially, it could be worse than that. We just don't know. We had to put a line in the sand. For every 100 basis points it moves, think of it as that's about a $20 million net revenue impact negative to the company. So it's not that huge, frankly speaking, in a meaningful way. What we're really seeing though is the majority of \u2013 the reason it's fairly small is a lot of these diesel vehicles that are not being sold and are being replaced with a gasoline vehicle, a lot of that has similar content for BorgWarner. So a turbocharged diesel vehicle in Germany or the UK, to use your example, would quickly be replaced with a petrol or gasoline turbocharged vehicle. So when you do all the math and net it out; for every 100 basis point move, it's about a $20 million impact for the company. So it's not that meaningful. I would also say, Chris, just as an anecdote if you look at last year, last year we saw a similar level of decline. And yet we still, as Ron said, delivered a 10% organic growth. It's because we found offsets in other parts of the business and we were still growing in Europe. So we're not dismissing it because it is there. But as you see, I think our ability to manage through those \u2013 that transition, we're very comfortable with that. Chris McNally - Evercore ISI : That's fantastic. So it seems like you have a transition. This is a larger question and I know you guys have addressed this before on the call. But what are you hearing in terms of how the OEMs themselves will bridge the CO2 hole between, call it, late 2018 and 2021? Because we're seeing as they lose the diesel advantage, their CO2 rates for the fleet whether it's just a lower number of vehicles or a lower demand for PATV or even 48-volt. It seems like it's going to be a problem for them as they try to hit their targets for 2020. And I'm sure you're involved in some of those conversations to bring some of the better architectures forward. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Yeah. Well, you gave a great summary, Chris, actually. That was a really terrific summary of exactly the challenges the OEMs are facing. In the short run, the strategy really is shift from diesel to gas and optimize gasoline technology. So think advanced turbos, advanced variable cam timing. What it's doing more strategically and over the mid-term horizon is it's causing an acceleration of adoption of hybrid technology. That's the real push. So that momentum towards 48-volt mild hybrids, which I talked about in my commentary, is fast accelerating. I would say the other thing that's happening in parallel is they're looking to get the most advanced gasoline technology that they can because there's still optimization you can do on the gasoline engine to get it more diesel-like type performance. So you're right. We're right in the middle of those conversations. And frankly speaking, it's utilizing a lot of our technology. But the pragmatic thing is it's an acceleration of hybrid and electric technology and rapidly cranking up the efficiencies on the gasoline engine. So more advanced turbos, more advanced variable cam timing and hybrid technology to go with that. So that's really what we're seeing, Chris. Chris McNally - Evercore ISI : Great. Thank you, gentlemen. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thanks for taking the questions. And, James, just transitioning here as you did, talking about the hybrid and electric pipeline. If this characterization is wrong, please correct me. But it seems like geographically, what's in the backlog so far for hybrid and electric wins may be heavily China-weighted. So at what point, are we looking at 12 months from now or sooner or further down the line, does that start to sort of even out a little bit more geographically, get more of Europe in the balance, for example? Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: James. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Yeah. Now what I would say as you look at the \u2013 at least through the three-year window with the backlog, the initial piece of the backlog is a little China-weighted. And that's predominantly because of a lot of the eGearDrive technology that we'd been launching in China. But as the backlog rolls out and flows out, you're seeing that regional balance become more balanced, frankly, as we launch hybrid technologies globally but heavily in Europe. And then as you kick on beyond the backlog, then it becomes even more geographically balanced. So I think you're right. In the short run, in the next year or so; it's a little China-oriented. And then that balance becomes much more balanced, frankly, as you go forward over the next two or three years. Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: So just to make sure I'm understanding this right. What's already in backlog includes more geographic balance, say, two or three years from now out of the three-year net backlog? James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Yeah. Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay, great. And then just after tax reform with repatriation opportunities, how much cash do you think you'll bring back? And what's your view to spending on M&A versus buybacks at this point? Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: I'd say that \u2013 the way we look at this is that the Tax Act is going to make it very flexible to bring back cash. So as far as bringing it back like next week or next quarter, we don't have a significant need for the cash right now. But just having that flexibility is fantastic. A couple of years ago, we went through a lot of work to restructure to get cash to have a buyback program and a dividend program and to bring cash back. And this makes it a lot easier. I would say going forward, we are reevaluating our dividend policy. We are reevaluating stock purchases. Our stock repurchase program for this year is $100 million. But all of those decisions will have to be updated and reevaluated, what it means for the company. The thing I'm looking forward to is that we can deploy more capital back to the shareholders in, I would say, efficient way and a more flexible way going forward. But I think you're going to have to wait as far as us really giving our strategies to you folks going forward, okay? James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Yeah, no. Ron gave a good summary. The only thing that I would just say to you from my perspective \u2013 we do remain \u2013 continue to monitor M&A opportunity and particularly in the electronics, power electronics type space. We're very happy with Sevcon so far. That's going really well. But I think it's fair to say we would want to be on some level of M&A activity over the next couple of years to utilize that cash, particularly complementary deals such as Sevcon. It's the way to think of it. Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets. Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: Good morning, Joe. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Good morning, Joe. Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC : James, thanks for all the color on the puts and takes to the first quarter organic guidance. I was wondering if we could talk a little bit though about what you expect on the margins because it looks like the first quarter guidance assumes total company margins are about flat year-over-year. And if I recall correctly in the first quarter of last year, you had about a $5 million lease termination thing which is like 20 bps. That should reverse out, which implies the segments here would actually be down a little bit year-over-year. I just want to make sure I'm thinking about that right. And if that's true, what the drivers are there? Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: That's correct, Joe, on the math. I would say that the first quarter is some transitional costs probably again that we're seeing operationally probably in the emissions business as well. We got to get that business right-sized. And we're a bit cautious about what that transition is going to cost us. The second item is that North America changeover of one of our major launches is going to impact us as well. It's a profitable product line for us. And that launch, as it starts to gear up in the second and third quarter, will give us some momentum. So it's two items. I'd say it's emissions headwind a little bit as well as this launch in North America. Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC : And the launch is across both segments or more in Engine? Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: It's going to be in the Engine \u2013 I'm sorry, it's in the Drivetrain group. Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay, Drivetrain. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: It's a four-wheel drive launch program. Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. And then just to follow on, I guess, one of the prior questions, a bigger picture on tax reform here. You guys are always sort of been active out there in the market. You seem like you have a big pipeline. I think one of the things we've heard over the years is maybe some hesitance for companies to sell stuff because of tax implications or tax leakage or stuff. And I'm wondering if any of that has sort of changed yet in sort of what you're seeing in discussions or pipeline or if it's still a little bit too early for that or just broadly, if you think this makes it easier to actually consummate deals. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: Joe, that's a good question. I can tell you right now that in the M&A discussions that we're having that language hasn't come up about it being more favorable to release those assets and not have as much of a tax headwind. But I think that's going to play out over time. I'd have to think about that. But I have not had that discussion with our investment bankers that certain individuals would be looking to divest their assets now because it's more in a tax advantage position for them. But it's an interesting concept. I'd have to think about it longer, Joe. Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Thank you. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thanks, Joe. Operator : Your next question comes from David Tamberrino with Goldman Sachs. David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey, great. Thanks for taking my questions. Ron, you mentioned on the tax plan that you're looking at a few things longer term to continue to maybe grind that down. I think some of us were expecting a little bit lower today. Where do you think your tax rate could get to over the medium term and how many years do you think it will take to establish kind of getting there? Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: Yeah, David. Let me talk about what the items would be. David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Sure. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: There's two main areas that we're looking at. One of them is when we bring cash back through different legal entities, if we can restructure those legal entities to lower that tax rate. I won't go into greater details, but that's one area. I'll just mention it's kind of out of Asia as we bring cash back and that will be significant to us. The other area is the way that intellectual property reimbursements go across borders right now. And we can change our strategy of where intellectual property is. Those two items would probably take over the course of one to two years to implement now. So that's the timing. As far as the rate, I hate to give you a number. But you can probably go down to the mid 20s fairly quickly in that number, 23%, 24% probably is a good number. But don't hold me to that number because this is a lot of work that we have to do to go through it. But the best part of all this I just mentioned is there is a pathway to lower that rate. So we're real confident we'll get there. We just got to have our tax folks do the work. David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Understood. Look, that's incredibly helpful. And then James just on power electronics, how big of a business are you looking to buy versus eventually build? And thinking about M&A there, what technology or further capabilities are really needed that the OEMs are asking for in your conversations? James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Yeah. No, it's a good question, David. So the way I would think about is what we have today with the acquisition of Sevcon, we're in a really good spot. And the reason for that is we've been investing pretty significantly over the last two or three years to build our organic internal electronics capability and knowhow. And we've done a nice job there. And then Sevcon added scale and obviously some actual products also. The key thing to think up for us as our power electronics strategy and the way to think of it is that we're not necessarily looking to be, quote, a big power electronics supplier of standalone power electronics, widgets or componentry. What we're all about is complementary power electronics knowhow and products to work in conjunction with our products. That's the real strategy that we're pursuing. So we're not looking to add big scale and capacity just to go compete as a standalone power electronics guy. What we're looking is to add discrete technology that's complementary to our product offering. And the reason for that, David, simply put, is we're a propulsion system player. And in order to do that, you need obviously engine technology, you need drivetrain technology and you need power electronics knowhow and hardware that you can integrate and offer the OEM a complete solution. So all of that said, the way to think of it is if we can add another Sevcon or another couple of Sevcons over the next couple of years, that would be really good because it would just build more scale, more capability, more engineering, horsepower, frankly. That's really the strategy, if that helps you. David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: No, it does. And are you finding that there's a plethora of those assets out there to look at or is it going to be harder to find as we think about other companies as well looking to beef up their technical capabilities through the shift towards EV architecture? James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Yeah, the way to think of it, David, there are quite a few companies out there that do that. The interesting thing is it's very rare you find a pure play. What I mean by that is you'll often have companies that have power electronics capability, but they're involved in multiple end markets. Now, they may be into industrials and other spaces. So what it's about is finding one that either has good automotive technology or the ability, such as Sevcon, that does have some automotive technology. But their industrial and commercial vehicle technology is very readily applicable to light vehicle technology. So not a lot of pure plays out there, David, but certainly players out there that could add capability and scale for us that we're continuing to monitor. David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Understood. I appreciate the time. Thank you, gentlemen. Operator : Your next question comes from Brian Johnson with Barclays. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Good morning. I want to talk a little bit about the backlog. As I kind of look at the distribution of your \u2013 the time series of your backlog over time, it picks up in 2020 and is a bit softer in 2018. Now, you've historically had that pattern going way back. But I know more recently you've tried to risk-adjust your backlog at least for the near term. So really kind of two questions. One, what are the puts and takes within your $650 million to $730 million guide around risk adjustment for either macro conditions, customer schedules, mix? And then, secondly, I know powertrain is very different from other sectors like seating where the awards are much more short cycle. But as you kind of look to 2020 based on the discussions you're having, would any of those help the 2020 backlog or are those really in the next backlog update? James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Yeah. Let me see if I can help you, Brian. So the way to think of it is, I would characterize it that the, let's say the methodology shift, if you wish, that we made a year or two ago where we applied a little bit more of a rigid macro potential downside and launch cadence. It's the same methodology we're using for this backlog, if that helps you. So it's continuing on what we've done for the last couple of years. And the reason I say that is we've executed well over the last couple of years as you know. And so I feel it's well-apportioned with the backlog that we've got out now. It's not something that we've just really taken dramatic haircuts. It's not. I think it's set very appropriately is my view. I think the one dynamic that's a little different about our backlog than some prior year backlogs that you may find interesting is our product breadth and product portfolio is much broader than it was historically and regionally balanced. We're better regional balance than we were historically where we're a little less dependent on Europe. And I think that helps us actually. I think that helps us have even more confidence in the ability to deliver the backlog. So that's how I would characterize it, Brian. I think if you look at it by products, you still have a good portion of turbo growth in there. We do see strong DCT growth in there. So all in all, we feel really good about this. And we're confident we're going to execute it frankly. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Second question which is somewhat housekeeping, somewhat restructuring. Your 28% GAAP tax rate, 20% cash tax rate, is it fair to assume you have some legal tax entities that are unable to use deferred tax assets and so hence you don't get the losses flowing through for that? Is that related to your emissions business? And how long do you expect the cash tax rate to run below GAAP? Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: The first question you had there. No, it has nothing to do with the impact of losing any kind of credits through legal entities. We fully utilize all of our foreign tax credits in the process. So, no, that doesn't apply. And the second is our long-term plan is always to have our cash tax lower than our GAAP tax rate. The only time you have differences is, quite frankly, Brian, is when you have settlements with the closing of tax audits. Those are typically when you see unusual items on a cash basis and those are just one-offs. But normally on a run rate basis, you'll expect it to be lower. And the only difference is our tax settlements with tax years. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. So it's more structurally in terms of \u2013 can I assume that... Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: Right. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: ...the expenses and the CapEx you get to depreciate, bonus depreciation and so forth as opposed to anything like the OEMs not being able to write off losses under GAAP in money-losing geographies. Okay, thanks. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: Correct. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thanks, Brian. Operator : Your last question comes from Richard Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning, everyone. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Hi, Rich. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: Hey, Rich. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : On North America, so the last couple of quarters \u2013 last quarter you had a 20-point spread versus underlying production. This quarter is 14%. How should we think about this year? It seems like you have very good momentum there. I know there has been some key launches and obviously truck market shares are very high. But just how do we think about the cadence over the course of 2018 in terms of outperformance? James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: You're thinking North America specifically, Rich, or - Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Yeah, North America specifically. You've had really good outperformance there. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Yeah. We still expect good outperformance in 2018 versus the market. I don't have a specific number in my mind actually, Rich, but we can get you that. But we do see good. I think the one thing what we do see is in the quarter, we have the changeover program that we're dealing with on the truck side that Ron alluded to earlier. So Q1, it'll be distorted a little bit by that truck changeover. But I think we'll have good outperformance. It probably won't be quite as high as we did last year, but it's still pretty good. But I'll have Pat and Ron try and get you a bit more specificity, Rich, so we can get a number to you. But think of it as good outgrowth in North America but probably not quite at the high level of last year. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay, I appreciate that. And then two for Ron here. Just to clarify, the emissions losses on the non-core stuff; that's part of guidance, correct? That's within the Engine \u2013 well, that's how we should model it correctly? Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: Yes. So the 2018 guidance includes the operating performance of the pipe and thermostat business. And what I was trying to allude to was that in the quarter one, we just have to execute basically what's in our plan at this point. So our puts and takes could be we could execute better, we could execute worse than what's in the plan. The restructuring costs will be all called out, okay. It won't be in the run rate in the margins. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Sure. But that $10 million is the run rate, correct, $10 million loss? Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: Yes, correct. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : And you don't expect that to be any worse or any better. That's kind of the run rate we should think about. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: That's the run rate that you should expect, correct. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: Now, obviously, we're going to try to improve it, right, and not make it worse. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Right. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: But that's what's in the guidance right now. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Right, okay. And just real quick on free cash flow. So CapEx is going up. That explains some of the miss or I should say the decline in free cash flow. Like you had a very good year in 2017. Is there something going on in working cap? Looks like there's maybe $30 million or so gap there relative to the free cash flow guidance and then the CapEx increase. Just anything noteworthy there? Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: No, I don't think there's anything noteworthy on that right now. It would be working capital. A couple of things you have to note is we have to build banks in the emissions business to move the products back into other plants that we want to move. So that's one issue is the bank builds throughout 2018. But the other side, the more positive side is there are some opportunities to improve it that we're working on. So that's where we're at right now. We're working on some opportunities, but we do see some headwinds of bank builds. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. This makes sense. Thank you. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thanks, Rich. Patrick Nolan - BorgWarner, Inc.: I'd like to thank you all for your great questions today. With that, Sharon, you can close the call. Operator : That does conclude the BorgWarner 2017 fourth quarter and full-year results conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Operator : Good morning. My name is Dan, and I'll be your conference facilitator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BorgWarner 2018 First Quarter Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. I would now like to turn the call over to Patrick Nolan, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Nolan, you may begin your conference. Patrick Nolan - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thank you, Dan. Good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining us. We issued our earnings release at 6 :30 AM Eastern Time. It's posted on our website, borgwarner.com, on our homepage, and on our Investor Relations homepage. Before we begin our call, I need to inform you that, during this call, we may make forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties as detailed in our 10-K. Our actual results may differ significantly from the matters discussed today. During our presentation, we'll highlight certain non-GAAP measures in order to provide a clearer picture of how our core business performed and for comparison purposes with prior periods. When you hear us say on a comparable basis, this means excluding the impact of FX, net M&A and other non-comparable items. When you hear us say adjusted, excluding non-comparable items, that means on a non-comparable basis. When you hear us say on a reported basis, that means U.S. GAAP. Now, back to today's call. First, James Verrier, our President and CEO, will comment on the industry followed by high-level overview of our Q1 results and full-year outlook. Then, we will discuss some of our recent product wins. Then, Ron Hundzinski, our CFO, will discuss the details of our guidance as well as our results. Please note that we've posted our earnings call presentation. At the IR page of our website, you'll find the link in the Events & Presentations section beneath the notice for the call. We encourage you to follow along with these slides during our discussion. With that, I'll turn it over to James. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thank you, Pat, and good morning, everybody. Ron and I are really pleased actually to share our results today from Q1 2018 and also give you an update on our progress as we march towards delivering our 2018 target. Before I get going, I do realize many of you on the call have been taking a lot of calls this morning, so I'm going to try and keep my prepared remarks a little shorter than usual Albeit, I'll cover all the main points. So, let me kick off by sharing a few thoughts on the macro environment and the industry. And for those of you following along, we're on slide number 6 in the deck. So at a high level, I would start with this. Our growth over the market was a little stronger than we'd expected in the quarter. And during that same time, global light vehicle production was a little bit weaker than anticipated and, hence, our growth versus the market was a little stronger. If I give you some background on Q1 from an industry perspective, basically, global light vehicle production came in about 2% for the quarter versus our expectation of it being pretty much flat as we went into the quarter. If I break that down a little bit for you regionally, so European light vehicle production was down slightly with some volume pushed into Q2. We saw the continued shift from diesel to gas mix in Europe and I'll share a little bit more commentary on that later. We saw diesel share in the quarter declined by about 760 basis points from a year over comparison to Q1. Let me switch to China. So, China light vehicle production was down 3% year-over-year and that was pretty much in-line with what our expectations were as we started the quarter. From a North American perspective in light vehicle, industry production declined almost 3%, but we did note that mix was holding up particularly well. The other thing of note from an industry perspective is growth in our CV business continued and that did somewhat offset some of the like \u2013 the lower light vehicle industry trends. Let me continue on a little bit from an industry perspective and shift more towards a full-year view. So our expectations for the full year, global light vehicle industry is very consistent with our prior forecast. So, what that means it implies global production growth of approximately 1% when you adjust for our geographical exposure. Again, just quickly walking through the regions for you, we expect China growth of about 1% to 2%, we see Europe up similar level between 1% and 2% and North America flat to up slightly. From a commercial vehicle perspective, we do expect to see some benefit in the coming quarters, though we are assuming a little bit of a lower benefit than we saw in Q1. So, if you look at that, our industry assumptions appear to be pretty balanced, and I would say consistent with how we started the year, the view that we had coming into the year. So, some highlights there. With the commercial vehicle, we're going to continue to watch and see if that commercial vehicle volume will continue to be sustained. China, we continue to pay a lot of attention too as we expect modest industry growth in 2018, maybe some potential upside in the back half. And on the downside, we're obviously paying a lot of attention to the diesel gas mix where we're expecting at least a 500-basis point shift from diesel to gas mix in the year of 2018. And we continue, like, I think, everybody looking to get better feels for diesel inventory in Europe, so we can get a better track on that. But the key for all of that, if I step back for a moment, is that we're going to continue to expect to outgrow the markets in 2018 by the continued strong demand for our products. Talking about products, let me just add a little bit of commentary what we're seeing in the world relative to hybrid and electric programs and how that's evolving. I would say the key message really is our customers are continuing to march very strongly towards adoption of hybrids and electrics, particularly with some of the regulatory uncertainty out there. All of the automakers are realizing they need that balance mix in their fleet between combustion, hybrid and electric and, naturally, we're working very closely with them. For us specifically at BorgWarner, I'm very encouraged by the hybrid and electric programs we've secured to-date. You start to see some of that flowing through to our press releases. And what we're going to do is, as we get to our Analyst Day in September, we'll be giving you a thorough and full overview of the progress we've been making around hybrids and electrics. So, the key and the punch line for us is two things : We're going to continue to expect to book more growth and gain what we need to do from a business booking perspective for hybrid and electric; and we were really confident that our portfolio off products allows us to do that. So, we're very confident and comfortable in our product mix inside the company. Let me move to slide 7 now and give you a little bit of a view of our Q1 results and our outlook for 2018. So I'll start with Q1 results, and I'd say overall I was very pleased. We came in with our organic growth above our guidance, as I said, in a slightly weaker market and solid incremental margin performance, which Ron will cover in some detail. We recorded $2.8 billion of sales, which is a quarterly record for us and that's up 6.6% organically when you exclude FX and Sevcon. And again, this compares to our end market exposure of down 2%. Regionally came in pretty much as we'd expected. We saw very strong growth for the company in China. We also saw positive light vehicle revenue trends in Europe and North America despite declines in industry volume. This light vehicle growth was supplemented by positive revenue trends in commercial vehicle off-road. From an EPS perspective, we delivered $1.10, which expressed non-comparable items. And for comparison purposes versus the quarter last year, that's a 21% year-over-year improvement in our EPS, which is outstanding performance. Operating margin is solid at 12.2%. And again, Ron will provide more color and commentary on that. Let me switch to give you a little bit of a high level view for the full year. Our organic growth rate is unchanged, but once again we're going to be increasing our EPS forecast, largely driven by FX, which again Ron will cover in his remarks. So, we continue to expect organic growth of 5% to 7% year-over-year in a market that is flat to up 1%. And we still see our consolidated operating income margin expected to expand between 10 basis points and 20 basis points year-over-year. I'd like to move to slide 8 for those following along and just talk a little bit about some of the highlights of recent announcements. And again, it was another strong quarter for us where we booked a lot of business across the portfolio in combustion, hybrid and electric. I'm just going to highlight three that you see on the slide here that I think were particularly important for us. First one, you see, we were very pleased to win a 2018 Automotive News PACE Award for our S-wind wire forming process for electric motors and alternators. And for those of you that have listened to me talk about this for the last couple of years, I've spoken a lot about motors are not just motors. There's a lot of technology in the types of motors that we're using, both from a product and a process design point of view. And for our perspective, this is strong validation of that from an external party. So very pleased with that one. We also announced that we'll be supplying our eGearDrive transmission for two First Automotive Works Group electric vehicles. And we also have there, we're supplying our Electro-Mechanical On-Demand transfer case for the Ram 1500 4x4 pickup truck, which is a terrifically good program for BorgWarner. So again, the message is consistent. This balanced approach of winning business and growing across all three propulsion systems for combustion, hybrid and electric remains on track and remains very strong for us. So let me take a few moments to close before I turn over to Ron. Q1 was a great start to the year for us, very strong performance both top line and bottom line. We're feeling very confident about our full-year outlook, which will be another strong growth year for the company. And really importantly from where I sit, the year-to-date new business wins that we've achieved across combustion, hybrid and electric continues to give me a lot of confidence in the long-term growth and balance across propulsion for the company. So great start to the year. And with that, let me turn it over to Ron. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. Before I review the financial details, I would like to provide you some of the highlights as I see them for the quarter. First, as James has said, the quarter was strong and a solid start to the year. Second, organic growth was better than our expectations. And I should note it was a record sales quarter despite weaker industry volumes. And finally, we are maintaining the organic growth guidance, but we're increasing our EPS guidance based on FX benefits. Now, as Pat mentioned, I will be referring to supplemental financial slide deck that is posted on our website, so I encourage you to follow along. Let's turn to slide 10. On a reported basis, sales were up 15.7%. On a comparable basis, our organic sales was up 6.6%. Very strong performance compared to our weighted average light vehicle industry production for the quarter, which was down 2%. We saw a 29% growth in China against production market that was down 3%. Europe revenue was up 7% compared to the 1% industry production decline in the quarter. North America revenue was up 3% versus the 3% production decline in the quarter. Commercial vehicle was a benefit, contributing about 100 basis points of growth. And diesel and gas mix in Western Europe was a headwind for us. Now, let's look at the year-over-year comparison for operating income, which can be found on slide 11. Q1 adjusted operating profit was $339 million \u2013 this, again, was a quarterly record as well \u2013 compared to $292 million in Q1 of 2017. Our operating margin of 12.2% was a 10-basis point improvement year-over-year. However, if you excluded the tailwind from FX and Sevcon, margins would have expanded some 30 basis points to 40 basis points. On a comparable basis, operating income was up $26 million on $157 million of higher sales. That gives us an incremental margin of 17% in the quarter, which is a bit better than our expectations due to better cost performance and a lower headwind from our non-core emissions business. On adjusted provision for income tax basis was $85 million for an effective tax rate of 28% for the quarter. I would also point out the year-over-year increase in net earnings attributable to non-controlling interest and the growth in this line item reflects our minority partner share in the earnings performance of our Chinese consolidated joint ventures. We do expect this to increase throughout 2018. Earnings per share on a reported basis was $1.07 per basic share. On an adjusted basis, net earnings were $1.10 per diluted share. And as James said, that's an increase of 21% year-over-year. Now, let's take a closer look at our operating segments in the quarter beginning on slide 12. Reported Engine segment sales were $1.716 billion in the quarter. Sales growth for the Engine segment on a comparable basis was 4.9% as demand for our light vehicle OEM products was supplemented by growth from our commercial vehicle sales. I would note that we reclassified Sevcon battery charging business into our Engine segment as we believe this business is better fit with our commercial vehicle and aftermarket business, which primarily resides in this segment. Adjusted EBIT was $280 million for the Engine segment or 16.3% of sales. On a comparable basis, the Engine segment's adjusted EBIT was up $16 million on $74 million of sales for an incremental margin up 22%. This incremental margin is a result of two factors. First, the segment was very strong in overall cost performance in the quarter. And second, headwinds from our non-core emissions business were less than we expected going into the quarter. Turning to slide 13, Drivetrain segment net sales were $1.083 billion in the quarter. Sales growth for the Drivetrain segment on a comparable basis was 9.2%, primarily due to higher strong DCT growth in China and transmission components in four-wheel drive as well. Adjusted EBIT was $121 million for the Drivetrain segment or 11.2% of sales. On a comparable basis, the Drivetrain segment adjusted EBIT was up $13 million on $85 million of higher sales for an incremental margin of 15%, and this is good performance and reflects the successful ramp of new programs. Now, I'd like to discuss our 2018 guidance, which we have increased due to higher foreign currency tailwinds. Turning to sales growth guidance for the full year on slide 15. We continue to expect organic growth of 5% to 7%. The Sevcon acquisition is expected to add $50 million to revenue 2018. Currency is expected to be a $400 million tailwind now, that's up from $170 million, and total revenues now expected to be in the range of $10.77 billion to $10.94 billion. Next, I'll walk you through our operating income on slide 16. From a performance perspective, we expect mid- to high-teens incremental margins on sales growth. Our consolidated operating income margin is expected to expand to 12.5% to 12.6%. I would point out that this margin guidance is in line with our guidance prior to the reclassification of a pension income adjustment, which is in accordance with the new accounting standard. And for those of you who are interested, it's FASB ASU No. 2017-07. This is a 10 bps impact versus our original guidance, but with no EPS impact. To finish up the full year guidance, please turn to slide 17. EPS guidance range is now $4.30 per diluted share to $4.40 per diluted share versus $4.25 per diluted share to $4.35 per diluted share previously. Like I said before, the increase is driven by the impact of larger FX benefit. This EPS guidance does include a $0.06 year-over-year EPS headwind related to higher minority interest and lower equity income. We continue to expect free cash flow to be in the $525 million to $575 million range. The tax rate is remaining the same at 28% and our assumption for the dollar to euro exchange rate has been adjusted to approximately $1.22 from $1.18. Now, our second quarter guidance is on slide 19. For sales, we continue to expect organic growth of 7% to 9%. This is above our full-year guidance, primarily due to stronger year-over-year industry production. EPS is expected to be in a range of $1.09 to $1.11 including a $0.02 year-over-year headwind from higher minority interest and lower equity income. This guidance is based on a 28% tax rate and incorporates $1.23 [to] \u20ac1 assumption or about $125 million revenue benefit year-over-year. So in conclusion, let me summarize quarter one. It was another strong quarter to start the year, as James and I mentioned earlier. Organic sales growth of 6.6% despite decline in industry volume. The Q1 incremental margin of 17% was slightly better than expectations. And as we look at the remainder of 2018 and beyond, we see substantial opportunities to participate in impending electrification trend while our combustion-related business continues to outpace market growth. And with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Pat. Patrick Nolan - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thank you, Ron. Dan, we're ready for questions. Operator : Thank you. We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Your first question comes from the line of David Leiker with Baird. Your line is now open. David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hi. Good morning, everyone. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Good morning, David. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: Good morning, David. David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Two questions. First, a numbers question. The working capital number I'm guessing is distorted a little bit by currency and FX, but I thought reasonable amount here year-over-year. Any thoughts on that? Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: The only thing is this is a general trend in the first quarter. Working capital is needed to get into production after the fourth quarter where volumes ramp down, David. I would say that, year-over-year, we were not alarmed. Our ratios of days on sale for inventory and receivables was pretty much payables, was a little bit of what we probably pay their bills a little bit quicker basically. And then the emissions as well probably had an impact on it. So, nothing alarming. We're still holding our full-year cash forecast. David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then, secondly, on the portfolio products that you're billing out for hybrids and EVs. I guess two different parts of this, one from the drive motor, the gearbox. What do you need to do there? Is there anything you need to do there to broaden that product range at all and what the timing is of bringing those types of products to market? And then, secondly, as you're out there booking a lot of great new business, new contracts there, do you have any sense what your win rate or market share is of those programs that you're going after? James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: So, David, this is James. I would say the first thought I would share with you, we're very, very happy with the technology that we got from a drive motor and a gearbox perspective and now obviously with the added power electronics capability we've got from Sevcon, that's just strengthened us. So, we have a lineup of motors and we have a lineup of gearboxes that run the full range needed for hybrid and electrics. And actually that's why you can probably tell in my comments that we're booking really well. And so we're picking up the business that we need to and you're starting to see that flow through the press releases. I can have Pat, actually, David, give you the amount we've actually secured this year on eGearDrives and motors because of some specific data. But I would say in general, if I look back six months ago to the Investor Day, David, on what we'd hoped to book around hybrid applications and electric, I would say we're ahead. I don't have a number to give you in terms of revenue or percentage. We can work on that with you, but I would say directionally we're absolutely running ahead of where I thought we would be both in terms of win rates, absolute bookings, and dollars. I just don't have that specific info with me, but we're definitely doing well, and we have the portfolio needed. I don't need to go and add anything beyond what we've got to keep \u2013 to deliver on the growth that we've got out there. David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay, congratulations. Congratulations on the (00:23:44) contract. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Yeah, thanks. David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Or award, yeah. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks, David. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Colin Langan with UBS. Your line is now open. Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Hey, Colin. Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Any color on how much diesel mix as a headwind within the quarter? I know it looked pretty bad, so I was \u2013 want an update there and if you could also maybe update the dollar exposure, I think you've said in the past like 80 cents on the dollar gas-diesel ratio? James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Yeah, Colin. So for the quarter, it was 760 bps year-over-year shift from diesel to gas for the quarter. And for the full year, we're estimating about 500 bps full year, year-over-year 2017 to 2018 diesel to gas mix. And for every 100 bps it moves, it's a net revenue impact for BorgWarner of about $20 million to $25 million. Did that help you? Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC : No, it's very helpful. And that \u2013 when your initial guidance was a 200 basis points to 300 basis points decline, so is it a bit worse? James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Yeah, 300 basis points to 400 basis points is how we started the year, Colin. So, we're trending a little worse than what we'd expected because we've now shifted to about 500 basis points to 600 basis points. And like I said, the first quarter was 760 basis points down. So, that's kind of where we're at right now. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: Okay, I just like to add some (00:25:13). That's what the market is doing. We're not seeing, again, in 2018 the full impact that we did, the same thing happened to us in 2017. The market's moving faster than what we're actually experiencing in our business. Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Yeah. Got it. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Colin, one of the thing not to overdo \u2013 these things drive you crazy, but obviously we're talking light vehicle here, just to separate the commercial vehicle aspect. Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Yeah. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: And actually, the irony of this which is kind of cool for us is that strength in commercial vehicle is pretty much offsetting that light vehicle diesel shift. So, that's why we're delivering the outcomes we're doing. Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. And any thoughts on the potential for the U.S. fuel economy fares to get pushed out? Do you think that helps your Engine product and then maybe they have a longer life? Does this really make a difference to your business? Any color there? James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Yeah. So, that's a fair question and we \u2013 like everybody else, we don't really know. We know obviously there's a lot of discussions going on. There's a lot of review going on. I think the sentiment is one of, if anything, it's kind of relaxing \"the standard\" a little bit. But here's what we do now, Colin. The rate of improvement and efficiency required across all three architectures : combustion, hybrid, electric. Has to continue to climb from where we are today. So on combustion, what that's going to mean is more advanced turbos, more advanced variable cam timing, et cetera. That's what's driving our growth. As we're optimizing, get more efficient on the combustion products. And hybrids and electrics obviously, we've got a strong portfolio. So the net for us as a company, Colin, we have growth in all three vehicle types : combustion, hybrid and electric. What happens for us is with the different OEMs, the mix of hybrid, electric and combustion will vary a little bit depending on the adoption rate and the climb with the standards. But for us, net-net, we're growing independent of that shift or slowdown or acceleration of standards. Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. All right. Thank you very much for taking my question. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thank you, Colin. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thank you, Colin. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning, everybody. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Hey, Rod. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: Good morning, Rod. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: I had a couple questions. First one, I just want to apologize just given the number of companies that have reported today, I should have dissected this already, but your full-year guidance change basically appears to reflect the upside from Q1 when I look at the earnings per share. Can you just clarify, for the rest of the year, it sounds like you raised your FX assumption, but did you offset that with downward revisions to diesel mix or something else? Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: No. We're still concerned about our emissions business going forward. They had one great quarter and they gave us good tailwind. I'm not in a position. I don't think we are as a management team to say it's going to continue the headwinds going forward, Rod. So, we're just going to watch that business quarter-by-quarter until we sell it. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And that was actually my second question, just on that emissions business. How much of a drag was that at this point and what's your timing on resolving this? Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: So going into the quarter, we anticipate it would be about a $5 million per quarter headwind for the first two quarters and then it would kind of even us up out in the back half of the year. We didn't see all the $5 million headwind in the first quarter, Rod. Now, that's not to say \u2013 we're cautious. They did very well and we're all supporting them. But to have that flow through for the year here is premature. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Rod, and maybe I can just give you a little bit of an update on what we're doing with the business more strategically. So the plan obviously was to sell and divest the thermostat and pipe, non-core product lines, and that's moving along as planned, Rod. So what that means is we've used the first quarter to really get some of the ground work done in terms of marketing the business. We'll be moving into that over the next 60 days. And I would say, our early thoughts are it's a good opportunity and a good business for somebody. We're not the natural owner or the best owner for that business. But I would say we're comfortable, and I think we'll get a sale. We just need another quarter to go through the process, frankly, of engagement with potential buyers, and then I think we'll know more. But we're encouraged by early interest in terms of being able to move that business out of our portfolio as we go through the year. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, thank you. And just one more if I could just slip this in. It sounds like there's a pretty significant pickup in electrification and other technologies that are being added to comply with the regulation, particularly in Europe. Was wondering if just from your perspective in speaking to customers, are you hearing about anything more strategic vis-\u00e0-vis their plans for Europe? There just seems to be a little bit more of a recognition that some segments are structurally challenged. And it's hard for your customers to pass along some of these cost increases. What do you think that might mean for you, just in terms of the volumes or those relationships over time? James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Yeah. It's a good question, Rod. Our view is, I would say generally from certainly where we were six months or a year ago, the pace and acceleration towards electrification has increased in Europe for sure. I think an element of that obviously is the transition from diesel to gas of course is accelerating that for obvious reasons. I would say too each OEM is kind of looking at it, what is best solution obviously for them uniquely with their portfolio. But a couple of things that are fairly consistent. The march to 48-volt technology continues to gain momentum, and we see that 48-volt mild hybrid technology is the prevalent solution or a growing solution, if that makes sense. I would tell you, our quote activity in that space is intensified. And that's obviously great for BorgWarner because we've got clutching and motors to help provide that solution. And then EVs are obviously in scope too. That varies a little bit by OEM, particularly on the fleet size and the fleet mix, right? But net-net, the march is definitely getting faster. It's getting stronger. And I would say 48-volt mild hybrid is surfacing to the top. And EVs, if anything, are getting pulled forward. And they're all having to adjust quicker than they thought they would because of the diesel gas mix shift, if that helps you. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Okay, thank you. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thanks, Rod. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Good morning. Good morning. So on the organic growth, you outperformed your own prior expectations by 200 bps for the quarter at midpoint, even despite the diesel headwind and the lower industry production. I think we have some of the elements of it here from your prepared remarks, but can we just pin down really what were some of the major contributing factors leading to that higher organic growth versus the outlook? James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Yeah, sure, Noah, this is James. The two things that I would say are the most meaningful, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, commercial vehicle was a little stronger. If you remember, we came into the year with a view that really no growth for commercial vehicle for us. And we saw some growth there in commercial vehicle. So that contributed probably 100 bps of, let's say, the better performance or stronger growth. And then I would just say the overall view of the backlog in terms of launch was a little stronger, and that's a mixture there, Noah, some of the programs maybe came in slightly quicker, some ran a little faster than what we'd started into the year. And I would say those are the two kind of primary drivers of what allowed us to get a little bit higher than our organic growth, if that makes sense to you. Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Yeah, no, that's very helpful. And then, the China show \u2013 the China Auto Show that's ongoing, clearly, the EV models are being showcased here, right, ahead of the quota requirements that are going to kick in. And then we've had the announcement around ownership liberalization. And I was just wondering kind of what's your view of the potential impact to the business. Obviously, local content requirement on batteries, that doesn't impact your ability with your products to play in the market. Would this at all help you to increase your market share in electrification? How to think about that effect? James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Yeah. I'd give you a couple of thoughts, Noah. So first off, I think you know this, that China is a major growth engine for us as a company and actually has been for the last year or two, for sure, and continues to be very strong. It was over 30% of our backlog that was derived from China. The other data point I would tell you is we have seen over the last two or three years the fastest adoption of pure electric, battery electric vehicle technology has been in China, and we've been right there with that. If you look at some of the eGearDrive announcements that we've made over the last few quarters, that's evidence that we're strongly in there. We've obviously also launched our electric drive module, which is a combination of both the motor and the gearbox. And then the other thing I would share, Noah, that you may find useful is what we find particularly with the domestic OEMs adopting technology at a very fast pace. They really do rely quite heavily on propulsion system partners such as us. And the reason for that is we bring all of the discrete technologies and can put them together as a system for them. And that's what we've seen in some of our bookings and some of our win rates. So we found their adoption is aggressive and their reliance on partners such as us has been very strong. So all of that put together, we see tremendous EV growth in China. We're right there with them and we're seeing also more and more adoption of hybrid technology where we're also there. So, this is all super positive for BorgWarner and good for China as well, Noah. Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thanks very much for the color. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line Armintas Sinkevicius from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Armintas Sinkevicius - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Good morning. Armintas Sinkevicius - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: You've made a lot of progress towards becoming propulsion agnostic. But when I look at the slide from Detroit or the Investor Day where you have the content per vehicle and the participation rate, the content per vehicle is going up as we transition to different architectures. But your participation is trending lower. I know it's early days, but can you help me think about where \u2013 how you think about being propulsion agnostic? And, in my mind, it would be where the content per vehicle times the participation rate starts to even out. And it's certainly moving in that direction. But do you see that ultimately as being the equilibrium? And if so, what are the factors to get there? James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Yeah. So, yeah, this is James. Let me maybe give you a little bit of color on what we see. What may be useful is if maybe you've already got it arranged that way, having a more detailed discussion with Pat where he can actually walk you through the discrete specific numbers for content per vehicle and participation rate. But in general, I would articulate it this way. First of all, obviously, we see growth across all three platforms : combustion, hybrid, and electric. From a combustion perspective, in a flat to declining marketplace of combustion over the next few years, we generally grow at about 5%, okay? So, that's primarily through additional content as they advance the technology in combustion-powered products. So, that's what's driving that growth. On hybrid, we're actually increasing obviously our content per vehicle and the participation rate continues to grow. And that's coupled with two things. One, that the carryover of use in our combustion products in addition to the hybrid product. So, on hybrids, we grow both content and participation rate. And on electrics, what you may be thinking about on electrics, if you go back a year or so back to 2016, our content per vehicle was exceptionally high. We were in the 600s and that was driven by we were only really shipping one single product called transmission. And as we adopt an array of products, that content per vehicle actually comes down and narrows itself out, but our participation rate is going up from about 3% to 26% over the next two or three years. So, when you net all of that together, you net all of that together. We're going to end up with the combustion content per vehicle in the low-200s and hybrid content per vehicle in the mid-200s and the electric in the high-300s, so it's pretty consistent. And participation rates will be about 50% on combustion, mid-20s on electrics and mid-30s on hybrids. So, does that help you a little bit? Otherwise, I know Pat can give you the multiplier. Armintas Sinkevicius - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: It does. No, this is helpful. And then, Pat has been helpful as well. Just when I think about the transition electric, where you see the equilibrium on participation rate for yourselves? Do you see it sort of not by 2020, but sort of further out, do you see it higher than the mid-20% range and what do you need do to get there? James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Yeah, we'll climb beyond the mid-20s. I mean the mid-20s is a great number for us considering we're coming from 3% just a couple of years ago. Armintas Sinkevicius - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: But we'll get to that mid-20% and we'll climb from there. Absolutely, we'll climb from there because we \u2013 I have portfolio across the space, whether it's transmission, power, electronics. We will continue to climb. We don't have a definitive number of where that will settle out. But intuitively, if you think about it intuitively, why would there be any less participation on an electric than it would on a hybrid or a combustion? And I don't think it will. It's just a function to me of when we get there. Armintas Sinkevicius - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Well, thank you so much for taking the question. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thank you. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Morning, Ryan. Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Maybe just first regarding the modestly lowered EBIT margin guidance for the year. Thanks, Ron, for the comment on the economy impact. I imagine the FX tailwind to revenue was also diluting the all-in contribution margin. Are there any other factors that play such as a decision to spend more on investments electrification, other technologies to drive future sales growth or is pretty much accounted for by those other factors? Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: It's accounted for those other factors and we are still maintaining our incremental margins right in the mid-teens, so no. It's those two of the factors, FX and then the reclassification of the pension. Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Got it. That's helpful. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: And, Ryan. Sorry, Ryan. Just \u2013 I just \u2013 Ron's right on, of course. But I just want to reiterate there is absolutely no spend slowdown at all in R&D. We continue to get at that pace of 4% or more across both \u2013 across over the portfolio. So, yeah, I don't want you to think we're touching R&D. If anything, we'll spend more not less. Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Very helpful. And then just, James, I recall you saying a couple of years ago before Sevcon that you'd be happy to make a number of power electronics acquisitions whenever you \u2013 if you could. I'm just curious what other like power electronics capabilities exist out there that were maybe not addressed by the Sevcon acquisition that you could be potentially still interested in acquiring? James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Yeah. I would say it's probably similar stuff to what we \u2013 what Sevcon brings, but just more of it, more scale, more engineering capacity, more engineering capability is really the key. We're happy with what we've got. We're doing good. But as we're marching towards an $11 billion company and growing at the right we are, we're becoming a big company and it's a lot of activity we're managing. And if we can add more capability, more capacity, Ryan, it's only going to help us. I don't need to add other discrete products, if that makes sense to you, to the portfolio to deliver on the growth targets. We can do that with what we've got plus Sevcon. It would just be more of it, would be good, if that makes sense to you. Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Yeah. No, that's great. Thanks. And then just the last question for me is, in the past, I think you've talked about like a breakout of the alternate powertrain mix in your backlog or for the industry as a whole. We see the IHS figure, kind of 5% to 6% DAV penetration in 2028. I think this is as far as they go. Just curious given all the anecdotal evidence and announcements we've seen from automakers over the past \u2013 even over the past six months or so, if you see anything shifting in your conversation with automakers, are your conversations still mostly tied to discussions around hybrids and NPFs? James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Yeah. So, couple of thoughts, Ryan. One, obviously, as we get closer to \u2013 as we're getting into invested, I will do a refresh on that for you and give you the outlook of vehicle architecture breakdown based on IHS view and our view and others. Fundamentally, we've not seen a huge change from 6, 9, 12 months ago other than I would say the adoption or a push for 48-volt model hybrid. It continues to be strong and continues to get pushed not just in Europe, but different parts of the world as well. And you see a lot of announcements on pure electrics, which I think we're paying a lot of attention to. So I wouldn't say there's been any meaningful big shift. I would just say we're getting close to those dates now, so there's a lot of drive to get these technologies in place and implemented. I think it's more that has changed a little over the last year. We're getting closer to implementation date, but 48-volt model hybrid coupled with some battery electric and then optimization of combustion is the primary drives that we're seeing in the business. Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Very helpful. Thanks for all the color. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: All right. Thank you, Ryan. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks. Hello, everyone. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Hey, Joe. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: Hey, Joe. Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC : So just on the diesel commentary, I know you said the market was down, I think, 760 basis points. Within that, one of the things we observed was sort of the smaller Engines declining at a faster rate than the larger Engines. Are you mostly aligned with sort of the industry mix or did you perhaps outperform or underperform based on your mix? James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Yeah. So, yeah, Joe, this is James. The 760 basis points is the right number for the quarter. And you're right, it's biased to small. Vehicles are switching from out of diesel quicker, much quicker. We've seen that trend over the last 6 months to 12 months. On average, Joe, it we're slightly weighted to the larger vehicles. I mean, I don't have any specific data point, but I would say generally we're a little more weighted to larger vehicles than smaller vehicles. So, we don't get as impacted as much in the average. We do a little better than the industry average because of that slight bias for us on the larger vehicles. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: One thing I will add, James \u2013 I'll add one thing, Joe, is if you're looking at the impact we actually experienced in Q1, it was in line with our guide of 300 basis points to 400 basis points. That's what we experienced, okay. We didn't experience the 760 basis points for the quarter. Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. So, the drag to sales in the quarter was 300 basis points to 400 basis points, but then you also made a comment that commercial vehicle offset that. So, the inference is that commercial vehicle \u2013 and so (00:46:32) none of the two was in line or you're in line because you were expecting the zero on commercial vehicle. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: Right. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Yeah. Yeah. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: What happened is commercial offsetting the guide that we thought we were going to experience and we still performed better than what the market did. Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Right. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: Okay? Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. The second one is just \u2013 so, I appreciate the comments on 48-volt and that makes a lot of sense given some of the near-term targets that the automakers have to hit. But presumably because of your capabilities, you're also involved in a lot of discussions with the automakers about where they go after, and I guess I'm curious about those conversations for sort of the next gen. Like, what are they thinking there? And I guess the reason I'm asking is, it seems like 48-volt could be this really strong growth, mid-term solution. But ultimately, it seems like maybe it gets transplanted by some of the other technologies in your other content. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Yeah. Let me say, if I can help with that, Joe. The first thing I would say to you is, we are absolutely involved in those discussions across the \u2013 around the world, so to speak, with all the automakers, which is interesting because we get a unique view of pretty much what all the automakers are doing. And the very conversations that we're having are, what is the optimal mix of propulsion technology for their range of vehicles both now and also through 2025 and even beyond 2025. The general trend that we see is, obviously, they all have their own unique mix. But what we're generally seeing is that all of them are looking towards a balanced fleet. So, we're not seeing a lot of will hybrid be an interim solution to use an example and everybody switching over to pure electrics. We're seeing even in a sustained period to 10 years out that they'll have a mix of really advanced combustion technology, which continues to get advanced pretty aggressively. There will be a certain mix of hybrid and then there will be some \u2013 generally some EV portion of that fleet. So that's what we're consistently seeing. We're not seeing people jump into two of the three architectures as an example. And I would also point out, I think you're right, 48-volt hybrid is a sustained solution. We don't see that as an interim fix, so to speak, to go to electric. Within the 48-volt mild hybrid architecture, the P2 solution, which is basically putting the motor between the engine and the transmission, seems to be a prevalent trend. We see that very, very clearly. And I would say the investment in continuing to advance combustion to engine technology is still very strong. Sometimes we hear a myth that that's not happening. It's not true. There's a lot of investment and a lot of advanced technology that we're discussing on pure combustion. So the difficulty is, Joe, it varies OEM-by-OEM and region-by-region, but those are some of the high-level trends that we're seeing, if that helps you. Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Yeah, no. That is helpful. I guess just one quick follow-up because you mentioned the sort of P2 configuration. Is there sort of a motor configuration that is generally more favorable for BorgWarner than the others? Or are you pretty agnostic between the different \u2013 where they place the motor? James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: No, what we're finding, Joe, and maybe the reason, just for those on the call, of why the P2 solution lends itself very, very well, is it gives the OEMs the opportunity to use the current engine and transmission configuration that they have and basically put the P2 model in between, which then gives them flexibility to use that engine transmission as a combustion vehicle or a hybrid vehicle. What's pretty unique for us, and this is pretty interesting, is if you actually list the companies in the world that understand engines, transmissions, clutching, motors and electronics, which are all the five elements needed to pull off a P2 mild hybrid solution, there is BorgWarner and I'm not sure who else frankly. So all of that, that's the competitive advantage we're bringing. And we have a range of motor technology, Joe, so we can \u2013 we have different motors. And it varies again on the needs and the specific uniqueness of the application. But because we understand the clutching and we understand the transmission and the engine, we know how to scale or adjust the motor for that particular application. And that's why we're gaining a lot of traction there and doing really well. Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Great. Thanks. That's helpful. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris McNally with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Chris McNally - Evercore ISI : Thanks. Hey, guys, I really just wanted to discuss a little bit about the high-voltage industry outlook maybe more in detail and specifically the power electronics. Now that you have Sevcon for the last two quarters and you had a strong interest from the OEM. So, two questions. The first is on really the bundling of the electric motor and power electronics. If you can give any qualitative or just some guidance for how much you're seeing those two bundled together as opposed to sort of bid out separately amongst different suppliers. And then, the second on insourcing. I think you gave some comments last year that you thought on the electric motor side, that it was going to be about 50% insourced from OEMs. And we really don't have a good industry check on power electronics, outside of Tesla. It seems like most OEMs are going to outsource, but any color you can add there would be great. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Yeah, let me take a shot at that for you. So I'll start with the \u2013 let me start with motors, so let's start there. And you're right, Chris, our assumption was about 50% would be insourced and 50% outsourced by the OEs. And of that 50% that was outsourced to suppliers, we'd probably pick up about 15% thereabouts of that market share. I would say the two things that I've seen since we talked about that is, I think the 50/50, in versus out from the OEMs, I think, is pretty consistent. I'd just say that's still a pretty good assumption. If I had to do the over/under, I think they'll do a little more out. He's just changed his view. And our ability to win that 15%, I'm feeling incrementally more positive and more comfortable about. And I think we're probably running a little ahead of that. It's still early in the race, Chris, but I would say \u2013 directionally, I would say that's where I would go. So that \u2013 I would say that. On power electronics, I agree with your sentiment that we \u2013 the OEs are generally leaning to outsourcing power electronics for sure. And then I would say in terms of your other thought in terms of the bundling of the package, that varies a little bit by the OEMs. I would say, generally speaking, the Chinese OEMs are much more lending themselves to bundling the whole thing, and we're seeing that play out pretty strongly. Europe, North America probably a little more less so. But I will also say the other very critical point is, you, as a supplier, if you're going to compete, you need to understand all of those things and how they interact. That's what I've heard loud and clear from the OEM. So don't come to me with a transmission motor combo and not understand the electronics needed. You have to understand that even if it's outsourced and bid separately, Chris, if that makes sense. You got to understand the system, you got to understand the interactions and that's where we bring the value. So hopefully that gives you a little bit of a sense from what you're thinking about. Chris McNally - Evercore ISI : No, James, that's fantastic. And do you think, just as a quick follow-up on the bundling, I mean when you're going to the OEMs, is there a very strong value proposition that, if we are able to do both or able to offer x in terms of savings or efficiency because of essentially the design of what is the critical components in an EV. Or right now that value proposition is only so-so, not just for yourself, but for the industry, that combining those two, you're not really gaining a lot of efficiency? James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Yeah. Again, I would say there is a little bit, Chris, OEM-to-OEM. But here's the way I think about it, is if you've got the capability to do all, you're in a much, much stronger position. You really are for two reasons. One, you can understand the tradeoffs between the different pieces of technology, but also if you've got the capability to offer it, insource to offer it, to supply it, you have an advantage. So it's still early, Chris. To be fair, it's playing itself out, but I would say in general you're way better off if you've got all pieces of the puzzle as opposed to only certain bits of the puzzle. Chris McNally - Evercore ISI : Great. Thanks so much. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thank you. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thanks, Chris. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America. Your line is now open. John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Good morning, guys. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Hello, John. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: Hello, John. John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Just a question, I mean, on the Drivetrain business. Ron, when you were kind of going through the walk, you were talking just about how you'd benefited from mix there and what we're hearing on four-wheel drive, what we're hearing from the automakers is an increasing focus on crossovers and trucks in relation to potentially cancellation of many car program. Just curious as we think about the Drivetrain business, what kind of potential upside you see as we see the shift towards more crossovers and trucks that will have a lot more four-wheel drive or at least All-Wheel Drive toward transfer capability? Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: I'll start, then maybe James would follow up. It's not just about transfer cases. It's also about coupling, so we have the coupling business. So, we see good growth in the first quarter in the coupling business in Europe, for example, and in China. So in the U.S., we all think about the trucks and the transfer cases, but it's not just about transfer case. It's about couplings as well. Do you want to add anything... James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: No. I think that's a good perspective. The only other thing I would say, John, it's not directly related to your question is, not to beat a dead horse here, but this notion of having the broad elements of Drivetrain, all the key pieces of Drivetrain in addition to the Engine piece is a huge competitive advantage because you can understand both parts of the vehicle. That's a big advantage for us. John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : But I mean, simplistically, directly from a pass car to a crossover to a truck, I mean, what is the content potential for you in Drivetrain just sort of on a more traditional standpoint? James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, the biggest thing that moves the needle is the transfer case. So, that's the biggest shift for us, if that makes sense, John. So think of the other key pieces here. We have pretty much equal content of transmission across the vehicle, but transfer case is obviously an additive to trucks and obviously four-wheel drive applications. So, that's the biggest shift you see. We see \u2013 the rise in China of more and more and more SUVs is calling on more functionality for All-Wheel Drive or four-wheel drive and also calling for dual-clutch type applications because they're better equipped in an SUV. So, we're seeing some of those trends, if that makes sense. John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, that's helpful. And then just a second question, can you just remind us what your commercial vehicle exposure is there because it sounds like the market is running a whole lot hotter than flat or is going to run a whole lot hotter than flat this year. I'm just trying to understand what the potential upside is from that as well. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: In China, John? You're asking about China? John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : No, more North America, but also potentially China as well. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: So, CV is about 12% of revenue, total company, and it's about a third in the North America, a third in Europe and the other third is split between China and Brazil, weighted to China. And about total CV, about two-thirds is over the road and about one-third off-the-road. Is that helps? John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And profitability on that, if you guys \u2013 would you guys do, is that sort of a round corp average or is there a higher profile there? Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: Yeah. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: It's round corp average. John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Great. Thank you very much. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thanks, John. Operator : We have time for one final question and that question comes from the line of Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning, everyone. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Hey, Rich. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: Hello, Rich. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Just a couple here for 2018 on the guide. So, implies second half organic growth slows down, production comps particularly in North America get easier. Is that backlog timing or anything we should be reading into with regard to conservatism? Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: I don't think it's anything to read into. It's early right now into the year. We're only five months in \u2013 four months in, Rich. I don't think there's anything to read into that at this point, okay? Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And then on the equity and affiliates. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: Yeah. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : So, that number is going to be a headwind. So, it's going to be down year-over-year. That's, I think, related to \u2013 you have Korean and Japanese joint venture. There's something else there not just production or is there programs or what's driving the lower contribution? Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: So, I call that leakage, basically. So, there's two elements to loan line that we want to make you guys focus on. There's affiliates and then there's the equity, right. Both of them are headwinds. One of them on the joint venture is what's happening is, as we make more money in those joint ventures, we have to give them more money because we don't have 100% ownership. So, that will increase. For example, the dual-clutch transmission for the Chinese OEMs is a good example. So as we do better there, we have to give our partners. And then we are seeing startup in NSK-Warner expansion plans, and we're anticipating that this should go through some cost issues as they expand their business. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. So that was the one I was looking for, I understand the DCP piece with minority interest (01:01:04)... Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: All right, yeah. So, it's basically the expansion of NSK-Warner partnership that we had over 50 years. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. So, there's some investment going on there, okay. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: All right, yes. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : That's great. Okay, that's all I had. I appreciate it. Thank you. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: All right. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thank you, Rich. Patrick Nolan - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thank you, everyone, for your very good question today. Dan, you can now conclude the call. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude the BorgWarner 2018 first quarter results conference call. You may now disconnect.",

First, James Verrier, our President and CEO, will comment on the industry followed by a high-level overview of our Q2 results and full year outlook. Then, Fr\u00e9d Lissalde, our COO, will outline our second half priorities as well as review some of our recent announcements. Finally, Ron Hundzinski, our CFO, will discuss the details of our results as well as our guidance. Please note that we posted our earnings call presentation to the IR page of the website. You'll find a link in the Events & Presentations section beneath the notice for this call. We encourage you to follow along during our discussion. With that, I'll turn it over to James. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thank you, Pat, and good morning everybody. Thank you for joining us this morning. Fr\u00e9d, Ron and I are very pleased to share our results from Q2 of 2018 and we're also going to update you a little bit on our progress towards delivering our 2018 targets. I thought a good place to start is for me to share a few thoughts on the macro environment and the industry in general. And for those of you that are following along on the webcast, we're on slide number 6. The way I would characterize the headline summary to start off with is, for us our growth over market was in line with our expectations and that was in an environment with global light vehicle production a little bit weaker than we'd expected going into the quarter. So, let me just give a little bit of color around Q2 industry results. From a global light vehicle production perspective, it came in up slightly less than 4% year-over-year. Now, when you adjust that for a weighted geographic exposure, the market was up a little under 2% year-over-year. And if you think about that from our perspective that was about 150 basis points weaker than our expectation when we provided our Q2 guide. If I break down that a little bit regionally for a moment. First of all, European light vehicle production was up 4% year-over-year. The highlight on diesel gas mix in Europe continues to shift. We saw diesel share declining by approximately 870 basis points year-over-year in Q2. Moving to China. China light vehicle production was up close to 9% year-over-year and that was pretty much in line with our expectations as we went into the quarter. From a North American perspective, light vehicle industry production declined about 2.5% year-over-year which is a little bit weaker than expected driven in part by some lost production at one of our key customers due to the supplier fire incident. From a commercial vehicle perspective, growth there was modestly ahead of our expectations. Now, Fr\u00e9d will go through the details in a short while, but the full year industry volume outlook remains roughly unchanged for us. And as we look at the business going forward, the fundamental upsides and downsides to our industry assumptions appear to be pretty well balanced. So, with that, our expectations for the full year global light vehicle industry is consistent with our prior forecast. What that means is it implies global production growth of less than 1% adjusted for our geographic exposure. The final point I'll make on this slide though and I think this is the best part of all, the key for us is we expect to continue to outgrow the market in 2018 based on the strong demand for our products. Now, let me talk a little bit about Q2 results and 2018 outlook and I'm on slide number 7. So, first of all is just a brief summary of the Q2 results and again, Ron will cover this in more detail later. Overall, I was very pleased \u2013 I'm really pleased actually \u2013 our organic growth was in line with our expectations and this was despite slightly weaker industry volume and customer downtime for one of our key platforms which I had mentioned earlier. Operating performance is also up very strong and managed to offset some of these revenue headwinds. So, putting that into numbers for a moment, recorded $2.7 billion of sales. So, that's up 7.3% organically when we exclude currencies and Sevcon, and this compares to our end market exposure of less than 2%. So, very, very strong outperformance again. Regionally, as was pretty much as we had expected, we did see strong growth in China; our European revenue growth exceeded industry volume growth; our North American revenue was flattish due to the lost volume of one of our key customers, and that was somewhat offset by positive revenue trends in commercial vehicle off-road. EPS came in at $1.18 excluding non-comparables, and one of my favorite metrics is that's a 23% year-over-year improvement which is pretty fantastic. Operating margins were at 12.7% which is up 20 basis points year-over-year, again very strong performance. Now, for the full year I'm really pleased that we've increased the low end of our organic growth forecast. So, we're expecting organic growth of 6% to 7%, and again this is in a market that is growing less than 1%, so a strong performance. Our consolidated operating income margin is expected to expand to 10 basis points to 20 basis points year-over-year. And we're also increasing our EPS guidance range to $4.45 to $4.50 based on our updated growth outlook and more beneficial tax rate and Ron will walk you through the details that go with that shortly. So, before I turn it over to Fr\u00e9d, I just wanted to say a few words as this is my \u2013 this will be my last earnings call as I come to the end of a 29-year career with BorgWarner which has been a wonderful journey for me to be in this great company. A few thanks, if I could. I'd first of all, like to thank the board for their continuous support for me but also for the company. As we've repositioned the company in recent years, they played a really strong pivotal role in helping us drive that forward. Obviously, for sure I want to thank the employees, all 32,000 of you that are out there listening, it's your commitment, your dedication to deliver these great results that has made BorgWarner the great company it is. And whether that's financial performance, whether it's quality, whether it's safety, innovative products, BorgWarner knows how to do all of those things and you're the folks that have done it and thank you for your support. It's truly been an honor to lead you. But as I leave the company, I know a couple of really important things. First of all, I know I'm handing over to the right guy and that makes me feel really, really good. I've known Fr\u00e9d for 19 years. We've worked together in many different capacities and he's always been a superb leader and he will continue to be a superb leader and I know I can make that move in his very, very safe hands. Fr\u00e9d also has a great team around him. This is a team that's been together pretty closely over the last several years. And as we've built this strategy for the company, the current leadership team is the team that's put that together and I think that great team will stay in place and continue to deliver the type of performance we expect at BorgWarner. I also leave knowing the company is in a great place. It's strongly positioned. And when I look at what the team has done over the last four or five years, it's pretty remarkable as we transitioned ourself to \u2013 with a new vision for the company of clean, energy-efficient world and we pivoted the company from a powertrain company to a propulsion company, and that wasn't just PowerPoint slides, that was real work. And here we are now with a balanced portfolio for combustion, hybrid and electric products that will serve and deliver growth for the company whatever the end market plays at us and that's something that I feel really, really good about because we're balanced, we have a great strategy and we've got great results ahead. I also leave knowing the company is operating beautifully and you'll see that in the comments from Fr\u00e9d and you'll see in the results from Ron. So, the company is in a really, really terrific spot. The last thing I'd just like to say with the analyst community and investors that are on the phone, I want to thank you also. You gave us a lot of support, advice, sometimes criticism, often justified, and you challenged us and you made us ask a lot of good questions, and it's a result of that engagement and that discussion with you that has made us a better company and I want to thank you for that. So, finally I'll turn it over to Fr\u00e9d. Fr\u00e9d, you're the guy. Keep it going for us and best wishes to you. Thank you. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thank you, James. On behalf of BorgWarner, I'd like to thank you for your leadership over the past six years as CEO and 29 years at BorgWarner. You are leaving us very strongly positioned for future growth. So, we'd like to wish you and Tracy a great retirement and a great next chapter of your life. As we look at our priorities for the next six months, there are three that we focused on. One, we are laser-focused on delivering our updated guide, both in terms of organic growth and bottom line earnings. Two, we will secure significant new business awards. I'm very, very happy by the programs we've secured year-to-date, and there are significant second half opportunities across our three segments : combustion, hybrid, and electric. And three, we will monitor and be prepared to manage through the industry risks. These include the potential for additional tariffs. We believe that we're strongly positioned on a relative basis. However, we need to manage any impact on our business going forward. On slide 10, you see some highlights of a few of our key announcements during the quarter. I think the most significant is the establishment of our Indiana Tech Center. This complements our existing investments that exist around the world related to electric propulsion. It's an impressive facility; very, very high tech with outstanding virtual global collaboration tools. It will be one of the great research development and testing hub for us on the electric propulsion field. We also wanted to highlight our upcoming Investor Day on September 18. It will take place at our Propulsion Technical Center here in Michigan and will feature presentations by several members of our senior management team. But as importantly, the event will give you the opportunity to touch and experience the products that will drive our future growth. I look forward to seeing many of you there. With that, let me turn it over to Ron. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thank you, Fr\u00e9d, and good morning, everyone. Before I review the financial details, I would like to provide you with some of the highlights as I see them for the quarter. First, our organic revenue growth was within our guidance range despite close to 200 basis points headwind from weaker production and a customer plant shutdown. Second, incremental margin performance was stronger than our expectations driven by a strong incremental within our Engine segment and corporate cost savings. And finally, we are increasing the low end of our organic growth guidance and lowering our expected tax rate for the year from 28% to 26%. And as a result, our 2018 EPS guide has once again been increased. Now, as Pat mentioned, I will be referring to supplemental financial slide deck that is posted on our website and I do encourage you to follow along. Let's turn to slide 13. On a reported basis, sales were up 12.7%. On a comparable basis, our organic growth sales was up 7.3%. It's a solid performance compared to our weighted average light vehicle industry production for the quarter which is up under 2% year-over-year. We saw a 26% growth in China against a production market that was up 9%. Europe revenue was up 7% compared to 4% industry production growth in the quarter. North America revenue was flat versus the 2.5% percent production decline in the quarter. The outgrowth was despite the impact of the F-Series production shutdown that impacted us about 400 basis points. Commercial vehicle was a benefit contributing about 50 basis points of growth in the quarter. And as James mentioned, diesel gas mix in Western Europe was a headwind. Now, let's look at the year-over-year comparison for operating income which can be found on slide 14. Q2 adjusted operating profit was $341 million compared to $298 million in Q2 of 2017. Our operating margin of 12.7% was a 20-basis-point improvement year-over-year. On a comparable basis, operating income was up $33 million on $167 million of higher sales. That gives us an incremental margin of 19% in the quarter which was a bit better than we expected due to better cost performance and lower headwind from our non-core emissions business. Our adjusted provision for income taxes was $82 million for an effective tax rate of 24% for the quarter, but again 26% year-to-date. Earnings per share on a reported basis was $1.30 per basic share. On an adjusted basis, net earnings were $1.18 per diluted share. Now, let's take a closer look at our operating segments in the quarter beginning on slide 15 of the deck. Reported Engine segment net sales were $1.674 billion in the quarter. Sales growth for the Engine segment on a comparable basis was 7.2% as demand for our light vehicle OEM products was supplemented by growth in our commercial vehicle business. Adjusted EBIT was $279 million for the Engine segment or 16.7% of sales. On a comparable basis, the Engine segment adjusted EBIT was up $24 million on $107 million of our sales for an incremental margin of 23%. This incremental margin is the result of two factors. First, the segment had very strong overall cost performance in the quarter. And second, the headwinds in our non-core emissions business were less than our expectations going into the quarter. Now, turning to slide 16. Drivetrain segment net sales were up for $1.034 billion in the quarter. Sales growth for the Drivetrain segment on a comparable basis was up 7.4% as well. This is primarily due to strong DCT growth in China, transmission components and all-wheel drive. Growth was partially mitigated by the F-Series shutdown in North America. Adjusted EBIT was $116 million for the Drivetrain segment or 11.2% of sales. I like to note that the 70 basis points reduction in margin is all related to Sevcon acquisition. On a comparable basis, the Drivetrain segment's adjusted EBIT was up $8 million on $68 million of our sales for an incremental margin of 12%. The F-Series shutdown was a drag on incremental margins for us in the quarter. Now I like to discuss our 2018 full year guidance, which we have increased due to higher foreign currency headwinds. Turning to sales growth guidance for the full year that's on page 18. We continue to expect organic growth of 6% to 7%. The Sevcon acquisition is expected to add approximately $50 million of revenue in 2018. Currency is expected to be $220 million tailwind. This is down from $405 million in our previous guidance and total revenue is now expected to be in a range of $10.64 billion to $10.75 billion. Next, I'll walk through our operating income on slide 19. From a performance perspective, we expect mid- to high-teens incremental margins on our sales growth. Our consolidated operating income margin is expected to expand to 12.5% to 12.6%. To finish up our full year guidance, please turn to slide 20. EPS guidance range is now $4.45 to $4.50 per diluted share versus the $4.30 to $4.40 previously. The higher guide is driven by increasing the low-end of our organic growth guidance and lowering our expected tax rate for the year. We continue to expect free cash flow to be in the $525 million to $575 million range. The tax rate is expected to be in the low-26% range. Our assumption for the dollar to euro exchange rate for the second half has been adjusted down to $1.15. Now, our third quarter guidance can be found on slide 22. First, sales. We expect organic growth of 4.5% to 6.5%. This is slightly below our full year guidance due to some new business being pulled in the first half and a customer mix in China and Europe. EPS is expected to be in a range of $1.03 to $1.06 per share. This guidance is based on a low-26% tax rate and incorporates $1.15 euro assumption for a $53 million revenue headwind year-over-year. So, let me summarize quarter two. Overall, execution was very strong. Organic sales growth of 7.3% was good despite that weaker than expected industry volume and impact of customer shutdown. The Q2 incremental margin of 90% was much better than we expected going in. And as we look at the remainder of 2018, we are focused on delivering our financial targets and continue to secure significant new business. I'd like to take a moment and thank James for his outstanding leadership at BorgWarner. Our partnership was strong and very solid as we went along. There is no doubt that this company is the number one positioned to provide solutions to electrification of the propulsion system. Also I am confident and very excited that Fr\u00e9d and I will continue to grow the company and generate the financial returns that investors are accustomed to. So again, James, thank you for your leadership. With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Pat. Patrick Nolan - BorgWarner, Inc.: Tasha, we're ready to open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. And our first question comes from Joe Spak of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Great. Thanks for taking the question. And James, congratulations on your retirement. And Fr\u00e9d, likewise, congratulations. I guess, Fr\u00e9d, I wanted to start with you. You focus on \u2013 you mentioned some of the priorities for the second half which sound reasonable. I guess, bigger picture, also I wanted to understand your view just broadly of the powertrain industry, how you view it. There's a lot of assets out there, how you think about consolidation, whether that's needed and what BorgWarner's role in all that could be? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.: Yes. Thanks, Joe. In the propulsion area, our strategy to be balanced across combustion, hybrid and electric is the right thing, and this strategy will be executed \u2013 is executed and will carry on to be executed. We have no missing pieces in our product portfolio to be able to execute this strategy and be growing at mid- to high-single digits year-over-year. So, we are very happy with where we are from a portfolio perspective, from a product perspective. And as I have mentioned before, if we could \u2013 we're already very actively growing the organic portion of our power electronics business. And if we come across with some potential acquisition on power electronic, we would certainly look at that, but absolutely no need for us to look at filling and missing product gap that does not exist. Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Thank you. And then just maybe on some of the puts and takes and sort of cadence for the rest of the year. I thought I heard you say a 400 basis point impact from the F-Series in the second quarter, and I assume a good portion of that comes back in the third quarter. But then is the offset maybe some WLTP issues in Europe. And then it also sounded like you said maybe some third quarter business was pulled forward in the second quarter. So, I was just wondering if you could dimensionalize some of those puts and takes, Ron? Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: Yes. Just to clarify something, Joe. When I said 400 basis point, that was a regional impact in North America. Just want to make sure that's clear, okay? Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: Overall, it's 50 basis points. Yes, I just want to make sure it's clear. Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Perfect. Okay. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: All right. Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC : So, that makes a little bit more sense. But then just in terms of some of the other puts and takes. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.: So, your question is more around Q3 or... Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Yes, the Q3. Because it would seem like some of that F-Series business would sort of come back helping it but then you talked about some of the offsets from the pull forward, and I was wondering your thoughts on WLTP issues in the back half. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.: Yes. So, let me give you some clarity on this. So, our organic growth for Q3 is 4.5% to 6.5%. We've seen a lot of pull forward into the first half where we've had a very, very strong backlog. What we see, Joe, is really two market things that are touching us in Q3. One is from a customer mix perspective in China, we see slightly slower growth in the second half. And also from a European customer mix including WLTP certification, we see a little slower numbers too from a market standpoint. On the full year basis, we've upped our guide from 5% to 7% to 6.7% (sic) [6% to 7%] (00:27:10). So, the full year growth is still very, very solid on a [ph] global \u2013 on (00:27:16) a weighted market growth of less than 1%. Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Rich Kwas from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.: Good morning, Rich. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : James, congratulations on retirement. Best wishes. It's been a pleasure. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thanks, Rich. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : And Fr\u00e9d, I look forward to working with you in the future and best wishes as well. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.: Great (00:27:49) Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : So, on diesel, so down significantly more than everybody kind of thought here, at least going back to the beginning of the year. So, how is it playing out in terms of the balance of the year on Europe. It seems like you're making up a little bit with the switch to gas maybe new backlog, et cetera. But in terms of positioning here as you exit 2018, how do you feel about getting to a neutral standpoint? I know \u2013 I think, officially, you've talked about 2019, but just how should we think about the cadence in particular larger displacement engines which didn't suffer as much last year that seems to be worsening this year, payback. But just broader comments there in terms of risks here as we think about the back half and into 2019? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.: One way to look at it, Rich, is on the year-over-year basis, we drop \u2013 the market drops 600 basis points to 700 basis points. And you remember 1% of shift in diesel gas mix is for us, $20 million to $25 million. What we see, and you are right, we see that the headwind declines in 2019 due to our growth in gasoline turbo, EGR, and VCT. What we also see is that overall, as you mentioned, the decline is faster on small diesel than on big diesel and we also see that the pace of the decline is moderating on a month-over-month basis. We've always managed through those diesel headwinds, and we will manage those headwinds going forward. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. So, it sounds like you feel pretty comfortable about it easing and being able to offset that so \u2013 as you've been doing, so... Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.: Yes. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And then just two for Ron. So, the non-core emissions business, where are you in terms of settling all that? And then second, I know we seem to have a little bit of a respite with regards to tariffs here in the last 24 hours. But just any thoughts around whether how much Section 301 is in the back half from China? And then just any initial thoughts on a Section 232 impact? I realize you may be still going through the numbers, but any color there would be helpful? Thanks. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: Sure, Rich. So, let me talk about emissions first. I would say that the headline is basically we're on track. And what I mean by that is we are doing management presentations with some potential buyers, that should finish up here shortly with final bids coming in. We are moving products out of one of the facilities in Europe. And if all goes well, we're looking at probably a end of Q3 or early Q4 close at this point. So, I would say that in general everything's on track. I'm pretty close to the transaction and things are going well there. On the tariffs side, Rich, so I'm going to go through a little more detail here on that. So, the first thing I'd like to talk about the commodity inflation of the Section 232 around steel and aluminum, we have been experiencing already year-to-date. So, this is something that's just not new. When this was put in place we were seeing some headwinds but we were finding ways to mitigate that and that really dragged those issues into our results. So, that's the first thing I want to note and that'll continue through the year. And I think that the operating folks have done a fantastic job mitigating through the Section 232 steels and aluminum. Now, when you get into the Section 301, we have incorporated, and it's already reflected in our guide, but we are seeing some cost inflation of about a $10 million to $20 million headwind in the back half. But again, like I said, we're working through that and we're finding very \u2013 we'll find a lot of alternative ways to get around this but it isn't \u2013 it's baked in there. Now, you referred to the Section 232 automotive, I would just say that's a big issue. The numbers are easy to apply because if you look at our total purchases coming into the U.S. that we're still sorting through, it's significant. So, those will have significant impacts on us but we're not really finalized with all those calculations but that's a big impact and that's more speculative in going into next year as you know. But it's a big number for everybody, not just for BorgWarner. And then I just want to comment on NAFTA, that's still kind of hanging out there. And then, there's this extra, the $200 billion that's across the board as well that's a little bit speculative because they haven't really identified all the components that would come under the tariff. The Section 301 was \u2013 we can identify components that's why we came up \u2013 we can identify the $10 million to $20 million. And in fact, in those numbers we know by component pretty much what the headwinds are. So, hopefully, that's a little bit more clarity around that for you. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : And then real quick... Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: And if there's anything that \u2013 but maybe I would have Fr\u00e9d to add anything about that as well. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.: Yes, Rich, what I just want to add is that we think that on a relative basis, we're pretty well positioned since we produce our final product in the same region as our customers production facilities are. So, for sure the commodities and tariffs certainly impact the business through our supply base. And as you mentioned, it's I would say fairly fluid, changes every hour. So, our goal is to be agile and monitor those changes and react appropriately going forward. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : For your product portfolio you wouldn't be at a disadvantage versus your key competition with regards to the Section 232 automotive. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: We don't think so. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: Not a disadvantage, no. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. All right. Thanks. I'll pass it on. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Chris McNally from Evercore. Your line is open. Chris McNally - Evercore ISI : Hi, gentlemen. James, Fr\u00e9d, I know it's been echoed a bunch, but congratulations to you, to you both again. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thank you. Chris McNally - Evercore ISI : Two questions. So, one on Drivetrain and the second on just the environment as a whole in Europe. So, when I look at the incremental margin on Drivetrain despite the total incremental margin for the company continuing to be in a pretty attractive mid-teens level, we're seeing Engine move into the 20% range in the first half despite lower growth and Drivetrain with a lower base still in the lower teens. Can you just maybe give some color where we could sort of see that inflection in Drivetrain as clearly there's a longer-term opportunity to drive margins there higher? And then the second can you maybe quantify, you mentioned Europe in Q3 for WLTP as a headwind, would you be able to maybe just put some numbers around that? Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: So, Chris, this is Ron, and good morning. Let me address the margin question you had on the Drivetrain. If you go back and look at the last six quarters and I could be off a quarter here, Drivetrain margins have actually been outstanding, very high, 15-plus. It was really only Q2 of 2018 that we've seen this 12% in quite a long time. So, this is primarily driven like we were talking the F-Series is having a drag on the incremental margins. So, I would say that the Drivetrain incremental margins have been outstanding in the prior quarters and we fully expect once we get to the transition to F-150, that we'll be back to the mid-high-teens incremental margins again in Drivetrain. So, if we go back and look at a few things, you'll see this was just one of those quarters. But the exciting part for us was actually was the Engine group being up that high 19 (00:36:07) because that was the segment that was lower historically. But again with emissions business improving for us year-over-year and some good cost controls, the segment, the Engine segment did well. And then when you add in the corporate costs, actually we're down, that just leverage us a little bit more for a total company accrual margin. So, the Drivetrain was just a quarter or two (00:36:28) at this point and I don't think it's going to stay in that range. And then WLTP. Fr\u00e9d? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.: Yes. So, Chris, on the WLTP certification, I would say that the impact that we may see is already baked in our market assumption and we don't see any company specific major impact. Chris McNally - Evercore ISI : Okay. That's great. And just a quick follow-up on the WLTP, if we saw some recovery in Europe in Q4, would you have enough exposure where that could be upside or sort of conservatively baked into your guide. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.: It's in the band. It's in the range. It's a bit too early to know exactly what upside we could see in Q4. Chris McNally - Evercore ISI : Okay. Perfect. Thank you so much, guys. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thank you. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thank you, Chris. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Noah Kaye from Oppenheimer. Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thanks very much. Hey, Ron, with the tax rate moving lower towards 26%, is that the right baseline we should think about for future years? How do you see the potential for that, potentially it can go lower through tax planning as we look at 2019 and 2020? Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: First, Noah, thank you for asking a question because I'm actually very excited about the tax rate but that hasn't come up yet. Good question. We came into the year, we held our guide at 29%, we did bring it down to 28%. And we knew we can lower the tax rate but we thought it was going be a 2019 event. I'm extremely excited and actually very happy that the tax department was able to move that up a couple of quarters to 26%. They do have a lot of planning ideas to lower that rate. The question is how low and when. And I think you're going to have to wait some more clarity going forward unfortunately, Noah. But I will say this, the rate will come down and I unfortunately cannot give you a number right now because there's a lot of planning activities that we're doing but we're very comfortable it's going to come down. And again, like I said, unfortunately, I can't give you the timing. But for modeling purposes, you're going to have to wait, Noah, all right? Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Sure. Sure. I think that's helpful directionally. And then a couple of references now to F-Series, margin drag on Drivetrain, would you mind was just telling us what that was so we can actually call it out here? Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: As far as the amount of sales that we've lost in the quarter or... Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: What the headwind was to margins from that, yes, in Drivetrain? Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: You can basically take $25 million of sales headwind and we didn't take out the cost. So, I'd have to do some calculations and get back with you as far as what the headwinds were, Noah. But it was about $25 million in the region, in North America region for us which \u2013 and if you just tie the standard margin to us, you can get some decent numbers there. Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay. Great. And then if I could ask one more and, James, I'll echo what others have said, pleasure in getting to know you and work with you and the very best wishes on your retirement. And Fr\u00e9d, much success to you in this new role as well. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thank you, Noah. Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: I think you talked a bit about power electronic portfolio and it looks like you may be ever so modestly raise the expected 2018 revenue contribution from Sevcon. I guess as we look at the pipeline for power electronics sales, what are you seeing now as more of a driver? Is it 48-volt mild hybrid? Is it growth in plugins? Can talk a little bit about how you see the future growth opportunities there? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.: Yes. Noah, we see the use of the power electronic portfolio in all of the above. We see an extended product portfolio, for example, on P2 48 volts, on P2 high voltage, iDM for electric vehicles. So, this power electronic product portfolio is going to be instrumental for our ROE. And not only on Drivetrain, it's also the case for eBooster. So, this is this is part of what we've done already for quite some years and Sevcon only added horsepower behind it. The power electronics is pretty much in everything we do and will be part of our products as you will see in the Investor Day going forward. Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Perfect. Thanks so much. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thank you, Noah. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thank you, Noah. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thank you, Noah. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson from Barclays. Your line is open. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Good morning, Brian. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: James, been a pleasure working with you. And I guess bienvenue to Fr\u00e9d. Just a couple questions, first, short term and then more of a longer term one. The shorter term one is what are you seeing in the European marketplace on diesel? The German OEMs are supposedly saying it's reached a floor for maybe perhaps the longer range Autobahn applications and commercial where it makes sense. But what are you seeing and then how's it kind of affecting your thinking this year and next? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.: Yes. Brian, I wouldn't say that it reached a floor. But as I mentioned before, the pace of decline is moderating. We still see some decline in the small displacement. So, what I would characterize as below 1.8 or 2 liter. And as far as we're concerned, we're managing the diesel mix fairly well, we have and we will in the future. And by 2019, we'll be totally agnostic in Europe on that mix due to our really good growth on efficient small gasoline engines. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Second question, as you kind of think about the role you play with the new product lines around motor, electric motors, electric drivetrains and just think about kind the kind of electric content of those as opposed on hybrids and the gas, some of the enhancements in the internal combustion engine part of those, how do you think mid-term and longer term about OEMs potentially insourcing that especially, Fr\u00e9d, in Europe where \u2013 since James' country is no longer part of Europe or the OEMs have substantial engine and transmission employment base in high-cost, unionized plants that they may want to convert into electric motors and electric drivetrains. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.: I would say that the \u2013 we see many different insourcing, outsourcing strategies and those strategies are fluid. What it will \u2013 I think one color I would like to give you is I think the insourcing, outsourcing strategy is going to be volume related. And when we will make and we make motors and depending on the volumes that we produce, when it's made by a supplier the volume is going to be much, much bigger than if an OE does it for his own consumption. We have a lot of different factors that are impacting this make or buy decisions from a motor perspective. What I can tell you is that we have in our portfolio one of the best motor in the world with our S-wind forming process that you will see at the Investor Day. The power density of that motor is one of the best that exists around the world. And in our business it's all about having the right product to drive efficiency in propulsion. And I think we're really well-positioned with the products that we have to offer. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And if an OEM does want to insource some portion of assembly for electric motors and drivetrains as they do for example in transmissions, do you still see a component business there and how would that affect your kind of longer-range growth targets? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.: We will never say no for any business. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Colin Langan from UBS. Your line is open. Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats, James and Fr\u00e9d. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thank you, Colin. Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Just my first question is very basic, you raised your organic growth range to the high end, but it seems like the quarter was pretty rough from a market perspective, I mean, what were the factors that gave you confidence to raise it? Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: Well, one thing, Colin, you got to put in (00:46:05) consideration is that Q1 was actually a very good quarter for us and Q2 was \u2013 F-Series is going to kind of get right-sized, going forward. And we're taking a look at a couple other launches that are coming in the back half the year. And year-to-date, we're at 7%, keep in mind, right. So, from what we're seeing in the marketplace, it's shaping up so that we can lower the lower end of the guide and I guess that raises the midpoint is what it does. From what we're seeing, we're pretty confident about it. Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Great. And any color on \u2013 you mentioned steel, I mean how much is baked in as a headwind for this year and how much \u2013 is there any recovery help in the second half that's not going to last (00:46:53)? Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: Well, yes, so when you talk about the Section 232 steel portion, like I was saying earlier, we've already experienced headwinds but we've also mitigated that. We have plans in place as we took \u2013 it came into the quarter for the full year, and we felt that that was not going to significantly impact our operating results on the steel and we looked at alternative ways of mitigating that. So, it's not really a net number at this point. If it is, it's an immaterial portion that's not affecting our operating income. The other one I was mentioning too, was the Section 301 which is a relatively new tariff that's come in that we're still sorting through. But that one is experiencing $10 million to $20 million, and we've found ways to mitigate that that we're working on. But on the steel side, we've done a good job just mitigating it. Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. And just lastly, the Sevcon deal gives you sort of the inverter capability and it seems like the trend have taken the (00:47:53) e-motor and merging that. I imagine that might be some of the strategy there. I mean, is that in the product pipeline, a merged e-motor and inverter? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.: I don't know exactly what you mean with merge but an inverter is a motor controller. So, having a motor in-house makes the controllability of that motor much easier when you know exactly all attributes of that motor. And our strategy has always been and will always be to position ourselves as being one of the only one in the world from a battery electric vehicle that not only specifies but makes the transmission piece, the motor piece, and the controller, which is the inverter. I hope that answers your question. Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC : I guess I was talking about, I think in certain vehicles, there are two separate actual physical products and then like on recent ones they're actually one large product. Is that... Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.: Yes, yes, I see what you mean, okay. Again, it's not one size fits all. There is a logic to integrate inverter and motor. I think in a battery electric vehicle what our customers are trying to do is limit the 400 volts or high-voltage cables in the car. And when you combine the motor and the inverter together, that helps you doing that. But we also see other architecture types that would keep those two elements separate. It's not because it's separate that I shouldn't work together like on dual-clutch transmission, the controller and the clutch are separate. Nevertheless, they function jointly. So, whether or not it is one unit or two different units, it has to talk to \u2013 both units have to talk to each other seamlessly. Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. Thanks for taking my question. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Murphy from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Good morning guys. And James, congrats on a long very successful career in transitioning the company for the future. And Fr\u00e9d, congrats but you've got a lot \u2013 you've got some big shoes to fill, so we're looking forward to it, literally and figuratively, right. So, maybe a first question, as you think about all the trade tariffs, everything that's going on right now and the uncertainty, how do you think about capital allocation decisions, right? Ron, you kind of went through the list and it's very helpful and you've obviously thought a lot about this. But I mean if something changes, right, it could change back in two years or six years. So, are you just going to have to follow your customers' lead on this stuff or are there other actions you can take? Because you make long-term capital commitments, not short-term capital commitments. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: Yes, the first thing, and Fr\u00e9d mentioned this, John, is that we typically produce in the region that our customers are in. We don't have a lot of cross-border products going. We don't serve our North American customers with parts coming out of China for example, right. So, that's a benefit for us for the first thing. But with that said, the Section 232 total automotive parts, obviously if that were to be enacted down the road that would significantly alter our decisions going forward about capital allocation and investments and where we put it. I would say that I think the lessons that's being learned here is that you have to remain flexible and balanced as you start to put investments throughout the world. And when you have a policy environment that tends to be unstable that just means that you have to build in more flexibility in the manufacturing footprint is what we're starting to learn. John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And then, maybe a second question as a follow-up to that. I mean, as you look at the rise in the buyback from $100 million to $150 million, does that mean that there are less opportunities sort of internally and as far as acquisitions that you're seeing on the horizon or is this just your prediction looks better \u2013 your financial position looks better and the stock looks cheap to you. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: It's what you just said the latter, financial position is good and the stock is cheap. It has nothing to do with the outlook on the M&A side. It's just the opportunity to buy stock, cheap, you're right. John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And then just lastly, I mean when we look at slide 19, it looks like the op income forecast went down ever so slightly but the actual operations are better. FX is a little bit less of a benefit. So, net-net it's about the same. I mean given all the puts and takes in the second half of the year that you're looking at, Ron, is this a conservative view just based on uncertainty? Because your first half performance has been very strong and in light of sort of the disruption on Ford's trucks, which should catch up in the third and fourth quarter, it seems like that things might be a bit better than you were initially expecting. But is this a conservative guide? Really how should we think about your positioning on this? Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: I wouldn't say it's conservative. I would say that there's a lot of risk factors in the back half of the year that we're focused on right now. And because of all those risk factors, things can move around rapidly for us. So, I think we put in all the risk elements that we're aware of and it's a very realistic number that we hope to deliver here. Actually, we will deliver it. John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thanks. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.: As I mentioned, we're focused on delivering this guidance, delivering our commitment. John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thank you very much and congrats, James. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Yes. Thank you, John. Operator : And we have time for one final question and that question comes from Armintas Sinkevicius from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Armintas Sinkevicius - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. When I think about the propulsion agnostic portfolio that James has assembled here and Fr\u00e9d will be taking over, one of your peers reports a bookings figure for power electronics and I know you just opened up a technical center. And I'm just trying to think through when should we start to see some of these power electronics products from Remy and Sevcon start to flow through the backlog and really start to impact the numbers here? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.: First of all, the power electronics is part of a bigger system, a bigger product that we sell. It's either imbedded into hybrid modules or drive module for electric vehicles. So, I don't think you'll see us breaking down the power electronics portion of what we sell. As you will see in the Investor Day, it is embedded in everything that we sell going forward and you'll be able to witness touching the products. But I don't think going forward we'll break it down like we won't break down friction versus mechanical or any other pieces of the system we sell. Armintas Sinkevicius - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Okay. Got it. And then I guess just how should investors be thinking about getting comfortable with the growth in power electronics? Just what should we be watching for as far as announcements or disclosures? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.: Yes. We'd love to announce more but we can't and we are very respectful of the confidentiality that we have with our customers. I think one way to look at it is if you look at our growth on H&E, a certain portion of it will always have power electronics in there. So, that will give you a little bit of light on our growth in this field of product. Armintas Sinkevicius - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. That's helpful. And then one more on the Section 232 automotive tariffs. You said it was a big impact. Is it a big direct impact as far as direct tariff costs? I know you said you produce in country, for country or does it lead to sort of bigger question marks around the supply chain? Just trying to think through how we should be thinking about the big impact comment. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.: Yes. As Ron mentioned, we produce where the final product is concerned. So, there will be very, very marginal direct impact, if not any. So, it's going to be \u2013 if it comes, it's going to be all indirect. Armintas Sinkevicius - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Thank you so much for taking the questions. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thank you. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thanks, Armintas. James R. Verrier - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thank you.

First, Fr\u00e9d Lissalde, our President and CEO, will comment on the industry, followed by a high-level overview of our Q3 results and full year outlook. He will then discuss some of our recent product wins and highlights from our recent Investor Day. Then, Ron Hundzinski, our Chief Financial Officer, will discuss the details of our results as well as our guidance. Please note that we have posted an earnings call presentation to the IR page of our website. You'll find the link in the Events & Presentations section, beneath the notice for this call. We encourage you to follow along during our discussion. With that, I'll turn it over to Fr\u00e9d. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thanks, Pat, and good morning, everyone. We're very pleased to share our results from Q3 and update you on our progress towards delivering our full year targets. I'll start by sharing a few thoughts on the macro environment and the industry, as shown on slide 6. Overall, I'm very proud to say that our growth over market was slightly stronger than we expected, while at the same time, global light vehicle production was much weaker. Let me first make a few remarks about the industry in Q3. Global light vehicle production came in down about 3% versus our expectation of more than 2% growth going into the quarter. This is a 500 basis points headwind versus our expectations. European light vehicle production was down 6% year-over-year as our customers continue to work through WLTP certification. Diesel/gas mix in Europe continues to shift. The diesel share declined by approximately 800 basis points year-over-year in Q3. Moving to China, light vehicle production was down 4% year-over-year, which was 700 basis points weaker than our expectations. North American light vehicle production increased 2% year-over-year and growth in our commercial vehicle business was about a 50 basis point top line benefit year-over-year. Moving to the industry for full year, our expectations are consistent with what we provided last month. This implies a slightly declining global production adjusted for our geographic exposure. Looking at the regions, we expect China flat to down 1%, Europe flat to down 1%, and North America pretty much flat. We still see continued industry headwinds for the remainder of 2018. We expect that the short-term production issues in Europe related to WLTP will continue into Q4. Also, in China, we're expecting industry volumes to remain under pressure through year end. But the key is that we expect to continue to outgrow the market in 2018 based on continued strong demand for our products. Let me now move to slide 7 to give you a brief summary of our Q3 results. Overall, I'm very pleased to the way the team is reacting to the weakening industry backdrop. With $2.5 billion in sales, we're up 3.6% organically excluding FX and Sevcon. This compares to our end market exposure, as mentioned before, down approximately 3%. So, our growth over the market was very strong in the quarter at more than 600 basis points. Looking at our regional growth, North America revenue grew double-digit. We saw low- to mid-single-digit growth in China despite the market decline. Europe revenue declined slightly year-over-year. This light vehicle growth was supplemented by positive revenue trends in commercial vehicle and off-road. Our earnings per share is at $1.00 excluding non-comparable items. Now, for the full year, our organic growth outlook is unchanged from the guidance we provided last month at our Investor Day. We continue to expect organic growth of 4.5% to 5.5% or organic growth of 500 basis points plus over market at the midpoint. We expect our earnings per share to be at $4.35 to $4.40, up 15% to 16% year-over-year. Looking at the market volatility and as we see the risks today, we expect to be at the mid- to low-end of this guidance. Despite the near-term industry volume challenges, we must remain focused on continuing to win new business with our customers around the world, and we shared several key awards during the quarter that are highlighted on slide 8. We would like to highlight two of them today. First, our electric drive module for the new electric vehicles from Great Wall Motors, this includes our EV transmission and electric motor system. Secondly, I'd like to point out that we're seeing traction on booking significant amount of business with our High Voltage Coolant Heater for battery electric vehicle. This quarter, we acquired two pieces of business : one in Europe, and one in Asia. We also would like to point out that our win rates across all propulsion systems \u2013 combustion, hybrid, and electric \u2013 are strong. Finally, I wanted to recap very briefly the highlights of our last Investor Day on slide 9. Our new business win supports the long-term outlook we shared last month. We expect 2023 revenue of $14 billion before any benefits from M&A. By 2023, we'll be overweight hybrid and electric revenue compared to industry volume, and we're targeting $1 billion of free cash flow in 2023. These targets are achievable because electrification accelerates the opportunities for BorgWarner. This is Ron's last earnings call with the company and I wanted to take a moment to personally thank him for his tremendous contribution over the years to our company. I speak for the entire management team in wishing Ron well in future career opportunities. So, thank you, Ron. All the best. Good luck. And with that, I turn the call over to you. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thank you, Fr\u00e9d, and good morning, everyone. Before I review the financial details, I'd like to provide you some of the highlights as I see them for the quarter. First, our organic revenue over market was better than our expectations. The lower overall organic growth was the result of lower industry volumes. However, we still outgrew the industry volume by more than 600 basis points. Second, incremental margin performance was negatively impacted by the rapid decline in industry volumes, which when combined with the temporary nature of the European volume weakness, limited our ability to reduce cost within the quarter. And finally, EPS was at the high end of our guidance we provided last month. Now, as Pat mentioned, I will be referring to supplemental financial slide deck that is posted on our website and I also encourage you to follow along. Let's turn to slide 11. On a reported basis, sales were up 2.6%, and on a comparable basis, our organic sales were up 3.6%. This is solid performance compared to our weighted average light vehicle industry production for the quarter, which was down approximately 3% year-over-year. We saw 4% growth in China against a production market that was down more than 4%. Europe revenue was down 2% compared to the 6% industry production decline in the quarter. North America revenue was up double-digits versus the 2% production growth in the quarter, and commercial vehicle was a benefit, contributing about 50 basis points of our growth. And diesel and gas mix in Western Europe was a headwind. Now, let's look at the year-over-year comparison for operating income which can be found on slide 12. Q3 adjusted operating profit was $293 million compared to $297 million in Q3 of 2017. Our operating margin of 11.7% was 50 basis point decline year-over-year due to the impact of Sevcon and higher R&D spending as a percentage of sales. On a comparable basis, operating income was up $6 million on $88 million of higher sales. That gives us an increment margin of 7% in the quarter which is below our mid-teens target. There are three main drivers of this weaker incremental margin performance. First, the rapid decline in industry volumes which when combined with the tempering nature of European volume weakness did limit our ability to reduce costs within the quarter. R&D timing related to new launches distorted our margin performance in the quarter as well, and raw material and tariff-related costs and inflation impacted us. Earnings per share on reported basis where at $0.98 per share, on an adjusted basis, net earnings were $1 per diluted share. Now, let's take a closer look at our operating segments in the quarter beginning on slide 13 of the deck. Engine segment net sales were $1.516 billion in the quarter. Sales growth for the Engine segment on a comparable basis was 2.1% as growth in North America was offset by lower China volumes. Adjusted EBIT was $238 million for the Engine segment or 15.7% of sales. On a comparable basis, the Engine segment adjusted EBIT was up $5 million on $32 million of higher sales for an incremental margin of 17%. This incremental margin performance is partially driven by better performance in our noncore emissions business. Turning to slide 14, Drivetrain segment net sales were $977 million in the quarter. Sales growth for the Drivetrain segment on a comparable basis was 6.3% primarily due to strong DCT growth in China, transmission components and all-wheel drive. Growth was partially mitigated by lower volumes in European customers were higher than average Drivetrain content. Adjusted EBIT was $108 million for the Drivetrain segment or 11% of sales. Sevcon had a 60 basis point negative impact on margins. On a comparable basis, the Drivetrain segment adjusted EBIT was up $2 million on $58 million of higher sales for an incremental margin of just 4%. This was driven by limited European cost reduction due to the temporary volume decline and timing of R&D spending for awarded programs. Now, I'd like to discuss our 2018 full year guidance. Turning to sales growth guidance for the full year on slide 16, we expect organic growth of 4.5% to 5.5%, which is consistent with last month's update. The Sevcon acquisition is expected to add approximately $57 million to revenue in 2018, currency is expected to be a $192 million tailwind, and total revenue is expected to be in the range of $10.48 billion to $10.58 billion. Our operating income walk is on slide 17. From a performance perspective, we expect mid-teens incremental margins on our sales growth. Our consolidated operating income margin is expected to be 12.3% to 12.4% or flattish year-over-year. To finish our full year guidance, please turn to slide 18. EPS guidance range of $4.35 to $4.40 per diluted share is unchanged from last month. We continue to target free cash flow of $550 million to $575 million; however, working capital pressures and tax payments will present a challenge in achieving this target. That being said, this is our goal and we are continuing to drive for this target. The tax rate is still expected to be in the low-26% range. Now, our fourth quarter guidance is on slide 20. Our guidance range for Q4 is wider than typical, which reflects the continued industry volume uncertainty we see through year end. First sales; we expect organic growth of 1% to 4.5%. EPS is expected to be in a range of $1.07 to $1.12. This guidance is based on a low-26% tax rate and incorporates a $75 million FX revenue headwind year-over-year. So, now let me summarize Q3. Overall, execution was solid in light of the challenging industry volumes. Like we mentioned before, organic sales growth of 3.6% was more than 600 basis points over industry production. The Q3 incremental margin of 7% was explained by the pace of revenue slow growth and R&D timing to support awarded programs. As we look at the remainder of 2018, the environment will remain challenging. However, we have an experienced team in place to react to these changes while still positioning the company for its future growth. Now, before I turn it over to Pat, I'd like to say a few things. First, BorgWarner is in an extremely strong position to compete in the coming electrification trend in powertrain. We have an outstanding portfolio of products. I have never seen this company stronger. Next, I would like to thank many people as I retire from BorgWarner. I'd like to thank the board of directors for their support over the years, and especially our Chairman. I would also like to thank the investment community from the buy and sell-side analysts who I've met over the years, in addition to the advisors from the accounting firms to the bankers. Also, I owe a big thank you for all the BWA employees, but even a bigger thank you to my finance staff, who I think are the most talented, humble and hard working group around. And I have a big endorsement goes out to Tom McGill, who has been a loyal Treasurer for me, and I have no doubt that his leadership alongside with Fr\u00e9d will continue to deliver the results expected by our investors. And finally, my most important thank you goes out to my wife Tina, who without her support, none of this would have been possible. So, with that, I'd like to turn it over to Pat. Patrick Nolan - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thank you, Ron. Sharon, we're ready to open up for questions. Operator : And your first question comes from Richard Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities. Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hey. Good morning, everyone. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.: Good morning, Rich. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: Good morning, Rich. Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hey, Ron. Best wishes. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thank you, Rich. Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Enjoy it. So, on China, down 4% for the market; you were up 4%, so 8 points outgrowth. Obviously, this past quarter was pretty sudden in terms of the changes to schedules, et cetera. If we just take a step back and think about growth rate in that market, which had been double-digits in a little better production environment, but if we think about kind of a flattish production environment, what should we be thinking with what you know with regards to backlog, et cetera and mix, what we \u2013 should be thinking about outgrowth for that market for you? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.: So, thanks, Rich. So, first of all, in Q3, China was a positive contributor. But first half of the year was ahead of the plan, and I think China also fixed a little bit of inventory for us, but still the new business growth is really, really significant for us. And going forward, I think you can expect double-digit over market in China. Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. So, no backing off of that with regards to what you see right now... Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.: No. Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : ...particular side, okay. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.: No. Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And then, just on \u2013 so, we're all square on tariffs. Last quarter, you talked about 10% to 20% in terms of impact, I think Ron did. Is that still playing out as envisioned? And then, if we're starting to think about 2019, any incremental impact from List 3? And then, I assume there's some lap over negative impact for 2019, but just if you could level set us there, I'd appreciate it. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: All right. Rich, I'll do 2018 and Fr\u00e9d will talk about 2019. You're correct that $10 million to $20 million of headwind in tariffs. We did see approximately about $10 million of headwinds in Q3 related to tariffs. So, I feel that we're still on track for what we've communicated \u2013 I think it was last month. I think in Q4, we'd probably continue to see about another $10 million of headwind in tariffs \u2013 and inflation, we kind of combine those together. And then, Fr\u00e9d? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.: Right. So, for 2019, one way to look at it is that we certainly see that pretty much in line. For 2018, we have a low recovery, and we are focused into working with our customers to get more recovery than zero. And so, that's going to be our focus going forward in 2019. Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : So, the way to think about this is, once we get into 2019, the impact should be less than $10 million a quarter (22:53). Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.: We might see a little bit more tariffs going forward, because I think it might be the beginning of the impact, but we also think that our focus into getting some recovery is going to compensate some of those increases. Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. All right. And then real quick, last one on return of capital with the stock, where it is, given where we are in the cycle, what are the latest thoughts there? Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: I would say, Rich, at this point, we're going to reevaluate that going into the 2019 plan, that will be communicated in the first quarter, because at this point, we're finished with the $150 million buybacks that we did for 2018. But we'll be up \u2013 the opportunities are there, we're going to take them. There's no question. But we'll have to communicate exactly what that buy is going to be as we go into the first quarter, okay? Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks. Thanks, again, Ron. Operator : Your next question comes from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thanks very much. Good morning and Ron, congratulations on your retirement. It's been great working with you. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thank you. Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: So, just to pick up on the question that Rich was asking about, he was looking at the tariffs and materials side. You talked earlier about basically inability to or decision not to moderate spending in view of what we saw as EU temporary weakness. So, I just want to understand what is your view to how long that kind of WLTP really weakness lasts? Should we see a short-term continued pressure on margins in view of that and how long do you think it lasts? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.: So, our view is that it's essentially a second half of 2018 impact and it's certainly going to carry on in Q4. And we also think that the volumes that have been lost in 2018 might not be recovered in 2019. But going forward, we'll do a better job in fixing costs to reduction of volume overall. Now, I think in Europe, early-2019 what we know is that it might actually be back to normal. Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. And then, Fr\u00e9d, you talked about strong win rates across propulsion types. We've seen some peers recently stepping up a bit or talking about stepping up their inorganic spend in electrification and I think that certainly validates some of the earlier moves you've made. But just any changes you might be seeing in the competitive environment? Any risk at this point you see to kind of expected product margins on the hybrid and electric side? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.: No, we don't. We're very, very successful in booking business on hybrids and electrics. And what Ron and I see when we get these requests for capital installment, we don't see any changes in margin going forward. So, we're very pleased with the booking rate. It remains strong across combustion, hybrid and electric. And there are many booked items that we can't disclose, as you may imagine, but we don't see any things changing from what we've told you in the past which is pretty much the same margins and capital intensity and return on capital. Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay. Perfect. I'll jump back in queue. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from David Leiker with Baird. David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.: Good morning, David. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: Good morning, David. David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: And Ron, likewise, congratulations. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thank you, David. David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Look forward to it. Fr\u00e9d, as we look at WLTP in Europe, I know it would be bouncing around a couple of different ways, but do you have a sense of your customers, what share of their vehicles they have gotten certified here as of the end of October, and what's left to go yet? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.: No, I don't. I don't have that detail. David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. But from what you're seeing, that's something that should be \u2013 everyone should be pretty close to caught up by the end of the Q4? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.: I think it's getting better. In Europe, we don't have views of inventories. And so, I think they still have some work to do, but I \u2013 we're not in those \u2013 we don't have those info. We don't \u2013 we're not in those types of details, David. David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then, on China, since you updated your guidance going into your Investor Day, it's gotten weaker. There are some talks here in October of even a more severe weakening, double-digit-type declines. Just, what are your \u2013 it sounds \u2013 I mean, what you have in your numbers, in your guidance, and that double-digit kind of decline carried into next year, anyway you can characterize what that might mean for you? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.: So, you're right. There is a lot of volatility. This is why we have kind of wide top line Q4 guidance, and I don't want to comment for next year, but we think that we are seeing public forecast a little bit on the optimistic side. If you see the car registration in September, it's down double-digit. So, we're protecting for a bit of that and it's difficult to forecast short-term, but, yeah, we see that market is going down and that's why we have that wide range of guidance. (29:21). David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then, one last item here. As we look at the sub-comment in the power electronics business and your work, I don't think you've booked anything on the automotive side yet on power electronics. But where are you on developing that product portfolio in the bid activity and opportunities for win there? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.: Yeah. We are absolutely on track. Sevcon is focused into playing in our iDM, so integrated Drive Module. That's their focus. As you know, on battery electric vehicle, we have transmissions. We also have transmission and motor as we've announced with Great Wall. And the next step for us is to develop and manufacture an integrated Drive Module including power electronics, that's the focus of Sevcon, and we are absolutely on track for doing that. David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: So, what do you think the timing is for you to be in a position to announce your first win with the power electronics business? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.: It might be a little bit early for commenting on the date, but we're getting there. It's a very high focus of ours. David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. Great. Thank you very much. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thank you, David. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from David Tamberrino with Goldman Sachs. David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great, guys. Thanks for getting us on and taking our questions today. I just wanted to follow-up on that. So, to be clear, your eDM doesn't have any power electronics embedded in it, the eDM (31:02)? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.: So, we have two types of product, Dave. We have the eDM, which is motor and transmission, and we have the iDM, which is power electronics, motor and transmission. The eDM is in production. The iDM is in development. David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. And then, I guess for my follow-up, as you looked at the China production schedules and kind of thought back to the guidance that you put out in September 18 of this year, how much \u2013 or how weak did you really fully expect that China industry to go? And what are you seeing from an inventory level of your customers' end market supply and if there's any risk to your views in the back \u2013 or at least the last quarter of the year? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.: So, as I mentioned in my opening comments, we have a wide range, 1% to 4.5%. When we looked at the guide that we did on September 18, it was due to two things : WLTP and China. WLTP and China was pretty much half and half for Q3 and Q4. And so far, even if I have already commented, we think we're going to be between the midpoint and the low-end of the guide, we don't see a change from what we guided back a month ago. David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you, gentlemen. Operator : Next question comes from John Murphy with Bank of America. John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : All right. Good morning, guys, and Ron, congratulations. I look forward to staying in touch, hopefully. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thank you, John. John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Fr\u00e9d, as you went through page 9 and talked about $14 billion as still the goal for 2023, you kind of had a heavy emphasis saying that that didn't include acquisitions. I'm just curious, given some of the stuff that's going on more recently with the KKR acquisition of Magneti Marelli \u2013 or the announcement of acquisition, if you're seeing any of this M&A activity heating up, either on a smaller or larger basis, and that may be a real opportunity for you in the future? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.: Yeah. So, the $14 billion is without any M&A. And John, we're always active on the M&A front. We have a team of great people focused on optimizing our product portfolio, making proposals for M&A \u2013 small, medium or big M&A \u2013 and this is something we will always focus on. Technology is always a key. M&A is always focused on, for us, for product leadership. And so, this is the direction we're marching towards. John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. When you say big, though, what does that mean? I mean, usually we've been hearing about sort of smaller stuff. What does big mean? Same size as Borg or is it half the size? What does that mean? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.: Small is small, medium is bigger than small, and big is bigger than medium. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: Borg is huge. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.: And Borg is huge. John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yeah. Okay. So, in the context of that, Borg is huge, in the context of that small, medium, big, is that a fair statement? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.: It's a fair statement. John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Then, just one quick follow-up, and Ron just because you're the numbers guy and you used to talk about this stuff. I mean, when we think about margin expansion, it used to be you needed high-single-digit to low-double-digit top line growth to get margin expansion. Has the equation changed when you look at sort of mid-single-digit top line growth, you may still be able to eke out a little bit of margin expansion? Is there sort of a new formula here that you guys might be able to sort of illustrate for folks, so we can understand sort of the rough math around margins versus top line? Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: Yeah. There's a couple of ways to look at this. First of all, John, you've been around for a long time and it was communicated that you needed about 8%, 9% growth to get margin expansion. I think we've proved as a company, we've lowered that point to probably, say, 4%, 5% growth. And actually, if you had taken a look at this quarter and some of those headwinds weren't there, we probably would have expanded margins as well at the 3% to 4% growth. I would say this, though: that mid-teens is more over a range of time as well. So, when you look at changes in volume in short order, it's a little bit harder to adjust your cost structure to get margin expansion, which happened to us in the third quarter. But I would say that this company right here is operating in a range where we can get margin expansion at the lower end, say, to this 3%, 4%, 4.5% growth. That's where we're operating right now. But you can't have rapid declines in volume like we saw in Q3. So, we've lowered that bar from like back in the days to be 8% to 9% to more about 3% to 4%. We can still expand margins. John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And thanks for pointing out that I've been around for a while, Ron. I appreciate that. Thanks. So, thanks very much. Congratulations, buddy. Take care. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: All right. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Colin Langan with UBS. Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Just want to like everyone else said, congratulations, Ron, on your retirement. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thank you. Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Can you just touchback on \u2013 I think I missed the first question on China tariff, what can you do if the tariff go from 10% to 25% next year? I mean, how should we think about that impact and what kind of mitigation actions might be possible? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.: So, we're focused on that. We have plans in place. We have several mitigation actions \u2013 localizing, resourcing, sharing, passing it along to our customers some of it. So, we have a view on what we need to do and we have plans in place if that will happen. Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC : And I mean, do you think you can execute those plans fairly quickly or should we think about that sort of \u2013 I think it would be like $20 million to $40 million annualized for this year. Does that more than double if it goes to 25%? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.: So, those resourcing plans would take time. There will be negotiation with customers on validation periods. So, the $20 million that you've seen in 2018, we've incurred that all our own. We've not passed anything through. Discussions take time and are happening. So, when tariff increases or when we see a bigger impact of what's already enacted, we also think that we can be successful in closing some negotiation with our customers. Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Got it. And I apologize if I missed this as well, but any color on the weak incremental in the Drivetrain margin of just 4%, if we look slide 14? Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: Yeah. I had that comment in my remarks. It's a combination of R&D spending and \u2013 what's the other item? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.: Europe. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: Europe. I'm sorry, (38:48). So, the rapid decline in the volumes, we didn't take any cost out, because we saw them as temporary in Europe. So, we didn't respond and take cost out. And as we saw it, the term we use in accounting is lack of absorption basically in our plants. And as Fr\u00e9d was saying earlier, we see that as a temporary thing in Europe. So, we do fully expect that our fourth quarter incremental margin to come back to a more reasonable level. Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC : And why don't you see that in Engine? Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: Engine, we get a tailwind little bit from the noncore emissions business as well. Remember, last year, there was a tremendous headwind on the Engine side, and this year, we're seeing a little bit more tailwind. And R&D spending was more heavily rated to the Drivetrain as well. So, Engine had a good incremental margin primarily because of the tailwinds of the emissions business or the thermostat business we're trying to sell. Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. And then just lastly, it sounds like you have a pretty broad range in your guidance anyway. But any color on the sensitivity to China production if we see it come in \u2013 I think IHS has it flat if it comes in down 1% for the year. What would that mean in terms of your risk? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.: So, as I mentioned before, we have a wide range of guide. We've protected for some downturn. I suggest Pat can follow-up with you on that particular question, if you like. Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. All right. Well, thanks for taking my question. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thanks, Colin. Operator : Next question comes from Brian Johnson with Barclays. Stephen Hunt - Barclays Capital Securities Ltd.: Yes. Hi. Good morning, team. This is actually Stephen Hunt on for Brian. Ron, congrats on retirement and your future opportunities, I wish you the best. Just want to drilldown a little bit on European light vehicle here. So, Europe light vehicle production was down 5% in the quarter. Just wondering if you guys can provide any color on Borg's outperformance or in line performance, not sure what it was in the quarter. And then, also as we think about the supply chain from (41:03) standpoint as we think about each OEMs that you're serving and how to think about kind of from a manufacturing just-in-time standpoint delivery, et cetera. How tie are you guys to each individual plant versus kind of just overall levels of production in Europe? And then, I've a couple follow-up questions. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: So, before Fr\u00e9d, let me just start give you some of the numbers on \u2013 in my script. I was saying that we saw negative 2% growth in Europe where the market was negative 6%. I think you asked about China. China, we saw, was up \u2013 we said China 2% growth on a market that was down about 4%. So, just on the numbers side, all right? So, Fr\u00e9d? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.: No. It's absolutely right. It's consistent with the fact that regularly we overgrow or outgrow the market by 500 basis points to 600 basis points. So, in Q3, it was closer to 600 basis points and a little bit more. But this outgrowing the market is where we want to be, and you see that in Q3 and also you see that in our longer-term guide. Stephen Hunt - Barclays Capital Securities Ltd.: Okay. And then, just any color on \u2013 because you guys are pretty close to WLTP right now. Just wondering from supply chain manufacturing standpoint, particularly as we think about the differences between kind of the transmission versus trends in the Drivetrain versus the Engine, how to think about kind of Borg's positioning as you think through kind of the next couple months and get through these WLTP issues? Just wondering if there's any key differences in how to think about maybe OEM's ability to stock up or build more engines or drivetrains, et cetera, through the WLTP. Any color you could provide on that would be helpful. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.: It's tough for us to have that detail. We don't see a lot of impact \u2013 or differences between the Engine side of the business and the Drivetrain side of the business regarding call offs. We also think that progress are being made by the carmakers on getting this done and \u2013 yeah, for sure, it's going to impact Q4, but having a longer term view is a little bit difficult for us. But to your questions, we don't see any impact between Engine and Drivetrain. Stephen Hunt - Barclays Capital Securities Ltd.: Yeah, understood. Okay. Good. And then just one last housekeeping one, free cash flow, it sounds like there's some potential downside to that due to working capital and tax payments. Just wondering if you can kind of quantify \u2013 roughly quantify what the downside could potentially look like. And then also, as you think heading into 2019, is it just a one-time thing that's going to reverse, so to speak, into 2019 or is that kind of ongoing? Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: I'm not going to quantify the headwinds. All we're going to say is that given some customer responses we saw at the end of Q3, we're anticipating some of our customers may short pay us a little bit in the fourth quarter. And we're going to make sure that we do everything, given them phone calls to make sure they don't do that. We just want to make everybody know that there are some challenges in hitting the free cash flow target at this point. 2019 is too early right now, Stephen, to say anything. They'll have to come out in the first quarter when we provide guidance. But it is kind of on a temporary basis I would say. Our working capital is temporary. Stephen Hunt - Barclays Capital Securities Ltd.: Okay. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.: The focus on free cash flow and working capital and CapEx is very central, and we're certainly marching towards our $1 billion free cash flow in 2023. Stephen Hunt - Barclays Capital Securities Ltd.: Got it. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : And we have a question from Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets. Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Ron, all the best as well from me. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: Hey, Joe. Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Fr\u00e9d, maybe just bigger picture, at the Analyst Day and in the past, you've sort of mentioned that the sweet spot for you from a content perspective is really on the plug-in hybrids. Near-term, right, with some of the WLTP rulings and I think some of the credits to some of the countries as well, it seems there has been a step back from that. Are you seeing that? And I guess specifically with the WLTP stuff, are you seeing any sort of change in how customers are thinking about plug-in hybrids as they begin to source next-generation platforms? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.: No. I don't see any changes. Hybrid is, for sure, a great product for us. It adds content. We have two times more content on the hybrid than on the combustion propulsion architecture, so \u2013 and we don't see any slowdown in any parts of the world in going towards hybrids. P2, for sure, but also other technologies that we can support, so it's still a great story for us, we're booking hybrids to plan, and the overweight strategy on hybrids and electric is taking shape. Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. And then, from the near-term impact on maybe some customers pulling plug-in hybrids that doesn't impact you that much, because really that's more in your bookings than in your base business? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.: You're right. Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Thank you. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thank you, Joe. Ronald T. Hundzinski - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thank you, Joe. Operator : There are no further questions in queue. Mr. Patrick Nolan, I will turn the call back over to you. Patrick Nolan - BorgWarner, Inc.: Thank you. I'd like to thank you all for your great questions today. If you have any follow-ups, please feel free to reach out to me. With that, Sharon, you can close the call. Operator : That does conclude the BorgWarner 2018 third quarter results conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BorgWarner 2018 Fourth Quarter and Full-Year Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Patrick Nolan, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Nolan, you may begin your conference. Patrick Nolan : Thank you, Sharon. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. We issued our earnings and backlog releases at 6 :30 AM Eastern Time. We posted on our website for borgwarner.com, on our homepage and on our Investor Relations homepage. A replay of today's call will be available through March 1st. The dial-in number is 855-859-2056 and the conference id is 6778077, where you can simply listen to the replay on our website. With regard to our Investor Relations calendar, we will be attending multiple conferences between now and our next earnings release. Please see the Events section of our IR page for a full list. Before we begin, I need to inform you that during this call, we may make forward looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties as detailed in our 10-K/A. Our actual results may differ significantly from matters discussed today. Also during today's presentation, we will highlight certain non-GAAP measures in order to provide a clear picture of how the core business performed for comparison purposes with prior period. When you hear us say on a comparable basis, that means excluding the impact of FX, net M&A and other non-comparable item. When you hear us say adjusted, that means excluding non-comparable item. When you hear us say on a reported basis, that means U.S. GAAP. We will also refer to our growth compared to our market. When you hear us say market, that means the change in light vehicle production weighted for our geographic exposure. Our outgrowth is defined as our organic revenue change versus our market. Now back to today's call. First Fred Lissalde, our President and CEO will discuss our achievements of 2018. Fred will then comment on the industry outlook. This will be followed by a high level overview of our Q4 results, as well as our 2019 outlook. Fred will conclude our highlights of our three-year net new business backlog. And Tom McGill, our Interim CFO and Treasurer, will discuss the details of our results as well as our guidance. Please note that we have posted an earnings call presentation to the IR page of our website. We encourage you to follow along with these slides during our discussion. With that, I'm happy to turn it over to Fred. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : Thanks Pat, and good morning everyone. Today we're pleased to share our results for 2018, our initial guidance for 2019 and our three years backlog. I'd like to start by sharing a few thoughts on 2018 on slide 6. 2018 was the year of strong execution for BorgWarner. Despite the industry volatility, we delivered more than 600 basis points of our growth. This is an amazing performance. We had significant launches and wins across combustion, hybrid and electric vehicles. Specifically, wins in hybrid and electric included multiple P2 programs, including three complete module awards, multiple high-voltage coolant heater awards for battery electric vehicles and continued electric motor and electric drive module bookings. At our Investor Day, we shared a 2023 revenue outlook of $14 billion before any M&A and a free cash flow outlook of $1 billion. As you will see later, our backlog supports the necessary outgrowth to reach these goals. We continue to approach our customers as a balanced propulsion partner. Looking at the win flows, we expect to be overweight in hybrid and electric by 2023. Turning to the industry on slide 7, and starting with Q4, the global light vehicle production came down about 3% versus our expectation of about 1% decline going into the quarter. So this was a 200 basis point headwind versus our expectation. However, I'm very proud to say that our outgrowth in Q4 was slightly stronger than what we expected, which allowed us to achieve our growth guidance. The biggest impact to industry volume expectation were, once again, Europe and China. European light vehicle production was down 6% year-over-year as our customers continued to work through WLTP certification. China light vehicle production was down 15% year-over-year and nearly 20% in December. Now for 2019, we expect that the challenging conditions in China and Europe will continue into 2019. In Europe, we still expect first half industrial volume to decline as customers work through the final WLTP impacts. In China, we expect double-digit industry declines in Q1 as customers reduce inventory. As a result, this is also impacting the launch of some of our backlog. As we look to the full year, we expect a market decline in the minus 2% to minus 5% range. At the midpoint of our guide, we're factoring in China down 10%, Europe down 3% and North America down 2%. But the key is that we expect to continue to outgrow the market in 2019 based on continued strong demand for our product. Let me now move to Slide 8. First, a brief summary of the Q4 results. Overall, we're very pleased with the way the teams reacted to the weaker industry backdrop. With $2.6 billion in sales, we are up 2% organically. This compares to our market being down approximately 3%. So our outgrowth was very strong in the quarter at approximately 500 basis points. Looking at our regional light vehicle growth, our North America revenue grew high-single digits. We saw a low-single digit revenue decline in China or more than 10% better than the industrial decline. Europe, revenue declined low-single digits. This light vehicle growth was supplemented by positive revenue trends in commercial vehicle and off-road. We reached our goal of a double-digit incremental margin despite the industry volume volatility. Our earnings per share is at $1.21 and was above our guidance range due to a year and tax true-up. Now for the full-year 2019, we expect revenue to be down 2.5% to up 2% organically. This represents an outgrowth of 250 basis points to 400 basis points over our expected market decline. Excluding the first quarter, which is being impacted by launch timing and customer inventory adjustments, our outgrowth is expected to be 400 basis points to 550 basis points above market. We expect our earnings per share to be at $4.00 to $4.35 with a wider than typical range reflecting the end market uncertainty. While we continue to deliver strong outgrowth in 2019, we will also look at ways to adjust our cost structure to adapt to the current environment without compromising our longer-term aspirations. Now let's look at this exciting longer-term view for BorgWarner with a snapshot of our outdated backlog. Starting on slide 10, from a product perspective, we see growth across the portfolio, 20% of our backlog will be related to vehicles with combustion propulsion systems, 70% of our backlog will be related to hybrid, and 10% of our backlog will be related to battery electric vehicles. So 80% of our backlog is from the hybrid and electric. This is a great example on how we are executing our proportional growth strategy with overweight hybrid and electric. Turning to Slide 11. From a regional perspective, we see outgrowth in all our major markets; 25% of the backlog is in the Americas, 15% is in Europe as continued diesel declines impact the net new business backlog, 60% of the backlog is in Asia. Within this, China accounts for 50%. China is where the music is being played for hybrids and electrics, and we're doing very, very well there. This is playing an increased factor in our growth. From a customer perspective, our very diverse customer base is increasingly important. This gives us great insight to what's happening across the entire propulsion landscape. Wrapping up on slide 12, our '19 to '21 backlog is expected to be within the range of $2 billion to $2.4 billion. You'll notice that the 2019 backlog is down from last year's disclosure due to [indiscernible] industry volumes and launch timing impact in 2019. However, you notice strong backlog for 2020 and 2021. Importantly, this backlog will support an average outgrowth of 500 basis points to 600 basis points for the next three years, and keep us on track to reach $14 billion of revenue by 2023. These targets are achievable because electrification accelerates the opportunities for BorgWarner. With that, I will hand it over to Tom. Thomas McGill : Thank you, Fred. Good morning everyone. Before I review the financial details, I'd like to provide some of the highlights as I see them for the fourth quarter. First, our outgrowth remains strong at 500 basis points. This allowed us to deliver our guidance despite end markets that continue to weaken throughout Q4. Second, incremental margin performance was in line with our expectations due to strong performance in our Drivetrain segment and corporate cost controls. And finally free cash flow generation was better than expected due to lower working capital and capital spending requirements. So let's turn to Slide 14. On a comparable basis, our organic sales were up 2%. This is solid performance compared to our weighted average light vehicle industry production for the quarter, which was down approximately 3% year-over-year. We saw a 3% decline in China against the production market that was down more than 15%. Europe revenue was down 2% compared to the 6% industry production decline in the quarter. North America revenue was up high-single digit versus the 2% production growth in the quarter. Commercial vehicle was a benefit contributing about 50 basis points to our growth. Now let's look at the year-over-year comparison for operating income which can be found on slide 15. Q4 adjusted operating profit was $323 million compared to $327 million in Q4 '17. Our operating margin of 12.6% was flat year-over-year. On a comparable basis, operating income was up $6 million on $52 million of higher sales. That gives us an incremental margin of 11% in the quarter which was in line with our double-digit goal going into the quarter. However, this is below our long-term mid teens target due to the rapid decline in industry volume and tariff-related cost inflation. Earnings per share on a reported basis were $1.10 per diluted share and on an adjusted basis net earnings were a $1.21 per diluted share. So, now let's take a closer look at our operating segments in the quarter, beginning on slide 16 of the deck. Reported Engine segment net sales were $1.54 billion in the quarter. Sales growth for the Engine segment on a comparable basis was 0.4% as growth in North America was offset by lower Europe and China volumes. Adjusted EBIT was $243 million for the Engine segment or 15.7% of sales. On a comparable basis, the Engine segment's adjusted EBIT was down to $16 million and $6 million of higher sales. This weak incremental margin performance was driven by the rapid decline in industry volumes. We are not satisfied by this performance and are exploring additional cost actions within the Engine segment. Now turning to Slide 17; the Drivetrain segment net sales were $1.05 billion in the quarter. Sales growth for the Drivetrain segment on a comparable basis was 4.4%, primarily due to strong DCT growth in China, as well as transmission components in all-wheel drive growth in North America. Growth was partially mitigated by lower volumes on European customers with higher than average drivetrain content. Adjusted EBIT was $131 million for the Drivetrain segment, or 12.5% of sales. On a comparable basis, the Drivetrain segment's adjusted EBIT was up $9 million and $45 million of higher sales for an incremental margin of 20%. The strong performance was driven by the benefit of new programs. Before I move on to our guidance, I would like to discuss our cash performance for Q4. Our annual free cash flow came in at $580 million and that's ahead of about $550 million to $575 million guidance and our expectations going into Q4. There are two factors driving the strong performance. Number one is that the working capital pressures that we expected in Q4 were not as bad as we originally feared. And number two, was due to the push-out of some of our new programs from first half '19 to second half '19, some of our planned Q4 capital spending was delayed into 2019. Now I'd like to discuss our 2019 full-year guidance. So turning to sales growth guidance for the full year on slide 19, our guidance is based on a market assumption of down 2% to 5%. We expect our organic revenue change of negative 2.5% to positive 2% or 250 basis points to 400 basis points of outgrowth. The thermostat divestiture is expected to reduce sales by approximately $98 million in 2019. Currency is expected to be at $280 million headwind. So total revenue is expected to be in the range of $9.9 billion to $10.37 billion. Our operating income walk is on slide 20. Our consolidated operating income margin is expected to be flat to down in 2019. This margin performance is due to the relatively low organic growth combined with costs related to tariffs, supplier bankruptcy costs in Europe and changes to launch timing throughout 2019. To finish up our full-year guidance, please turn to Slide 21. Our EPS guidance range is in the $4.00 per dilute share to $4.35 per diluted share range. Our guidance range is wider than typical. We're targeting a free cash flow of $550 million to $600 million. The midpoint of this guidance implies flat free cash flow year-over-year as higher CapEx spending is expected to be offset by lower working capital usage. The tax rate for 2019 is expected to be approximately 26%. On Slide 23 is our first quarter guidance. First, sales. We expect an organic sales decline of 5.5% to 7.5%, and this is roughly in line with our market forecast as our outgrowth is impacted by the timing of launches in 2019 and customer inventories of programs launched during 2018. Our earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.92 per share to $0.96 per share and this guidance is based on a 26% tax rate and incorporates a $130 million FX revenue headwind year-over-year. So in conclusion, let me summarize our Q4 and our outlook. Our overall execution was solid in light of the challenging industry volume. Our organic sales growth was 2.0% or 500 basis points of outgrowth. The Q4 incremental margin of 11% was in line with our expectations driven by strong performance in our Drivetrain segment and corporate cost controls. As we look into 2019, the environment will remain challenging. However, we are continuing to outgrow the industry and we'll take the necessary steps to adjust our costs to the changing industry volume outlook. With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Pat. Patrick Nolan : Thank you Tom. Sharon, we're ready to open up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank. Emmanuel Rosner : First question on - are on the first quarter's - the first quarter factors and can you maybe highlight what your production assumptions are maybe by market or for the first quarter? And then just maybe a little bit more color around how some of these factors impact your backlog. It looks like you're - I mean you are essentially saying you want to really outperform the underlying markets in Q1. So I assume there's minimal amount of backlog. And so how do these new production and dynamics around the various market impact the backlog in Q1? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : So if you all focus on Q1, it's essentially Europe and China. And in China, we think that the run rate in Q1 is not going to be much better than the run rate we saw in December. So it's you know - it's below minus 20%. And in Europe - also we see Europe around minus 5%, minus 6% which also is pretty much the run rate that we saw in Q4 last year. Now when it comes to the backlog, it impacts the backlog where actually - literally there is no backlog in Q1. If you look at the backlog evolution and if you are removing Q1, we're pretty much absolutely in line with what we've announced and marching towards this $2 billion to $2.4 billion. And the outgrowth of the market actually, if you take Q1 out, if you do the math on outgrowth of the market in Q2 to Q4, we are around 400 basis points to 550 basis points, which supports our long-term view of $14 billion by 2023. Emmanuel Rosner : No, I really saw that and that's helpful color. I'm just - curious on the ground, how does that actually sort of translate in the first quarter, because obviously the whole beauty of the backlog is, it is growth above market. So the markets are extremely weak in Q1 and that's a - I think it's a fair conservative assumption. I'm just curious what it is that's on the ground in your plans that drives the lack of backlog in the first quarter? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : Well, it's essentially the China volume of new programs that are - that are lower right. And it's because of - of the market being down so much. Also we have and I think we talked about it before, some Europe and North America timing, but the majority of the impact is in China. Emmanuel Rosner : And I guess my second question then is, you mentioned maybe three margin drivers for the 2019 guidance. The - obviously, I understand the low organic gross piece of it, but then you also mentioned tariffs, supplier bankruptcies and then changes in the launch timing. Can you maybe give a little more color on each of these - on each of these buckets and any numbers you are able to share? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : So from a - from a full-year basis at the high end of our guide, we have an incremental of single digit. I think it's around 6% and that's essentially linked to the weaker Q1. At the low end of our guide, we have - have a decremental. that is, a little bit on the high side and it's also linked in Q1 from - a volume and conversion standpoint. Supplier bankruptcy is around $5 million, if I had to show a number. And as you know, tariff is also impacting us. And on the announced perspective we're not - we're not slowing down on any R&D announced support and that has an impact of about $10 million. Emmanuel Rosner : And the tariffs? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : The tariff impact is about $20 million, mostly in first half. Operator : Your next question comes from Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets. Joseph Spak : I just wanted to maybe follow along some of that and, Fred, some of your comments because if you look at the implied guidance beyond the first quarter on a total revenue basis, it looks like you're flat year-over-year, but then the outgrowth is like 4%, which I think is the number you said. So I know that's sort of just in the math, so I was wondering if you can provide a little bit more texture to the cadence because it would seem like what you're basically saying is still some issues in the second quarter and then maybe a little bit stronger outgrowth in the back half. Is that fair? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : The outgrowth, if you remove Q1 with inventory adjustment in China, launch timing is actually improving quarter-over-quarter. And the back half of 2019, the outgrowth is close to 500 basis points, which was - which is in line with the outgrowth of last year, and which is in line with the backlog and in line with the $14 billion by 2023. So that's the cadence and that's the sequence of that backlog and outgrowth of the market. Joseph Spak : And then on the backlog, I was wondering if you could just give a little bit more - you mentioned the China number and that's where all the action is, and it's actually a big percentage of the backlog. Can you talk a little bit more about the type of business you're running there, who you're running it with? And then also, maybe just if you care to add, like how much of the backlog is turbochargers and maybe even how much of that is turbos for hybrid vehicles? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : All right. So let me give you some color on the backlog. About 15% of the backlog is related to turbos, about 30% of the backlog is related to transmission products including DCT and including hybrid products, 20% of the backlog is all-wheel drive and 15% of the backlog is around rotating electric components and motors. In China, most of our backlog is advanced hybrids battery electric vehicle. But we also grow in some of our combustion products. So I would say it's pretty much across the board, 80% of the backlog being hybrid and electric, and I think this is a great example on how we execute the strategy of being overweight in hybrid and electric by 2023. Joseph Spak : And then within China, is it domestic? Is it the global OEs? Any color there? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : So it's about 50/50. We are 50% working with the Chinese, the big ones and we're doing well with them and the other 50% are with the western JVs. Operator : Your next question comes from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Noah Kaye : And actually just to follow up on Joe's question, it's really around the methodology and assumptions that you're making to derisk that three-year backlog number. You know I think we have a sense that the number of new energy vehicle car makers there is unsustainable. So what should investors know about your methodology and your conviction level in this three-year backlog number? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : So Noah, we incorporate risk factors and we put in a lot of intelligence in volume adjustments. And we've done that since a few years. There is no change in what we do. We are taking all that in account when we look at the three-year backlog. Noah Kaye : And then maybe switching gears, how should we think about priorities for cash at '19? You kept your dividend unchanged. You know in 4Q, could you get more aggressive on share buybacks considering what stock is versus this prior Q? And then do you have any active conversations around the M&A pipeline that might materialize? Thomas McGill : Noah, this is Tom. So first of all, with dividends we've said before that we will grow dividends with our free cash flow growth. So we were kept on a level this year. On the stock buyback, we're guiding to share repurchases of about $100 million versus about $150 million in 2018. Our 2019 guidance is similar to how we initiated 2018 as well. However, we're going to continue to buy back shares opportunistically as has been our historical practice when we're producing excess cash. And if there's no near-term M&A possibilities, we will consider buying back additional shares. So, with that - and then we - again, we do continue to look at M&A with a focus on technology. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : And I could give you some color on this. Technology is really what's driving our approach, and technology is what drives our focus and our decisions. So we continue to be opportunistic and very, very disciplined the way we look at M&A. And you know it's always been the focus, will always be a focus, always very technology-driven. Operator : Your next question comes from David Tamberrino with Goldman Sachs. David Tamberrino : Good morning, gentlemen. I just wanted to ask you about your regional production guidance, because just looking at the different suppliers and kind of forecasts that are out there, I think you have the most conservative that we've seen so far. So just curious if this is more a reflection of what you're seeing from your customers or really just your beliefs in the market, given it is a little bit lower than I think everybody else is baking in for their numbers Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : You know I think it's early in the year. We feel that you know, we need to be a little bit prudent in the market assumptions. From what we see, we see Q1 with inventory adjustment and some volume delays. So what we are focusing on is focusing on what we can control and focusing on our strategy to outgrow the market around 500 basis points year-over-year. You can have some plus, some years or quarter, we're going north of that like we did last year. Some years or quarter we're going to be a little bit lower than that like Q1 this year. But that's our focus and - I think it's the right thing to do, to be prudent looking at the volatility of all those market dynamics right now. David Tamberrino : So it's not necessarily anything you're seeing from a specific program. It's more just where we've left 2018. That's the best place to start given the chop? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : I think - yeah, I would agree with that. David Tamberrino : And then my follow-up is Bosch recently bought out their partner Daimler's stake in this electric EM-motive JV that they used to have. Does - that competitor taking full control of an E-motors business, is that going to create more of a competitive market? You know on the back of this maybe, what are you seeing in terms of competition for, you know some of those complete module awards that you've been getting and you've been winning? Thank you. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : We're very, very happy with the motor that we have. We have a great motor. We have a great technology with a PACE Award. We're very happy with the booking flow that we see. And as we mentioned before, we don't see any differences from a competition intensity in this field than what we see in other fields in other product lines. Operator : Your next question comes from Rod Lache with Wolfe Research. Rod Lache : I had some - I was hoping you can just clarify some things for us on the backlog. If I looked at the midpoint of your backlog breakdown from last year, hybrid was $919 million. And now it's a $1.05 billion over that. Actually a little bit, it looks like a $550 million increase. Combustion went from $1 billion down to $440 million. And then if I look at the regional breakdown, China has actually increased from $660 million to $1.01 billion. It looks like North America - the Americas and Europe are down. So is the way that we should interpret this is that basically what you're winning is overwhelmingly in China and hybrid? And you're not winning as much in the Western markets? And if that's the case, why are there not that many awards in the Western markets? What does the pipeline look like? And what's been happening in these markets? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : So two things I would say Rod. First one is, we strongly believe that China is where the music is played from a battery electric vehicle standpoint and we're doing very well here - there. And we're very proud about having 50% of our backlog being in China. In Europe, when you look at the backlog you need to - I think factor that effect that it's made of the diesel decline. And if you factor that back in, I think you will increase that European backlog by about 10%. And in North America, even if customers are moving, I think customers are waiting on regulations that we hope are going to become published and real in the next weeks or months. So that's what I would say to give you some color on your question. Rod Lache : So it's not so much that you've missed out or lost share. It's just that those contracts haven't been awarded. Can you give us any color on what the pipeline looks like as you look forward? And then just lastly, obviously there's been a lot of volatility in China production and some - from time to time you have some of those customers push out launches? With that in mind, can you just give us a feel for how you might have incorporated some conservatism in the China assumptions for backlog? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : So we don't see program cancellations. We see some delays and we see volumes of the backlog being impacted by the fact that the Chinese market is lower and inventories are being are being managed. I would say that what I see is that the backlog is well balanced across the three regions. When I look at the intensity of what people are doing from a hybrid and electric standpoint, and we're very confident that the booking that we see coming our way is supporting a constant 500 basis points outgrowth and confirming that $14 billion by 2023. Rod Lache : So just to clarify Fred, going forward is the opportunity set accelerating in Europe or is it still that most of the activity, not just hybrid, but just in general, net new business opportunity? So obviously it's hard for us to see what's been happening net of the diesel decline. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : I would say China is still a significant portion of the backlog. China is remaining significant and Europe is going to come. The good thing and what we really like where we are is that, from a from a hybrid and electric standpoint, we're going to get scale in China. And getting scale is what's important once we are - we're at scale. It's going to be really, really an enabler for us to be booking business in Europe and in North America. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from John Murphy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. John Murphy : I just want to follow on Rod's question, because I think it's probably one of most important things we learned today here in these backlog shifts. When you look at the extreme shifts that Rod highlighted, I mean how much of that is being driven by program wins and maybe delays and is there any component of it that's based on changes in volume assumptions, and how - means, how confident are you with these numbers, obviously things can shift around? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : So as I mentioned, we are incorporating a certain level of risk and volume adjustments in the backlog. And we are used to - since we talk to everyone and since we have a very broad customer base, we used to discount what customers tell us and - but we feel good about where we are. The backlog to 2021 is 100% booked, and 2023 is about 80% booked. So the biggest risk that you would have between now and 2021 would be industry volume. John Murphy : Fred, maybe just a follow up. I mean the preponderance of the shift is a result of programs, not industry or program volume assumption. I mean this is really a shift in program wins for you, is that correct? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : I would say that there is a timing effect in 2018. If you didn't have Q1 the way we look at it, you would see a backlog that would be absolutely in line with what we've announced last year, which was around $700 million to $800 million. So if you remove Q1, the 2019 backlog would be flat versus the prior announcement. Nevertheless or in addition, I would say that, what's important for us is to really focus on what we can control which is the outgrowth of the market and which is launching the products and booking the new businesses. So, if you remove that timing effect of Q1, we're actually absolutely in-line with what we've announced before. John Murphy : I apologize Fred. I might be asking the question incorrectly - is that a fair statement? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : I think it is a fair statement. We see an acceleration in the flow of products that we win in hybrid and also you need to factoring in - factor in the diesel decline that impacts the volume on the production spend, on the combustion segment. John Murphy : And then just to follow up and lastly, the margins and return implications for these kinds of shifts, I mean as we think about the next three years, and maybe Tom, this is a question for you here, what - will that have a big implication for margins and returns as we see this shift away from combustion towards hybrids and EVs as you have to put maybe more capacity into play? And as Fred alluded, you need to build scale in China so that you can compete back in North American Europe to try to understand the marginal return implications. Thomas McGill : Right. We don't anticipate any changes in margins and returns when we close business. And this is done on our investor presentation. Yeah, we have certain return on invested capital hurdle and those hurdles are the same no matter the region or the type of product. So yeah - so we have that minimum hurdle rate, we can always go to go above that. But what we're seeing on our business wins and hybrid and electric is kind of an average return on invested capital that's very consistent with what we have on combustion. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : And then bring our CapEx, we intend to have that. They'll be within that same 5.5% to 6.5% range long term. Again we're hoping to drive that to the lower end of the range, maybe go lower but that factors there in as well. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Colin Langan with UBS. Colin Langan : Any color on the margin outlook, how we should think about it between the two different segments? It seems like Engine, particularly this quarter, is under a lot of pressure. Should we expect that to continue or accelerate or is there going to be some stabilization there? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : Yes, I'd say a couple of things. One is, and we've talked about this. For us to get our mid-teen incremental goal, we're looking for some minimum amount of growth of at least 2% because that growth will help us drive that incremental margin and we admit that on the Engine side separately, and I talked about it. We're not really happy with the incremental and decremental downtime Engine right now. So we're going to take a closer look at that and see if there's some cost actions that we can take to get that more in line with our long-term expectations. Colin Langan : And can you - you mentioned earlier the tariff headwind was I think it's the $20 million. Is that an incremental impact of tariff? I thought there was a big hit and already. And then is that assuming a 25% tariff which obviously is not imposed yet, but was Brent? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : The tariff is $20 million incremental in first half. Colin Langan : And it assumes the 25% rate in there? Thomas McGill : It's for the tariffs that are currently in place, but we have not made any assumption for any tariffs that have not been decided on. So List 3 has very little impact. Operator : Your next question comes from Brian Johnson with Barclays. Brian Johnson : Yes. I appreciate your conservative end market guide and not depending on macro to bounce back, but I'm struck by the slowdown in above-market growth the 250 basis point to 400 basis point range versus the strong 4Q and '18 as a whole was over 600 basis points. Could you maybe break down, how much of that is due to just the delay of the Q1 backlog and how much is conservatism around other factors? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : It's almost all around the Q1 backlog. As I mentioned before, if you remove the - no backlog in Q1, we're in line with the 500 basis points at midpoint. Brian Johnson : And that the backlog, the programs that would have been launched in Q1, why do they just launch later in the year or do they just kind of roll into '19 given everything's pushed out a quarter? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : Yes. Brian Johnson : I mean, roll into 2020. I'm sorry. One year out. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : Yes they are - you have some delays announced you have also some lower volume announced, due to the Q1 market situation especially in China. And this is going to roll out in the future years as you as you've seen the 2020 and '21 backlog is strong. Yeah, so it's a timing essentially linked to Q1. Brian Johnson : And how much of that '20 backlog nearly doubling versus '19 is program delays versus fresh programs? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : I'm not sure, I can give you that granularity at this point in time, Brian. Brian Johnson : And then final question around the backlog. Could you give us more color on not just the - you've talked about the propulsion mix in the China backlog, but the mix of OEMs between global JVs, the strong local players e.g. Geely, Great Wall and others and then the more regional smaller tier, low - lower tier OEMs who have to catch up on powertrain but also in the most macro impacted regions? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : There was strong - we were strong with that, with the big Chinese OEMs. That's really the punch line, Brian. And we will follow up with you on your prior question. I apologize I cannot give you that granularity. On China, it's the big ones. Operator : Your next question comes from Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo. Deepa Raghavan : This is Deepa Raghavan for Rich Kwas. A couple of questions from me. A medium term question first. What are some of the production assumptions in the backlog for your 2020, 2021 target particularly in China, but also others too? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : So the industry assumption that we have in 2020 and 2021 is a growth of 1%, which is the baseline assumption that we have that - built up our $14 billion by 2023. Deepa Raghavan : Is there a split between China versus North American production assumptions? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : I would say that we're incorporating a kind of a slower growth in China that we've seen in the past with maybe a low-single digit growth in that market going forward. Deepa Raghavan : My second question would be, can you discuss some of the restructuring that you mentioned and if there are any other actions you're undertaking to offset some of the negative volume impact? We heard you on some of the additional actions on the Engine segment, but you know is there going to be more on the Drivetrain too, I mean just given your - you need to offset negative volume impact across your firm? Thank you. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : We're exploring a lot of different options and we will give you more detail and color in the Q2 call. I mean in the next quarter call. Operator : Your next question comes from Armintas Sinkevicius with Morgan Stanley. Armintas Sinkevicius : Thank you for taking the question. Just can you remind us how much diesel headwind are you incorporating? Is it the usual sort of 500 bips of headwind and how we should be thinking about diesel beyond this year? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : We are incorporating a 300 basis points to 400 basis points shift between last year and this year down. And two things that I would add. We see a little bit of a decrease in the slowing down rate in the past few months. And also as far as we are concerned, as you know Armintas that by the end of 2020, we will be totally agnostic to that diesel penetration take rate. Armintas Sinkevicius : And then, there is some commentary at the Investor Day around M&A. Just curious to get your thoughts - updated thoughts here, particularly given the environment and the environment has - presents any opportunities. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : Yeah. It has not changed. As I mentioned before, it's all around technology. It's a technology-driven approach. We're focused on M&A, we're focused on building sustained capabilities for complete solutions and technology. Product leadership drives the focus. Armintas Sinkevicius : And then, my last one here. During the quarter, you announced the launch of, I believe it's the iDM. Have you noticed any change in conversations since the official launch? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : No, we are absolutely not seeing any change. We are seeing a strong pull for our iDM products for battery electric vehicle. We are also seeing a strong pull as you've seen in some of the announcements for our air and liquid heaters. And today, most of what we sell is eDM, so it's transmission and mortar. And in focus and in the near future, we felt iDM which is transmission mortar and power electronics. Operator : Your next question comes from Ryan Brinkman with J.P. Morgan. Ryan Brinkman : Thanks for taking my question, which is really just exploring a little bit more around the push out of some of the backlog from 1Q further in the year. You talked earlier in the call about softness in China and Europe and maybe that's created an oversupply of some of the vehicles that were recently launched in 2018. I think there's more publicly available data that we can look at in Europe. But I was just hoping you could shed a little bit of light on the inventory situation in China. Is it concentrated at certain automakers or in certain product segments? And then if environment persists in being softer as you seem to assume with the outlook for 10% lower OBP there this year, is there any risks. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : We are planning for China's run rate to be stable to today's run rate. So we're not we're not planning for a deterioration of the China market. We're planning for a - we're not planning for an improvement as the year advances. We are not thinking also we're not seeing any slowdown in intensity of program development and awards that we see from those key customers that we have in China, which is really encouraging. Ryan Brinkman : That is good to hear. And then I know it's only a small a last question a small minority of your business but I just curious if you could provide us an update on your commercial vehicle business? It seems the trends impact in that market, we're still very strong in the fourth quarter and yet there's sort of some anecdotal signs in the US that there might be some potential slowing. You've got some insight in that market. Just curious what are your thoughts are? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : Yes we benefited in queue far from our - from a strong commercial vehicle market. In our backlog we assumed flat going forward. And again when you think about commercial vehicle and BorgWarner, the North American Class A is small. 12% of our business is what we call commercial vehicle. But it's pretty much a third North America, third Europe, and third China and rest of the world. And we are in off road, and agricultural construction. So don't associate North America Class 8 to BorgWarner commercial vehicle portfolio. Operator : Your next question comes from Chris McNally with Evercore. Chris McNally : Thank you so much Tim. Just two quick ones, I think we've asked a lot about the core markets but just the math on getting to the bottom end of that minus 5% market range, I think you talked about China being flat where it was in December, but should we take that as essentially the market would have to be down on 15% in 2019 and Europe would be down to a couple of percent as well to hit the worst low end of that market range? Thomas McGill : Yes. So if you're talking about the low end of the market range that would put China at minus 12 year-over-year, Europe around minus 5, and in North America around 3 to 4. Chris McNally : Down 3 to 4? Thomas McGill : Correct. Chris McNally : December run rate. Thomas McGill : That is based on average net year run rate, the year-over-year run rate. Chris McNally : But you're coming to those numbers based on essentially if we would a run rate the sort of the worst levels that we saw in Q4 particularly in China and Europe. As you come up with those assumptions. Thomas McGill : Yes. Plus North America weakening just a little bit from that 17.2% SAAR. Chris McNally : And the second part is I really just wanted to hone in on Europe which we saw some of the weakness in the second half but we're sort of following the weakness in consumer confidence and some of the estimates and you know the first half is probably going to be down that minus 5%. The unknown is sort of the second half of the year and we do have more tests particularly on the RDE. Could you talk about from the supplier perspective what you know about Q3 from speaking with the OEMs is you know - is this another situation where we could have a production issue associated with bottlenecks and like we did with WLTP, what sort of visibility are you getting in and how are you preparing for what would be another it should be a less onerous test. But how do you think about that as you prepare for your business? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : Yes. So our assumption is that Europe for the second half will be flat versus the second half of '18. I think our customers have done a great job you know getting lessons learned from the U.S. GDP. But clearly all the years is coming and is not going to be. It's not going to be done with no effort it's going to require a lot of work. Chris McNally : And in terms of specific OEM or variances is there. I mean obviously everyone had their eye on Volkswagen for WLTP. So should we just think about that as the same big guys are going to have the same issues when it comes to RD? I mean we should focus on you know middle of the year seeing how well they execute it. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : I would not. I think you should ask them directly. I wouldn't want to comment specifically for our customers. Operator : Next question comes from David Kelly with Katherine. David Kelly : Thanks for taking my questions. Just a quick follow up on the 80% backlog tied to hybrid and EVs. Are you seeing increased customer bias to go with hybrid and electric drive module solutions? I guess I was just hoping to get a feel for full module versus the component mix within the electrification backlog and maybe potential impact of that higher dollar content on the backlog growth? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : Yes we have a pull for system from a hybrid and electric standpoint, but it's the mix. We also, as I mentioned before, we also very open to support the customer with components and sometimes we do and we are happy to serve them with all the products that we have in this propulsion side of them of the market and of the technology. David Kelly : So you're not seeing a substantial shift in how your customers are approaching components versus modules say versus last year. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : And what, I think it was also mentioned in my prepared remarks in China we see a little bit more interest on modules than in the rest of the world. But it's the mix and we're happy to support them in any different shape or shape or form. David Kelly : And then just a quick housekeeping on FX,. I think you referenced the first quarter your assumption of $1.13. Can you also provide your assumption I guess baked into the full year outlook. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : Yes. It's about the same get $1.13 I think yeah. $1.13 for the full year. Operator : We have time for one final question and that question comes from James Carillo with KeyBanc Capital Markets. James Carillo : So just on your portfolio, you completed the sale of your thermostats business I believe you still have the EGR pipes and tubing business that you intend to sell as well. Any update there to confirm the remaining size of that business. And just a follow on do you have any other businesses within your portfolio that you'd be looking to prune as well. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : Yeah. So with that thermostat business, we entered into an agreement where we were for final signing and everything which should be happening in the next few weeks if all goes according to plan. Your other question on portfolio for some of the other products that's an ongoing process for us. We're looking at that at all times looking at what makes sense for us. And then there's a lot of different factors that go into that where we see the market, where we see our strength and our position in the market. So that's something that's an ongoing discussion with us. James Carillo : Then just regarding your 2023 target you specifically called out in the prepared remarks that revenue and free cash flow is strongly intact. The $14 billion and $1 billion not to read too much into it but do you still regard the low 13% EBIT margin target as intact as well? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : Yes. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : With that, I'd like to thank you all for your questions today. If you have any follow ups, feel free to reach out to me. Sharon you can close the call. Operator : That does conclude the BorgWarner 2018 fourth quarter and full year results conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BorgWarner 2019 First Quarter Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to Patrick Nowlan, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Nowlan, you may begin your conference. Patrick Nolan : Thank you, Sharon. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We issued our earnings release at 6 :30 a.m. Eastern Time, posted on our website, borgwarner.com, both on the homepage and on our Investor Relations homepage. A replay of today's call will be available through May 9. The dial-in number is 855-859-2056, and the conference ID is 6599394 or you can simply listen to the replay on our website. With regard to our investor relations calendar, we will be attending multiple conferences between now and our next earnings release. Please see the Events section of our IR page for a full list. Before we begin, I need to inform you that during this call, we may make forward-looking statements which involves risks and uncertainties as detailed in our 10-K. Our actual results may differ significantly from the matters discussed today. During today's presentation, we will highlight certain non-GAAP measures in order to provide a clearer picture of how the core business performed and for comparison purposes with prior periods. When you hear us say on a comparable basis, that means excluding the impact of FX, net M&A and other noncomparable items. When you hear us say adjusted, that means excluding noncomparable items. And when you hear us say organic, that means excluding the impact of FX and net M&A. We will also refer to our growth compared to our market. When you hear us say market, that means the change in light vehicle production weighted for our geographic exposure. Our outgrowth is defined as our organic revenue change versus the market. Now back to today's call. First, Fred Lissalde, our President and CEO, will comment on the industry. He will then follow this with a high-level overview of our Q1 results, our 2019 outlook and the cost restructuring plan that we announced this morning. Fred will conclude with a discussion of our recent product highlights. Then Tom McGill, our Controller, will discuss the details of our results as well as our guidance. Also with us today is Kevin Nowlan, our recently appointed CFO. Please note that we have posted an earnings call presentation to the IR page of our website. We encourage you to follow along with these slides during our discussion. With that, I'll turn it over to Fred. Frederic Lissalde : Thanks, Pat, and good morning, everyone. We're very pleased to share our results from Q1 2019 today and provide an overall company update. Before we begin, I'd like to welcome Kevin Nowlan to his first earnings call with BorgWarner as our new CFO. Kevin's impressive background speaks for itself. But suffice it to say, his experience will be invaluable as we continue our long legacy of strong financial discipline. He hit the ground running during his first few weeks, and you will be hearing more from him in the coming months. I also like to thank Tom McGill for his excellent financial leadership, and I'm very pleased that he is now our Controller with responsibilities for all our accounting, tax and enterprise risk management operations. Now I'll start by sharing a few thoughts on the industry shown on Slide 5, starting with Q1. The global light vehicle production came down about 5.2%, which is more than 100 basis points better than the midpoint of our expectation going into the quarter. In addition, I'm very proud to say that our outgrowth in Q1 was also stronger than expected, driven by higher volume of new programs, especially in Europe and North America. European light vehicle production was down about 5.5% as customers worked through the final stages of the WLTP certification. China light vehicle production was down mid-teens year-over-year as our customers reacted to lower demand and reduced their inventories. North American light vehicle industry production declined about 2.5% year-over-year.  Now looking to the remainder of 2019. We expect that the challenging conditions in China and Europe will continue for the remainder of the year. Even with these challenging conditions, we expect to be able to deliver on our full year earnings and cash flow guidance. On a full year basis, we continue to expect a market decline in the minus 2% to minus 5% range. At the midpoint of our guide, we're factoring in China down high single digits, Europe down more than 3% and North America down more than 2%. The key is that we expect to continue to outgrow the market in 2019 based on continuous strong demand for our products. Let me now move to Slide 6. First, a brief summary of our Q1 results. Overall, I'm very pleased. Organic growth was above our guidance. And while we fell short of our typical 20% decremental margin, the performance was in line with our Q1 guide. With $2.6 billion in sales, we were down 3.3% organically. This compares to our market being down approximately 5.2%, so our outgrowth was approximately 200 basis points in the quarter, which was ahead of our expectations.  Regionally, our China revenue declined high teens as ramp-up schedules of new programs were impacted by inventory reduction at our customers. Our European light vehicle revenue was down about 1%, outperforming the industry decline. Our North American light vehicle revenue was flattish year-over-year, and our commercial vehicle off-road and aftermarket business was also flat year-over-year. Adjusted earnings per share came at $1, which was ahead of our guidance, driven by revenue outperformance. Now for the full year 2019. Whilst we are encouraged by the stronger Q1 performance, we're maintaining our full year guidance. We continue to expect revenue to be down 2.5% to up 2% organically, and this represents an outgrowth of 250 basis points to 400 basis points over our expected market decline. We continue to expect our adjusted earnings per share to be at $4 to $4.35.  I would also like to briefly touch on our planned margin and R&D cadence for 2019. As Tom will explain later, our guidance for Q2 implies a shortfall compared to our typical decremental margin. In addition to the costs related to tariffs and supply bankruptcies, we're also supporting elevated R&D spending in Q2. This is mostly related to the recently awarded programs.  The prototype spending for this program is a bit lumpy throughout 2019, with some of the largest impacts in Q2. For example, during this quarter, we will experience a $10 million year-over-year impact from prototype spending related to recent complete module awards for P2 hybrids. However, at the high level, our R&D spending expectations for 2019 remain unchanged. We continue to deliver strong outgrowth in 2019, and we must continuously look at ways to adjust our cost structure without compromising our long-term aspiration. The cost restructuring plan that we announced in our press release this morning is consistent with this long-term commitment. We've taken a company-wide view of areas to reduce our current cost structure. Based on our analysis, we believe that we can achieve a $40 million to $50 million annual improvement in our current structural cost over the next 2 years. These cost actions will range from capacity realignment, efficiency improvement in SG&A expenses within our businesses and cost reduction opportunities within our corporate overhead. We expect these actions will result in restructuring expenses in the $80 million to $100 million range through the end of 2020. Our plan is to really deploy these savings into spending to support future growth in hybrid and electric propulsion. Specifically, we expect to use savings to increase our R&D spending as a percentage of sales without negatively impacting our overall operating margins. We continue to see a strong pool for our products from our customers. And we expect the return on this higher spending will not only drive stronger growth, but generate returns in line with our historic levels. Now I'd like to discuss some of our recent product successes, which are on Slide 7. For the second year in a row, BorgWarner has been recognized as an Automotive News PACE Awards winner. This year, we won for our revolutionary dual volute turbocharger for gasoline engines. General Motors is the first OEM to put this innovative technology in its full-size pickups with its 4-cylinder turbocharge engine. This is a great example of technology that will help support our above-market growth in the combustion propulsion. In hybrid, we also announced that a major European commercial vehicle manufacturer has chosen our HVH410 electric motor for plug-in hybrid electric truck to be announced in 2019. I'm also strongly encouraged by our year-to-date wins across multiple hybrid architectures and electric products. Before I turn it over to Tom, let me summarize my opening remarks. Q1 was a strong start of the year, and we feel very confident in our full year outlook. Our cost restructuring plan will help support our future profitable growth while sustaining margin performance. And the year-to-date new business wins that we've achieved across combustion, hybrid and electric vehicle will position us strongly for the future. Now let me turn it over to Tom. Thomas McGill : Thank you, Fred. Good morning, everyone. Before I review the financial details, I would like to provide you some of the highlights as I see them for the quarter. First, our outgrowth was better than expected at 190 basis points. This, combined with a more modest decline in industry volume, allowed us to deliver a stronger top line sales performance. Second, decremental margin performance was below our long-term targets, but the shortfall was in line with our expectations going into the quarter. As a result, the stronger sales from the quarter flowed through in line with our long-term incremental margin expectations. And finally, we are maintaining our guidance for the year, but feel increasingly confident in our earnings and free cash flow outlook for the full year. Let's turn to Slide 9. On a comparable basis, our organic sales were down 3.3% year-over-year. This is solid performance compared to market, which was down approximately 5.2% year-over-year. We saw a high-teens decline in China against a production market that was down mid-teens. Europe revenue was down 1% compared to the 5.5% industry production decline in the quarter. North America revenue was flat versus the 2.5% production decline in the quarter, and our commercial vehicle and aftermarket business was flat year-over-year. So now let's look at the year-over-year comparison for adjusted operating income, which can be found on Slide 10. The Q1 adjusted operating income was $295 million compared to $339 million in Q1 of '18. Our adjusted operating margin of 11.5% was down versus 12.2% last year. On a comparable basis, adjusted operating income was down $29 million or $91 million of lower sales. This gives us the decremental margin of 32% in the quarter, which is worse than our long-term decremental margin target of 20%. This $11 million shortfall compared to a 20% decremental margin can be explained by tariff-related costs, supplier bankruptcy costs in Europe and timing of costs related to a new business launch later in 2019. Our earnings per share on a reported basis were $0.77 per diluted share. On an adjusted basis, net earnings were $1 per diluted share.  Now let's take a closer look at our operating segments in the quarter beginning on Slide 11 of the deck. The reported Engine segment net sales were $1.6 billion in the quarter. On a comparable basis, sales for the Engine segment declined 1.8% as growth in North America was offset by lower Europe and China volumes. Adjusted EBIT was $241 million for the Engine segment or 15.1% of sales. On a comparable basis, the Engine segment's adjusted EBIT was down $28 million on $31 million of lower sales. This week, decremental margin performance was driven by the decline in sales and costs related to supplier bankruptcies. So turning to Slide 12, the Drivetrain segment net sales were $982 million in the quarter. On a comparable basis, sales for the Drivetrain segment declined 5.6% year-over-year, primarily due to lower volumes on European customers with higher-than-average Drivetrain content and on low volumes of recently launched new programs in China. Adjusted EBIT was $105 million for the Drivetrain segment or 10.7% of sales. On a comparable basis, the Drivetrain segment's adjusted EBIT was down $12 million on $61 million of lower sales for a decremental margin of 20%. So now I'd like to discuss our 2019 full year guidance, which is unchanged. So turning to the sales growth guidance for the full year on Slide 14, our guidance is based on market assumption of down 2% to down 5%. We expect an organic revenue change of down negative 2.5% to positive 2.0% or 250 to 400 basis points of outgrowth over the market. Total revenue is expected to be in the range of $9.9 billion to $10.37 billion.  Our adjusted operating income walk is on Slide 15. Our consolidated adjusted operating income margin is expected to be flat to down in 2019, and this margin performance is due to the decline in sales year-over-year, combined with costs related to tariffs, supplier bankruptcy costs in Europe and changes to launch timing throughout 2019. To finish up our full year guidance, please turn to Slide 16. Our adjusted EPS guidance range is unchanged at $4 to $4.35 per diluted share. We continue to target free cash flow of $550 million to $600 million. And our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 26%. Our second quarter guidance is on Slide 18. So first, sales. We expect organic sales to be in the range of down 2.5%to flat year-over-year. This would represent an outgrowth of 350 to 400 basis points versus our market forecast of down 4% to 6%. The sequential improvement in our outgrowth is expected to be driven by recovery in volumes of new programs in China and newly launched programs in North America. Adjusted EPS for Q2 is expected to be in the range of $0.99 to $1.05 per diluted share, and our Q2 guidance is based on a 26% effective tax rate and incorporates $100 million of FX revenue headwind year-over-year. As Fred indicated earlier, our guidance for Q2 implies roughly a $20 million operating income shortfall compared to our typical incremental and decremental margin performance. And as with the case in Q1, the Q2 results will be impacted by tariffs and supplier bankruptcy costs. And in addition, higher R&D spending will impact our year-over-year margin performance in the quarter. But most of this impact was timing-related, and the largest impact is related to recently awarded programs. The prototype spending for these programs is a bit lumpy throughout 2019 with some of the largest impacts in Q2. On a full year basis, we still feel comfortable that the R&D will be in the low 4% range, but timing of spending will vary from quarter-to-quarter. Specifically, we expect our Q4 R&D spending to be $10 million to $20 million less than the Q2 levels. So in conclusion, let me summarize Q1 and our outlook. Overall, execution was solid in light of the challenging industry volume. Organic sales decline of 3.3% was better than our expectations. Decremental margin performance in the quarter was in line with our expectations. And as we look into the remainder of 2019, we remain confident in the reacceleration of our outgrowth and our ability to achieve both our earnings and cash flow guidance. With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Pat. Patrick Nolan : Thank you, Tom. Sharon, we're ready to open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And your first question comes from John Murphy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. John Murphy : Just wanted to ask a first question on your sort of the step-up in R&D versus the restructuring actions. I'm just curious, I mean, as you're thinking about this, are the restructuring actions being taken because there's some potential underperformance that you're seeing in things that need to be fixed or is the direct motivation to fund a step-up- in R&D going forward, and it really will be almost a 1-for-1 offset? Just trying to understand what's going on there between the two. Frederic Lissalde : I think it's both, John. We asked to adjust our cost structure to the latest industry evolutions, and we then are going to focus on our growth and also make sure that our operating margin evolutions are in line with what we've announced and what we committed to. So it's both, John. It's absolutely both. So we're taking a company-wide view to reduce the cost structure. And at the end of the day, the pool is there from our customers, and we see growth potential that require R&D. I think those two things have to be done, and we're doing it. We're executing it, and we'll execute it. And that's going to be good for profitable growth for the company. John Murphy : So should we think about the $40 million or $50 million of ongoing cost saves would be directly offset by a step-up in R&D that should drive sales, which should keep R&D as a percentage of sales roughly in the low 4% range? Is that a sort of a logic that's correct? Or am I missing something? Frederic Lissalde : No, your logic is correct. The R&D would be up a little more than that, and that would be topping 2020, 2021. Don't consider that the R&D that is currently at 4.1% of sales in 2019 is going to change. And also the margin profile expectations are going to be unchanged. John Murphy : Okay. And then if I could just sneak in a follow-up. Just on this Slide 10, Fred, and maybe for you, Tom, as well. I mean, as you're going through the tariffs impact, the supplier bankruptcy and the new launches as headwinds to your decremental margins or sort of losses to decremental margins, are those relatively equal? Or how should we think about the three of those as we go through the course of '19 and potentially into 2020? Frederic Lissalde : Are you talking about full year? John Murphy : Well, I mean, in the quarter, but then, also, it sounds like they're going to persist a little bit in the second quarter. So I just want to understand what are the sort of the buckets of those? Were they equally split in the first quarter? And is that the same allocation we should think about going forward? Or is there something changing going forward? Thomas McGill : Yes. So with the tariffs, we've talked about that being up to maybe $10 million a quarter, and that will continue through Q2. And then come Q3, that year-over-year comparison, the tariffs will be in both. So again, a little bit in Q2, but by Q3, the year-over-year will even out. For the supplier bankruptcies, yes, that will continue in Q3 and probably through the year, but we'll see that coming down in Q3 and Q4, especially on a comparable basis. Frederic Lissalde : And for R&D in Q2, John, it's about $10 million, and it's timing. Operator : Your next question comes from Rod Lache with Wolfe Research. Rod Lache : A couple of things. To make the full year number, it implies that the second-half margins are in the 12.5% range after the mid-11s in the first half. And it sounds like part of this is moderation of R&D, and part of it is the supplier bankruptcies. And I presume that you're also anticipating easier comps in European production, but I was hoping you might be able to just elaborate a little bit more on each of these components and how we should be thinking about that because it's pretty unusual to see BorgWarner have stronger back-half margins versus first half. Frederic Lissalde : So one is related to R&D timing. We have Q4 R&D, which is $10 million to $20 million lower than Q2. And also you have a stronger growth in the second half of the year which is linked to stronger backlog and demand of our products for Europe and North America, but also in the second half of the year, and we see that starting in Q2 in China. Rod Lache : What's the bankruptcy part of this? And what are you assuming for European production in the back half? Frederic Lissalde : So our midpoint to European production is estimated at a little bit less than -- let's say, down more than 3%. And to give you an idea, on the supplier side, we consider that the bankruptcy costs and everything that we have to go through is about $5 million a quarter. Rod Lache : Okay, okay. And then secondly, I know that you're... Frederic Lissalde : Which is the supplier bankruptcies started last year. So there's $5 million of growth that we'll start lapping in the second half. Rod Lache : Okay, got you. Secondly, I know your backlog is bigger, I mean, your business backlog is bigger in 2020 versus 2019, but I don't think that either of those backlog numbers incorporate any changes in mix in Europe. And the reason I'm asking is, obviously, a lot needs to happen for European OEMs to go from 120 grams of CO2 per kilometer down to 95 over the next year or so. So do you -- just setting aside the macro issues and thinking about your business in Europe, do you see an additional net positive from mix coming in here as some OEMs eliminate some of the lower-performing models from a CO2 perspective? Just generally, what are you hearing from your customers as you look out to the next year or so as far as their plans for CO2 compliance? Frederic Lissalde : So you're right. But again, when you look at our European backlog, you need to factor back about 10% of our overall backlog linked to the diesel mix. And the other thing that you're going to see longer term is that I think you're going to see a very, very positive push for hybrid propulsion architecture post 2020. This is also one of the reasons why you've got an acceleration of the backlog in 2020 linked to those new launches. Rod Lache : But do you see, just from a mix perspective -- forgetting about backlog, do you see a shift towards more a kind of higher BorgWarner content of vehicles in 2020 versus what you're just seeing right now simply because these automakers need to shift to their -- to better CO2 compliance? Frederic Lissalde : In the short term not in a meaningful way. Operator : Next question comes from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Noah Kaye : So can you talk more about the factors that led you to conclude that higher investment in hybrid and EV products were necessary? Does this contemplate a faster mix shift towards electrification than you saw previously? If so, why? Frederic Lissalde : Because the customers are in high demand and because we're winning. Noah Kaye : Can you expand on that a little bit? Frederic Lissalde : Well, yes. I mean, we have technologies from a hybrid perspective that are being pulled by our customers in different architecture, in different regions of the world, especially in China and in Europe. At this point in time, we're winning advanced hybrids in Europe. And we'll just ask -- we're focusing on the long-term profitable growth. The returns are going to be good, and we need to deliver. Noah Kaye : Okay. Yes. So if I understand that, then this is really R&D supporting an elevated number of launches than maybe we've previously thought? This is not core R&D or some sort of gaps you saw in the portfolio? Am I understanding that right? Frederic Lissalde : You're right. It's essentially more at new business development application type R&D than, how would you call that, advanced R&D. Operator : Your next question comes from David Tamberrino with Goldman Sachs. Mariel Kennedy : This is Mariel Kennedy on for David Tamberrino. Just our first question, looking toward your second quarter guidance, what are your regional production assumptions for the industry? Frederic Lissalde : So for Q2 regional production for the industry is pretty much North America, slightly down; Europe, down more than 5%; China, down double-digit. And overall, on the global, both on a weighted average, we're pretty much down around 5%. Mariel Kennedy : Okay. And then just looking at commercial vehicle, it looks like that was just kind of flat in the quarter, where you've been seeing it positive in the past. What sort of expectations do you have for that going forward? Frederic Lissalde : So when you look at commercial vehicle, our business in commercial vehicle represents about 12% of our revenue. And it's very, very -- we have about 1/3 of that revenue in the U.S., 1/3 in Europe and 1/3 in China and Brazil, China being 2/3 of that last 1/3. And we have 60% of our business which is on-road and 40% off-road construction agriculturals. So this business is very, very wide and very spread. And our hypothesis is going into forecasting and is that we are considering it by default flat because of that complexity. So don't attach a Class 8 North America market or industry volume to us. We're way more complex than this. Mariel Kennedy : Okay. Then just one last question, if I could get it in there. As we're looking, and you have more backlog in hybrids and EVs, are you starting to see any sort of material customer mix shift, especially in China? Or is it still kind of the same as you've seen in the past? Frederic Lissalde : We don't see a meaningful customer mix change. Operator : Your next question comes from Chris McNally with Evercore ISI. Christopher McNally : If I could just follow up to, I think, just one of the questions that have been asked before, particularly Rod's question, around Europe. I mean, if we think about the next two years, where you're talking about sort of an increase in R&D specific for new launches in Europe, can you just give a little bit more color on the type of vehicles that you're getting, maybe increased requests for or maybe volume requests are going up, so that European OEMs can meet the O2, which starts essentially in 2020? Is there still P2 PHEV 48-volt? But are you also seeing some EV programs pull forward for you specifically in Europe? Frederic Lissalde : Okay. Chris, until 2020, 100% of the business is booked. And the stuff that we're booking right now is past backlog period. It's 2021, 2022. And yes, it's going to be around advanced hybrid. Most of those programs are going to be advanced hybrid, 48-volts and higher voltages, a variety of products. Christopher McNally : Okay. So is it fair to say that we're not actually seeing volume change? I think there's a view out there that essentially, some of the volumes on some of these programs that need to be increased, the OEMs are going to push them to avoid fines because of a greater-than-expected shortfall that they've seen in, for example, diesel. Frederic Lissalde : And here you're asking within the next two years, right? Shorter term, right? Christopher McNally : Yes, exactly. Frederic Lissalde : Well, shorter term, we can react. If we have the program, we can react. And if they want more volume, we'll react, and we can react pretty fast. The impact of the additional R&D is certainly past 2020.. And, yes, that's what I was saying. Christopher McNally : Okay, that's perfectly clear. If I could just ask one more on a more near-term basis. As we think about the second, where even, I think, in your assumptions, if Europe is down roughly 5%, 6% in the first half and you have it down 3%, we have a recovery essentially in the second half to get there. And some of that's the easier comps. Can you talk a little bit about RDE in Q3? I think most of the industry was hit with the surprise of WLTP. We're hearing that people are more prepared. Is there any comments that you can get on when schedules for the summer may be more firmed up with respect to the next level of testing in Europe? Frederic Lissalde : Chris, the way we see it is it that in Europe, for the second half of the year, the market's going to be pretty flat year-over-year. And our hypothesis is that, yes, you're going to -- our customers are going to go through RDE as they went through WLTP last year. And that's our assumption going into the second half of the year. Operator : Your next question comes from Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets. Joseph Spak : Sorry if I missed this, but just you initially guided the backlog to be effectively 0, and it ended up being about 3.7% to growth. What change that sort of maybe came in that you didn't expect? And how should we think about that as it trends into the second quarter? Frederic Lissalde : Yes. So in Q1, we guided with no outgrowth to market, and we are effectively outgrowing the market by about 200 basis points. Two major drivers : one is Europe Engine business slightly better; North America, also slightly better. And China was in line, which means no outgrowth. Joseph Spak : But I thought the commentary previously was that because of sort of the market outlook, some of the launches were maybe going to be delayed. And it seems like maybe some of those launches did come in. So can you maybe sort of, maybe if not customer-specific, like did stuff launch in China that you didn't originally expected? Or where did they come in from? Frederic Lissalde : So in China, things did not bounce. In China, we were, as I said, in line with our expectations going into Q1. Europe was the driver. Joseph Spak : Europe? Okay. On -- just maybe to sort of talk about the R&D spending and sort of the electrification program going forward a little bit differently. I think in your backlog, you have 70% allocated towards hybrid. I was wondering if is it possible to sort of disaggregate that 70% to -- from the -- maybe from like the ICE side of the hybrid versus the electric side? And how does that sort of change with the sort of R&D talk beyond this sort of backlog period as it sort of gets to more advanced hybrids? Frederic Lissalde : We really look at hybrid as an addressable content. And we have, from a hybrid perspective, we have our P2 hybrids. We have P1. We have P3. We have motors. We have -- and past the backlog, we will have power and electric. So it's very difficult to put a number on the combustion side of hybrid or the electric part of hybrid. What is true and what's driving growth, and that's why electrification is great for this company, is that the more advanced hybrid you get, the higher content of vehicle you're going to get from BorgWarner. And that's why electrification accelerates our growth. Joseph Spak : Okay. And just, I guess, lastly, with the structural costs you're taking out, did you mention specifically what it is? Like are you shuttering capacity for some specific types of products? Or what exactly are you restructuring? Frederic Lissalde : So as I said, it's a company-wide view, but the largest share is going to be into the engine side. That's where we have to pick, as you saw some of the too heavy decremental. Corporate also will contribute. So we look at it from a holistic approach in order to get that done. Operator : Next question comes from Colin Langan with UBS. Colin Langan : Any color -- I mean, the numbers came in better than your guidance for Q1. Any thoughts on why not just tweak up the full year guidance? Or it's just too early in the year out there? Or has something gotten worse than the full year outlook? Frederic Lissalde : I think it's just too early in the year. The volatility in the market is still here in pretty much all the regions. And I think it's just -- we think it's just too early. Colin Langan : And I apologize if I missed this. The decrementals were pretty large, particularly in Engine. What were the big issues year-over-year on the quarter? Thomas McGill : Yes. So this is Tom. So in Engine, well, we have tariffs that impacted both Engine and Drivetrain. In Engine, the supplier bankruptcies in Europe that we talked about were primarily in the Engine Group. And then it was just kind of the launch timing and then the lower volumes that also contributed. Colin Langan : Got it. And when we're thinking about diesel, I mean, how was that trending? And what are your expectations for this year? Frederic Lissalde : So the assumption on diesel is that for this year, we assume a 300 basis point shift from last year. And what we also see is that there might be a little bit of a reduction in decreases quarter-over-quarter, 300 basis points down from prior year. Operator : The next question comes from James Picariello with KeyBanc Capital Markets. James Picariello : So just on electrification programs in China, hearing farther up the supply chain as it relates to cash flow materials that China EV programs are getting pushed by as much as like 12 to 18 months. We're also seeing cobalt prices come down. So I'm just curious what you're seeing in the China market as it kind of relates to this commentary from another supplier of the supply chain? Frederic Lissalde : No, that's -- we see no changes at all from our allowance cadence on that electric vehicle propulsion in China. The EV pool is still very strong. James Picariello : Okay. And just on the timing of the restructuring plan, the $40 million to $50 million in savings by 2021, is that sort of a 50-50 split over next year in '21? Or is it weighted to the -- to later half there? How should we think about that? Frederic Lissalde : The timing's still being worked out, but it's going to be over the 2 years. We're still working it out, but all of those actions for those savings will be in place by the end of 2020. James Picariello : Got it. And just last one on buybacks. You have the $100 million target for the full year, $70 million deployed in the first quarter. Just wondering if there's still maybe some upside to that or maybe the prototype spending and the restructuring actions consumed cash that otherwise would have been deployed? Thomas McGill : Right. So I kind of just have the same answer there. We have the $100 million guidance, but we do potentially look at opportunistically buying back more depending on other uses of cash like for potential acquisitions and other things. So some we continue to look at and we'll be opportunistic with. Operator : We have time for one final question, and that question comes from David Kelley with Jefferies. David Kelley : And just a couple of quick ones. I think, clearly, the China production weakness was well broadcast, but we've been hearing from others that the market appears to be at least stabilizing. Just can you speak to if there's any change from your vantage point in either customer sentiment around potential volume improvement on the horizon or if there's any change in maybe the potential outgrowth you're seeing for the pipeline in your market? Frederic Lissalde : So the market is stabilizing from the current run rate. Now what we see is the next generation of new programs -- next generation of our new programs in China. And we see schedules for those new programs starting -- accelerating, starting in Q2. But from a market standpoint, we're not thinking that the market is going to recover. David Kelley : Okay, great. And just a quick housekeeping, could you update us on your implied tariff headwind? I guess, is that still $20 million? I think if I recall, you weren't building in a step-up in those three costs there. So I just wanted to follow up. Thomas McGill : Yes. So for that, it's still at that $20 million. There's very little impact for us with those three. But again, $20 million, $10 million in the quarter in Q1 and 2. And by Q3 and four, that will be in both years. Patrick Nolan : With that, I'd like to thank you all for your good questions today. If you have any follow-ups, feel free to reach out to me afterwards. Thank you. Frederic Lissalde : Thank you all.

Mr. Nowlan, you may begin your conference. Patrick Nowlan : Thank you, Sharon. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We issued our earnings release at 6 :30 AM Eastern Time. It's posted on our Web site, borgwarner.com, on our homepage and on our Investor Relations homepage. A replay of today's call will be available through August 8th. The dial-in number for that call is 855-859-2056, and the conference ID is 9052479 or you can simply listen to the replay on the Web site. With regard to our Investor Relations calendar, we will be attending multiple conferences between now and our next earnings release. Please see the Events section of our Investors Relations homepage for a full list. Before we begin, I need to inform you that during this call, we may make forward-looking statements, which involves risks and uncertainties as detailed in our 10-K. Our actual results may differ significantly from the matters discussed today. During today's presentation, we will highlight certain non-GAAP measures in order to provide a clearer picture of how the core business performs and for comparison purposes of prior periods. When you hear us say on a comparable basis, that means excluding the impact of FX and net M&A. When you hear us say adjusted, that means excluding non-comparable items. And when you hear us say organic, that means excluding the impact of FX and net M&A. We will also refer to our growth compared to our market. When you hear us say market, that means the change in light vehicle production weighted for our geographic exposure. Our outgrowth is defined as our organic revenue change versus the market. Now back to today's call. First, Fred Lissalde, our President and CEO, will comment on our Q1 results and our 2019 outlook. This will be followed by a high-level overview of our joint venture agreement with Romeo Power. Fred will conclude with a discussion of our recent product highlights. Then Kevin Nowlan, our CFO will discuss the industry outlook, as well as details of our results and guidance. Please note that we have posted an earnings call presentation to the IR page of our Web site. We encourage you to follow along with these slides during our discussion. With that, I'll turn it over to Fred. Fred Lissalde : Thanks, Pat, and good morning, everyone. We're very pleased to share our results from Q2 2019 today and provide an overall company update. Let me start with the highlights of the quarter on Slide 5. I am pleased with the sequential improvements in our outlook. With more than $2.5 billion in sales, we were down about 0.3% organically. This compares to our market being down 5.7%. So, our outgrowth was approximately 540 basis points in the quarter, which was ahead of our expectations. Regionally, we saw outgrowth in all major regions. Our European light vehicle revenue was up 2%, outperforming the industry decline by more than 9%. Our North American light vehicle revenue was at up 4% year-over-year with 600 basis points of outgrowth. Our China revenue declined about 10% versus industry production decline of 16%. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $1 with our operating income performance at the midpoint of our guidance. And higher than expected tax rates was a $0.02 headwind. I'm also pleased with our stronger year-to-date cash performance that Kevin will discuss in detail. As we focus on near term execution in this challenging market, we also, at the same time maintaining an equal focus on investing in the long-term. In the second quarter, we closed on our Romeo Power investment, which positions us to be a leading player in battery management, and I'll speak about this in a couple of slides. We also continue to deliver new wins in hybrid and electric, which is positioning us to deliver continued revenue outgrowth. Overall, Q2 was a solid result compared to an industry backdrop, which continued to weaken throughout the quarter. Now, I would like to address our full year 2019 guidance, which is on Slide 6. While we were encouraged by the better than expected outgrowth in the first half, we expect our full year revenue to be in the bottom half of our prior revenue range. We expect revenue to be down 2.5% to flat organically. This is based on an industry assumption of down 3.5% to down 5% with the high end being 150 basis points lower than our prior assumption. We expect our outgrowth to be in the 250 basis points to 350 basis points range for the full year. We expect our adjusted earnings per share to be between $3.75 to $4. This guidance reflects our updated revenue outgrowth outlook, and additional margin pressure for the continuing production volatility and weaker cost performance from our supply basis. To be clear, we're not satisfied with our margin performance in the full year '19. Margin performance has historically being one of our strengths, and we are focused on maintaining that discipline. In order to meet our long-term margin and cash generation objectives, we are taking more aggressive steps to adapt our cost structure to the challenges facing our business. This will include more steps to manage our near term cost and more aggressive restructuring measures than the ones we have previously announced. While we will continue to manage the current volume environment and cost pressures, we will continue to secure our future growth through new business awards supplemented with M&A investments. Consistent with this, during this quarter, we announced our plans to enter into a joint venture with Romeo Power who we view as a technology leading battery module and pack supplier. It's a good fit between the two companies. Romeo Power has excellent technologies and we provide the customer reach and comfort level, as well as the capability to reply and produce at scale and globally. BorgWarner will own 60% interest in the joint venture. It will also complement our existing portfolio and expand our system expertise for electric propulsion. Finally, we believe this joint venture can fill the gaps in the marketplace between and hybrid and electric vehicle makers. Next, I will point you to Slide 8, which illustrates our competitive advantage in EVs. The products in blue are products that we now have capabilities to produce in-house. This is what positions us strongly for future growth. We are one of the few with products covering energy management from grid to wheel. Upstream of the battery, we have onboard charges, and we are active in the stationery charging business as well. Downstream of the battery, we supply motors, transmission and power electronics. We can supply these components individually or as an integrated module. We complement our proportion offering with cabin and battery heating technologies, for which we also see a strong market pull. And now with our battery pack JV, we can supply the battery packs and thermal management systems as well. We can develop, specify and manufacture all the major components of a battery electric vehicle propulsion system. Our product breadth is really our advantage. Now, I would like to discuss some of our product successes, which are on Slide 9. We continue to innovate in combustion proportion. This quarter, we announced that our innovative regulated two stage turbocharging system will be used on BMW Group's latest two liter twin-power engine. Innovation is still occurring in combustion propulsion. And our technologies are helping automakers comply with increasingly stringent regulations worldwide. I am strongly encouraged by our year-to-date wins across multiple hybrid architectures and products for electric vehicle. We have booked hybrid and electric business in Europe, Asia and North America. While we cannot share all of the customers or program specific details at this time, we have received awards across multiple hybrid platforms, including P1, P2, and P3. One example is a high volume P3 hybrid system for a major European OEM. For this system, we're supply a motor generator unit, which power electronics and software, gear set and disconnect controls. In EVs, our cabin heaters are also continuing to win new business. Importantly, we expect to see additional wins across hybrid and electric in the second half of 2019, and I am very pleased with this. So let me summarize by opening remarks this morning. Q2 saw a recovery in our growth as expected, but we expect a challenging second half. We will take the necessary actions to adjust our costs to the current environment, and we are encouraged by our year-to-date wins in the three regions of the world across multiple hybrid and electric vehicle architectures. This positions us strongly for the future. Now, let me turn it over to Kevin. Kevin Nowlan : Thank you, Fred and good morning everyone. Before I review the financials in detail, I'd like to provide you a quick overview of the two key drivers of our second quarter results. First, our revenue outgrowth was ahead of our expectations at 540 basis points in the quarter. This was driven primarily by higher volumes and new programs, especially in Europe and North America. We also benefited from some amount of pull forward of launch volume from Q3. And we remain on track for full year revenue outgrowth of 250 to 350 basis points. Second, cost pressures continued to be a headwind during the quarter, which drove all inbound site conversion of 27% and prevented us from hitting the upper end of our adjusted EPS guidance range. Nonetheless, we still achieved performance within our Q2 guide, but we're disappointed that we didn't deliver a stronger result. Let's turn to Slide 11 where you can see our perspective on industry production. Let me start with Q2. Global light vehicle production came in about 5.7% lower on a year-over-year basis, which was slightly worse than the midpoint of our expectations going into the quarter. Within that global result, we saw European production down about 7% against the fairly tough comparison from last year. China production was down 16% as that market continues to remain under pressure. And North America declined by about 2%. As we look ahead to the remainder of 2019, we expect that the challenging industry conditions will continue. On a full year basis, we now expect the market decline to be in the minus 3.5% to minus 5% range. The stronger end of this outlook is 150 basis points lower than our prior expectation. Also as part of outlook, we're now planning for China to be down anywhere from 10% to 14% on a full year basis, while Europe is likely to be down 3% to 4.5%, and North America down to the 3%. This new market outlook means we have become even more cautious on China, and slightly less negative on Europe. Let's turn to Slide 12. Even with the global market down 5.7% in our second quarter, on a comparable basis, our organic sales were down only 0.3% year-over-year. This is the 540 basis points of market outgrowth I referred to earlier. And importantly, this outgrowth occurred in all of the major light vehicle markets around the globe. In Europe, our revenue was up 2% compared to the 7% industry production decline in the quarter. In North America, revenue was up 4% versus the 2% industry decline in the quarter. And finally, we did see a 10% decline in our China revenue, but the overall Chinese market was down more than 16% year-over-year. Underperformance in Korea reduced our global output by a 100 basis points, and our commercial vehicle off-highway and aftermarket businesses were down about 1% year-over-year. Overall, we're pleased that we continued to deliver revenue outgrowth even in this challenging end market environment. Now, let's look at our adjusted operating income performance, which can be found on Slide 13. Q2 adjusted operating income was $303 million compared to $341 million in the second quarter of 2018. Our adjusted operating margin was 11.9%, down from 12.7% last year. On a comparable basis, adjusted operating income dropped $23 million on $7 million of lower sales. The $22 million shortfall compared to our long term 20% decrimental margins can be explained primarily by our supply chain cost reductions falling short of our target due impart to the year-over-year impact of tariffs and some of insolvency issues in Europe. In addition, we incurred costs in the quarter related to new business launches scheduled for later in the year. Adjusted earnings per share was $1 for the quarter, slightly below the midpoint of our second quarter guidance. Even though the result was within our EPS guidance range, we are disappointed in this result as we anticipated managing the decrimental margin better. And delivering bottom line remains closer to the top end of our guidance. In addition, our effective tax rate came in a couple percentage points higher than planned, which reduced adjusted EPS $0.02 in the quarter. We are proud of the fact that we delivered a strong cash flow result for the quarter. In the second quarter, we generated $300 million of free cash flow, significantly stronger than the $161 million we delivered in the same quarter a year ago. As you know, cash flow has become an important focus of the company over the last couple of years as we drive toward generating $1 billion in annual free cash flow starting in 2023. Now, let's take a closer look at our operating segments on Slide 14. Engine segment sales were $1.569 billion in the quarter. On a comparable basis, sales for the engine segment declined only 0.4%, or $7 million despite lower industry wide production. Growth in North America and Europe for our engine business offset by the impact of the weaker China end market. Adjusted EBIT was $249 million for the engine segment or 15.9% of sales. On a comparable basis, the engine segment's adjusted EBIT was down $19 million on $7 million of lower sales. This weak decremental margin performance was driven primarily by the decline in sales and by supply chain cost performance not offsetting normal decreases in customer pricing. This is impart due to the costs arising from the year-over-year impact of tariffs and costs related to supplier bankruptcies. Drivetrain segment sales were $998 million in the quarter. On a comparable basis, sales for the Drivetrain segment increased 0.2% year-over-year. Also, meaningfully outperforming the market as growth in North America offset revenue declines in Europe. Adjusted EBITDA was $102 million for Drivetrain or 10.2% of sales. On a comparable basis, the Drivetrain segment's adjusted EBIT was down $10 million on $2 million of higher sales. The decline was driven by higher R&D spending and launch related costs, primarily in China. Now I'd like to discuss our full year and third quarter 2019 guidance, which is on Slide 15. Our guidance is based on the end market assumptions I discussed earlier with global production down 3.5% to 5%. Despite that, we expect organic revenue to be in the range of down only 2.5% to roughly flat. That's because we continue to expect to drive significant market outgrowth of 250 basis points to 350 basis points for the full year. We're ahead of that march through the first six months, but we do expect lower outgrowth in the third quarter as a result of the impact of lower launch volumes in China and negative mix in Europe. With these organic growth assumptions, we now expect total revenue to be in the range of $9.94 billion to $10.18 billion. That means we reduced the top end of our revenue outlook by 200 basis points. Three quarters of this reduction is the result of the lowering the high end of our market production assumptions, while the balance is driven by the lower backlog that we now expect as a result of those end markets now being lower than before in that high end scenario. This lower backlog translates to a decline of a little more than $50 million in revenue from our prior guidance. Our adjusted operating income margin is now expected to be 11.4% to 11.8% versus 12.3% in 2018. The 40 basis point to 50 basis point decline in our margin outlook relative to our prior guidance reflects weaker cost absorption to continue production volatility and lower than expected revenue in the second half of 2019, weaker supply chain performance stemming in large part from the continued financial challenges in the supply base and weaker year-to-date margin performance than we were expecting. Full year adjusted EPS is expected to be in the range of $3.75 to $4 per diluted share. The decline in the bottom end of the range primarily reflects the weaker margin outlook. In addition, our run rate effective tax rate is now expected to be around 27% for the full year versus our prior guidance of 26%. That has an impact of almost $0.06 on our adjusted EPS guidance range. And finally, we are now targeting free cash flow of $525 million to $575 million, which is down $25 million from our prior guidance. Lower earnings are being partially offset by a reduction in working capital. That's our full year outlook. Now let's touch on the third quarter outlook starting with sales. We expect organic sales to be in the range of down 1.5% to up 1.5%, which would yield sales of $2.4 billion to $2.5 billion. These expected third quarter organic growth rates are roughly in line with our market forecast, which implies little to no market outgrowth in the third quarter. That's being driven by lower overall volumes on new programs in China and negative mix in Europe. Importantly, however, we expect this lack of outgrowth to be a one quarter phenomenon as we see the fourth quarter likely to return to our more recent levels of outgrowth. And that keeps us on track for the full year outgrowth of $250 basis points to 350 basis points that we've highlighted. Adjusted EPS is expected to be in the range of $0.83 to $0.90 per diluted share in the third quarter. On a year-over-year basis, earnings are expected to be negatively impacted by continued challenges with supply chain cost performance, inefficiencies related to lower launch volumes than planned and higher R&D costs as we continue to invest in electrification related programs within our Drivetrain segment. Let me wrap up by summarizing how I think about the second quarter results. We were able to deliver 11.9% adjusted operating margin, a $1 of adjusted EPS, which was within our guidance range and $300 million of free cash flow while also driving more than 500 basis points of market outgrowth. And we did all of that in a very challenging end market. But from a financial performance perspective, we're not satisfied. Our decrementals have been higher than we expected in organization. We will take the necessary actions to get our decrementals back to target, because we fully intend to maintain our company's historically strong margin profile. And in addition, we remain committed to executing against our long range plans in delivering on our long range financial objectives around revenue outgrowth, margin performance and free cash flow generation, even while we manage through a very difficult near term market environment that we expect to continue for the remainder of 2019 and likely into 2020. With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Pat. Patrick Nowlan : Thank you, Kevin. Sharon, we're ready to open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] and your first question comes from Emmanuel Rosner of Deutsche Bank. Emmanuel Rosner : So first question is around your full year guidance, or assumptions on the revenues that you really just trimming the high end, but obviously, a fairly large cut through the margin outlook. Can you just go back over why does this modest decrease in the revenue guidance resulted in such a large negative impact on the guided margins? And in particular, I will be interested in any more detail you can provide on some of these comments around supply bankruptcies that you made during the quarter, maybe any quantification? Fred Lissalde : Emanuel, let me start with the market. So we see the full year market down 2.5% to down 5%, which is a change from the down 2% to 5% that had back two quarters ago. Now, it's not the same minus 5%. China is down more and Europe we're a little bit more confident that the prior guide from a market perspective. So we want to share realistic outlook, especially in China and in Europe. From a margin perspective, the first and foremost impact versus our prior guide is coming from our supply base. And Kevin will give you more detail I guess in future questions. But overall this is what's happening in markets and in margins. Kevin Inda : And maybe I'll follow up on that. I mean overall if you think about the 25% drop, I want to just speak to that in the low end of guidance in particular. The $0.05 of that really relates to the tax rate change going up 1 percentage point. So if I put that aside, I'd say the other $0.20 is really coming from operational performance not hitting our objectives. And there's really three items that are driving that. The first as I say, our second quarter came in weaker than we were anticipating. We expected to deliver at the top end of our guidance, and we missed that top end by about $10 million on a pretax basis. The second thing I would say is that with the volatility in the global markets and some of the markets coming down more quickly, just as Fred spoke to, we're seeing decrementals coming in closer to 30% right now than the 20% that we target overtime. And then the final thing with what you touched on, the supply cost performance coming in worse than anticipated. And that's due to the continuing impact of some of the insolvencies that we're seeing and frankly just the general macro environment making it more challenging to achieve cost reductions in the supply base. Those are the three items that are causing us to take the guide down. Emmanuel Rosner : Just a quick thought on this, and then I have a separate second question. But can give more detail on those insolvencies? Obviously, it seems to be something that you're speaking about more now than before, the second quarter margins were okay. Obviously, the second half is much weaker than we expected. And any level of quantification you can give around what is this used to being for the full year in terms of incremental costs from that? A - Fred Lissalde : Emmanuel, we don't see more impact from bankruptcies. We're managing it. We've been managing it and we've been managing it -- we will managing it. As Kevin alluded to, it's more than market situation that is putting the supply base under pressure. Emmanuel Rosner : And then now maybe looking forward a little bit, so I think two of the trends that you're highlighting is taking basically more of the satisfactions to improve the cost base in light of this market and then obviously, managing these insolvencies. How should we think about that should as we look forward? How quickly can some of these actions show some impact on margins? And should we assume additional weakness from those insolvencies in 2020? Fred Lissalde : So in the prior call, we've announced some restructuring that we're essentially SG&A focused. Now, the more aggressive look is going to be around COGS and manufacturing costs. And so we know what to do, we know how to do it and we're just managing through it. Emmanuel Rosner : And timing? Fred Lissalde : Timing for the -- I think in the next quarter or two, we're going to give you update. Operator : Next question comes from Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets. Joseph Spak : First question is just if we look, if we compare your revision to the global production versus the revision to your organic growth, it's a little bit steeper for you. It looks like you maybe took down the backlog you expect to come on a little bit this year. Can you just talk about what's driving that? Is it slower ramp ups on some of the programs that were expected to launch perhaps in China? And how do we think about the impact to profitability as you capacitize for certain level of ramp, and that seems might be coming in a little bit softer? Fred Lissalde : So from a backlog perspective, the major impact that we have is, I would say, some of the program delayed and also a program lower volume went down, and it's essentially in China. The top end of the guide -- the top end of the backlog is down about $50 million and the lower end is unchanged, if that gives you the color that you need, Joe. Joseph Spak : And then how much is that, how much is the like lower absorption on that is driving the margins in the back half? Kevin Inda : I mean, that has an impact on the way we're decrementing right now. As we're seeing the volatility in the markets, and some markets like China coming down more quickly than we anticipated, it's causing us to decrement more like the 30% rate as opposed to our target of 20%. And that some of the impact we're seeing as we head to the back half of the year. Joseph Spak : And then I just want to circle back to this supplier cost reductions act keeping pace. I understand there's an unusual or extraordinary situation maybe with some of the bankruptcies. But is there anything more there? Like did you sign up for certain level of efficiencies and you're expecting to get that and you're not? I guess what I'm trying to understand is the relationship between what you signed up from your customers and then what you expect from your supply basis? Seems like there is a bigger disconnect now. Kevin Inda : I mean, as I look at the three things that are really impacting us from a supplier cost performance perspective. The first is we have had the impact of year-over-year tariffs. So that's something that's been a headwind year-over-year. The second item is the supplier insolvencies that we talked about, which has provided some headwind to our cost structure this year that we haven't been able to offset. And the third is that general macro environment, which is making it more challenging to execute on cost reduction strategies in the supply base. So, it's really a combination of those three things that's impacting us and causing us to fall short of offsetting normal customer price downs. Joseph Spak : And those customer price downs are in steady, or has there been a change there? Kevin Inda : They're relatively consistent. I mean, we haven't seen a significant change in terms of our annual customer price downs. They tend to be consistent with what we've seen in the last couple of years. Operator : Next question comes from John Murphy with Bank of America. Aileen Smith : This is Aileen Smith on for John. Following up on Joe's question earlier around the backlog and the slight revision there for 2019 if possible within that full year backlog estimate. Could you remind us what your realization was relative to expectations in the first half of the year? And maybe where that stacks up versus the implied realization on the backlog in the back half of the year? Kevin Inda : In terms of our market outgrowth in the first half of the year, is that your question? Aileen Smith : Yes. Kevin Inda : I think in the first quarter, we reported that we had delivered about 190 basis points of market outgrowth. And then in the second quarter here, we delivered 540 basis points. And as we look ahead to the third quarter, we're expecting it to be roughly a little bit flat to up a little bit favorable from an outgrowth. And in the fourth quarter returning to some of the higher levels we've seen relative to where we were in the first half of the year. So all that then gets us to the 250 to 350 basis points of outperformance. Aileen Smith : So is it fair to say that perhaps 1Q and then specifically 3Q as you looked at your backlog at the beginning of the year, those are the two quarters where there's some relative weakness on backlog roll on versus expectation. Is that fair? Fred Lissalde : I would say looking at the backlog quarter-over-quarter is really something that is very granular. I think we should -- one should look at the backlog year-over-year. Last year, we had outgrowth of 600 plus basis point, this year we'll be at 250 to 350 our long term target. And we said on average it's on average, its 500 basis points above market. But looking at it quarter-over-quarter with the - now the different program launches and stuff like this is really, really something that is difficult. Aileen Smith : And I'm not going to ask any questions around the 2020 backlog specifically, but just to give us a frame of reference as to some of the sensitivity on those numbers. Can you remind us what your underlying volume assumptions were through 2021 when you set your backlog estimates, your three year backlog estimates at the beginning of the year? Fred Lissalde : The underlying market assumption is overall 1% growth year-over-year and flat on commercial vehicle. And I suggest that maybe you can take follow up on that offline. Aileen Smith : And then one last question. The cost restructuring plan that you outlined in 1Q, that was intended to help support investment in future technology. Did you get any of the benefit of some of those actions in the second quarter? Or is this more likely a 2020 story, which explains some of the pressure on Drivetrain margin with higher R&D and launch costs? Kevin Inda : What we alluded to last quarter was intended to do two things. One, to help fund some of the incremental R&D costs that we're expecting. And second was to sustain our strong margin profile. We expect to get the full run rate delivery of that by the time we exit 2020. I will say though that there are some cost performance actions that are taking in the back half of the year that's helping our incrementals as we get into the fourth quarter, but in a small way. The bigger impact is in '20. Operator : Next question comes from David Leiker with Baird. David Leiker : I just want to dig through a little bit on China. You're talking about down 10% to 14% for the year. That 14% decline number is higher than where a lot of the past third party people are, just curious of your thoughts. Is that putting a little bit of a cushion in there? Or is that what you're hearing from the market of where your customers are expecting things to be? Fred Lissalde : So, Dave at the midpoint of our guide, we are at minus 12% for the full year and actually about minus 8% in Q3, close to minus 11% in Q4. This is what we see. And you've seen also some lower pull from electric vehicle from an electric vehicle segment in China this quarter, or let's say in Q2. So this is what we see and we want to share that realistic outlook. This is our best guess. And I agree it might be lower than some third -- out of the third parties, but we want to share what we think. Q - David Leiker : And then just one change subjects here for a bit on Romeo. you give a little bit of detail in terms of what that business is today. I'm sure there are multiple options in term that you could partner with why did you choose them and what customer base do they have? Just if you'd flesh that out a little bit would be great. Thanks. Fred Lissalde : So, we -- as you know, technology drives whatever we do on M&A and also I think analyzed every place in the battery management system, the thermal management system in the battery. And also their flexibility on what type of sales to use, we found that Romeo Power was the best one. And that's why we chose them. They are in production with some low volume application commercial vehicle application. And the joint venture is very simple. And I think joint venture has to be very simple. The focus on product development, and we focused on customer intimacy and manufacturing at scale and globally. And we are in talks with a few customers around the world for different types of applications. Operator : And your next question comes from David Tamberrino with Goldman Sachs. David Tamberrino : Yes, let's just stick with Romeo. Is that something that your customers were asking you to do? I mean is this something that you wanted to do in order to provide a full solution? What was the internal evolution of thinking of going on and adding this to your portfolio? Fred Lissalde : You've heard us talk about the fact that we want to enhance our system focus in electric vehicle and hybrid vehicle. And if you look at all the components that we are making in the slate that shows the components in blue, there was one missing piece is that we wanted to ask to be having products from grid two wheel. And with having all those products, we felt that we can add value to customers from the system understanding, potentially from the product integration path. And so we proactively decided to go into this field. And I think it is also an element where we think in addition to the system understanding and expertise that we can still get between the cell makers that do battery packs and battery thermal management and some of the OEs that do that too, and we feel good about that. Q - David Tamberrino : And then as a follow up, there's been some reports of incremental competition within the turbo charger market. Is that impacting the margin profile on new business that you're quoting, or you're not seeing any impact in the marketplace? Fred Lissalde : So on the turbo market, the new program pricing are challenged. And this is coming from competitive dynamic that is currently existing. We are absolutely focused on our financial discipline. We're focused in getting the best products in the hands of our customers. But they are programs that we're not going to chase. Operator : Next question comes from Rod Lache with Wolfe Research. Rod Lache : Just hoping you could help me get my head around something here. So the midpoint of your full year EBIT guidance came down by $55 million on an $81 million revision to revenue, if I use the midpoint of revenue guidance. So it looks like the bigger change to your expectations were on the cost side. And if I do a simple bridge, the first half decremental margin on the revenue decline was 23%. But if I do the same math on the second half, it's 38%. And maybe you can just elaborate a little bit more on, it seems like this is a cost thing. And is it costs coming into the platform, or is it the inability to take costs out due to some of the factors you're describing here with the Tier 2s? A - Kevin Inda : Rob, this is Kevin. I'll answer that. I think it's predominantly what we're seeing on the cost side in a few different ways. And I'll take it in the three buckets. I think the $55 million that you quoted is a good way to think about it. The first bucket I'd say is we expected to deliver better performance in the second quarter from a decremental perspective, and we didn't deliver on that. Some of the reason because of the some of the supply chain performance. That was about $10 million of that $55 million as you think about it that we expected to be at the upper end of our guidance range. Second is because of all the volatility that we're seeing in the markets, especially with some of the markets coming down in a more accelerated way, we are decrementing at the moment closer to 30% than 20%. 20%, which is our target and will remain our target means that we have to take some costs out to be able to achieve that. But when the markets are moving this quickly, it takes a little bit more time for us to execute. And so we're seeing decrimentals at that 30% level. And you can do the math and see how big an impact that is ballpark, call it, $25 million on a full year basis. And then the final thing is really the supplier cost performance coming in worse than anticipated for the reasons that we talked about earlier. And that's really the bridge for that 55 million or so that you've pointed to. When you look at the first half versus the second half, the one other thing I think you need to keep in mind as you do a year-over-year causal is that we do anticipate our R&D expense being higher in the second half of the year than the first half based on what we're planning right now. Rod Lache : Okay, that might be a big factor there. And in terms of the supplier issues. How wide spread is this within Europe? And if there were to be a downturn in this market, should we interpret this is something that posses an additional risk with the downside sensitivity be greater? Fred Lissalde : So, the bankruptcies are essentially centered in Europe. But the supplier distress, I would say from the current microenvironment and volatility that one see, is varied at -- is at different degrees, but I would say it's global. Rod Lache : And just lastly you alluded to additional restructuring. Are you seeking, at this point, to mitigate additional pressures that you see coming into 2020 and trying to get ahead of that? Or are you primarily looking to restore to your current -- to your margin targets based on the current level of production? Fred Lissalde : We're trying to be proactive and head of the curve. Operator : Your next question comes from Brian Johnson with Barclays. Q - Brian Johnson : Yes. Just try to get to a couple of questions that might be left. In terms of the backlog, how comfortable are you with the 4Q launch cadence, especially, well, both in China given the micro pressures there and then in Europe, given the uncertain outlook for CO2 compliance? Fred Lissalde : What we see right now is that launches are on time. We don't see program cancellation. We see very rare program delays. But what we see is that when it launches, it launches at lower volume. That's the key impact of the backlog shift. Brian Johnson : And then second, as we start looking at 2020, 2021 EU CO2 compliance. Can you help us balance out? On the one hand, it would seem to drive additional take rates across your product lines and install rates, and how you're factoring that in. On the other hand, it's not lost on investors that the European other market, particularly in the mass market is the disaster from the OEM point of view and only going to get worse as these mandates come in, which could underscore both pricing pressure and/or ability to recover costs overruns. So, how do you think about your two to three outlook in light of those trends? Fred Lissalde : So, this is a question that I'd like to answer later in the year. We're currently going through the process of getting our arms around 2020. And with the volatility that w experienced, this is going to take some time. So I'd like to reserve my answer to a little point in time in the year. Operator : Next question comes from Chris McNally with Evercore. Chris McNally : I think I have a similar question to Brian, so I might counter that you said you could address it later. I think what we're all trying to figure out and my colleague has been running this for some time. Is it fair to say that BorgWarner's sitting here in the middle of the year is very conscious that there is probably a disconnect, first what you see as the gap in 2020 and 2021, fuel efficiency in Europe to meet regulations need to grow up by 20% to 25% in the next 12 to 18 months. And that you have to do something to gain scenario for that, because OEMs are not really admitting to the problem. There's definitely going to be some repercussions. I think is that something that you recognize right now, or are we on the sales side seeing numbers that maybe are skewed and we're missing something in our analysis? Fred Lissalde : We're not going to speak for our customers. But what I can tell you is that for every product that we do that balancing that enhances fuel efficiency and reduce emission, we see a strong pull. And everything we can do to add capacity and to push production lies to deliver more in Europe to help our customers, we'll do. Chris McNally : So you are starting to at least consider a scenario where as our customers come to you with a need for higher adoption rates of fuel efficient products, whether that's ICE or on the electrification side? Fred Lissalde : We're saying it and it's good for us. Operator : Your next question comes from Dan Levy with Credit Suisse. Dan Levy : Just following up on this line of questions, I assume that there is a fairly fluid discussion between yourself and the OEMs on what they're trying to achieve. So could you just give us a sense, the latest thing that you're hearing, OEMs have a number of options of meeting these targets, whether it's just more beds and pay TVs, or to enhance the internal combustion engines or pay the credit fund. Where does the enhanced internal combustion engine fit in on this? And as it relates to yourselves, I mean your internal combustion engine portfolio is obviously mature, it's been around for a while, the hybrid and BEV piece, this is newer. Where are you in terms of capacity on ICE versus the hybrid and that piece, and ability to meet incremental demand on both sides? Fred Lissalde : So first again, we're not going to speak to our customers. But since we are pretty relevant in the propulsion area and we have a breadth of product that cuts across combustion and within electric, and that's what we do right. We have discussion at the highest level at customers and each customers have different options to meet future regulatory obligations either 2020 and 2025, or 2030, they have different options. And each customers are going to take potentially different path and different options depending on what their fees, depending on what they used to do. And for us we position ourselves as a system supplier, able to supply and support them in anything they want to do. So, it's not going to be a one sides fits all. You're we\u2019re going to see a lot of different customers moving in lot of different strategies technologies and products strategies. And whatever they do, they can do it BorgWarner. From a combustion product standpoint, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, customers are still wanting to bring in their portfolio innovative solution that makes their engine and transmission leaner and more efficient. So we see that pull also. Dan Levy : And then just one more, I wanted to just follow up on China. Obviously, a very challenging market environment and you think you're still able to maintain efforts in the second quarter. But if I just contrast your current China profile versus the last couple of years where you were experiencing very significant and robust outgrowth, I think in order of magnitude 20 points to 30 points, just very robust outgrowth. Is there something that's happening in terms of the product mix set shifting? Or is it now that you're emphasizing more hybrids and electrification at that uptake, is maybe a little slower than -- I think previously there is more DCT. So just trying to understand the shift in the China growth? Fred Lissalde : So, two things I want to try to give you some color then first of all, year-after-year, our base revenue becoming higher, so the outgrowth in percents is based on the higher revenue. What you see in China also is that as I alluded to before the volumes of the products that are being launched are lower than that what we expected in the past because of the macro environment and the customer confidence and other changes in this market. You see ups and downs on take rate on battery electric vehicle and that impacts us quite a bit. Operator : Your next question comes from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Noah Kaye : Maybe just a quick one on Romeo. I think you explained your strategic rationale. Obviously, this is a large AFP or content for vehicle item. Can you talk a little bit about the backlog that you're seeing where the coating activity, just for us to try to understand what the growth trajectory could look like for BorgWarner to the battery system supplier? Fred Lissalde : No, it's still very early days for the JV. We're getting everything ready. We have customer pool. We are in coating phases. In any case, between now when we quote and when we launch, most probably won't have any significant impact in our three year backlog. Noah Kaye : And then I understand, I mean you're really targeting niche volume productions, tens of thousands. Is that correct? Fred Lissalde : That is correct. Noah Kaye : And then just on the -- just to go back to\u2026 Fred Lissalde : That is correct initially\u2026 Noah Kaye : So then just to go back to some of the breakdowns with the supplier bankruptcies. I guess, obviously, we've gone through this before in a much more severe way globally in decades past. I guess what does surprised you at all about what's happening now in that supply base, and what mitigating actions are you taking? Fred Lissalde : So I would say, if there is a surprise it's how many suppliers are impacted. As I mentioned before, it's essentially Europe. And in Europe you've seen an impact on the supply base of the diesel drop, which is not significant for us but for some of our supplies it is significant. And we have to find a way to manage these costs. We have to find a way to get through those tough times. And just we know how to do it, we've done it before and we're doing it. It's just the magnitude and the number of them that if there was a surprise that would be the surprise. Operator : Next question comes from Armintas Sinkevicius with Morgan Stanley. Armintas Sinkevicius : Good morning, thank you for taking the question. Presumably this is already incorporated into the guide around European production. But maybe you could give us some color around how your customers are thinking about RDE coming up here in a few months? Fred Lissalde : So I think we see the impact of RDE coming in a few months. And so right now our put in Europe is that it's going to be flat second half of prior year at the midpoint of our guidance from a market perspective. I think it's a bit early to talk about the impact of RDE, at least at our level. Armintas Sinkevicius : And then the other question is just more broadly we're seeing in partnerships with BMW and Jaguar Land Rover around the electric drive unit. Volkswagen is talking about 30% less employees for an electric vehicle versus an internal combustion engine. Just as we gravitate towards that world. How do you think about the potential risks of in-sourcing and how do you position yourself? Fred Lissalde : So we've always been in products that have potentials of in-sourcing. And from a battery electric vehicle standpoint motor and drive motor being a good proxy, our hypothesis is that the available market is going to be 50% of the total market, i.e. 50% of those motors could be in-sourced. And again it's not going to be one size fits all, it's not going to be, we think, one customer is doing it all in-house, some customers are not going to do it, some customers are going to do some and outsource some. And even if customers do, let's take motor as a proxy in-house, they will still need components. And they will still need efficient motors and we are here to support them also in this. So for us, supplying systems is certainly a target understanding system is certainly core, but we are absolutely supportive in selling components too. Operator : We have time for one final question, and that question comes from Colin Langan with UBS. Colin Langan : When I look at the Q3 guidance, it seems to imply a pretty good bound in margin. I mean, how should we think about margin cadence? So it just seems like Q3 looked little rough based on their earnings guide. And then it has to pick up a big step in Q4. Is that the case and why the sequential decline here? Kevin Inda : Colin, this is Kevin. From a sequential perspective, the reason we're seeing the step down is first and foremost, revenue stepping down $50 million to $150 million in our guidance. And with the quick moves we're seeing to the downside and some of the revenue, we're decrementing it closer to 30%. So that's a big piece of the equation. In addition to that, we are seeing a sequential step up in our R&D expense as we head into the third quarter. Some of what we anticipated in the second quarter slipped into the third quarter, and so that's going to be north of $5 million, in the $5 million to $10 million range sequentially in Q3. Colin Langan : And so you should expect though as to jump back up in Q4 get full year to Q4. What makes Q4 so strong? Kevin Inda : Well, Q4, our revenue takes back up you can see that in our guide. The Q3 is the low point. So we do expect to convert on the incremental revenue sequentially. When we look at the back half of the year, there is a couple of things that we normally expect. One is that we do tend generate certain types of prototype income, or government grants in a modest way that impact the quarter. We're also expecting to see some of the cost performance that we talked about last quarter starting to kick-in in our Q4 results as well. But again a big piece of that is really coming from the conversion on incremental revenue. Colin Langan : And just lastly just to clarify prior comments about pricing in turbo. When we're thinking about that impact in the market that how would hit your backlog when it comes to us, if it's not a factor in the margin performance currently? Fred Lissalde : It would most probably be passed to backlog, because this is something that we are quoting now. And so team would be -- would not be impacting the backlog, would be impacting the backlog very marginally. Colin Langan : Okay, great. Thank you very much. Fred Lissalde : Thank you, Colin. Patrick Nowlan : With that, I'd like to thank you all for your good questions. And if you have any follow ups, please feel free to reach out to me. Sharon, you can go ahead and close the call. Operator : That does conclude the BorgWarner 2019 second quarter results conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BorgWarner 2019 Third Quarter Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Patrick Nolan, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Nolan, you may begin your conference. Patrick Nolan : Thank you, Sharon, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. We issued our earnings release at 6 :30 AM Eastern Time posted on our website borgwarner.com on our homepage and on our Investor Relations homepage. A replay of today's call will be available through November 14. The dial-in number for that call is 855-859-2056. The conference ID for that replay is 2638875, or you can listen to the replay on our website. With regard to our Investor Relations calendar, we will be attending multiple conferences between now and our next earnings release. Please see the Events section of our Investor Relations homepage for a full list. Before we begin, I need to inform you that during this call, we may make forward-looking statements, which involves risks and uncertainties as detailed in our 10-K. Our actual results may differ significantly from the matters discussed today. During today's presentation, we will highlight certain non-GAAP measures in order to provide a clearer picture of how the core business performed and for comparison purposes with prior periods. When you hear us say, on a comparable basis, that means excluding the impact of FX, net M&A and other non-comparable items. When you hear us say adjusted, that means excluding non-comparable items. When you hear us say, organic, that means excluding the impact of FX and net M&A. We will also refer to our growth compared to our markets. When you hear us say, market, that means the change in light vehicle production weighted for our geographic exposure. Our outgrowth is defined as our organic revenue change versus the market. But now back to today's call. First, Fred Lissalde, our President and CEO, will comment on our Q3 results. This will be followed by a discussion of our recent cash flow performance. He will conclude with a discussion of our recent product highlights. Then Kevin Nowlan, our CFO, will discuss the industry outlook as well as the details of results and guidance. Please note, that we have posted an earnings call presentation to the IR page of our website. We encourage you to follow along with these slides during our discussion. With that, I'll turn it over to Fred. Fred Lissalde : Thanks, Pat, and good morning, everyone. We're very pleased to share our results from Q3 today and also provide an overall company update. Let me start with the highlights of the quarter on slide 4. I am pleased with our stronger than expected top line and margin performance in the quarter. With approximately $2.5 billion in sales, we were up about 4.5% organically. This compares to a market being down approximately 0.4%. So our outgrowth was about 490 basis points in the quarter, which was well ahead of our expectation, driven by stronger than expected revenue trends in Europe, essentially, and in China. Regionally, we saw outgrowth in all major regions. On an organic basis, our European light vehicle revenue was up double-digits. Our North American and Chinese light vehicle revenue was up mid-single digits year-over-year. Our adjusted earnings per share came in at $0.96, ahead of our guidance, driven by the revenue upside and better than expected margins. Our near-term cost actions are beginning to drive our incremental margins, and we are identifying additional cost saving opportunities to sustain our strong margin profile. At the same time, we are also securing key new wins across combustion, hybrid and electric, which is positioning us to deliver continued revenue outgrowth. In fact, in this quarter, we secured awards for two new products for electric vehicles, which I'll speak about in more detail shortly. Next, I would like to highlight our strong cash generation on slide 5. As you know, cash flow has become an important focus for the company over the last couple of years. Year-to-date we have generated $478 million of free cash flow, up significantly year-over-year despite the volatile industry volume. We're able to drive this level of free cash flow thanks to our strong margin and earnings profile. Combining this with, our increased focus on capital spending efficiency and working capital management we remain poised to continue to improve our free cash flow generation going forward. A strong cash generation allows us to reinvest in the business to support our continued revenue outgrowth initiatives. It also gives us an ability to provide real cash returns to our shareholders. We've been relatively balanced in how we've deployed this capital over time. As you can see, over the past five years, we've utilized about half of our free cash flow for strategic growth opportunities while deploying the other half towards returns of capital to shareholders. We expect to maintain a balanced approach to capital deployment as we look ahead. In a few minutes, Kevin will talk about our strategic deployment of capital that we just executed this week, which allows us to eliminate our exposure to asbestos. Beyond our track record of capital deployment, our prudent leverage profile combined with strong cash generation better positions us to manage the business throughout the demand cycle. At the same time, as we manage through the challenging global market environment, we continue to focus on pursuing new business and new technologies. This quarter, we achieved continued success on both fronts bookings and new technologies. For combustion products, on slide 6, I want to highlight two contracts. First, we're supplying our turbocharges to a global OEM for its gasoline engines in multiple markets including North America. This program will start with two vehicles and expand to additional applications over the life of the program. And second, we're supplying our gasoline EGR technology to Indian OEM for its small gasoline engines. This is an expansion of our existing business with this customer. Both of these wins point to the increased penetration of highly efficient gasoline engines around the world. There are also great examples of applying already proven solutions towards meeting demands of OEMs. This allows us to reduce time to market, reduce cost to our customers while sustaining our product leadership in combustion propulsion. Now, let's turn to slide 7 and discuss our first awards for two new electric vehicle products. First, our Torque-Vectoring Dual-Clutch for electric vehicles. This Dual-Clutch design replaces the conventional differential in an electric driveline while improving handling and maneuverability in an all-wheel drive application. This clutch distributes torque independently to the left and right wheels from its position on the rear axle. The technology features disconnect capabilities to minimize energy loss and increase range. This is a great example of applying our existing clutch and hydraulic controls expertise to electric vehicle platforms. This first award is supplying a major global OEM with start of production expected in 2022. Next, I'm glad to announce that we have secured our first contract for our integrated drive module, so-called iDM. This product integrates our highly efficient power electronics with our advanced transmission system and our drive motor technology. Our iDM creates value to our customers in several fields, including packaging, efficiency, low NVH, and of course, ease of assembly. We're supplying a China EV brand for an electric vehicle which is scheduled to go into mass production in 2021. Importantly all components used in this iDM are part of BorgWarner's owned technologies. We have ongoing interest from several customers and are currently pursuing multiple program awards for our iDM. Our differentiation in electric propulsion is our full propulsion system expertise. Many of our competitors purchase some of their components and subsystems. In our case, we design and manufacture the motor, the transmission, and the power electronics, creating system value for our customers. This first iDM award is a significant step for BorgWarner. So, let me summarize the quarter. We exceeded our expectation for revenue growth. Earnings were better than our guidance, driven by better topline performance and our cost saving measures. We delivered strong free cash flow and the benefits of R&D investments in electric propulsion are continuing to pay off with the award of our first iDM contracts. Before I turn it over to Kevin, I also want to commend and thank the entire BorgWarner team for how they have reacted to the challenging external environment. It is your actions, smartness, and dedication that allows the company to successfully manage the presence, while continuing to position us for future success. Now, over to you Kevin. Kevin Nowlan : Thank you, Fred and good morning everyone. Before I review the financials in detail, I'd like to provide a quick overview of the two key drivers of our third quarter results. First, our revenue outgrowth was ahead of our expectations at 490 basis points in the quarter. This was driven primarily by higher volumes of new programs and strong mix, especially in Europe. This puts us on track to deliver full year revenue outgrowth of 350 to 400 basis points. Second, our margin performance was ahead of guidance driven by better-than-expected sales and our focus on cost management actions. Let's turn to slide 8, where you can see our perspective on industry production. Overall, while production expectations continue to moderate in the quarter, the volatility of these forecasts has declined over the past few months. This is a welcome change. Looking specifically at Q3 global production for our market declined by 0.4% year-over-year roughly at the midpoint of our expectations going into the quarter. Within that global result, we saw European production up less than 1% against a relatively easy prior year comparison. North America production was down modestly while China production was down about 5% as that market remains under pressure. On a full year basis we now expect the market decline to be in the minus 4% to 4.5% range which is roughly in line with our prior outlook. By region, we're now planning for China to be down anywhere from 9% to 11% on a full year basis which is a modest improvement from a few months ago. Europe is likely to be down 3.5% to 4% just as we previously expected. And North America is now likely to be down 2.5% to 3.5% which is a little bit worse than before. As we look toward the remainder of 2019 and into 2020, we expect that the challenging industry conditions will continue so we are managing our cost structure accordingly. Let's turn to slide 9. As we look at year-over-year revenue, you can see the impact from the thermostat divestiture we executed earlier this year. In addition, you can see that the stronger U.S. dollar reduced revenue by about 2.7% from a year ago. Excluding these items, our organic sales were up 4.5% despite the 0.4% decline in industry production. This is the 490 basis points of market outgrowth. And importantly, this outgrowth occurred in all of the major light vehicle markets around the globe. In Europe our light vehicle organic revenue was up double digits on strong new programs and platform mix. And in China we grew double digits over the market. Partially offsetting the strength in our light vehicle growth our commercial vehicle and off-highway businesses declined relative to last year, resulting in a more than 100 basis point drag on our total organic growth. Overall, we're pleased that we continue to deliver revenue outgrowth even in this challenging end-market environment. Now, let's look at our adjusted operating income performance, which can be found on slide 10. Q3 adjusted operating income was $294 million, compared to $293 million in the third quarter of 2018. Our adjusted operating margin was 11.8%, which was flat year-over-year. On a comparable basis, adjusted operating income increased $9 million on $109 million of higher sales, which translates to an incremental margin of roughly 8%. Even though this was below our long-term expected incremental conversion of 15%, the result was still ahead of our guidance, due to stronger revenue and our cost management actions, which included a reduction in R&D spending in our engine segment compared to the same quarter in 2018. Adjusted earnings per share, was $0.96 for the quarter above the top end of our guidance range. The $0.04 decline in earnings per share compared to the third quarter of 2018 was driven by lower equity and affiliates earnings and a slightly higher tax rate. Moving to cash flow. As Fred discussed earlier, we are proud of the fact, we delivered a strong result for the quarter. In the third quarter, we generated $255 million of free cash flow, significantly stronger than the $126 million we delivered in the same quarter a year ago. This is a great result as we continue to focus on cash generation as a management team. Now, let's take a closer look at our segment results on slide 11. Engine segment sales were just over $1.5 billion in the quarter. Organic sales for the Engine segment increased 4.6% or $69 million despite lower industry-wide production. Growth in Europe for our Engine business was partially offset by the impact of the weaker China end market. Adjusted EBIT was $241 million for the Engine segment or 15.9% of sales. On a comparable basis, the Engine segment's adjusted EBIT was up $8 million on $69 million of higher sales. Drivetrain segment sales were $993 million in the quarter. On a comparable basis, sales for the Drivetrain segment increased 4.2% year-over-year, also meaningfully outperforming the market, driven by strong outgrowth in China and European mix. Adjusted EBIT was $100 million for Drivetrain or 10.1% of sales. On a comparable basis, the Drivetrain segment's adjusted EBIT was down $5 million on $41 million of higher sales. The adjusted EBIT decline was driven by higher R&D spending and launch-related costs, primarily in China. Now, I'd like to discuss our full year guidance, which is on slide 12. Our guidance is based on the end market assumptions I discussed earlier, with global production down 4% to 4.5%. Despite that, we expect organic revenue to be in the range of down only 1% to roughly flat. That's because we continue to expect to drive significant market outgrowth of 350 to 400 basis points for the full year. This is in line with our year-to-date outgrowth of approximately 400 basis points. With these organic growth assumptions, we now expect total revenue to be in the range of $9.95 billion to $10.1 billion. The midpoint of this guidance is slightly lower than the midpoint of our prior guidance, as there is an additional $105 million of FX headwinds that are offsetting the benefit of stronger organic growth. Our adjusted operating margin is now expected to be in the range of 11.7% to 12.0%. The 20 to 30 basis point increase in our margin outlook relative to our prior guidance reflects stronger organic growth, which has a higher incremental margin than the margin impact of the additional FX headwinds and cost management actions including lower full year R&D relative to our prior planning assumption. We continue to proactively manage and aligned our overall cost structure to the revenue we're actually seeing in the marketplace, while ensuring we continue to support the investments that drive our sustained revenue outgrowth. For full year adjusted EPS, we've tightened our guidance by increasing the bottom end of our range by $0.10 as a result of our stronger margin outlook. Therefore our new guidance range is $3.85 to $4 per diluted share. And finally, we are now targeting free cash flow of $550 million to $600 million which is up $25 million from our prior guidance. In addition to higher earnings at the midpoint of our guide, we expect capital spending to come in lower than our prior guidance. That's our 2019 outlook. Before we move to Q&A, I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing an important transaction you saw us announce yesterday which is summarized on slide 13. On Wednesday, we signed and closed on a transaction in which we effectively sold the company's asbestos liabilities to a subsidiary of Enstar which is a publicly traded insurance company that specializes in managing runoff liability exposures like asbestos. The transaction involved BorgWarner investing $172 million in cash into the non-operating legal entity that holds the asbestos liabilities. Then we transferred this entity including the cash and other related insurance assets to the buyer. The result of this transaction is that, we expect to remove the $772 million in asbestos liabilities from our balance sheet. By eliminating the company's exposure to this liability, we will also avoid future exposure to the annual defense and indemnity cash costs which have been running in the $45 million to $60 million range as you can see on the slide. We think this was an important strategic deployment of capital that will eliminate the overhang of asbestos liabilities on our balance sheet and our cash flow. Overall, we had a really solid quarter as we delivered 11.8% adjusted operating margin, 490 basis points of market outgrowth, $0.96 of adjusted EPS which was above our guidance range and $255 million of free cash flow. On top of that we executed a very important derisking transaction this week. As a management team, we are taking the necessary actions to maintain our company's historically strong margin profile and strengthen our free cash flow generation. We'll continue to do this while managing through a very difficult near-term market environment that we expect will continue for the remainder of 2019 and likely into 2020. With that I'd like to turn the call back over to Pat. Patrick Nolan : Thank you, Kevin. Sharon we're ready to open up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets. Joseph Spak : Thanks all and good morning. I guess I just first wanted to focus on the backlog that you're indicating for this year. It's within your -- the range you talked about at the beginning of the year, but it does look like it was raised 15% at the midpoint versus what you indicated last quarter. So -- and I apologize if I missed this, but did something come back? Or did something pull forward? Or what was the cause of that revision? Fred Lissalde : Joe, the major driver is actually from the engine group, better-than-expected new program launch and associated volume on small gasoline in Europe. That's the main driver. Joseph Spak : Okay. So you took that down last quarter and then the volumes were just stronger than you thought as this quarter progressed? Fred Lissalde : Yes. Yes it was difficult to forecast with the volatility of the market and it turned out to be better than expected. Joseph Spak : Okay. And then just on the iDM market, it's nice to see a win there. Can you talk a little bit about how -- now that you're sort of bidding on those awards, how you see that market evolving? It\u2019s having all the subcomponents a true differentiating feature in winning that award and as you go after additional business? Fred Lissalde : Yes, we think it is a true differentiating features because by -- not only developing and buying, but also manufacturing the three key elements of that iDM, we're able to design it smarter and make it smarter and make it lighter. And in those systems this is the interaction of those subsystems that make the product creating value in different shapes or form for our customers. So we think that it is going to be a differentiating factor and it has been for this business win. Joseph Spak : And in the quoting are you seeing any shift towards more of an integrated product versus more of in a way a sourced-by-component strategy? Fred Lissalde : This one was a system. We also as you know are in production with what we call eDM which is transmission end motor. We're not forced to sell our system. We're happy to sell systems or subcomponents. What's important in this market is to understand the system in order to partner with our customers and sell them whatever they want. And we are in this position. Joseph Spak : Okay. Thank you. Fred Lissalde : Thanks, Joe. Operator : Next question comes from with Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Noah Kaye : Thanks. Good morning. So high-level question first. We're a few months away from the start of the implementation in Europe the more stringent CO2 standards. I guess, just based on your conversation with the customers what you've got in the pipeline as the process plays out over the next few years how does this impact BorgWarner in terms of content per vehicle growth backlog other dynamics? Fred Lissalde : So Europe, first of all, the second half of this year is stabilizing and it's a good thing. It's true that it's comparing to a rather weak second half of 2018. And we see no signs of WLTP disruption. Now as far as next year is concerned for RDE, I would say that it's difficult to forecast and we will give you our look in our Q4 call. The good news for us is that these standards in Europe will drive opportunity for our components and systems. So we see that as a plus. How this -- what will be the disturbance in 2020 due to the RDE validation remains to be seen. And again Noah, we'll give you some more color in our Q4 call. Noah Kaye : Okay. I appreciate that. I think you commented on the key points of having an integrated solution with the iDM just knowing all the components there. So I want to ask about integration on, sort of, a similar product which would be electric turbochargers. I think one of your competitors recently stated they're introducing an E-turbo where the motor is integrated on the shaft of the turbo unit. Clearly, you've got in-house competencies around both turbos and electric motors. So engineering and integrated unit would seem feasible, I guess just -- is that in your product road map? Is it something your customers are asking for? And more generally how do you see your competitive positioning with respect to electrically boosted turbos? Fred Lissalde : Yes. So we are in production with E-boosters since quite some time with Daimler and others. And it is pretty much also motor around the turbo and our own power electronics. It's also a system that requires understanding of turbo motor and power electronics. So we have that in our portfolio. That's the E-booster. We also have E-turbo in our portfolio. And we think that this market will see some daylight in the next years to come. We are -- we believe is that electrification of turbocharges will drive growth for us. Noah Kaye : Okay. Very helpful. I will jump back in queue. Thanks. Fred Lissalde : Thanks, Noah. Operator : Next question comes from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Ryan Brinkman : Hi. Great. Thanks for taking my question. You know, maybe just first can you talk about what you think the impact of customer consolidation is on the supply base around BorgWarner? Are there any market share or pricing implications for investors to consider? Fred Lissalde : Are you -- well, overall we're very global and we serve all markets around the world. There is not one customer\u2019s that we don't serve. And to the extent that they use the same propulsion and they want to combine forces I think there are costs and benefits to both us and them. So we focus on what we can control and what we can control is carry on delivering great products that deliver value to any customers around the world. Ryan Brinkman : Okay, great. Thanks. And can you please remind us of your latest exposure to commercial vehicles and your outlook for this market. Some of the other suppliers reporting this quarter have called out softer production of off-the-road vehicles where I think yours \u2013 you're primarily commercial on-highway. That tracked better, but there's a lot of changing estimates for next year. Just curious how you're thinking about that? Fred Lissalde : Yeah. Commercial vehicle overall is about 13%, 14% of our revenue. And it's very, very I would say fragmented around the three continents about a third in North America, a third in Europe, and the last third between China and Brazil. It's also very fragmented as far as Class 8 is concerned in off-highway and agricultural construction. And its true CV was down this quarter especially the Class 8. And we'll give you our view of 2020 in the Q4 call. But again, when you think about 14% or 13% of revenue for CV for BorgWarner don't associate that to U.S. Class 8. It's much more than that. Ryan Brinkman : Very helpful. Thank you. Fred Lissalde : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank. Emmanuel Rosner : Good morning. First some clarification on the backlog, if there's anything you can give in terms of incremental color. So, I guess last quarter, you were sort of like taking your expectations down for this year's backlog. In particular, you were making a fairly bold forecast or assumption of essentially no backlog in the third quarter. Obviously, extremely pleased with your performance this quarter $153 million, but it sort of feels like just incrementally higher volumes wouldn't sort of like explain going from like 0 to like $150 million. So anything else you can give us in terms of dynamics of why you maybe felt somewhat less positive? And what actually sort of is playing out in the quarter that turned out to be a really, really strong backlog? Fed Lissalde : Yeah. So the last quarter guide from a backlog perspective, we actually thought that the China backlog was going to be down. And we saw that Q3 was modestly stronger than expected. But as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the majority of the backlog is better-than-expected engine products related to small gasoline European platforms. And it was also a little bit of mix in Europe too. And that was not forecasted right? It's a good surprise that we take. We have enjoyed that our growth and also converted very well on it. Emmanuel Rosner : Understood. And are you able to talk about implications from I guess the backlog now for this year trending towards the high end of the range communicated all the way back in January despite some fairly meaningful weakening in I guess production environment. What are the implications for that in terms of your existing three-year backlog? Are the puts and takes still the same where the volumes are maybe weaker than its back in January but at the same time potentially faster rollout of some of these launches or better volume on some of these new products? Or is it too early to tell? Kevin Nowlan : Yeah, I think it's \u2013 I mean, I think overall what I would tell you is as we look ahead obviously, the markets are looking a lot different than they were maybe a year ago at this time. And undoubtedly, that will have implications on the business. We'll give more updates on our longer-term outlook when we get into our Analyst Day in the spring upcoming. But at this point, we're not prepared to give guidance on that in terms of a long-range outlook. But I would say obviously market is \u2013 has changed from where we were a year ago in terms of our outlook. Emmanuel Rosner : Understood. Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from Armintas Sinkevicius with Morgan Stanley. Armintas Sinkevicius : Great. Thank you for taking the question. I was hoping you could \u2013 as we look ahead here and think about some of the puts and takes for margins into 2020 obviously a lot of it's driven by global production the environment in China the backlog in China, the emission standards in Europe. But something within your control is the cost management, which you've done a good job on, but trying to think through how you plan to attack cost of goods sold and manufacturing? Kevin Nowlan : Yes, I think -- I mean a focus point of ours as I've talked about in my remarks is sustaining our strong margin profile. And obviously we -- as we indicated on the call, we expect that the markets are going to remain under pressure and challenged as we look ahead to 2020. So our continued focus on managing cost performance is going to be a key element of how we think about 2020. So when we give guidance in February, you can expect it to reflect that we expect the market to be under pressure and we're going to look at cost actions that are appropriate to take to make sure we sustain the margin profile we have. Armintas Sinkevicius : Okay. And then with regards to the asbestos transaction, can you remind me how the accounting works for the cash cost? Does it flow through the income statement? Or is it a cash flow item? Kevin Nowlan : It's a cash flow -- the entirety of the liability has been accrued on the balance sheet. And so what happens is when we have cash costs, it simply relieves the liability. So it's not P&L. It's purely cash. But it's obviously real cash going out of our pockets $45 million to $60 million every year. Armintas Sinkevicius : Okay. Much appreciated. Operator : Next question comes from John Murphy with Bank of America. John Murphy : Good morning guys. Just sort of in light of the divestiture of the thermostat business and what you're doing with the asbestos liability, it seems like you're a little bit more open to at least small portfolio actions and sort of a little bit of restructuring here. Given the balance sheet is pretty underlevered at 0.7 times at least relative to other folks in the industry, I'm just curious how open you are or how active you are in portfolio -- in your portfolio review and potentially adding maybe some acquisitions? Given the stress that we might see there might be some really good stuff that opens up in the next year or two. I mean, how are you thinking about that? And how far could you go on leverage? Fred Lissalde : Yes. We're managing our portfolio actively and we will do that going forward. From an M&A perspective, what drives our approach is the drive for technology in two elements : First would be scale and competencies in electronics; and secondly system focus and electric propulsion. So we do that very disciplined and it is a focus of us and we just carry on doing that. John Murphy : So Fred, it's fair to characterize that as small acquisitions that would be focused on the EV powertrain is really where you're headed. Nothing that would be big bang, nothing that would be in \"sort of old school combustion technology.\" Is that a fair statement? Fred Lissalde : Again, we'll be opportunistic and -- but also very disciplined on how we see that. The drive will be technology. That's the punch line. John Murphy : Okay. And then just a clarification on the sale of the asbestos liability, it's being called Morse TEC. Is there anything going on with the chain business that's being sold? Or is that all residing? Is this just a way that this has been structured under the name Morse TEC just a little confusion. Kevin Nowlan : They unfortunately happen to share the name Morse, but the Morse TEC entity that was transferred to Enstar has -- is a non-operating subsidiary of the company. So there is no portion of the operating business including the chain business that was transferred as part of this. It's still absolutely an important part of BorgWarner going forward. John Murphy : \u2026.the liability and the assets going over? Kevin Nowlan : That's called Morse Systems. It's the liability that happened to reside in a legal entity that had the name Morse TEC LLC. That's what's been transferred to Enstar. Non-operating, it really has the asbestos liabilities some environmental liabilities and then the cash and the insurance-related assets. John Murphy : That's very helpful. Thank you very much. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We have a question from David Kelley with Jefferies. David Kelley : Good morning guys. Thanks for taking my question. You alluded to the cost initiatives starting to bear fruit. I think you're targeting $40 million to $50 million in savings over some 18 months or so. Can you kind of update us on where we are in that process? Fred Lissalde : Yes. And I think you're starting seeing evidence on the results in our Q3. And as Kevin alluded to we will give you some more updates in Q4 call. We started by looking at the SG&A and the corporate costs. And now we take a bit of a more aggressive look at our manufacturing costs and other structural costs and that's the picture that we're going to give you hopefully in early next year. So far on track. David Kelley : Okay. Perfect. Thank you. And maybe I get the same answer for this question. But just thinking back to your last three-year backlog update, I think 80% of it was tied to EVs and hybrids, clearly weighted more to hybrids though. It seems like over the last few months EV adoption has been a bit softer than most expected particularly in China. Are you more or less bullish today on hybrid adoption and potential sales growth? And do you foresee the pace of EV adoption getting pushed out even further? Fred Lissalde : We are bullish on electrification overall. We think that the world is moving towards electrification. And for us with our portfolio it doesn't really matter if it's hybrid or electric. We are in a position to support the customers with whatever they want to do. David Kelley : But -- okay. Thank you. But just a quick follow-up. You weren't seeing any, I mean, it's got a lot of -- you're getting a lot of traction in China and the EV market. Are you seeing any pullback in customer interest and the technology or transition to hybrids or anything there? Fred Lissalde : You'll have a little bit of noise driven by incentives. And yes, we saw the EV pull in China getting a little bit choppy. But the contracts are still coming in and we think that the long-term outlook for electric vehicle as well as hybrids in China is very strong for us. David Kelley : Perfect. Really appreciate the color. Thank you. Fred Lissalde : Thank you. Operator : At this time, I will turn the call over to Mr. Nolan. Patrick Nolan : I'd like to thank you all for your great questions today. If you have any follow-ups, feel free to reach out to me directly. Sharon, you can close the call. Operator : That does conclude the BorgWarner 2019 third quarter results conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BorgWarner 2019 Fourth Quarter and Full-year Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Patrick Nolan, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Nolan, you may begin your conference. Patrick Nolan : Thank you, Sharon. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We issued our earnings release earlier this morning. It is posted on our website borgwarner.com, on our homepage and on our Investor Relations homepage. With regard to our Investor Relations calendar, we will be attending multiple conferences between now and our next earnings release. Please see the Events section of our Investor Relations homepage for a full list. Before we begin, I need to inform you that during this call we may make Forward-Looking Statements, which involve risks and uncertainties detailed in our 10-K. Our actual results may differ significantly from the matters discussed today. During today's presentation, we will highlight certain non-GAAP measures in order to provide a clearer picture of how the core business performed and for comparison purposes with prior periods. When you hear us say, \"On a comparable basis\", that means excluding the impact of FX, net M&A and other non-comparable items. When you hear us say, \"Adjusted\", that means excluding non-comparable items. When you hear us say, \"Organic\", that means excluding the impact of FX and net M&A. We will also refer to our growth compared to our market. When you hear us say \"Market\", that means the change in light vehicle production we did for our geographic exposure. Our growth is defined as our organic revenue change versus the market. Please note that we have posted our earnings call presentation to the IR page of our website. We encourage you to follow along with the slides during our discussion. With that, I'm happy to turn the call over to Fred. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : Thank you, Pat, and good morning, everyone. We are very pleased to share our results for 2019 this morning and provide an overall company update. Let me start with the highlights of the quarter on Slide 5. I am pleased with our stronger than expected top-line and margin performance for the year, driven by the fourth quarter performance. With approximately $10.2 billion in sales, we are up about 0.7% organically. This compares to our market being down approximately 4.6%. So, our outgrowth was 530 basis points for the year, which was ahead of our expectations going into the fourth quarter, driven by stronger than expected revenue trends in China and Europe. For the full-year, we saw our growth in all major regions. We delivered high single-digit outgrowth in Europe and China. Our North American outgrowth was in the mid-single digit range. 2019 earnings per share came at $4.13, ahead of our guidance, driven by the fourth quarter upside. We delivered strong free cash of about $700 million for the year and we expect this strong free cash to continue in 2020. Our near-term cost actions are supporting our incremental margin and we have identified additional cost saving opportunities that we believe will sustain our strong margin profile. As Kevin will discuss in detail later, we believe our backlog supports our targeted mid-single digit outgrowth going forward. And lastly, our planned acquisition of Delphi Technologies, we strengthened our propulsion leadership while supporting our long-term growth outlook. Let's now turn to Slide 6, which highlights the additional cost restructuring steps that we have announced today. As you will recall, on our Q2 call, we highlighted our intention to find additional ways to adjust our cost structure without compromising our longer-term aspirations. Over the last six months, the team has identified additional restructuring opportunities in all major regions. These actions will include the restructuring, closure or consolidation of both manufacturing and technical centers. We have also made the decision to consolidate our turbo and emissions businesses in order to create product differentiation with our turbo and EGR under one roof, as well as consolidating overhead costs. These actions are expected to generate incremental annual cost savings in the range of $90 million to $100 million by 2023. Combined with our previously announced restructuring plan, we plan to achieve gross cost savings of $135 million to $145 million per year by 2023. Cost improvement is a continuous focus for BorgWarner. We view these actions as proactive steps that we believe will position the company to sustain its strong margin profile and overall long-term competitiveness. While we must adjust our cost to the challenging global market environment, we continue to focus on pursuing new businesses and new technology. Our Q4 product announcements highlight this focus and they are summarized on Slide 7. First, we disclosed that we will be launching our Triple Clutch P2 Hybrid Module and hydraulic control unit with ChangAn this year. This module gave us cost effective hybridization and is compatible with existing vehicle platforms. Next, we disclose our first award for our eTurbo. Though this program launches with the European OEM in 2022. It is a great example of combining our mechanical, rotating electric, electronics and software expertise. Lastly, we secured another High-Voltage Coolant Heater Program with a major European premium OEM. This program launches in 2023 for both hybrid and battery electric vehicle applications. These three programs are great examples of revenue that supports our strong backlog through 2023. On Slide 8, I would like to summarize the key points of our planned acquisition of Delphi Technologies. First and foremost, it will strengthen our leadership position in electrified propulsion systems, as we gain scale, expertise and capabilities in electronics at a time when the industry is moving toward electrification. At the same time, it would enhance our combustion, commercial vehicle and aftermarket businesses, driving an even better market balance for us. The combined company would offer a comprehensive portfolio of industry-leading products and systems across propulsion types. As we bring our offering together, I know we will be better positioned than ever before to meet our customers' evolving needs it is not just the strategic fit we are excited about, we believe the financial benefits are also compelling as we expect this transaction to have significant synergies and to be meaningfully accretive. We are confident that this transaction will deliver enhanced returns for stockholders, both in the near term and long into the future. I would like to highlight a sampling of the mid-term revenue synergies opportunities from the Delphi Technologies acquisitions on Slide 9. As part of our due diligence work, the sales and engineering teams from both BorgWarner and Delphi Technologies focused on identifying the key customers where we expect to pursue modular solutions for various hybrid and electric programs. Within this customer list, we then drilled down to hybrid and electric programs that are likely to be awarded by these customers over the next 18 to 24 months. What you see on the Slides are the top-15 programs that we identified as our priority pursuits post-closing. A vast majority of these programs are expected to launch in the 2024 to 2025 timeframe. There are three takeaways from this slide that I would like to highlight. First, the size of the list reinforces our view that the opportunities in electrification are accelerating. We believe the revenue opportunities are significant, with these programs alone representing $0.7 billion in potential additional revenue by 2025 and growing to $1.3 billion by 2027. It is this size and acceleration of these opportunities that supports our view that the acquisition of Delphi Technologies is not only supportive but accretive to our long-term growth outlook. Before I turn it over to Kevin, let me summarize our 2019 results and long-term outlook. We exceeded our expectations for revenue growth and margins. We delivered strong free cash flow. We are taking the necessary cost actions to maintain our margin profile and overall competitiveness. We continue to see strong demand for our products, as evidenced by our new program wins and strong net new business backlog. It is the operational and financial strength of this company that allows us to execute a transaction like the planned acquisition of Delphi Technologies that will help support our long-term revenue outgrowth. Now, over to you, Kevin. Kevin Nowlan : Thank you, Fred, and good morning, everyone. Before I review the financials in detail, I would like to provide a quick overview of the two key drivers of our fourth quarter results. First, our revenue outgrowth was ahead of our expectations at 850 basis points in the quarter. This was driven primarily by higher volumes of new programs in China and stronger than expected diesel related revenue in Europe. Second, our margin performance was ahead of our guidance, driven by better than expected sales and our focus on cost management actions. Let's turn to Slide 10. As we look at our Q4 year-over-year revenue walk, you can see the impact from the thermostat divestiture we executed in early 2019. Additionally, you can see that the stronger U.S. dollar reduced revenue by about 2% from a year ago. Excluding these items, our organic sales were up 2.6% despite the 5.9% decline in industry production. This is the 850 basis points of market outgrowth, and importantly, this outgrowth occurred in all of the major light vehicle markets around the globe. In Europe, our light vehicle organic revenue was up low-single digits on strong new programs, as well as better-than-expected diesel-related revenue. And in China, we grew high teens over the market. Partially offsetting the strength in our light vehicle outgrowth, our commercial vehicle and off-highway businesses declined relative to last year, resulting in 100 basis point drag on growth. But that is already netted in our reported 850 basis points of outgrowth. Overall, we are pleased that we continue to deliver revenue outgrowth even in this challenging market environment. Now, let's look at our adjusted operating income performance, which can be found on Slide 11. Q4 adjusted operating income was $340 million compared to $323 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. Our adjusted operating margin was 13.3%, up compared to 12.5% in the fourth quarter of 2018. On a comparable basis, adjusted operating income increased $27 million on $67 million of higher sales, which translates to an incremental margin of 40%. The result was ahead of our guidance and our typical conversion rate of 15% due to our cost management actions and lower R&D spending compared to the same quarter in 2018. Adjusted earnings per share was $1.15 for the quarter. The $0.06 decline in adjusted earnings per share compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 was driven by lower equity and affiliates earnings, higher corporate costs and a higher tax rate. Moving to cash flow. We are proud of the fact that we delivered a strong result for the fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter, we generated $221 million of free cash flow, which drove our full-year free cash flow of $699 million. This was well ahead of our guidance and a great result as we continue to focus on cash generation as a management team. Let's turn to Slide 12, where you can see our perspective on industry production for 2020. Overall, we expect that the challenging industry conditions will continue into the new calendar year. On a full-year basis, we expect the market to decline, to be in the minus 2% to minus 4% range. By region, we are planning for China to be down anywhere from 1% to 5% on a full-year basis, as we expect customer demand to remain under pressure. Europe is expected to be down 2% to 5% as our customers maneuver through 2020 CO2 emissions targets. And in North America, we expect a modest 1% to 2% decline. However, as you'll see in a moment, we expect to continue to outgrow the market in 2020, based on continued strong demand for our products. So, let's discuss our full-year guidance on Slide 13, which excludes the potential impact of the pending Delphi Technologies acquisition. Our guidance is based on the end market assumptions that I just reviewed with global production being down 2% to 4%. Despite that, we expect organic revenue to be in the range of down only 2.5% to up 0.5%. That is because we continue to expect to drive total market outgrowth of 150 to 250 basis points. Embedded in that our growth range is 100 basis point headwind from declining commercial vehicle volumes, which means that our light vehicle outgrowth is expected to be 250 to 350 basis points. With these organic growth assumptions, we expect 2020 revenue to be in the range of $9.75 billion to $10.075 billion. Our adjusted operating margin is expected to be in the range of 11.6% to 12%. The 10 to 50 basis point decrease in our margin outlook relative to 2019, reflects normal detrimental margins on declining sales and a year-over-year increase in R&D spending, which is expected to largely offset the benefit of any restructuring savings in the year. For the full-year adjusted EPS, our guidance range is $3.85 to $4.15 per diluted share. And finally, we are targeting free cash flow of $675 million to $725 million, which at the midpoint is flat year-over-year despite lower earnings and an expected increase in capital spending to support our future growth. That is because of the cash savings related to the elimination of our asbestos liabilities back in October and lower working capital given the lower revenue outlook. That is our 2020 outlook. Let's now look at our longer-term view of revenue with a snapshot of our updated multi-year backlog on Slide 14. As you can see, we expect to deliver revenue outgrowth across combustion, hybrid and electric vehicles. More specifically, we see an increased content on electrified vehicles accounting for more than 100% of our light vehicle net new business backlog over the coming years. Within this, we expect over 20% of our net backlog will be related to vehicles with electric propulsion systems, and we expect our hybrid related revenue to continue to be supported by hybrid system solutions, as well as increased penetration of our combustion products on hybrid vehicles. And from a regional perspective, we see outgrowth in all of our major markets. On a cumulative basis, our 2020 to 2023 backlog is expected to be within a range of roughly $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion. Now, you'll notice that the 2020 backlog is down about $350 million from last year's disclosure. This is primarily due to two main factors. First, expected industry volumes adjusted for the regional exposure of our backlog are more than 15% lower than our expectations from a year ago. That lowered the backlog by approximately $125 million. Second, the pull forward of volume into 2019, which drove our outsized light vehicle outgrowth of 950 basis points in Q4, is creating a $140 million year-over-year headwind. When you then look ahead to 2021 to 2023, we expect the combined net new business backlog of $2.1 billion. Importantly, we believe this backlog supports an average outgrowth of roughly 500 basis points during this timeframe, which we feel very confident in. Let me summarize our financial results. Overall, we had a really solid year and finished with the results that exceeded the top end of our previous guidance range across the board, 12.1% adjusted operating margin, 530 basis points of market outgrowth, $4.13 of adjusted EPS and $699 million of free cash flow. As a management team, we are taking the necessary actions to maintain our company's historically strong margin profile and to strengthen our free cash flow generation. We will continue to do this while balancing the need to manage a very difficult near-term market environment with the need to continue taking the necessary steps to solidify the company's future profitable growth. With that, I would like to turn the call back over to Pat. Patrick Nolan : Sharon, we are ready to open up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] First question comes from John Murphy with Bank of America. John Murphy : Good morning, guys. I have got a bunch of questions, but I will try to keep it brief here. The growth over market discussion is one obviously is pretty favorable to you given where you are in the vehicle. But I'm just curious as, as you think about your backlog and where it is focusing in the powertrain, I mean, is it a potentially if the market falters on volumes a bit more, that your growth above market might expand just given the stickiness from a regulatory perspective as well as sort of a market demand perspective for what you are delivering to the market and your technology? I'm just trying to understand. Because it seems like that is what is happened more recently and it seems that that is very possible or likely going forward. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : I think that this is the beauty of the strategy of being balanced across combustion, hybrid, electric, having the right portfolio and capitalizing from electrification acceleration, but also having great products on the combustion side that see additional take rate, within the combustion and also within hybrid. John Murphy : Okay. But I mean, but it does seem like Fred, that this outgrowth may expand if volumes come down just because these aren't the kind of products that are discretionary or would get pushed out. Is that a reasonably fair statement? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : You never know. For example, diesel, diesel surprised us in Q4. And even if we don't think that this is a trend, those outgrowth from a quarter-over-quarter look is very, very tricky. So, I'm very confident with us marching toward the 500 basis points outgrowth mid-term. We have done that last year. This year, if you exclude the pre-buy and if you look at light vehicle will be at 440, and it is not going to be 500 exactly every year. But we are within that range and the backlog supports that 500 basis points outgrowth. John Murphy : Okay, great. And then maybe just one follow-up. Given that some time has passed since the acquisition of Delphi. So, I'm just curious if you have any incremental customer feedback? And if we think about what you are discussing on Slide 9 with the focus pursuit opportunities, is that sort of just early days in what you are identifying and that you are reasonably confident is a target? And how should we think about sort of win rates when you get into these very focused pursued opportunities? Are they similar to sort of typical win rates as you are going after programs or might be higher just given what you are delivering to the customers? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : Yes, feedback from customers is firstly saying, Hey, we understand the product, we understand the technology.\" And when you look at Slide 9, those are real programs and its significant revenue opportunity for us. So, I think customers are really liking the technology fit and this unique positioning that we will be able to have having mechanical rotating electrics and electronics at scale. John, I think it is a bit early to talk about win rates. But we feel good about the number of programs and the size of those programs. John Murphy : Okay. And then just one housekeeping real quick on Slide 6. I think this is all BorgWarner specific rationalization and restructuring, it has nothing to do with the combination at this point, is that correct? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : It has nothing to do with the combination with Delphi Technologies, total independent. John Murphy : Great. Thank you very much. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : Thank you, John. Operator : Next question comes from Joe Spak with RBC Capital Markets. Joseph Spak : Good morning, everyone. I wanted to dive in a little bit to the backlog and a greater than 100% of the growth coming from electric. So, sort of implies a declining ICE business even if you are sort of outgrowing, I guess, underlying ICE. But, and that is all sort of great and that sort of drives that outperformance on the top line. But how do you think about the margins over that time period? Because you have the high margin legacy business declining, the new electric business ramping. Like, does this restructuring savings of $90 million to $100 million, is that enough to sort of have you sort of hold core BorgWarner margins over that 2023 time period? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : Yes, I would say that we run the business with return on invested capital. We don't see any differences, whether it is combustion, hybrid, electric. We are, as you have seen accelerating our restructuring program, and in order to be proactively mitigating risks that may happen. In this industry, things happen. And so, we are absolutely committed and confident that we can maintain the high level of margin that we have and the current margin profile. That is what we do in the restructuring program also. Joseph Spak : Okay. I guess the second question and maybe sort of as an update. Like, do you have any refreshed views now that was for the year further into this on the electric traction motors, I think you have been saying you expect like 50% in-source and outsource. Is there any movement there? And I guess the reason I ask is, we have seen some other companies like [Nivac] (Ph) sort of really investing here. I think they had a comment, which said they are aiming for 35% share. I'm not sure exactly what they mean by that. But if only 50% are outsource, then they are talking like 70%. So, I don't know if you have sort of seen any change there on how the market develops, anything changing on the competitive front? And, I guess also, do you need to potentially partner with an automaker in a more structured fashion on the motor side? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : We see movement going both ways from customers around the world. Some that wanted to make motors are actually outsourcing motors and vice versa. But we feel that the 50% in-source versus outsource is about right. Joseph Spak : Okay. And is there a benefit to having a more formal structured program with potential customer? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : I will say that we never say no, but this is not the path we are on. Joseph Spak : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Next question comes from Rod Lache with Wolfe Research. Rod Lache : Good morning, everybody. Just two things. One is, I would like to better understand how we should be thinking about this restructuring. You pointed out that it is there to sustain margin, it is not incremental. And I suspect that the Street is going to be speculating on the reasons why, which could include incremental price pressure, lower margins on new technologies, shrinking ICE, higher R&D or maybe some other assumptions. So, maybe just first, like, talk to us about what is different now in this environment that this additional restructuring doesn't accrete to the margins? And then also how much of the restructuring is cash? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : Rod, I will answer then I will turn it over to Kevin for giving you more color on cash. We all have been in this business for a long time. I have been in this business more than 30 years and things happen. You have to be proactive in those restructuring efforts. You have to implement proactive risk mitigation. We talked a little bit about pricing pressure coming from the towable side of our business. We don't see it worsening, but it is still the case. We are maintaining a very, very strong return on invested capital discipline. But the need of being competitive and the need of maintaining an overall long-term competitiveness is necessary. And that is why we do those proactive action. Kevin Nowlan : And I will comment on the last piece and maybe just to add to that. We as a company pride ourselves on the sustained strong margin profile we have had over a long period of time. I mean, 7 consecutive years of north of 12% operating margin. We take a lot of pride in being a top tier supplier from that perspective. And part of it is taking the proactive steps necessary to be able to sustain that margin over the long term. In terms of your question about cash, the amounts that we quoted on there, the $275 million to $300 million range that we provided is the potential restructuring cash cost. Rod Lache : Got you. And then just secondly, it is noteworthy that Europe, which appears to be the epicenter of CO2 regulation right now, only accounts for 10% of the company's backlog. And I was hoping you can give us a little bit more color on what you see going on there. What that backlog would look like if you sort of ignored the decline in diesel? And of these opportunities that you are outlining on Slide 9, any color on how that is kind of splits regionally? Kevin Nowlan : Yes, sure. When you look at that backlog and you see Europe at 10%, keep in mind this is the net backlog. So, it is pluses and minuses in there. And one of the big minuses, clearly, that we continue to have in the European business is the impact of diesel. And so, we are overcoming that with this backlog because it is net of the diesel headwind. The diesel headwind, I think you should think into totality being about 20 points impact on the backlog. Now, if diesel we are sustaining itself there, there'd be some offset on the gas side, but not completely. But that is about a 20 point headwind purely associated with the diesel portfolio. Rod Lache : What does that mean, 20 points, Kevin? Kevin Nowlan : In isolation, if I don't assume any offsets in gas or other things, if I just look at how much lower the backlog is as a result of diesel coming down, it is about 20 points. Rod Lache : Okay. The 20%, it would be 20% higher? Or 20 percentage points higher than that 10% if it wasn't for that you are saying? Kevin Nowlan : Yes. I would say really focused on the turbo side in particular. But there would be offset on the gas side as well, not one for one, but there would be an offset. But that is the gross impact of diesel, correct. Rod Lache : Got you. All right, thank you. Operator : Next question comes from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Noah Kaye : Thanks very much. I want to follow back on the color you provided around the opportunities, joint opportunities you could pursue with Delphi. I guess given your expectations for the closing to occur in the back half of the year, and first of all, still verifying that the case. If some of these programs are going to be awarded relatively soon, subsequently to that, how quickly do you feel you can move in collaboration to capitalize and actually close on some of those opportunities? And maybe if you could explain why you think the integration could be relatively fast? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : I think, Noah, our ability to move quickly is certainly the goal. The key is that we have identified the focus pursuits and we'd be able to move very swiftly once we can. It is not going to be something that is going to take a long time. We are understanding what we need. The technology from a relative perspective is state-of-the-art and we will be able to move quickly. We both have world-class product that we marry very well which other. Noah Kaye : Okay, that is helpful. Obviously, you provided some color in the prepared remarks around the reduction to the 2020 backlog and part of that is a pull forward. For the part of it that is just a pure reduction, the adjustment in volume down 15%, I'm just wondering within that, is any of that related to lower expectations for EV and Hybrid relative to the past? But I think in 2019, we did see a bit more softness than expected. Just wondering how you think about the impact of the EV and hybrid trajectory now relative to maybe where you saw it last year? Kevin Nowlan : Yes, I will start with that and maybe I will ask Fred to comment on the hybrid and electric trajectory in total. But the number we quoted there in terms of the 15% down is purely markets. So, if you look at what our 2020 expectations were a year ago at this time versus where we are sitting today, I mean, based on what is happened in 2019 and then in 2020, China is down 25% from those expectations, North America is down about 6% and Europe is down about 10%. So, the blended impact of purely production on the backlog and our mix of the backlog relative to those production levels coming down is about 15%. And that has nothing to do with how we see combustion hybrid over electric. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : Yes. We see, as I mentioned, we see an acceleration in electrified propulsion architecture. Not only that, but our hybrid programs that we are targeting as we speak. But those programs won't impact the backlog. It will start after. Noah Kaye : Okay, great. And just if I could sneak one more in. You provided color on the cadence of benefit from restructuring. Can you give any color on the cadence of the actual cash outlays for the restructuring program? Kevin Nowlan : Yes. I think, I mean, we still haven't finalized all those plans. We are still working through the - taking the appropriate steps that we need to before we actually firm up some of these plants. So, there is a little bit of potential timing uncertainty, I will say, in terms of when the cash comes in. But I think you should think in our cash flow planning guidance for this year, we are probably in the $50 million to $100 million range from a cash restructuring perspective. Noah Kaye : Okay. Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from Brian Johnson with Barclays. Brian Johnson : Yes, thank you very much. I want to drill in a few things around the backlog. First, and I think I know the answer, but just given the record. [indiscernible] I think you made that distinction in the past. Is there anything around CV we should know? Second, I'm just trying to get my head around the pull forward of backlog into 2019. Was it launch schedules, launch volume, can you explain that? And also, is there any split between Drivetrain and Engine we have to be aware of? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : Okay. So, last year, the backlog [indiscernible] that CV was going to be flat. I missed the second part of your question, Brian. I apologize. Brian Johnson : The pull forward effect, could you explain just mechanically how that worked? Kevin Nowlan : Well, I think what we are saying about the pull forward is - remember, when we are looking at the backlog measure like this, we are looking at a year-over-year basis. And so, the fact that we saw 950 basis points of light vehicle outgrowth in the fourth quarter is something we weren't anticipating. And so, if you look at the annual effect of that on 2020 as you are doing a year-over-year comparison, that creates probably about $140 million impact on the backlog. Brian Johnson : Okay. Was that meaning some programs are partially launched in 2019 and also continuing their launch into 2020 had higher 2019 volumes, so that is a headwind for 2020, if you will? Kevin Nowlan : Effectively and get our backlog and revenue outgrowth in the year-over-year. So, the jump off point for the comparative period is that much higher, which we didn't anticipate as we entered 2019, it came in a lot stronger. So, for the full-year, we delivered 530 basis points of outgrowth, 580 on a light vehicle basis, and that was well above what we were guiding to throughout the year. Now, as we head into 2020, that is a year-over-year headwind as you do a comparison of your backlog in 2020 versus 2019. Brian Johnson : Okay. And then the Drivetrain segment margins hit an all-time high. How sustainable is that likely or are there kind of one time meant to be true-ups that we need to be aware of? Kevin Nowlan : Yes. I mean, I think, both segment saw pretty strong margins in the fourth quarter. I don't view fourth quarter margins is necessarily something you should expect quarter-to-quarter. We typically have strong results in the fourth quarter driven by certain things with respect to supply chain recoveries that oftentimes come in later in the year, performance initiatives, as well as we had quite a bit in the way of R&D customer recoveries, which came in the fourth quarter across both segments, which is part of the reason you saw net R&D down. And those tend to be lumpier toward the back half of the year than the front half. So as we jump into the new year, we are very focused on sustaining our strong margin profile. But I don't think you should think of that margin in Q4 as the jump off point for 2020. Brian Johnson : Okay, thanks. Operator : Next question comes from David Leiker with Baird. Erin Welcenbach : Good morning. This is Erin Welcenbach on for David. So, my first question relates to the backlog. I'm just wondering if you could kind of bridge the gap in terms of how you presented backlog in the past versus kind of this new presentation? So, I guess, said another way, how much of the three year backlog of the $2.1 billion from 2021 to 2023 is coming into 2023? I guess how would that compare to the kind of the $2.2 billion that you had last year for kind of the three year backlog figure? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : I would say that this is consistent with the 500 basis-point average outgrowth year-over-year. I wouldn't see any change in the way we are presenting things. I'm not sure -. Erin Welcenbach : I guess you have, call it, $475 million in backlog hitting in 2020 and then another $2.1 billion over the three year period after that. So I guess I'm wondering kind of the 2020 to 2022 rate would be if there is any acceleration in 2023 if that is essentially consistent in terms of the cadence of outgrowth? Kevin Nowlan : No, I mean I think we are expecting that we are going to deliver 500 basis points on average over that three year period. Some years might be a little higher, a little lower. There is not dramatic differences between any one of those given years in the backlog period. But right now, we are looking at sustaining that 500 basis points each year over the three year horizon. Erin Welcenbach : Okay. And then my second question is just related to the Corona Virus in China. So, I'm wondering if you are seeing any disruption in your supply chain that could potentially spread into operations in Europe and North America as well as just your Asian operation? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : Yes. I will start by saying that on this we are focusing on our people and making sure that this is the first and foremost focus that we have. And from an operation standpoint, Kevin, do you want to say a few words? Kevin Nowlan : Yes. And just so you understand what is in our guidance, I mean, our guidance effectively reflects the production disruptions we have seen to date both through end of January and first couple of weeks of February. As you look beyond that, there is obviously still a lot of uncertainty in terms of how that plays out. We have some of our production facilities running and some are not right now. Our China business is about $1 billion annually in revenue, which means it is about $35 million a week. So, if production disruptions continue through the back end of February and into March, there could be additional pressure on our China revenue. But I think you touched on an important point, how could that spillover to Europe and North America? I think that is a big unknown. And the longer there is production disruption in China, the more risk it poses on OE production across the globe. So, there is a lot of uncertainty around that at the moment. We will continue to monitor this day-to-day and week-to-week. But that type of production disruption, because of the uncertainty is not embedded in our guidance at the moment, just the disruptions we have seen to-date. Erin Welcenbach : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Operator : Next question comes from Chris McNally with Evercore. Chris McNally : Thanks so much guys. Maybe just a variance of some of the questions that have already been asked. I guess, Fred, what people are trying to figure out is for maybe 2021 compared to 2020 on the backlog growth, the way that you used to guide, should we think about 2021 backlog being better than 2020? And if we can, could we just maybe go through some of the areas of outgrowth taking commercial vehicles? And I'm putting it on the side for now. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : I would say that the average 500 basis points is a good way to get it. Maybe some color I can give you is some product breakdown from the backlog. So, 30% of the backlog is transmission products including DCTs and PX modules for hybrids. So, another 30% is all-wheel drive and couplings on combustion and hybrid, 20% is rotating electric component, which I think is very important, 5% is high voltage cabin and battery heaters, and 5% is turbos for gas and hybrid. Now, the big diesel impact. So, that is maybe some color that we have for you. Kevin Nowlan : And Chris, let me just clarify to 2020, because I know a lot of us are focused on the headline number we have talked about a 150 to 250 basis points of revenue outgrowth. I mean, keep in mind in that is a 100 basis points of headwind associated with commercial vehicle, just with markets and from our perspective being down about 7% year-over-year. So, the light vehicle outgrowth embedded in our 2020 guide is 250 to 350 basis points. But that, again, as I was talking about in response to Brian's question, that is being impacted by the pull forward we saw in the Q4, the significant outgrowth in Q4 which is creating year-over-year headwind. Without that Q4 pull forward, our light vehicle outgrowth in 2020 would be between 400 and 500 basis points. A little bit lower than the 500 we are guiding to as being on average over 2021 to 2023, but not significantly different. So, I think you have to walk that 150 to 250 we are guiding to in totality and adjust for those two effects to understand how to really think about 2020 and put it in the context of the 2023 guide. Chris McNally : Absolutely, guys. I think that makes sense. So, the 400 to 530 for 2020 becomes something like 700 on average for specifically light vehicle 2021 to 2023. And Fred, I think it is fair to say that - I appreciate the bucketed color. That is very, very helpful. But one of the things that we should think about is that there is an assumption that particularly for China that the NEV market will have a better 2021 than 2020, as you mentioned sort of estimates have been revised significantly over the last 6 to 9 months? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : I don't think you should think about anything north of 500 basis points year-over-year past 2020. So, I'm not sure how you are computing 700 plus basis points that you mentioned. Chris McNally : No, that 700 is just $700 million. The $2.1 billion divided by -. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : Yes, I'm sorry. Yes, you said [Technical Difficulty] yes. And so in this backlog we have no CV growth. We have no growth embedded into the backlog. After 2020 we can see the CV flat. Chris McNally : Okay, perfect. And it is quite clear. And then just another quick one on Q1. I totally understand you are sort of somewhat driving in the dark given where we are in the quarter and low visibility. But how should we think about - is this the type of thing we are not going to get an update until Q1 reports, then the full-year guide would have to incorporate the situation in China? Just any rule of thumb for how long if facilities stay down or any rule of thumb for sensitivity on China? Because I guess investors are all dealing with the same thing. And it is the same for every supplier, company, but we are all watching the week-to-week in China with sort of bated breath. Kevin Nowlan : Yes, with respect to that, because I think it just depends on how this plays out over the coming weeks. I think, as you think about our China business, remember, it is about $1.08 billion in revenue on an annualized basis, which is about $35 million a week in revenue. And so, as we look ahead, we actually have eight or nine production facilities there, some of them are open, some of them aren't right now. If the production disruption continues through the end of the month, there is that risk to the China revenue. But the bigger risk could be longer term if this extends into end of February and into March, does it spill over and have effects on OE production around the globe. Because the OEs undoubtedly rely on China production, not just from us, but from other suppliers as well. And I think that is where we continue to watch it day-to-day, week-to-week. And we will have more to update once we get through the end of the quarter. Chris McNally : Okay, great. Thanks so much guys. Operator : Next question comes from Armintas Sinkevicius with Morgan Stanley. Armintas Sinkevicius : Great. Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. When I look at the reported results you have for 2019 and I look at the pre-announced results from Delphi, and then I add those two up to get plus the $125 million of synergies that you are looking for with the deal, the $120 million $130 million of incremental cost savings beyond 2019 that you have outlined in the slides, and then $150 million program that they are engaged with. As a pro forma taking the 2019 pro forma, I get about 13.4% margins for 2019. And, yes, you are guiding to 11% margins with the combined company. So, there is a bit of a gap there. And I was hoping you could talk through, is this conservatism or are there some headwinds that you are thinking through that would drive the combined margin to 11%? Kevin Nowlan : Yes, I will take that. The first thing I think you have to also remember is there is amortization of purchase price amortization of intangibles, that is a piece of the equation as well, which I think we guided to be about $65 million to $75 million on a pre-tax basis. That number obviously would be finalized once we get the closing. But I think you also have to realize that flows through operating margin. And so, that is a headwind to margin. When you look at Delphi Technologies and what they have talked about from a restructuring perspective, our perspective on that was they have a good program in place in terms of addressing some of the margin issues in the business, but our belief is that they are going to meet some of those restructuring actions to be able to sustain their margin profile as opposed to being purely additive to their margin profile. And then as you look at our restructuring initiatives, as Fred mentioned, we view those as proactive measures to address risks that could pop up in the business. Couldn't tell you even sitting here today what those might be. But then, we are taking proactive measures opportunistically today to make sure we sustain our strong margin profile long into the future. So, that is why we are not looking at it and saying, we will just add that to our current margin performance. We view that it is potentially going to be something that we need to do to sustain that strong margin profile we have had for a long period of time. Armintas Sinkevicius : Okay. And then, so essentially what you are saying is there is nothing embedded with regards to product transitions going from combustion, where you have higher scale to electric, where the scale would be building up over time? Kevin Nowlan : No, I would say there is nothing I would say from a product mix perspective that stands out that causes us to say : \"Wow, this is $90 million to $100 million of profit improvement, we need to offset that. But we just know there is risk inherent in this industry that Fred has been managing a lot longer than I have. But we thought it was the right time in this challenging end market environment to take actions prudently and proactively to position ourselves for long-term competitiveness. Armintas Sinkevicius : Okay. Appreciate it. Operator : Next question comes from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Ryan Brinkman : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions, which are really around China backlog, given that it is now 50% of the total. So, firstly, have you broken out the China split for 2020 specifically, or could you? And secondly, is China backlog still largely driven by DCT etc.? Or do you see electrification starting to become the bigger driver, including with the iDM win in 2021? And then just lastly, to the extent there is downside risk to China backlog, that is simply because there is just the market could be lower, or are you seeing any signs that automakers in the current environment could maybe delay new program launches like they have done sometimes before when the market was softer? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : So, within the China backlog we are actually having nice backlog across combustion, hybrid and electric. If the backlog would go down, we will be more to market. And we don't see announced delays at this point in time. Ryan Brinkman : Okay, great. Thanks. And then just a follow-up on that earlier question about Europe backlog and it being so much lower than the current revenue in terms of share. The diesel explanation was there. I just wanted to understand that you feel like you are getting your share of electrification content over the near and medium term in Europe, and how that is looking given - it seems like the market is accelerating in that direction over there. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : Yes, I would say that the majority of our Europe acceleration is going to be post 2023, with less represented in the full-year results, slight hybrid and will be way more represented in [indiscernible] and high voltage hybrid systems. Ryan Brinkman : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from Dan Levy with Credit Suisse. Dan Levy : Hi, good morning. Thank you. Had a couple of questions on restructuring, please. One, the first one is, one of the points that we see in the restructuring related to turbos, you mentioned here that you'll be closing technical centers, which probably means reduced R&D. So does the reduced R&D in any way threaten the turbo penetration opportunity? Or really is the view that there is still more than enough engineering footprint in place to drive continued gas turbo penetration? And how much of that footprint reduction simply relates to diesel which just isn't necessary anymore? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : I think we are taking a companywide approach on the restructuring. The consolidation of R&D centers or closure or continuation is doesn't mean that we are going to obviously and automatically reduce R&D in those fields. We feel good about our 4% to 4.5% of R&D as a percentage of sales. Some product lines have more than others, which is I think a good way to manage the portfolio, good way to manage the business. So again, it is companywide and it is not focused in one region in particular. Dan Levy : Got it. And then the second question just on managing the deal alongside the Delphi - managing the restructuring alongside Delphi. You have your own restructuring plan, Delphi has its own restructuring plan. Could you just talk about the ability to concurrently manage your restructuring plan alongside the Delphi plan once it is closed? Are two restructuring processes twice as challenging or are there synergies, so to speak, in concurrently running two restructuring processes concurrently? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : They are pretty comp optimized. We have our own and they have their own and it does not interfere with each other. Project Pioneer is more focused into tech center consolidation from the Delphi technology standpoint. We have done our own from an SG&A standpoint that we announced back in April. And the one that we are talking about is more looking at cost of goods sold in some areas of the business. And so, it is, one way to look at it is really looking at it that they are disjointed. Dan Levy : Great, thank you. Operator : Next question comes from Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank. Emmanuel Rosner : Hi, good morning. First question is on the potential revenue synergies highlighted on Slide 9. Can you just conceptually explain for us again where do the revenue synergies come from? My understanding was that before your acquisition of Delphi, you guys were already bidding for complete drive module on electrification side, you are already winning some. And then similarly, obviously, Delphi has been winning some very good business on the power electronics side. So, when you think about these revenue synergies, what is that you are actually able to accomplish in addition to that? Or was there like specific technology that you needed to take you to the next level? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : No, Emmanuel, I think it is fairly clear that the combination of Delphi Technologies and us from a mechanical motor, power electronics, puts us in a position that we can sort of - customers around the globe who won system. And on that Page 9, we are talking about customers who won system. So, with their world-class motor control and our world-class motor on transmission, it puts us in a position to accelerate those systems in a system revenue synergies. This just makes our product offering better, faster and at scale. Emmanuel Rosner : Understood. And then a follow-up question on the backlog and its potential impact of its mix on margin. When I look at the breakdown that you gave by product, it feels like an overwhelming portion of the backlog would come from drivetrain versus Engine, which obviously is intuitive since it is electrification. Obviously, these have been businesses that have a considerably lower margin profile than what is going on in the powertrain. So, as you launch this, do you have sort of a natural a pressure on margin from launching businesses that have lower margin than the stuff that is actually rolling off? And I'm interested, in particular, on your earlier answer around focusing on ROIC. Are you essentially saying that even though those businesses may have a lower reported margin, the ROIC is still comparable? So, we may see margin compression, but not return compression? Kevin Nowlan : I wouldn't think about it that way. I mean, I think you are right. The backlog is disproportionate to the Drivetrain business, that is absolutely the case and that is by design of how we have been growing the company, particularly in the H&E products. But I think the incrementals, as you think about the two businesses are fairly comparable. I think we have just started from a lower base, especially as we have been investing in the Drivetrain product portfolio. So, I think as we increment on the incremental revenue, I think you should expect that it is going to have similar types of incrementals that you would expect for the company in total. And from an ROIC perspective, yes, we manage the business the same way we drive for similar levels of ROIC. We are pretty disciplined about that in all the appropriation request that Fred and I review, whether it is a Drivetrain program or an Engine program. Emmanuel Rosner : Great. Thanks for the color. Operator : We have time for one final question and that question comes from James Picariello with KeyBanc Capital. James Picariello : Hi, just asking about this revenue funnel. Could you just give a sense like what portion of these 15 OEs would represent a true Greenfield opportunities in terms of the relationship potential for BorgWarner? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : Greenfield, meaning that it would not be a customer we currently work with? James Picariello : Or the relationship would just be dramatically enhanced, I would consider that Greenfield as well. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : There is not too many customers we don't work with around the globe. But due to maybe the size, that would certainly enhance the relationship of the customer we would do business with. First of all, the product offering would certainly enhance the relationship and so winning. James Picariello : Okay. That is fair. And regarding the restructuring plan outlined here today, is any of this earmarked for the engineering and development spend that you'll likely need to put forth as you win future electrified propulsion awards? Kevin Nowlan : I mean I guess you can see already in 2020, we are anticipating an increase in R&D investment in the year, up $30 plus million, if you look at the midpoint of our guidance. And that is using some of the savings or basically offsetting some of the savings that we are anticipating in 2020 coming from restructuring. But that doesn't mean we are anticipating permanent step-ups from there even in R&D. I think when we look at the restructuring initiatives in the savings, we are simply being proactive to guard against the risk, whether it is increased R&D over time, whether it was something else that popped up in the business that we didn't anticipate. But I would say sitting here today, we continue to expect that we will manage R&D in that low to mid 4% range going forward. And that is the right way to think about the business. James Picariello : Okay. Thanks guys. Patrick Nolan : I would like to thank you all for your great questions today. With that, Sharon, you can close the call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BorgWarner 2020 First Quarter Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions].  I would now like to turn the call over to Patrick Nolan, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Nolan, you may begin your conference. Patrick Nolan : Thank you, Sharon. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us today. We issued our earnings release earlier this morning. It's posted on our website borgwarner.com, on our homepage and on our Investor Relations homepage. Before we begin, I need to inform you that during this call we may make forward-looking statements, which involves risks and uncertainties detailed in our 10-K. Our actual results may differ significantly from the matters discussed today. During today's presentation, we'll highlight certain non-GAAP measures in order to provide a clearer picture of how the core business performed and for comparison purposes with prior periods. When you hear us say, \"On a comparable basis,\" that means excluding the impact of FX, net M&A and other non-comparable items. When you hear us say, \"Adjusted,\" that means excluding non-comparable items. When you hear us say, \"Organic,\" that means excluding the impact of FX and net M&A. We will also refer to our growth compared to our market. When you hear us say \"Market,\" that means the change in light vehicle production weighted for our geographic exposure. Our outgrowth is defined as our organic revenue change versus the market.  Please note that we have posted our earnings call presentation to the IR page of our website. We encourage you to follow along with the slides during our discussion. With that, I'm happy to turn the call over to Fred. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : Thank you, Pat. And good morning, everyone. We're very pleased to share our results for the first quarter and provide an overall company update. Let me start with the highlights of the first quarter on Slide 5. While the industry production rates were clearly volatile during the quarter, we performed strongly on a relative basis with approximately $2.3 billion in sales, we were down about 8.1% organically and this compares to our market being down almost 20%. This means we drove significant outgrowth. In fact, for the quarter, we saw double-digit outgrowth in all major regions. Our decremental margin was approximately 26% in the quarter as our margin performance was impacted by COVID-19 related shutdowns. Given the pace at which the shutdowns occurred, we think this is a relatively good outcome. We delivered strong free cash flow of $146 million for the quarter providing an additional cash cushion as we manage through the lower production levels expected in the second quarter. Lastly, I am proud on how the team has reacted to this challenging environment. We met the challenges of managing orderly production shutdowns at our facilities in Europe and North America, while also managing production ramp-ups in China. Let's now turn to Slide 6, where you can see our perspective on the global industry production. Overall, we expect a very challenging environment in 2020, especially in the second quarter. On the full-year basis, we expect the market decline to be in the minus 25% to minus 31% range. Looking at this decline by region, we're planning for Europe to be down in the 29% to 38% range. In North America, we expect 27% to 35% decline. On the relative basis, the outlook for China is stronger as their shutdown in Q1 was shorter than what we're seeing in the other two geographies, but we still expect 18% to 21% decline in China production for the full-year. As you'll see from the line chart showing our different scenarios, Q1 is the quarter which has the largest expected production declines and at the same time the most uncertainty. The biggest drivers for these declines and the significant uncertainty are the timing of production restarts and the pace of industry production ramps. Under our high-end scenario, which is represented by the light green line, we're expecting Europe and North America production to largely resume by mid-May. Our low-end scenario represented by the dark blue line uses the assumption that Europe and North America will not resume production fully until mid-June. For both scenario, we expect the second half of 2020 to remain challenged due to lower consumer confidence. Visibility into the production outlook has certainly improved versus a month ago, but there is still tremendous amount of uncertainty around plant restarts, the pace of production ramp-ups and ultimately consumer demand. We're maintaining a very active dialogue with our customers and suppliers in order to support an orderly production ramp-up and manage effectively through this challenging environment. On Slide 7, you see the cost actions that we've taken to help moderate the impact of these severe production declines. This cost action has been across all major areas of the company. We've taken temporary salary reductions in many locations throughout the world, including 20% pay cuts amongst our senior executive leadership team. Employees at many of our facilities have been put on temporary layoff due to lower production or in many locations the complete production shut down. And we also worked with our strategy third-party relationship vendors, who have in most cases agreed to share in the economics of this situation by voluntarily reducing their work or billing rates. These actions were painful, although right things to do for the financial well-being of our company. I want to thank all involved, especially our internal team members who have kept their focus and strong engagement despite the sacrifices that have been endured. The industry's next big challenge will be to successfully manage the production restart. Let's take a look at how we manage this on Slide 8. While we must be ready to supply our customers as they resume production, we are first and foremost focused on what is best in terms of health and safety of our people. We have formed a high-level task force that has and will continue to rollout our Safe Restart Program to all our global facilities. The program includes a set of 17 minimum standards and nine additional recommended best practices. However, our focus on the safety of our people will extend beyond these standards. We have already seen additional innovative safety solutions developed at the plant level. And we will continue to utilize and promote this innovation to our other facilities around the globe. It is this plant-level innovation and the appetite to share ideas that is promoted by the BorgWarner culture. Let's now turn to Slide 9. I would like to briefly comment on our Seneca, South Carolina plant, which was unfortunately struck by a tornado on April 13. Seneca is one of our largest plants supplying transfer cases to multiple OEMs in North America. Thankfully, the plant was not in operation at the time of the tornado struck, but unfortunately a security guard at the facility was killed. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family. Now I'd like to give a status update on the plant. As you can see by the picture on this slide, the level of damage varies widely. The damage to machining portion of the facility was more limited. However, on the left side of the picture you can see the roof of the final assembly areas missing. That assembly area sustained a more significant amount of damage. Over the past several weeks, there has been a tremendous amount of remediation work completed and we have also performed significant amount of equipment testing and validation and where appropriate, we have erected temporary structure.  With all of this hard work over the last three weeks, I am proud to report that the facility resumed production on May 4 and that the production rates should improve throughout the month of May. This was an amazing accomplishment. I would like to personally thank the team and Seneca for their hard work and our customers for their support. We have turned a terrible situation into a BorgWarner success story. Next, I would like to provide an update on our planned acquisition of Delphi Technologies on Slide 10. This morning, we announced that BorgWarner and Delphi Technologies agreed to an amendment of the transaction agreement. This amendment effectively cures the breach of the debt covenant that we asserted at the end of March. Under the terms of the amendment, Delphi Technologies has agreed to new closing conditions with requiring that at the time of the transaction closing its gross revolver debt cannot exceed $225 million and net of its cash balances will not exceed $115 million. In addition, the parties agreed that Delphi Technologies' net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio will not exceed a specified threshold measured at closing. This new closing condition was structured to provide Delphi with the flexibility it needs to manage through the current environment and execute on its current forecast. At the same time, they also protect BorgWarner from scenarios that could result in more significant cash usage or EBITDA deterioration.  The party also agreed to revise the purchase price. In recognition of the potential incremental debt that could be outstanding at closing, the equity exchange ratio was reduced by 5%. As a result, current BorgWarner and Delphi technology shareholders would own approximately 85% and 15% respectively of the outstanding shares of the combined company following completion of the transaction. We are pleased to put this issue behind us and turn our full undivided attention to driving towards the closing. In regards to our effort to close on this transaction, there has been a significant amount of other work done over the past several months. The integration teams continue to work very well together. The regulatory filings are in process in several geographies. And last week we closed on $750 million delayed draw term loan to support our potential financing needs at the time of closing. I am pleased with the progress as we continue to work towards the closing of the transaction in the second half of 2020. Before I turn it over to Kevin, let me summarize our first quarter results and our outlook on Slide 11. We achieved significant first quarter outgrowth in all major regions. We delivered positive free cash flow during the first quarter, and as Kevin will discuss, we expect to be free cash flow positive for the full year. BorgWarner has one of the most robust liquidity position within our industry. It is this financial strength combined with the operational discipline of the company that will allow us to successfully manage the challenges we expect throughout 2020. As I look beyond the challenges of 2020, I am confident that we remain strongly positioned both from a financial and technology standpoint to capitalize on the long-term trends that will continue to support our future profitable growth. Now over to you, Kevin. Kevin Nowlan : Thank you, Fred. And good morning everyone. Before I review the financials in detail, I'd like to highlight two overarching themes you'll see in our year-to-date results. First, our financials have been quite resilient in the face of this challenging environment. During the first quarter, we delivered strong revenue outgrowth in all regions, sustained double-digit operating margins, and generated meaningfully positive free cash flow. Second, our liquidity remains strong and has actually gotten stronger over the course of the first four months of this year. Let's turn to Slide 12. As we look at our year-over-year revenue walk for Q1, you can see the impact from the thermostat divestiture we executed in early 2019. Additionally, you can see that the stronger U.S. dollar reduced revenue by about 2% from a year ago. Excluding these items, our organic sales were down 8.1% compared to the 19.6% decline in industry production. That means we delivered revenue outgrowth of 1,150 basis points in the quarter. And importantly, that outgrowth occurred in all of the major light vehicle markets around the globe. In Europe, our light vehicle organic revenue was down mid-single digits compared to the market decline of approximately 19%. The outgrowth was driven by better than expected diesel related revenue, as well as strong new programs. In North America, we were close to flat year-over-year versus the 10% industry decline driven by new programs and strong mix. And in China, we outperformed the market by more than 20% due to the year-over-year growth in our DCT business and other new business. Overall, we're pleased that we continue to deliver revenue growth even in this challenging end-market environment. Now let's look at our adjusted operating income performance, which can be found on Slide 13. Q1 adjusted operating income was $234 million compared to $295 million a year ago. Our adjusted operating margin was 10.3%, which was down compared to the 11.5% we delivered in the first quarter of 2019. On a comparable basis adjusted operating income decreased $54 million on $205 million lower sales, which translates to a decremental margin of 26%. As you know, when markets move downward quickly we tend to see initial decrementals that could be 30% or higher just like we saw at points in time last year. So we view the 26% as a reasonably good level of performance given how quickly industry production declined. And we accomplished this objective while increasing R&D expenditures in our drivetrain segment where we're continuing to invest in our electrification portfolio. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.77 for the quarter. The $0.23 decline in adjusted earnings per share compared to the first quarter of 2019, was driven by the lower adjusted operating income. Moving to cash flow. We are proud of the fact that we delivered $146 million of positive free cash flow for the first quarter. In an environment where revenues are under pressure, it's critical to manage our working capital effectively. And in the first quarter, we did just that, which is why we were able to deliver such a great result. So let's discuss our full year revenue outlook on Slide 14. Our guidance is based on the end-market assumptions that Fred reviewed earlier with global production being down 25% to 31%. We expect to continue to drive total market outgrowth for the year, but not at the level we saw in the first quarter. Our guidance now incorporates full year outgrowth of approximately 400 basis points to 500 basis points, this assumes our outgrowth for the remainder of 2020 is in the range of 150 basis points to 250 basis points, which is in-line with our prior full year guidance. But obviously, this full year guide is higher than our initial 2020 assessment simply given how much we outperformed in the first quarter. As a result, we expect a full year 2020 organic revenue decline of 20% to 27%. And that translates to an expected 2020 revenue range of $7.25 billion to $8 billion. Let's turn to Slide 15, where you can see an update of our liquidity profile. As of March 31, we had $2.4 billion of liquidity or 24% of 2019 sales. This consisted of our quarter-end cash balance of $901 million and our undrawn revolver of $1.5 billion. You might recall that at the end of December our revolver capacity was $1.2 billion, but in the middle of March we worked with our bank group to increase the capacity to the new level thereby bolstering our liquidity by $300 million. It's also important to note that we have a leverage ratio that is more than two turns below the covenant in our revolving credit facility, which means that we have full unfettered access to the $1.5 billion facility. Adding to this, last week we entered into a 364-day delayed draw term loan facility, which provides us with an additional $750 million of liquidity. To be clear, we don't think we need this additional liquidity to manage through the current environment, instead we put this facility in place as an insurance policy to support any potential financing needs in closing related to a Delphi technology transaction. Nonetheless, the facility is available to us right now prior to any such close which simply means that we have that much more liquidity today.  Finally, while we're not providing specific earnings guidance, we did want to give you color on our free cash flow outlook. In light of our first quarter results and our success thus far in managing our working capital, we expect to generate positive free cash flow for the full year in the range of $100 million to $300 million even in the challenging environment suggested by our revenue outlook. That's a testament to the strong financial condition of the company. Our board's confidence in our financial condition was evidenced by their decision to maintain our current dividend at this time. However, I would note that given the current global macroeconomic pressures, we don't expect to be executing on our share repurchase program in the near term. So let me summarize my financial remarks. Overall, we had a solid quarter in spite of the industry pressures delivering strong outgrowth and positive free cash flow. We expect the markets to remain under tremendous pressure throughout the year down 25% to 31% from last year. Yet, we expect to deliver positive free cash flow. And finally, we have significant sources of liquidity to manage through this environment. As a management team, we are taking the necessary actions to navigate through the current environment while ensuring the company is strong with position for the eventual industry recovery and our future profitable growth. With that, I'd like to turn the callback over to Pat. Patrick Nolan : Thank you, Kevin. Sharon, we're ready to open up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. First question comes from John Murphy with Bank of America. John Murphy : Good morning, guys. It's great to hear from you and thank you for all the detail and the stab at the outlook for this year, it's very helpful. Just really, first, simple question. As we look at Slide 6, there's some variability that you're indicating around the second quarter, but we're in the second quarter. So I'm just trying to understand, Fred, when you were mentioning mid-May restart versus mid-June restart, sort of as some of the scenarios you're looking at. We're hearing early May, which is what we're in right now for Europe and mid-May for North America. So that information should be reasonably available to you from your customers. I'm just curious on scheduled releases, what kind of information and lead time you're getting from your customers that hopefully can eliminate some of that variability in scenario planning, how much lead time you'd expect from them because it just seems like some of the stuff should be reasonably well communicated to you at this moment for the restart. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : John, there is a wide range of a restart date and restart scenario. I think we have to not think about just the date of restart, but at what level of capacity we restart. And it is changing daily both from a restart date and ramp up production. So I think it's still -- it still varies and we'd -- we still have a lot of uncertainty in Q2 from a volume perspective. John Murphy : Okay. But it would be fair to say that you're getting some communication on restart dates, but obviously the uncertainty is still flowing down from the customer. So there's still tremendous uncertainty on what the level is going to be starting you need at this point. Is that a fair assessment? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : I think the fair assessment is that we are in constant communication with our customers and, yes, we're following that very, very closely. And yes, things change, things do change. John Murphy : Okay. Then maybe just a quick follow-up. I mean, the 26% detrimentals on the lower volumes towards the end of the third, I mean end of first quarter. It's very impressive as we think about sort of the pressure in the second quarter and throughout the year, I mean, is that the kind of number we should be thinking? Are there any actions that might make that better or because you're lower in the U curve maybe be a bit worse? I mean, how should we think about sort of bracketing around that 26% which was very good performance in the first quarter? Kevin Nowlan : Yes, I think we were pleased with that 26% as well. And that's really a function of the lot of the cost restructuring actions that we were executing on about last year that we announced back in April and it allowed us to manage the decrementals now and we're seeing the benefit of that. And that's even while we were investing additional dollars in R&D and the drivetrain segment. So a good result all in -- all things considered in this environment. I think -- with the pace at which production is coming down on a year-over-year basis, I think it's still challenging to manage decrementals that are something less than 30% range in this type of an environment. I think that's a reasonable directional proxy to think of how to think about our decrementals going forward. Operator : Next question comes from David Leiker with Baird. Erin Welcenbach : Good morning. This is actually Erin Welcenbach on for David. So my first question is just about if you can kind of walk us through what you're assuming in terms of the Q3, Q4 production scenarios that you put on your slide? What that means in terms of kind of the pacing the cadence of OEM ramp ups in the back of the year? Any color on that? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : So we are looking at -- your question is very broad, but let me give you some color here. So on the high scenario we're looking at 25% down for the full year. We're looking at 53% down in Q2, 16ish in Q3, and about 10% in Q4. And the low scenario would be a little bit lower than that, especially in Q2 as you've seen in the charts on the page that John alluded to. So what matters is really when customer restart and how fast they restart. And I'm certainly not going to go customer-by-customer, but on an aggregate standpoint this is where we are quarter-by-quarter. Erin Welcenbach : Okay. That's helpful. And then just my second question is if you can talk about kind of the drivers of outgrowth in Q1? I mean, obviously, you mentioned a number of factors by region, but was there any impact on kind of stocking or timing benefits in terms of what you're shipping to OEM plants? And could there be a bit of a delay I got from what you're shipping in early Q2 as that production ramps back up? Thank you. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : We don't think it's stocking. And we add in Europe our Engine Group of stronger with -- with actually stronger diesel demand and stronger new small gas engine demand. China DCT was strong and also strong from an emissions business standpoint. And our turbo business was pretty strong in North America. So that's pretty much what drove the significant outgrowth in Q1. Operator : Next question comes from Dan Galves with Wolfe Research. Dan Galves : Hoping you could talk a little bit about how headcount might have changed from year-end to be... Patrick Nolan : Dan, I think we lost you. Kevin Nowlan : Can you repeat your question, Dan? We lost you. Operator : Move on to next question. And the next question is from Brian Johnson with Barclays. Please go ahead. Brian Johnson : Yes. Good morning or good afternoon as some of you are in Europe. Couple of questions. First, could you comment a bit more on the decremental performance? Not only was it different between engine and drivetrain, when we think of the real production impact in the quarter it was kind of the month of February in your China operations and then second half of March in North America and Europe. So if you could give a little bit more color on the decremental margins, maybe ideally by geography, by division. If you don't want to go that far, at least kind of geographically? So if you begin to think through Q2. Kevin Nowlan : I think I would give it more directly by the segments, the way we disclosed publicly. And it's -- I mean in the Engine segment you can see that the simple math says that our decrementals were around 20%, that's because the bulk of the cost restructuring actions that we've taken over the past year have been in that segment and they're getting the benefit of that even as they manage the decremental margins on lower revenue. And then if you could see in the drivetrain segment there, their decrementals came in in the low 30s, say, for the quarter on a year-over-year basis, but the bulk of that was because of the increase in the R&D spend on a year-over-year basis in that segment to support our electrification program. So if you were to strip out that increase in the R&D they would have had the decrementals that are in the low 20s. Brian Johnson : Okay. I guess what I was getting at is can we expect worse decrementals in 2Q because of your European and North American cost structure perhaps being less flexible than that in China? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : Yes. I think the decrementals are really driven by the pace at which the revenue is down as opposed to something unique about the geography. So I wouldn't expect that to be the driver of the change in decrementals, I think just the challenge of operating with significantly lower production, the magnitude of that decline is really the driver of a decremental that's probably at a higher rate just like we experienced the point in time last year. I think this year it's even under more pressure. So something in that 30% ZIP code is probably the right way to think about us. Brian Johnson : so for : Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : Brian, safety is where BorgWarner excels. We have extraordinary safety results from a PR and high perspective and we're using exactly the same excellence that we have built in this company over the past decades to restart production with safety and COVID-19. So we have done a tremendous amount of work to figure out how we would restart plant-by-plant including exactly what you said social distancing, which is possible but not always and PPE, but also it goes way beyond the production area. Also, it impacts the way people breakout, the way people do poses and so on and all that has been looked at. And our plant managers have done a terrific job, wonderful job in getting our plants ready to restart. Kevin Nowlan : And I just add to that, Brian, I think that part of the reason, when we talk about the 30% decremental, it's a directional guide at this point, that's part of the reason we're not giving specific earnings guidance. I think there's a lot of variables when you have a revenue range that's from low-to-high $750 million wide, some of it can be what is the operational efficiency in the plan. It can be what are commodity prices doing, what's happening in the supply base, are there struggles there? What additional cost actions might we take? So there's a whole host of things that I think we're going to be learning over the coming months that will ultimately impact what those decrementals are and how efficient we operate. Operator : Next question comes from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Noah Kaye : Yes. Okay. Great. Thanks. Sorry about that. Two part question as you prepare to reramp. First, how would you assess the stability of the supply base? And two, how are...? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : I think we've lost Noah too. Kevin Nowlan : Noah, I think we lost you while -- Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : I can answer on the supply base. I would say that we are absolutely clearly seeing that the supply base is under some kind of undoubtedly some stress. And to-date we have not seen any disruption, but the key for those -- we have two suppliers -- will be their ability to fund a production restart. We are applying all the best practices that we developed when it is around managing supply de-stress over the past several years, but I would say no that -- yeah, potentially this is clearly a different scale. Patrick Nolan : Sharon, we're ready for the next question. Operator : Next question comes from Chris McNally with Evercore. Chris McNally : Thanks so much, guys. I think we've had a couple of questions on the decremental this year. I know it's super, super early, but as we think about exiting the year, you guys used to give rule of thumb that essentially the incrementals could be in the high teen when production turns essentially flat to positive. Could you just maybe help us through? I think, well, a lot of us are trying to figure out the increased cost that comes when production restart. So even trying across model sequential, incremental margins, do you think we'll still be able to achieve high-teens into the low 20% when things get better sequentially Q3 and Q4? Kevin Nowlan : I think that's how we think about it in terms of the way we manage our incrementals and decremental. Obviously, right now we're in the process of managing decrementals in the challenging Q1, as well as Q2 will still be under even more pressure as you can see from our revenue chart in terms of what we're expecting from a production standpoint. So right now we're in the process of managing decrementals, which means making sure we manage operational efficiency, supplier risk, and additional cost actions that we take to manage in that environment. And then that positions us as we start to see the rebound whether you're looking on an increment sequential basis or a year-over-year basis to be able to deliver at something consistent with our historic guidance of operating in that high teens basis on a ramp up. Chris McNally : Okay. Great. And then just -- really just a technical one. When we're trying to like back so often juxtapose it sort of and apply EBIT for the year, can you just talk a little bit about the working capital assumptions? Are you assuming that you'll have a working capital inflow, which we would sort of expect, given in the production decline? Kevin Nowlan : That's exactly right, and that's some of the tailwind that we've seen already in Q1 as well as heading into Q2 because we do run positive working capital. If you look really receivables, payables inventory, we tend to run in the, called around 12.5ish%. So I think when you think about the decrementals, we obviously have real cash flow pressure coming from the decremental, but we also have an offset coming from free cash flow -- or I'm sorry, from working capital and we're experiencing that right now.  I would say, in this type of an environment -- and we all saw this in 2008, 2009, inventory tends to come out of the system much more slowly. But that said, we still run positive working capital when you look receivables versus payables and that's the real benefit that we're seeing at the moment.  Couple of other things that you should think about from a cash flow perspective as well is right now we're continuing in our planning assumptions, you can see at the high end, to maintain our capital investments at the levels that we operated with last year. And that's because with a company like us, one of our strengths is because of our liquidity and free cash flow profile we can continue to invest in programs in the long-term to support our customer needs, but obviously that's something we'll continue to monitor as the year goes on whether we need to do anything differently there. So I think those are some of the key puts and takes as you think about cash flow. Operator : Next question comes from Joe Spak with RBC Capital. Joe Spak : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Kevin, just to follow-up on that point and to be clear, is that what's in your free cash flow guidance for the year, working capital is still a source? Because I would expect there to be some use of working capital as you have to ramp back up in the back half. Kevin Nowlan : Yes. I mean when you ramp back up but they use by net-net we're down on a full year basis and in each quarter of the year and so that all allows it to be a pickup when you look at each quarter as well as the entirety of the year. So, yes, working capital is going to be a positive for the year, that's our expectation. Joe Spak : Okay. Thank you. And then maybe just on the quarter. And I know this is all sort of prior guidance because it's thrown out the window here. But your backlog I think previously was $400 million to $430 million, we can mark that down obviously for sort of industry volumes. But in first quarter, really strong, I think over $300 million you guys showed. So did that come in better than you were initially planning, is some of that timing or maybe you could just talk a little bit more about how some of that backlog rolled in? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : Joe, I think we're very happy with Q1. It was better than expected. We don't think that it's a pull forward of backlog, but we're not willing to assume that this outgrowth is going to continue at this point. We are watching, especially the diesel demand that was strong versus our assumption in Q1. And also, we're looking in great detail the China outgrowth. Joe Spak : Okay. And Fred, lastly just on back to the supply or stress comment. I mean -- and maybe you could sort of remind us what Borg has done in the past. But how would you support your supply base to sort of ensure your supply, if needed? I mean is that just payment terms, would it be sort of potentially take demand or are you hoping that some of those businesses will be able to rely on some government assistance? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : Well, we're using the same tools that we've used over the past. I would say about two years when we started talking about the distress of some of the supply base in Europe, we know how to do it. We have risk management departments and we understand all those, all the levers that we can pull up. You're right, what's a bit different now is that you might have some government, state help, and we would put these inputs in consideration when we decide how we -- what we do and how we do it. One of the key thing is really to stay close to the supply base, close to the customers to understand ramp ups and link it. Operator : Next question comes from James Picariello with KeyBanc Capital Markets. James Picariello : Just curious, does the current environment affect the timing of your SG&A and COGS, your restructuring savings at all, relative to the cadence you outlined last quarter? Is there a delay or possible acceleration in what you can achieve? Kevin Nowlan : I don't think there is a significant movement one way or the other. We're going to continue to support funding of the restructuring actions that we identified and talked about back on the January call. In this environment, there can be some modest movements, just some timing movements pull forward or even pushed out a little bit, but that's -- I'd say overall directionally there's not a material change in what we guided to from the January outlook. We're still proceeding on that path.  And t good is -- I mean that -- remember what we talked about when we announced that restructuring and set up restructuring initiatives, we were trying to be proactive to manage unforeseen risks to offset potential unforeseen risks to manage our margin profile. We didn't anticipate COVID-19 necessarily, but here it is, is one of those unforeseen risks, and the good news is we were out in front of trying to make sure that we have an ability to sustain our long-term margin profile by taking those types of actions. James Picariello : Got it. That's helpful. And just based on what you're willing to share, can you just walk through the rationale on the acquisition amendment, the 5% reduction on the conversion rate? Just curious what led you to that number maybe from a valuation standpoint? I mean clearly compared to the original timing of the announcement, the world has changed pretty dramatically beyond just 5%, let's say. So any color there would be helpful. Kevin Nowlan : Yes. I guess -- and the first thing I'd say about that is we remain confident in the strategic merits of this transaction, and so all of us see the long-term prospects of combining these two companies. And so remember what the nature of this consent agreement is that we signed up to this morning, is to resolve an issue with an operating covenant. And we view the amendment, that is a way to provide Delphi with the flexibility and needs to execute on its financial plan in this environment while protecting us from further unanticipated downside risk.  The reduction in the equity exchange ratio that we agreed to is intended to compensate us, for that additional risk we're taking by providing that covenant relief. And remember, the financials of all companies in this environment BorgWarner included, BorgWarner, Delphi, others in the sector have all been under pressure and our stock prices reflect that. And since this is an all equity transaction, the effect of equity purchase price has already been impacted as a result of the environment we're in. So that's really the totality of how we think about this. James Picariello : Okay. Well, fair enough. That's helpful. And just last one, on the strong diesel demand in Europe. This is a follow on to the uptick in demand that you saw in the fourth quarter, which I don't think you expected to continue, so just what's your take on that on the carryover there? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : Yes. And we're looking at that in great detail. I would not call it a trend. And we're doing that study with a lot of granularity, but we haven't seen this in registration. So I think it might be also due to the different element of diesel sizes and we're more and more into the big diesels and -- but I would say that this is something that -- this is not a trend that we're ready to bet on yet. Actually, if you look at the penetration rate for diesel, it's still in Q1 2020 about 5% lower than Q1 '19. So it has happened, but not ready to bet on the fact that this could be a trend. Operator : Next question comes from Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Emmanuel Rosner : Hi, good morning. First question are in the clarification around the backlog outlook. So is it close to $350 million in the first quarter. Is the right way to look at the full year outlook, the outgrowths market is essentially the backlog in which case is left as $400 million to $500 million or so? So are you assuming no limited amount of new business over the rest of the year and if that is the case, is that a result of delays or things that you're seeing? Or Is there an element of conservatism in there? Kevin Nowlan : We don't see major delays. I would say that two to two to four are in line with the prior guide, and which is 150 to 250 basis points of our growth. Emmanuel Rosner : Okay. But what was my math, I don't know if that one is to chime in. Was my math right? Is the front or the $397 million through $487 million in the 2020 outlook, is that comparable with the $333 million did in Q1 or was that a different thing? Kevin Nowlan : Emmanuel, I'll take you through the backlog math offline, but just mathematically their way to think about is the outgrowth through the remaining three quarters, the average will be that 1.5% to 2.5 % that Fred referenced but it's in line with the prior guideline. Emmanuel Rosner : Okay. And okay. Understood. And then I get just and then more intermittent basis, it's encouraging to see no, you're not seeing any delays as well to see the strongest growth in the first quarter. So from a high level point of view of using they could be any structural changes in the pace of adoption of various powertrain technologies post COVID, could there be some automakers pulling back in the electrification and if they're not under mandate, let's say North America or vice versa? Could there be an acceleration of some other technology there? Do you see anything changing the midterm midst of powertrain as a result of the COVID? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : So the first thing I would say, Manuel, is that our strategy of being balanced across CH&E makes it like, it doesn't really matter for us. What I can tell you is that in China, we -- I'm not saying any slow down on electrification programs. We see things moving very fast from an electrification standpoint. In Europe, we see that the 2025 and 2030 are regulatory on CO2 and emission leading to more electrification is not questions. Actually, if you look at it in detail, in some countries, some programs related to electrification were deemed essential.  In the U.S., it might take a little bit more time. But the U.S. will benefit from our great technology in the combustion standpoint, making engine cleaner and leaner, and wherever we are around the world, we will see electrification accelerating growth for BorgWarner and also a great product in combustion making customers happy when they decide to go and have a longer tail in combustion. Operator : Next question comes in from Armintas Sinkevicius with Morgan Stanley. Armintas Sinkevicius : Great. Thank you for taking the question. Looking at the exchange ratio here with Delphi, I understand that it compensates for the additional relief that Delphi is looking for. But on the other hand, you mentioned that you don't expect to be executing on the share repurchase program in the near term, and part of that transaction was adding some additional share buyback. So just trying to think through, the implications for share buyback and why you didn't try to take that into account with the exchange ratio? Kevin Nowlan : I mean with respect to the share, by that, we remain committed to the billion-dollar program we announced back in the end of January. I think all we're saying is that in the near term in this environment with all the uncertainty that we have, we don't think it's the prudent decision to be deploying liquidity at this moment to start executing on that program. We're subject to a number of blackouts anyway and the environment we're operating in as a result of where we stand and the transaction with Delphi, but nonetheless I think just in the coming months, we don't think it's prudent to be executing on that. That said, we remain committed to the billion-dollar program. Patrick Nolan : I think we have time. Operator : Yes, sir. We have time for one final question and the question comes from Dan Levy with Credit Suisse. Dan Levy : First, we've seen others got their own share buybacks and dividends to preserve cash. What's the rationale for why you maintained your dividend, I mean I saw you had zero buyback in the quarter but, you had the dividend in place, so why keep that? Kevin Nowlan : Yesh, I mean ultimately the dividend is the decision of the board of directors, but I think the way, we as the management team think about it is the dividend is the commitment that we make to returning free cash flow to our shareholders and generating $146 million of free cash flow in the first quarter with an outlook that suggested even under these difficult revenue scenarios that were going to generate positive free cash flow for the full year I think the Board undoubtedly took that into consideration and thought it was good to continue to live up to its commitments to returning that cash over to shareholders.  Undoubtedly, that's a decision the Board will continue to monitor each quarter as it looks at the environment and sees how things might be changing. But I'm sure that was the calculus that went into it.  I think with respect to the buybacks, buybacks, we remain committed, as I mentioned to Armintas, to the billion-dollar program, but the timing of the execution of those tends to be more discretionary and so we're going to be prudent with the liquidity in this environment and look at the right timing to start redeploying the cash towards that buyback program, but we don't think now is the moment to do that. Dan Levy : Great, thanks. And just a follow up on the deal with Delphi. You're -- assuming everything goes forward, you'll close the deal in a different world than what we saw at the time to deal with in housing. Delphi is probably going to be coming in with higher leverage though. How does it the higher leverage ratio change the way that you think you will operate the go forward an entity? Is there maybe where you're going to have to be more aggressive on the restructuring or would you have to adjust spend in different areas? So how does leverage change the tie in for how you think you may need to operate to go forward entity? Kevin Nowlan : Keep in mind when Fred talked to the slide what we agreed to with Delphi as part of this consent agreement is to put a limitation on the amount of debt that can be outstanding at the closing. And in the grand scheme of things when you think about that potential for incremental indebtedness, we don't think it materially alters our view on the expected leverage ratio or the financial prospects of the combined company. Dan Levy : Okay. So still the entire entity as a whole is still intact with this new requirement in place? Kevin Nowlan : You may remember Delphi had called it a $1.5 billion or so that we have $2 billion of debt and we'd talked about the potential, not the requirement, but the potential that there could be additional net debt at closing of $115 million according to the consent agreement we signed up before. So in the grand scheme of an entity that has $3 billion plus in debt, that's not a huge number that really swings the overall leverage prospects of the company in a way that causes us to want to operate it any differently post-closing. Patrick Nolan : With that, I'd like to thank you-all for your time and your good questions today. With that, we're going to wrap up the call, and stay safe. Sharon, you can close the call. Operator : That does conclude the BorgWarner 2020 First Quarter Results Conference Call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BorgWarner 2020 Second Quarter Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker\u2019s remarks there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions]  I would now like to turn the call over to Patrick Nolan, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Nolan, you may begin your conference. Patrick Nolan : Thank you, Sharon. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We issued our earnings release earlier this morning. It's posted on our website borgwarner.com, on our homepage and on our Investor Relations homepage. With regard to our Investor Relations calendar, we will be attending multiple conferences between now and our next earnings release. Please see the events section of our Investor Relations homepage for full list. Before we begin, I need to inform you that during this call we may make forward-looking statements, which involves risks and uncertainties detailed in our 10-K. Our actual results may differ significantly from the matters discussed today. During today's presentation, we'll highlight certain non-GAAP measures in order to provide a clearer picture of how the core business performed and for comparison purposes with prior periods. When you hear us say on a comparable basis, that means excluding the impact of FX, net M&A and other noncomparable items. When you hear us say adjusted, that means excluding noncomparable items. When you hear us say organic, that means excluding the impact of FX and net M&A. We will also refer to our growth compared to our market. When you hear us say market, that means the change in light vehicle production weighted for our geographic exposure. Our outgrowth is defined as our organic revenue change versus the market. Please note that we have posted our earnings call presentation to the IR page of our website. We encourage you to follow along with the slides during our discussion. With that, I'm happy to turn the call over to Fred. Fred Lissalde : Thank you, Pat, and good morning, everyone. We're very pleased to share our results for the second quarter today and provide an overall company update. Starting on Page 5. While the industry production rates were clearly weak during the quarter, we performed strongly on a relative basis. With approximately $1.4 billion in sales, we were down about 43% organically, and these compares to a market being down about 50%. This means, we drove a significant outgrowth. In fact, for the quarter, we saw our growth in major regions. Our decremental margin was about 28% in the quarter as our margin performance was impacted by the COVID-19 related shutdowns and inefficiencies related to the production restarts. We delivered positive free cash flow for the quarter, despite lower production levels, which we believe is a testament to the underlying cash generating ability of this company. I am proud of how the entire BorgWarner team has reacted to this extremely-challenging environment. We met the challenges of managing costs and cash during the production shutdowns, while ensuring our ability to supply our customers, as production resumed. All this was done, putting the health and safety of our employees in front. Let's now turn to Slide 6, where you can see our perspectives on the global industry production. Overall, we expect the challenging environment to continue throughout the remainder of 2020. However, our industry production expectations for the full year have improved, primarily due to the second quarter production coming in at the high-end of our prior expectations. It is important to note that the market environment is still volatile with the risk of future production disruptions, rising from COVID-19. With the important caveats in mind, on a full year basis, we expect the market declined to be in the minus 22% to minus 25% range, compared to a prior expectation over 25% to 31% decline. Looking at this by region, we're planning for Europe to be down in the 26% to 28% range, and in North America, we expect a 24% to 27% decline. On a relative basis, the outlook for China is stronger but we still expect 13% to 15% decline for the full year. As you can see from the line chart, showing all different scenarios, we expect the second half production declines to be less significant than those we experienced during the first half. However, at the mid-point of our guidance, we still expect to low double-digit market declines in the second half. As we manage through the challenging global market environment, we continue to maintain a very active dialogue with both our customers and our suppliers, while remaining focused on pursuing new business and technologies. Next, I would like to highlight the significant new business program that we announced this morning on Slide 7. I'm really excited to tell you that, we've building a power packed integrated drive module also called IDM for Fords new all-electric Mustang Mach-E. The IDM comes complete with BorgWarner thermal management systems and gearbox, integrated with a motor and power electronics from other suppliers and showcases our system integration expertise.  The IDM is being supplied to power the Mustang Mach-E rear-wheel, and all-wheel-drive configurations. On the all-wheel-drive GT version, BorgWarner is supplying the secondary drive unit as well. We were able to capitalize on our experience with scalable and modular approaches to IDM to deliver these customized drive module that met both stringent requirements.  We're excited to partner with Ford to deliver high quality, clean and efficient product propulsion solution to the high-performance electrification market. This is another significant milestone for our electric business. And there is still more to come, particularly as we expand our power electronics portfolio following the close of the Delphi Technologies acquisition. Let me provide an update of that particular pending acquisition on Slide 8. We achieved several milestones towards closing during the last few months. First, we completed a $1.1 billion senior notes offering at favorable terms. And Kevin will discuss this in more detail later.  Second Delphi Technologies' shareholders approved the transaction by an overwhelming majority. We believe these underscores the value that is inherent in bringing our companies together. Third we've now received regulatory approval in six of the seven jurisdictions requires for us to close the transaction. Importantly, there have been no conditions placed on the regulatory approvals we've received so far. We expect to receive approval in the remaining jurisdiction in the coming month.  And finally, the integration teams continue to work very well together. There is a high level of commitment and excitement among the teams as we drive towards day one readiness and capitalize on the value creating opportunities of the combination.  To sum up, I'm pleased with the overall progress as we drive towards the expected closing of the transaction in the second half of 2020.  Next on Slide 9, I'd like to highlight that we published our sustainability report last month. At BorgWarner, we embrace sustainability to deliver value to all stakeholders. And there are three pillars to our sustainability strategy. First, create a cleaner more energy efficient world. We do this first and foremost through the products we offer. Products that drive cleaner mobility and efficiency in moving vehicles from point A to point B. We're also very focused on how we manufacture these products in a cleaner and more energy efficient way. Our goals include reducing our energy intensity usage by 37% and our greenhouse gas emissions intensity by 50% by the year 2030. Second is to leave the BorgWarner beliefs. We encourage our employees to leave are beliefs which serve as a foundation for how we work together. I would like to highlight that, we are focusing on developing a talented and diverse workforce. In late 2019, I signed the CEO action for diversity and inclusion with BorgWarner\u2019s pledging to take actions, to cultivate a workplace with diverse perspectives and experiences are welcomed and respected. BorgWarner employees around the world are also involved and engaged in their communities, and have given about 63,000 hours of service helping others last year. And finally, we partnered with and report to our stakeholders. We want to promote responsibility and sustainability within our supply base, while also providing transparency in our impact, and reporting accordingly. In summary, BorgWarner strives to make the vehicles we drive more efficient and the world will even cleaner. We embrace diversity and inclusion, develop our employees and give back to the communities where we live and work. Before I turn it over to Kevin, let me summarize our second quarter results and our outlook on Slide 10. We achieved a significant second quarter outgrowth in all major regions, and we're excited to continue to drive that outgrowth as the market shifts towards electrification. Wins like the IDM for the Ford Mach-E continue our evolution into electrification. We delivered positive free cash flow, during this exceptional quarter and as Kevin will discuss, we expect the second half free cash flow to meet or exceed our year-to-date generation. We are on track to close the Delphi Technologies acquisition in the second half of this year. There has been tremendous challenges in 2020 with COVID situation. As I look at what we've accomplished at BorgWarner despite this environment and what we're positioned to accomplish over the balance of the year, I'm confident that we remain strongly-positioned to execute in the near and long-term from both a financial standpoint and a technology standpoint driving our profitable growth. Now over to you Kevin. Kevin Nowlan : Thank you, Fred and good morning everyone. Before I review the financials in detail, I'd like to highlight the two important takeaways regarding our second quarter results : First, our financial results were solid in the face of a very challenging production environment. During the second quarter, we delivered strong revenue outgrowth in all regions. We were able to maintain decremental margins below 30%, and most importantly, we generated positive free cash flow. The second key message is that we continue to execute on the financing measures that position us to successfully close on the Delphi Technologies acquisition. Let's turn to Slide 11. As we look at our year-over-year revenue walk for Q2, you can see that, the stronger U.S. dollar reduced revenue by about 1.4% from a year ago. Excluding this impact, our organic sales were down just under 43%, compared to the 50% decline in weighted-average market production. That means, we delivered revenue outgrowth of 730 basis points in the quarter. And importantly, that outgrowth occurred in all of the major light vehicle markets around the globe. In Europe, our light vehicle organic revenue was down 58% compared to the market decline of approximately 63%. The outgrowth was driven by better than expected diesel-related revenue as well as new programs. The good news been diesel is going to trend for us the last few quarters as we believe our mix of diesel business has held up better than the overall market. But we don't expect that tailwind to necessarily continue over the longer term. In North America, we outperformed the market decline of 69% by over 7%, driven by strong mix in new programs. From a mix perspective, our slightly overweight position in SUVs and pickup trucks has boded well for our ability to deliver outgrowth. And in China, we outperform the market by approximately 6% primarily due to stronger than expected year-over-year growth in our DCT products as well as strengthen our China commercial vehicle business, which was about 150 basis point positive contributor to our outgrowth.  Overall, we're pleased that we continue to deliver revenue outgrowth even in this challenging end market.  Now let's look at our adjusted operating income performance, which can be found on Slide 12. Our Q2 adjusted operating loss was $9 million, compared to $303 million of income in the second quarter of 2019. Our adjusted operating margin was negative point 0.6%, which was down compared to the positive 11.9% we delivered in a second quarter a year ago.  On a comparable basis, adjusted operating income decreased $310 million on almost $1.1 billion of lower sales, which translates to a decremental margin of 28%. As you know, when markets move downward quickly, we tend to see decremental that can be 30% or higher, just like we saw at point in time last year. So we view the 28% decremental as a reasonably good level of performance given the suddenness of the dramatic decline in industry volume during the quarter, and the costs and inefficiencies related to the initial production restart.  Adjusted loss per share was $0.14 for the quarter. The decline in adjusted earnings per share compared to the second quarter of 2019 was driven by the lower adjusted operating income and a slightly higher tax rate.  Moving to cash flow. We are proud of the fact that we deliver $10 million of positive free cash flow for the second quarter. In a quarter where global production gets cut in half, which is what we saw in Q2, it is critical to maintain a very clear focus on cash flow. And then in the second quarter we did just that. We achieve this through disciplined and manage decremental margins, focus on driving working capital performance and effective management of capital expenditures.  Now let's discuss our full year revenue outlook on Slide 13. Our guidance is based on the end market assumptions as Fred reviewed earlier, with global production being down 22% to 25%. We expect to drive market outcomes for the year but not at the level we saw in the first half. Our guidance now incorporates full year revenue outgrowth of approximately 450 basis points to 600 basis points. This assumes our outgrowth for the remainder of 2020 is in the range of 0 basis points to 300 basis points, which at the midpoint is relatively consistent with the outgrowth guidance we provided to start the year. This range of outgrowth expectations is wider than typical given the volatility in OEM weekly production schedules and launch timing of new programs. We expect this volatility will continue much of the second half. As a result, we expect a full year 2020 organic revenue decline of 16% to 20%, which translates to an expected 2020 revenue range of $8.0 billion to $8.4 billion.  Let's turn to Slide 14, where you can see an update on our cash flow guidance and other important considerations. During the first half of 2020, we generated $156 million of free cash flow, which we view as a tremendous achievement in such difficult markets. And as you can see on the slide, we expect the trend of positive free cash flow generation to continue with $300 million to $400 million of free cash flow for the full year. This implies approximately $150 million to $250 million of free cash flow in the second half, despite the working capital investment needed to fund the production ramp ups and the sequential increase in capital spending in the second half. You should note that, we do expect second half free cash flow to be weighted more towards the fourth quarter, as we expect a much larger working capital investment in the third quarter with a sequential step-up in revenue. Turning to margins. We continue to expect full year decremental margins to be in the 30% range for the full year. Second half decremental margins will be impacted by expected volatility in weekly OEM production schedules and some higher costs versus the first half, namely the end of our temporary wage reductions and higher R&D related to Q2. As we mentioned last quarter, we intend to continue to sustain the pace of our R&D investment during this downturn, because we view it as important to deploy our positive free cash flow to invest in our long-term growth. Also on decremental margins, I would point out that Q4 decrementals will likely be higher than the full year decremental margin due to the really strong 13% operating margin comparable from Q4 2019. Nonetheless, we feel confident in our ability to deliver on our free cash flow guidance for the year, and that confidence is reflected in the Board's decision to maintain our current dividend again, for this quarter. As we went through the depths of this COVID-19 downturn, we continued to generate positive free cash flow, which allowed us to sustain our dividend uninterrupted and unreduced. Next on Slide 15, I'll summarize the financing actions that we've undertaken related to the upcoming closing of the Delphi Technologies acquisition. First, as many of you are aware, we successfully renewed and up-sized our revolver in March. While a revolver is $1.5 billion today, as part of our revolver renewal from a few months ago, the capacity will automatically increase by an additional $500 million upon the closing of the Delphi Technologies acquisition. Next, during the second quarter, we completed a $1.1 billion senior notes offering. The proceeds from this offering will be used to repay amounts outstanding under the Delphi Technologies senior secured credit facility, while also allowing us to repay our own $250 million in notes maturing in September. Concurrent with this transaction, we entered into a cross currency swaps that synthetically converted the notes to euro denominated debt at an effective interest rate of 1.78%, which we view as an attractive rate, particularly in this environment. And finally, over the next couple of months, we plan to initiate an obligor exchange offering on Delphi Technologies $800 million, 5% notes. We intend to exchange substantially similar BorgWarner notes for the Delphi Technology notes with the exchange becoming effective shortly after the closing of the transaction. By executing this exchange offering, we would avoid the potentially significant cash cost of a make-whole and refinancing transaction. Importantly, this exchange represents the last major financing action that we need to complete ahead of the closing of the acquisition. So let me summarize my financial remarks. Overall, we had a solid quarter in spite of the industry pressures, delivering strong outgrowth and positive free cash flow. We expect the market to remain under pressure throughout 2020. But we've increased our revenue and cash flow guidance for the year. And finally, we were able to execute an important financing transaction that positions us to close on the Delphi Technologies acquisition in the second half of 2020. Just as I said last quarter, we are proactively navigating through the current environment, while ensuring the company is very well positioned for the eventual industry recovery and our future profitable growth.  With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Pat. Patrick Nolan : Thank you, Kevin. Sharon, we're ready to open up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from John Murphy with Bank of America. Aileen Smith : Good morning, guys. This is Aileen Smith on for John. All right, first question, I appreciate that your outlook doesn't incorporate the impact of additional production downtime from COVID. However, for internal planning purposes, how closely are you monitoring your supply base and your production footprint? And are there any proactive measures you're taking to mitigate potential hiccups to production that may pop up in the back half of the year? And specifically how are you playing for launches in this environment? Fred Lissalde : So the answer is absolutely yes. We are running the company all times ready for downturn. And we've shown in Q2 that we can manage that.  So plants have downturn plans ready to be implemented. The good thing is that we've just done it. So it will be a repeat and like most of the repeats, it's easier than the first time you do it. We are also as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we were staying very close to our customers and suppliers to figure out in detail, the details of schedules and expectations and potential issues.  So as far as launch is concerned, we see a little bit of program delays. But so far we're pretty confident that we're going to be able to honor all the launches that we have up and running and ready to launch in the second half. Aileen Smith : Great. That's very helpful. And second more strategic question. On the announcement of the IDM win on the Ford Mach-E. As you think about further quoting for integrated drive modules, should we expect a similar level of content coming through other suppliers that you're then integrating with your own components? Or is there a substantial opportunity to get some of the electric motor and power electronics content over time, particularly considering what you acquired with Remy? And what you will be acquiring with Delphi? Fred Lissalde : Yes, I would say first that we are super excited to partner with Ford on these great products. And as I mentioned in the past, we don't have to sale the system. We are flexible. We have modular design. And you may be right, we've extended our product portfolio in the past two years to be ready to have more internal contents, but very flexible around adapting our content intensity with what the customer want. Aileen Smith : Okay. And one last question if I may, more housekeeping on outlook for free cash flow, that's improved to $300 million to $400 million. Is that just consistent with the higher revenue outlook? Or does it also reflects more progress than expected on some of your cost saving or cash conservation initiatives? Kevin Nowlan : It's really in line with our revenue outlook. And I think you can see that with the low-end of our revenue outlook now matching the high-end of what we had before and that cash flow not coincidentally is $300 million at that revenue range. So as we look at the $400 million upside at the top-end of our range right now, that coincides with the $8.4 billion of revenue. Operator : Next question comes from Rod Lache with Wolfe Research. Rod Lache : A couple of questions. One is nice backlog this quarter. Just wanting you to clarify, are you including mix in that backlog line? Because, it looks like your -- obviously your production mix is pretty helpful in the quarter or is the backlog really backlog. And what I'm getting at is, you said backlog is a 100% hybrid and EV, and we're seeing really impressive strength in those categories around the world. So, is that something that we can extrapolate from as we think about how solid the backlog that you've previously disclosed is? Kevin Nowlan : Yes. I mean, backlog includes anything that's not market or FX effectively. So, it can pick up mix impacts and absolutely we're seeing some positive mix impacts in the quarter. So that is a piece of the equation, basically anything that's driving us to outgrowth the market. Rod Lache : So, any color on what's happening with regards to the hybrid and EV and is that a significant contributor already now or not yet? Kevin Nowlan : I mean, I think from a mix perspective, a lot of the mix benefits that we were seeing in the second quarter in particular has to do with our exposure to pick up an SUVs in North America, as well as our diesel related content in Europe seems to be holding up better than the overall diesel market, as we've seen for the last few quarters now. We have seen some DCT growth over in China as well, which is supporting that backlog. But as we think about the H&E content in our backlog, most of that's coming in the years to come in terms of where we expect to really see that driving our outgrowth and becoming more than 100% of the net backlog. That's really a comment on '21 to '23 timeframe. Rod Lache : Okay. Got it. And then secondly, could you just update us on the status of the $110 million cost reduction plan that you've talked about, this is specific to the BorgWarner business, not the synergies or the Delphi side. And is that 30% decremental that we're seeing right now is that including some benefit there? How should we be thinking about incrementals into next year with the savings and non-recurrence of temporary actions you've taken so far this year and any color on that? Kevin Nowlan : Yes. I mean, the detrimental is absolutely includes the benefits associated with the restructuring actions, and we've started to see the benefits of both obviously last year's restructuring actions that are taking hold and helping on a year-over-year basis, as well as we're starting to get some benefit associated with the restructuring that we announced back in early February timeframe. So that is mitigating the decremental and should continue to be a tailwind as we look out to the next few years to help offset any other bad news that could come into the equation like COVID-19 did this year.  And overall though, I would say to the question that is on track. We're continuing to execute according to the plan that we laid out several months back. And we're on track for that. Rod Lache : So just to help us out if we wanted to sort of disaggregate that 30% decremental. What is the incremental savings that you're seeing this year? And what is the incremental number that you were targeting for next year? Kevin Nowlan : Yes, I think we disclosed back in February timeframe that we expect that the 2020 numbers to benefit by about $50 million of incremental savings. And I would say we're on track to deliver that in our decremental number. So that is a tailwind in the decrementals. In addition to any of the temporary types of cost actions that we executed in the second quarter like temporary layoffs and wage reductions and those types of things are temporary in nature, but did help us in the second quarter as well. Rod Lache : And the next, you've got another 50. Was it or do I remember that well? Kevin Nowlan : I think it was in the 35-ish zip code as I recall, but we'll give more specific guidance on that when we get to the beginning of next year. But I think you should think overall, that plan directionally remains intact and on track. Operator : Next question comes from Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets. Joseph Spak : Maybe this is definitional, but in your backlog today have been very strong [Indiscernible] Unidentified Company Representative : Rid of the backlog. Joseph Spak : But, the midpoint of the range for the year is basically equal to what you did in the backlog for the first half. So, can you just explain the bridge between the two metrics? Are you saying there's no backlog in the back half? Kevin Nowlan : Yes, I think I backlog in outgrowth are two slightly different things. Backlog is basically outgrowth before you consider pricing. Outgrowth actually is backlog net of pricing. And so if you look at what our backlog, actually is to date through the first six months, I think it's around $525 million or so. Our backlog for the full year effectively If you take the outgrowth and you add pricing back to it, we\u2019re somewhere in the $580 million $730 million range. So there's a -- that's kind of how we get to the walkout towards the backlog. Joseph Spak : Okay, thank you. And then Just on the Mach-E and the IDM. One, maybe you could let us know when Ford sort of brought you into the process? And, I know you mentioned some other suppliers. Are you at liberty to mention if one of those other suppliers on like the power electronics is Delphi? And then finally on that you talked about how your integration expertise really helps with this business. But if you have all the elements [Indiscernible] ready [Indiscernible] Fred Lissalde : Joe, we lost a little bit there towards the end. So, yes. So Joe, we don't see at the end. But Ford and Borg has been working together for a few years on this. And right from the get go. So it's a few years back. Two, it's not the power electric supplier. And three, yes, with the portfolio that we have added over the past years, we sit in a position to do the whole thing. But again, as I mentioned before, we don't ask too, and we were very, very constructive with BOEs and depending on what they want to do and what they want to work with and we're absolutely flexible. Operator : Next question comes from it comes from Brian Johnson. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, team. This is Jason on for Brian. Kevin, you've already given some good color around 2021. I was just going to try to ask again, because I think 2020, it is fairly straightforward, but as we think after 2021, I was wondering, if you could maybe just comment on how the cost base in 2021, the fixed cost base compared to that of 2020? And I guess the moving pieces I would wonder about are the incremental restructuring savings that we're supposed to get in 2021, have any of those been brought forward into 2020? Any step up in engineering that we need to think about? And then any COVID-related inefficiencies in 2020 that may bleed into 2021? Sort of all of those things wrapped together, should we still see the fixed cost base lower next year versus this year? Kevin Nowlan : Yes. I think it's premature for us to start talking about 2021. But I can comment on a few of those elements. I mean from a restructuring perspective, as I mentioned in response to Rod's question earlier, we are on-track for executing against the plan that we've laid out a few months ago, and I wouldn't say there's any accelerations or delays in that plan. I think it's right on track. So I think it's fair to think about the incremental that we were showing back in February going from 2020 to 2021 to remain intact. From an engineering and R&D perspective, I think you should continue to expect us to invest in that low 4% to 4.5% range as a percent of revenue. Now this year it'll be elevated because we're sustaining our dollar investment in R&D around that $400 million level, and that's a conscious decision we made as a leadership team in this environment to sustain our investment, supporting long-term growth prospects for the company, because we have strong liquidity and strong cash flow generation. And then in terms of the inefficiencies arising from COVID-19, I think we're going through that process right now, as we're building our long-range plans to understand, what if any types of efficiencies do we expect to carry into next year? The last thing obviously, and we're not prepared to comment on it further as we start to think about 2021. Obviously, we expect to close on the Delphi transaction in the second half of this year, and that's going to obviously have some meaningful implications on what 2021 looks like as a consolidated company. So those are some of the things to consider. Unidentified Analyst : Understood. Okay. Very helpful. And maybe just on your last point. Just a quick clarification on the Delphi deal. Can you remind us of what the last jurisdiction requiring approval is? And I think you mentioned what happened in the next month, is the approval of that jurisdiction really the last bottleneck in this deal? I know there's a exchanging need to do with the Delphi bonds. But if you could just maybe remind us of what the bottlenecks are between now and when the deal closes? Kevin Nowlan : Yes. The last year of restriction that we have at this point is the European Union, and we've been going through interacting with the regulators and going through that administrative process. And we think where we are in that process keeps us on track for closing in the second half of the year consistent with what we've been saying for the last number of months.  So that is really the last major I\u2019d say administrative hurdle between now and closing the other big one that we had were obviously the other fix jurisdiction, which are now behind it as well as the Delphi shareholder vote which took place back in late June and received overwhelming support from the shareholders.  So I'd say, that's really the last major step. And then as we get to closing that, then Delphi will have to test the conditions to closing to make sure that they meet those. And we fully expect that they'll be on track to do that. But we'll obviously set the time we get to closing. Operator : Next question comes from Chris McNally with Evercore. Chris, Your line is open. Chris McNally : Yes, thanks so much for taking my question. And I think you\u2019ve covered the margin. Maybe two questions on a little bit of the cadences of outgrowth. And this is more qualitative. And I know we're not committing on '21 or '22. But I think as we see these EV wins announcements and as a lot of people are seeing the amount of new EV introductions is only going to accelerate as we get into sort of the 2022 timeframe. I know you've talked about this sort of balanced approach where you have a rough 5% outgrowth. But maybe you can just add a little qualitative commentary to can we see that outgrowth gets better '21 into 2022. Because we have just opposing forces '21 is going to be the height of all things, legacy power training to be a great outgrowth to you. But then, if you make any new announcements on products that are coming in 2022 that leads us to think that there's also growth. So maybe just a little bit qualitative but how we think about when these EV product could start to really be accretive to the overall outgrowth number. Fred Lissalde : Yes, Chris. So electrification accelerates our growth. And being E or H what you see is that everything that is being booked at this point in time is going to see daylight past 2022 and business for 2022 is pretty much already overloaded. And, this is in our goal of outgrowing the market year-by-year by 500 basis points and we are on track to do that the current guide for the free year for 2020s 450 basis points to 600 basis points. So that's what I would tell you also. I will also tell you that we see, we don't see a slowdown of requests for quote or systems support and discussion at a very high level between OEMs and BorgWarner to discuss the next generation IDMs but also the next generation, most advanced hybrid architectures. Chris McNally : That's great. And then maybe just a question around the more near term scale. This idea of diesel within the net. I think a 1.2, probably about two years ago, we thought sort of the \"diesel drag\" would be sort of done late '19 into 2020. The diesel numbers are less bad than we feared. At what point we sort of stopped talking about diesel where it probably doesn't have a mix and sort of Europe is balanced from gasoline versus diesel turbo. When are we essentially fully unbalanced on the European diesel front? Fred Lissalde : So, I think you're right. I think you see the quarter-over-quarter reduction reducing. So it's flattering around 29%, 30% take rate. We are starting, we've outgrew that diesel market for few quarters. I think we're going to stop lapping the European diesel benefits that started in the second half of '19. And I would say that in 2021, the diesel headwinds will stop fitting away and you won't see any impacts at all soon. Chris McNally : That's great. So, if we see 30% to go to 20% from 2020 to 2025. You think that by that point you'll be balanced. So, you won't be really talking about a drag, even though the number of diesel will be going down. Fred Lissalde : I would say so. Chris McNally : Okay, great. Thank you so much, guys. Operator : Next question comes from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Noah Kaye : I guess first on the subject of the vertical integration of some of these electric solutions. Just given that there's been some focus on that with the Ford announcement this morning. Maybe a couple of weeks ago, you announced the three awards in China, just apply the IDM three new electric models. I presume those \u2013 well with the exception of power electronics those are vertically integrated for you. You're supplying a complete solution there. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : Yes. Noah Kaye : Okay. Is it generally the trend? Or do you see a regional variation in trends where you are tending to have more vertical integration in one geography versus another? So, can you provide color on that? Fred Lissalde : There is no geographic trends. It's certainly not a one size fits all. You see customers that want us to integrate the full system and we do that and we capitalize on our integration and system knowledge and experience. If some customers would want us to supply transmission and motor, so we're flexible. It is true that, more will come as we are adding more products in our portfolio and be able to delete all and by doing that drive the maximum efficiency out of that device. But again, there is not one size fit all, and totally as far as we're concerned more to on this field. Noah Kaye : Okay. And last question, I think we've seen an uptake in interest and frankly in public capital market access for alternative power trains on the commercial vehicle side in the last quarter both EVN fuel cell. Can you talk a little bit about the positioning and the interest level you're seeing from customers on the commercial vehicle side? And where that interest might be coming from a medium duty electric bus, regional delivery. Just how are you positioned and how is the interest? Fred Lissalde : All of the above. We see a decent acceleration in electrifying different vehicles, including long haul trucks, with different types of technologies. Obviously that vehicle will be the biggest volume for us. But we're very committed in supporting commercial vehicle electrification to. With all the products portfolio that we have. There is no variable product in the propulsion area from an electrification standpoint that we can supply. So we're supporting all our customers and commercial vehicle included. And yes, we see an acceleration in this field. Operator : This question comes from Ryan Brinkman with JP Morgan. Ryan Brinkman : Hi, thanks for taking my question. Firstly, are you able to quantify the non-repeat in the back half or I don't know maybe even the catch up from any austerity measures taken in 2Q. I'm trying to gauge the degree to which the implied back half decremental guide may be driven in part by conservatism versus something maybe more specific you're seeing from a cost perspective such as you mentioned R&D. Just given, the outlook for 30% decremental for the full year versus 26% in 1Q and 28% in 2Q, as hopefully the industry backdrop in the back half should be improved quite a bit from the first. Kevin Nowlan : Yes. I mean not going to dimension the specifics of each component of how we mitigated the decremental margin. We're able to manage it down to 28%. But obviously, you can imagine our contribution margin as well north of 28%. And so the types of things that we had to execute to manage to that level include the restructuring actions, which are providing a tailwind and are more sustainable and permanent from a cost reduction perspective.  But then, we do have benefits coming from some of those temporary actions like the temporary layoffs in the wage reduction. So those will creep into the second half. We'll also see some level of higher R&D spend in the second half of the year. As I look sequentially from Q2, we were a little bit lighter in the second quarter than where our full year run-rate average is expected to be. And then the other thing just to keep in mind, Q4 decrementals are going to be impacted mathematically by the fact that we're jumping off a 13% plus operating margin from a year ago.  And so that just makes the comp pretty challenging as you look at Q4. Ryan Brinkman : Okay, that's helpful. Thanks. And then maybe lastly, a question on the integrated drive module win. Ford is into -- they have a lot more electric vehicles coming down the pike with their Team Edison initiative. I'm curious if your work on the Mach-E puts you in a strong position to win additional awards with that automaker? Or if you can't comment, specifically, maybe just any kind of an update you can provide on what your discussions with automakers have been like with regard to IDM\u2019s. Maybe what those discussions have been like since coronavirus. I think, announced towards generally across the sector have slowed a little bit as automakers have sort of focused on the crisis. But I'm curious if behind the scenes, you see discussions with regard to electric vehicles accelerating. Fred Lissalde : The development and the design work for propulsion architectures in electric vehicles and hybrids are being done and on time is pursuing a sense with confidence that our wells are going to carry on. And again more to come on this field, we are very uniquely positioned, especially with the Delphi Technologies acquisition to add again, both mechanical motor and power electronics under one roof and being able to work on all the types of efficiencies that those subsystem interact with.  And so we think that we are well positioned to supply whatever customers asked us work on either system or sub-systems. So its moving at the right pace, and I'm happy with what I'm seeing. Operator : Next question comes from Armintas Sinkevicius with Morgan Stanley. Armintas Sinkevicius : With regards to the Delphi integration, I'm curious, what you've seen since you announced the transaction that, maybe progressing better or worse than you expected? I think the first quarter results were quite strong for Delphi and they had similar benefits from diesel with regards to their growth over market the decrementals were a bit better. So maybe, then things like there's some momentum there around GDI power electronics that wasn't really the case in the last couple of years. And maybe you can comment on where your integration teams are working on it? And what you learn from the company over the last several months? Fred Lissalde : What I would say is that, we're very pleased on how the integration teams and the match payers on both sides are working and collaborating in a virtual environment. This is, we have not missed a beat and very, very happy with the way those teams interact and create value. We're not in a position to update the financials. We do that closer to the closing date. But it's moving at the right pace, and I really liked the engagement and the results that I'm seeing. Fred Lissalde : Okay. And then maybe on the cost side, your restructuring actions are helping you get to those 30% decremental margins for the back half of the year. I think their cost actions is being like we're also necessary to drive their incremental decremental margins at the rate that you'd be comfortable with in order to get to those 11% margins. Maybe you could talk to, where there be opportunities for upside from the restructuring program, outside of the normal course of incremental decremental margins for either company? Kevin Nowlan : With respect to the restructuring, we're pleased with the fact that, our program remains on track. I mean, both the program we announced a year ago, about 15, 16 months ago as well as the program we announced earlier this year, which was a pretty aggressive program to manage and sustain our margin profile to offset headwinds, including things like COVID-19, which we didn't know about at the time. So, it was a proactive measure to sustain our margin profile, and we're going to execute against that plan to help to mitigate the impact of things like COVID or whatever else might get thrown at us. From a Delphi perspective, I'm not going to comment in detail on their business other than overall we're pleased with the progress they've made on their restructuring programs and feel like they're on track delivering what they've committed directionally. I think you'll see, I think they'll file their financials today or tomorrow, and so you'll get to see what their results are looking like here for the second quarter, but directionally we're pleased with what we see and we'll give a more fulsome update as a financial outlook of the combined companies when we get to closing. Operator : Next question comes from Dan Levy with Credit Suisse. Dan Levy : So two questions on backlog. First, when I look at the $2.1 billion through your backlog back in February, obviously there is a production assumption underlying that. So we do have a lower environment. Could you give us a sense of how you might be thinking about how much you need to haircut that that backlog? Or is it potentially in fact, given that you have a more favorable environment on hybrids or how do think the haircut on backlog? Kevin Nowlan : Yes, I'm not sure the haircut you'd be referring to. But I mean directionally we're pleased with our backlog shaping up this year. As we entered 2020, we actually expected that we were going to have lower revenue outgrowth and what we're actually seeing is. And that's really across the globe. So our backlog in total, if you look at it, we're guiding for $580 million to $730 million of backlog coming through our P&L in 2020.  In terms of what are 2021 through 2023 and beyond horizon looks like? Not prepared to provide any updates to that other than directionally. I think we still feel very confident about the fact that we're going to deliver 500 basis points of outgrowth from a BorgWarner standalone perspective in terms of what our overall outgrowth is expected to be over those years. Some years might be higher or lower than others. But on average, we should be in that 500 basis point zip code.  And the good news is that's actually playing out this year in 2020, as well which we didn't anticipate as we started the year. Dan Levy : That's helpful. And then just a follow-up also on backlog. So we notice majority is fine. We heard some good news in the quarter. I think hybrids getting better credit in the NAV system in China. So what can you tell us on hybrid demand in China? Is this potentially upside to your backlog? And to the extent we do have an uptick in hybrids in China, what would be the timing of this incremental demand. Do you think this is over the next year or two or is this really outside of your three year planning period and more so beyond 2022? Fred Lissalde : So, no, you're absolutely right. And I think we we've always been talking about the fact that electrification -- and in China is not only battery electric vehicle, but it's also including the most advanced hybrid propulsion architectures. We see launches, we see our request for quotation, we see partnership with Chinese OEMs on hybrids. And we\u2019re part of that. Will it have an impact before the end of the current backlog season, probably not. Because this will be launched pass the backlog season will for the majority of the businesses. But when you see more hybrid powertrains in China, especially the most advanced hybrid absolutely, yes. Operator : We have time for one final question. That question comes from [Indiscernible] with Nomura. Unidentified Analyst : Just regarding China. I had a -- I just wanted to check with your situation and overall business situation in China. That during the first half the sales of EV kind of fell much faster than the overall market. So are you seen any cancellations of EV programs? Or how's the business developing? And do you see the trend improving in the latter half if is this going to continue? Fred Lissalde : So, the trend of electrification, we think is profound It's not going to be a quarter-over-quarter steadily increase. You'll just see some ups and downs. So we see some downs in the first half in China, but the long-term trends as far as we're concerned, we think is unchanged. It's just timing related. We see some programs related, but we see a lot of focus in getting this done and bringing those hybrid and electric power trains into the market place. And it\u2019s really in other parts of the world too. It is essential when you look at the newly published regulations. It is essential for all of us to move into cleaner and more energy-efficient power trains being electrical or hybrid or also efficient combustion powertrain, efficient combustion powertrain that I meant. So, it's accelerating and we're not missing a beat. Patrick Nolan : With that, I'd like to thank you all for good questions today. Sharon, you can go ahead and close out the call. Operator : That does conclude BorgWarner 2020 second quarter results conference call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Jerome, and I will be your conference facilitator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BorgWarner 2020 Third Quarter Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to Patrick Nolan, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Nolan, you may begin your conference. Patrick Nolan : Thank you, Jerome, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. We issued our earnings release earlier this morning. It's posted on our website, borgwarner.com, on our homepage and on our Investor Relations homepage.  With regard to our Investor Relations calendar, we will be attending multiple conferences between now and our next earnings release. Please see the Events section of our Investor Relations homepage for a full list.  Before we begin, I had to inform you that during this call, we may make forward-looking statements, which involves risks and uncertainties as detailed in our 10-K. Our actual results may differ significantly from the matters discussed today. During today's presentation, we will highlight certain non-GAAP measures in order to provide a clearer picture of how the core business performed for comparison purposes with prior periods. When you hear us say at a comparable basis, that means excluding the impact of FX, net M&A and other noncomparable items. When you hear us say adjusted, that means excluding noncomparable items. When you hear us say organic, that means excluding the impact of FX and net M&A.  We will also refer to our growth compared to our market. When you hear us say market, that means the change in light vehicle production weighted for our geographic exposure. Our outgrowth is defined as our organic revenue change versus the market.  Please note that we've posted an earnings call presentation to the IR page of our website. We encourage you to follow along with these slides during our discussion.  With that, I'm happy to turn the call over to Fred. Frederic Lissalde : Thank you, Pat, and good morning, everyone. We are very pleased to share our results for Q3 today and provide an overall company update, starting on Slide 5. The industry production rates steadily improved throughout the quarter as volumes in China and North America exceeded our expectation. Importantly, we continued to outperform on a relative basis. With approximately $2.5 billion in sales, we were up about 1% organically, and this compares to a market being down about 2%. This means we saw continued outgrowth in the quarter.  We saw a significant outgrowth in China, driven by DCT and commercial vehicle business. We also outperformed in North America, driven by new programs and beneficial mix. Our incremental margin performance was very strong as revenue trends exceeded our expectations, and we benefited from our restructuring savings and temporary wage reductions. We also delivered significant positive free cash flow. And we completed the acquisition of Delphi Technologies shortly after the close of the quarter. We're excited to move forward as one company and capitalize on our product leadership. Let's now turn to Slide 6, where you can see our perspectives on the global industry production. As you can see by the chart on the slide, the industry backdrop in the second half has significantly improved from the environment that we experienced during the first half. It's important to note that the market environment is still volatile, with the risk of future disruptions arising from COVID-19. As you've seen the latest lockdowns announcement in Europe announced last night, the risk level of these potential disruptions has elevated, and we're monitoring the situation very closely. With that important caveats in mind, on a full year basis, overall, our industry production expectations for the full year have improved. We expect the market decline to be in the minus 18.5% to minus 19% range compared to our prior expectation of a 22% to 25% decline. Looking at this by region, we're planning for Europe to be down in the 23% to 24% range. And in North America, we expect a 20% to 21% decline. On a relative basis, the outlook for China is stronger, but we still expect 7% to 9% decline for the full year.  As you see from the line chart, we expect a low to mid-single-digit decline in Q4. As we manage the balance of 2020, we will continue to maintain a very active dialogue with both our customers and our suppliers to manage any production volatility. Let's now discuss some new business awards. First, I'm happy to announce, on Slide 7, our second eTurbo award with a major European OEM launching in 2023. Our eTurbo is an efficient solution capable of delivering crucial benefits for our partners, especially in hybrid application. The in-house association of the mechanical, in this case, the turbo, the state-of-the-art motor and an electronic controller was key for us to win.  Next, I would like to summarize our latest inverter win that was announced in September on Slide 8. We're partnering with a premium European OEM to supply our 800-volt silicon carbide inverter for their next-generation battery electric vehicle. This business will launch in 2024 and is another great win in power electronics. Our 800-volt silicon carbide inverter significantly improves efficiency and range, whilst enabling, through the 800-volt architecture, a 50% charging time reduction. We're excited to build upon the momentum of this win and position BorgWarner as a leading supplier of inverters for future battery electric vehicles.  I would like to give you a little more detail on our planned customer engagement on vehicle electrification on Slide 9. We had been looking forward to engaging with our customers about our expanded electrification product offerings after the closing of the Delphi transaction.  And we're excited to report that we've hit the ground running post-closing, with customer meetings currently underway. We have plans to meet with customers representing 70% of the global industry volume over the next 4 months. We will be pursuing both full system and component opportunities with these customers.  The charts on the right are just a sampling of the programs we expect to pursue. We believe that we are very well positioned to secure our share of the expected industry award activity over the next 12 to 24 months.  Before I turn it over to Kevin, let me summarize our third quarter results and our outlook on Slide 10. We achieved a better-than-expected outgrowth in the third quarter, driven by new business in China. Our margin performance has been solid. Despite the industry challenging -- challenges throughout 2020, we delivered strong year-to-date free cash flow.  As I look forward, I'm excited about our positioning as we look to capitalize on the profound industry shift towards electrification. Wins, like the 800-volt silicon carbide inverter and the eTurbo, only helps support our continued and accelerated evolution. It is our people and their efforts that allow us to manage through a year like 2020, while continuing to secure our future position in the industry. I am very proud of the teams. With that, I will turn over to Kevin. Kevin Nowlan : Thank you, Fred, and good morning, everyone. Given the number of financial topics we have to get through this morning, I'm going to dive right into the details. So let's turn to Slide 11. As we look at our year-over-year revenue walk for Q3, you can see that modestly stronger foreign currencies increased revenue by about 0.8% from a year ago. Excluding this impact, our organic sales were up almost 1% compared to a roughly 2% decline in weighted average market production. That means we delivered 280 basis points of outgrowth in the quarter.  In China, we outperformed the market by about 17%. Strong DCT demand was the biggest contributor of the sizable outgrowth in the quarter. But our China commercial vehicle business also outperformed, although the CV good news in China was largely offset by commercial vehicle declines in other regions.  In North America, we outperformed the relatively flat market by approximately 2%, driven by strong mix and new programs. From a mix perspective, our slightly overweight position in SUVs and pickup trucks continues to bode well for our ability to deliver outgrowth in the region. And in Europe, our light vehicle organic revenue was down 12% compared to the market decline of approximately 8%. As we've discussed for several quarters, we've been outperforming light vehicle diesel in Europe since the third quarter of last year. However, we've now started to lap this market outperformance, which simply means that diesel will start to become a bit of a headwind again. Nonetheless, even with this headwind, we delivered another quarter of meaningful outgrowth.  Now let's look at our earnings and cash flow performance, which can be found on Slide 12. Our third quarter adjusted operating income was $317 million compared to $294 million in the third quarter of 2019. This yielded an adjusted operating margin of 12.5%, which was up compared to the 11.8% in the third quarter of 2019.  On a comparable basis, adjusted operating income increased $25 million on $20 million of higher sales. This earnings performance in the quarter was driven by our ability to successfully convert on the revenue recovery and the benefit of our restructuring actions in some of the temporary wage reductions we implemented earlier in the year.  Adjusted earnings per share was $0.88 for the quarter, which was lower than a year ago due to a higher tax rate this year. The higher tax rate was driven by a U.S. tax regulation change announced at the end of the quarter, which will limit our ability to utilize certain foreign tax credits to offset future tax obligations.  Moving to cash flow. We're proud of the fact that we generated $390 million of positive free cash flow during the third quarter. Fundamentally, we demonstrated our ability to convert operating income into cash flow.  In addition to that, we drove inventory performance that was better than we anticipated, and we saw some accelerated customer collections as certain customers paid early in China in advance of the Golden Week holiday period that started on October 1. Our year-to-date cash flow performance positions us very well to deliver higher full year free cash flow than what we were previously projecting. I'll talk about that more in a moment.  Before I discuss our updated full year outlook, I wanted to take a few minutes on Slide 13 to review the expected impact of Delphi Technologies on our Q4 outlook. Starting with revenue. We expect the acquired businesses to contribute between $950 million and $1 billion of revenue to our Q4 results, which will be down 5% to 10% from Delphi's reported fourth quarter revenue last year. We expect the adjusted baseline operating margin for the Delphi businesses to be in the range of 4.7% to 6%, inclusive of $10 million in synergies.  This lower year-over-year margin is the result of downside conversion on the combustion portfolio being only partially offset at this point by the benefits from restructuring actions. This is in line with what we've told you to expect for this business. Specifically, we don't expect to see the stand-alone business before synergies to return to 2019's level of margin performance until we see both the restructuring initiatives fully implemented in 2022 and a recovery of revenue to pre-COVID levels.  In addition to the baseline performance of the Delphi businesses, we're anticipating between $55 million and $60 million of annualized purchase price amortization. That means we expect to have around $15 million in amortization each quarter. So inclusive of this amortization, we expect that Q4 adjusted operating income impact of $30 million to $45 million from the acquisition. And finally, from a free cash flow perspective, we expect our fourth quarter cash flow to be impacted by approximately $100 million of transaction-related costs at or around the closing and the cost of achieving synergies during the quarter.  Now that you have a good understanding of how the Delphi acquisition is expected to impact our Q4 results, let's talk about our consolidated full year outlook on Slide 14. Our guidance is based on the end market assumptions that Fred reviewed earlier, with global production being down 18.5% to 19%. Also, we expect to drive market outgrowth for the full year of approximately 550 to 600 basis points, which is at the high end of our prior guidance of 450 to 600 basis points. Based on these assumptions, our 2020 organic revenue would decline by 12.5% to 13.5% year-over-year. Then adding the Q4 revenue from Delphi Technologies, we're projecting total 2020 revenue to be in the range of $9.7 to $9.85 billion.  From a margin perspective, we expect our full year adjusted operating margin to be in the range of 8.7% to 9.0%. This contemplates the legacy BorgWarner business delivering full year decrementals in the 30% range, consistent with our prior guidance. Now this implies a somewhat higher Q4 decremental margin as a result of the relatively strong 13.3% margin from a year ago, which makes for a difficult comparable; Q4 R&D that we expect will be higher by about $25 million as we continue to fund investment in our long-term organic growth opportunities; and our expectation that we'll experience some level of COVID-related costs and inefficiencies that impact our operational performance. This guidance range also contemplates the impact of adding Delphi Technologies to the mix, which means that we're adding up to $1 billion of revenue in Q4, with much lower operating margin for the reasons I noted earlier.  Let's turn to Slide 15, where you can see our updated free cash flow guidance. Year-to-date, we've generated $546 million of free cash flow, which we view as a tremendous achievement in this very challenging end market environment. As COVID-19 hit, we focused our team on taking the actions necessary to manage decremental margins, while at the same time managing working capital and capital expenditures prudently. The results speak for themselves.  As we look ahead to the full year, we now expect to generate between $575 million and $625 million of free cash flow before the $100 million of expected Delphi Technologies transaction-related costs and cost of achieving synergies that I mentioned earlier. But even with the Q4 headwinds arising from the transaction, we still expect to deliver $475 million to $525 million in free cash flow, a significant increase from our prior guidance. This positions us to continue investing in our future growth opportunities, while maintaining a focus on returning cash flow to shareholders.  So let me summarize my financial remarks. Simply put, we had another strong quarter. In spite of overarching industry pressures, we delivered outgrowth at the high end of our expectations. We delivered a strong operating margin for the quarter, back to levels we've seen in recent years. And we converted our earnings to free cash flow, both for the quarter and on a year-to-date basis.  So as we wrap up this quarter and look ahead to the balance of the year, we're confident in reinstating our margin guidance and in raising our 2020 expectations for both revenue and free cash flow. With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Pat. Patrick Nolan : Thank you, Kevin. Jerome, we're ready to open up the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from John Murphy with Bank of America. John Murphy : I just want to ask a first question around the fourth quarter and then into 2021 on trucks in North America. The F-150, I think they were talking about being down about 100,000 units in the fourth quarter. I'm just curious what kind of impact, Kevin, you think that has.  But then we're going through this sort of new truck boom, right? It's been going on for a while, but it seems like it's strengthening as we go into 2021 and beyond with some product launches. And that's very good for your business. Just curious how you think about that going forward, Fred, and what kind of opportunity there is in your backlog and what you might be able to win. I know it's a little less sexy than EVs, maybe, but it's still pretty sexy on the profit side. Kevin Nowlan : John, it's Kevin. I'll start with that. On the Ford F-150, obviously, we are seeing the changeover, and that is having an impact on our outgrowth, both a little bit in Q3, but a little bit more so in Q4. I'd say, from a revenue perspective, it's about a $30 million impact for us in Q4 from a revenue perspective.  But then as you alluded to, the truck mix has been a benefit for us. So when we talk about North American mix benefits that we're seeing, part of it is the benefit of having a mix that's skewed a little bit more towards truck than car than what we've seen in the past. So that is what we're seeing right now, and we're reaping the benefits of that in our outgrowth. Frederic Lissalde : Yes. And John, I just want to highlight the fact that this is exactly why we are executing a balanced strategy across combustion, hybrid, electric, with great portfolio to capitalize on the growth of electrification. If you take your question at the high level, if you look at the vehicles that are going to be produced between now and 2030, it's about 1 billion vehicle. IHS is saying 17% electrification. Let's round it to 20%.  Out of that 1 billion vehicle, 900 million vehicle will have a combustion engine, either as a combustion architecture or together with a hybrid. And we believe that it would be a mistake to ignore that profitable cash-generating revenue as well as the environmental opportunity to be supplying products on those 900 million vehicles. And I think your question is a good example. John Murphy : Okay. That's incredibly helpful. And then just a second and a follow-up question to the diesel headwind. In Europe, and just, Kevin, if you can -- I mean, I understand the comps. I mean there's some recovery and then the comps get -- are getting a little bit tougher.  But diesel headwind will still persist, presumably, in your business, but also in Delphi's business. So just curious if you think we're through the worst of this mix shift. And how should we think about that going forward? Frederic Lissalde : So John, you're right, the diesel is going down. The take rate is going down and actually pretty significantly down from Q2 to Q3. We are going to -- we outgrew that diesel market last year. And since Q3 last year, so we're starting lapping this outgrowth. And it's tough to figure out where it stops.  Certainly, we are more heavily weighted on bigger diesels. And the drop is essentially touching the smaller ones. But yes, it's going to be a bit of a headwind for us. Now you may remember that, for some of our product lines, the growth on gasoline is compensating that loss of element in diesel. And overall, this headwind will moderate in the future. Operator : Your next question comes from James Picariello with KeyBanc Capital Markets. James Picariello : Just on the timing of the Delphi cost-out synergies, is anything baked into the fourth quarter outlook? Or should the synergy capture strictly take place next year? Kevin Nowlan : Yes. In our fourth quarter, we're expecting already $10 million of synergies in those numbers that we showed on the slide in the deck. So that includes $10 million of synergies coming through in Q4. James Picariello : Got it. Okay. And then the drivers behind drivetrain's strong quarterly performance, I mean, we've seen three quarters now of, call it, double-digit market outperformance. The margins clearly came through this quarter. I mean does your guidance factor in sustainable momentum run rate around this business? And could you provide some color on the drivers from a product and regional standpoint for that segment in particular? Frederic Lissalde : So in Q3, the key drivers were a strong outgrowth on dual-clutch transmissions in China and North American mix product profile. So -- and this certainly, that DCT growth in China was above our expectation going into 2020 and going into the second half of 2020, and we converted well on those programs. James Picariello : Got it. And just one last one for me. Is there any change in your expectations for next year's incremental margins, given the stronger second half performance this year operationally. Just -- is there an element of more difficult comps relative to how you were thinking about things a few months ago? Or are 30% incremental margin still the right target for BorgWarner's base business next year? Kevin Nowlan : Yes. I mean when we speak of the 30% incrementals that we were talking about earlier this year and taking a step back, what we said is, hey, given the pace at which revenue was coming out as a result of COVID-19, we thought we would generate decrementals at about 30%. And then we said, hey, as we thought end markets recovered or rebounded from those COVID lows that we should be able to deliver incrementals on that end market recovery at the same rate at which we decrement it. And that's effectively what you saw in Q3 results, but that's not the long-term incremental profile of the company. That's really just the short-term snapback of a rebound in revenue. We still continue to think about ourselves as being a mid- to high teens incremental converter as you get beyond the snapback in end markets like we've seen here.  So I wouldn't look at next year and then layer on 30% on top of that. If you kind of look at our revenue profile, we're back to a north of $10 billion of annualized revenue here in Q3 and Q4, and we've converted on that effectively, incrementally back at the 30% like we had hoped and expected. James Picariello : Okay. So first half next year at the same decrement that you had in the first half in 2020. And then in the second half, maybe at a normalized rate. Kevin Nowlan : Yes. I think that's a fair way to think about it because we're coming off -- if you're doing a year-over-year comp, you can see the second quarter, we should expect to be at that type of an incremental because we're getting back to that -- off the end market lows in Q2 to end market norms, hopefully, in Q2 of 2021. So you would see those types of incrementals getting back to normalized markets at more of that 30%-ish type of range. But above and beyond that, our growth should be -- you should expect it to be back the way it was historically. Operator : Your next question comes from Dan Levy with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Dan Levy : First, I just wanted to ask a question on your core turbocharger business. Given the bankruptcy filing by your largest competitor in the space, is there any potential to see maybe incremental turbocharger business over the near or midterm? And then, similarly, maybe you could give us a sense of the underlying price or margin trends you've seen in terms of whether you anticipate this competitive development maybe shifting with those pricing or margin trends. So just an update on turbos given the development. Frederic Lissalde : Yes. What I would say is that balance sheet strength is certainly a competitive advantage, and that's what we're seeing in the turbo field. We're not seeing any major changes from a pricing standpoint that we've seen in the past. It remains a competitive business, where product leadership is absolutely important because turbo efficiency translates for our customers into direct impact on fuel economy. And so, in this business, like in a lot of business in our field, it's a lot around efficiency and the product leadership we can provide to our customers. Dan Levy : And I appreciate the balance sheet strength that you have. If customers view that as a good reason to use you as a sourcing solution, how long would it theoretically take for some of that incremental revenue to show up in the backlog or ultimately hitting the revenue line? Frederic Lissalde : It would take about 3 to 4 years to hit the revenue line from a sourcing event or from a booking event. Dan Levy : Okay. So nothing near term. Okay. Great. And then, second, just wanted to ask about your outgrowth trends in Europe. And we're obviously seeing a sharp inflection in Europe powertrain trends right now just as automakers are scrambling to meet these emission targets. And I know that you're more advanced hybrid and EV solutions, those don't launch for a couple of years. But maybe you could give us some color on why we wouldn't have seen maybe better Europe outgrowth this quarter in powertrain.  I mean, I know you had the tough issue with the diesel comps, and that's rolling off. But wondering why we're not seeing this more pronounced shift by automakers as they scramble, impacting you. Is it just simply portfolio -- the portfolio, and they're choosing to address it with EVs and it's not hitting sort of enhanced powertrain-type solutions right now? Frederic Lissalde : So I think you pointed a good point. I mean the diesel decline sequentially is certainly a factor. And you pointed out the second half of my answer, which is we are not extremely active into the first generation of hybrids. We're way more active into the plug-in hybrids and higher-voltage hybrids that will come in 2023 and beyond. We've announced a few wins already in past quarters. So that's the key point. Maybe one element for you is that from Q2 to Q3, diesel -- when the diesel take rate went down 370 basis points, which is one of the biggest decline quarter-over-quarter over the past several quarters. Dan Levy : Okay. So that explains a lot of what's going on there. Operator : Your next question comes from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Noah Kaye : So obviously, you kind of hit the ground running here on the Delphi integration in terms of the customer outreach. Can you talk to us a little bit about the execution on some of the ramps that we knew Delphi has and had in front of them in terms of scaling up their GDI and power electronics business? What are some of the priorities there? How do you see that tracking? Where is your focus going to be with some of those launches? Frederic Lissalde : Okay. So first of all, on GDI, I see a lot of demand. And also, I see some bookings coming our way. From a launch perspective, we're laser-focused into helping the plants to launch their products. We have, as I mentioned before, put into the fuel injection system business unit a team of excellent operators from BorgWarner. We left that business unit untouched in order to not disturb any of those launches in any shape or form. Similarly, on power electronics, we just announced a few -- the bookings over the past month. And also a very high focus on launch effectiveness across our PDS business unit. Noah Kaye : And as you've got -- I don't know how much more information you've been able to glean since the merger closing. But how do you think about the pricing and the pricing contract structures in those businesses? And anything else that you've learned incrementally that makes you more or less confident in being able to do better than kind of Delphi on a stand-alone basis was hoping to do in terms of reaching breakeven or corporate average margins in those businesses over the next 1.5 years? Frederic Lissalde : We've not seen anything dramatically different than what we looked at over the past month, so no surprises for us. Kevin Nowlan : And I think from a disciplined perspective, we are instilling the BorgWarner culture. We have a focus as we look at new programs of maintaining the discipline of driving towards a 15% ROIC on any new programs. And that's the same discipline we'll hold, whether it's a business that we acquired as part of the Delphi acquisition or part of a legacy BorgWarner position. It's the same approach that we take to the entire portfolio of businesses we have at BorgWarner. Noah Kaye : That's great. And if I could just sneak one more in. It's really around the pace of overall booking activity and quoting activity you're seeing in the space. I think we've heard from some peers that, interestingly, I mean, some bookings were still awarded in 2Q. But there was a surprising level, just ongoing engineering and development activity for what the conditions were in the pandemic. And I want to ask, if you have seen then, how you think about kind of the cadence and pace of booking activity as we are exiting the year here? Frederic Lissalde : I agree with you, Noah. I think it's amazing how teams and human beings can still strive and push forward programs during the pandemic. And we are a good proxy of that. We're spending more R&D in Q4 than prior year. And so we don't see any slowdown from an electrification trend perspective.  And so this is still very, very important for our customers to just carry on, working on those new powertrain architectures. This is becoming very, very important for them to be able to sell going forward. So we don't see any slowdown in our field. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your next question comes from John Saager with Evercore ISI. John Saager : It's John Saager on for Chris McNally. Congrats on finalizing the transaction. We saw the sort of go-to-market strategy on Slides 7 to 9, and I'm wondering if there's any upside to the initial Delphi margin outlook or order bookings from potential electrification synergies if we were to get a Democrat sweep on Tuesday. Kevin Nowlan : Yes. I'd say, just stepping back from a margin outlook, I mean, from a margin perspective, we still feel good about the direction that we're taking the business and the ability to deliver the 11-plus percent margin as we look at the run rate over the next few years. I think in terms of the impact on the near term of what an election might do, TBD, but it's part of our strategy of being balanced across combustion, hybrid and electric that, hey, we are positioned to be successful in all those environments, depending on which portion of the portfolio is growing more quickly than the others.  So if there is more emphasis on electrification here following an election, that's great. We'll look to capitalize on that. And I think the Delphi Technologies acquisition will only help that with the power electronics and electronics capabilities that they bring to the table. John Saager : Sure. Makes sense. And then does BorgWarner care if you're a fully integrated solution versus just one of the components? In other words, an OEM does the integration and then sources BWA as one of the critical components. Is it logical to think about the full integration drive module, could that be the highest-margin product for Borg? Frederic Lissalde : We had to partner and serve our customers, and so we'll be happy to provide a system like we do for the Mach-E. We'll be also happy to provide components. For us, we run the company with return on invested capital, and we will look at getting the same hurdle rates, whether it's a system or a component. John Saager : Okay. And then just -- is the -- do you think the full integration drive module, like, could that possibly be the highest-margin product that you have? Kevin Nowlan : We don't get into the margins of our specific products. But I would say, just as Fred mentioned, whether it's a component or a system offering, we look at driving the same discipline around return on invested capital. They may have different levels of capital investment requirements. But overall, we would drive that same discipline. Obviously, as you get to an integrated drive module, particularly if it has all of our components, it's a higher dollar amount than selling an individual component. And so you have the opportunity to generate more dollars. But in terms of the return on the employed capital, we maintain the same discipline of that 15% target, whether it's a component or a system. Operator : Your next question comes from Brian Johnson with Barclays. Brian Johnson : Yes. Just following up on that question. Could you maybe drill down a little bit more into the dynamic? And it's kind of represented on Page 9 between component opportunities for BEV versus integrated iDM opportunities for BEV. It looks like any components that most of the things you're chasing are inverter related.  I guess a couple of questions there. Is that a fair characterization? And then as inverters are designed to be bundled very close to or part of the motor as opposed to a stand-alone power electronics box, how comfortable are you with the Delphi product line that you got in terms of the ability to supply inverter components into highly engineered integrated modules that the OEM themselves is producing? Frederic Lissalde : Brian, first, it is kind of funny to watch that customers go in different direction. And even within a customer, some programs may go in different direction between in-sourcing and outsourcing the full system. And so that's why, first, it's important to be able to talk to the customer from a system perspective to look at the optimization of the design that can be done by BorgWarner versus what they can do. Secondly, when we talk to customers, we are not only talking to them about full system, but they absolutely understand that we can do a full system. And being able to understand the full system, from mechanical motor and electronics, is an enabler to sell a system, but it's also an enabler to sell components.  On the transmission side, when the customer does a full system, most probably, they'll do the transmission. On the motor side, there is a mix of both in-sourcing, outsourcing. On the inverter side, as I mentioned, I think, at the last quarter call, this might be the component that has the less likelihood to be in-sourced by the customer. And so there are a lot of discussion around those components, but not limited to inverters.  What I can tell you is that BorgWarner has a great technology from an inverter standpoint. And the win that I alluded to in my prepared remarks speak volume to that. That 800-volt silicon carbide is really, really, really very high technology and well managed and controlled. So we see some good tailwinds on those systems and components, both. Brian Johnson : Okay. And just a follow-on. The BEV iDM opportunity is sterling. Congratulations on the Ford wins/upcoming launch. Is there any commonality to the types of OEMs that are willing to outsource the iDM? Or whether -- when we think about some of these large skateboards that are coming out, the GM multi and the Volkswagen BEV, whether those are going to outsource their iDMs or whether they'll just be looking for components of those skateboards crystallized? Frederic Lissalde : No. We don't see common characteristics of the OEMs going through in-sourcing or outsourcing. One element is that, temporarily, we see some of the OEMs that have obligations vis-\u00e0-vis their works councils and things like that to start maybe in-source a little bit more at the start. But we don't see a common characteristics. We have opportunities in all 3 major regions of potentially getting full IDM businesses on the system standpoint. Operator : Your next question comes from David Kelley with Jefferies. David Kelley : Maybe just starting with the margin assumption for the fourth quarter. Can you give us a sense for how the BorgWarner-specific restructuring actions are going to factor in there? And just curious if you're still on track for the $50 million in incremental savings this year. Kevin Nowlan : Yes. From a BorgWarner restructuring perspective, you should assume that the Q4 on a year-over-year basis is in that $10 million to $15 million range in terms of the tailwind that it's providing. And we're definitely on track in terms of achieving the restructuring objectives from a savings perspective for the full year that we laid out before. David Kelley : Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then I wanted to also ask about your commercial vehicle exposure. You noted strength in China and weakness elsewhere. We've been hearing that from others as well. We were curious to hear what you're seeing as it relates to CV exposure trajectory in the year-end. Do you think that China tailwind starts to tail off here? And are you starting to see some signs of life and recovery in the other regions? Frederic Lissalde : So the CV China, both off-road and on-highway, has been very strong, and is still very strong, stronger than we have expected. It is not easy to figure out if this is going to carry on. But demand is strong, and we don't see signs of slowing down. For other regions, we see that business picking up, too. What we also see is an appetite from a commercial vehicle standpoint, customer standpoint to move towards electrification of their propulsion architecture, either hybrid or fuel cell or battery electric. It's going to take time. Those cycles are long in commercial vehicles, off-road and on-highway. But we see that trend, too, pretty solidly. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your next question comes from Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets. Joseph Spak : I just had a question, I guess, on where things are headed on electrification in your portfolio. I know you talked about your iDM. And my understanding is that's really sort of positioned sort of in the middle, if you will, and sort of putting power to the wheels. But as some of these larger vehicle programs come to market or being shown, it seems like the motor is closer to the wheel. And I'm curious about your capabilities there, your product offerings and whether what you can do on an iDM is transferable to accommodate some of those larger vehicles as they go electrified. Frederic Lissalde : Yes. We're looking at in-wheel motors. Right now, we don't see a path to growth in the foreseeable future, but we understand that technology. We still feel that having a structure that is closer to the traditional iDM architecture is, for now, the most probable path going forward, Joe. Joseph Spak : Okay. But what about not all the way in the wheel but just closer to the wheel, like maybe some of the larger electrified pickups coming out seem to be using that sort of structure. Frederic Lissalde : Yes. I'm not equipped to answer that question. I have to go -- I have to come back to you, Joe, on this one particular. Joseph Spak : Okay. Sure. Frederic Lissalde : Now, what I would say, though, is whether the motor is closer to the wheel or not, you're still going to have a motor, and you're still going to have an inverter. But I can't answer precisely what are the different characteristics of those products when you get those closer to the wheels. So I'll come back to you. Operator : Mr. Nolan, there are no further questions in the queue. I will hand it back to you for concluding remarks. Patrick Nolan : Thank you all for taking the time today, and thank you for your helpful questions. If you have any follow-ups, feel free to reach out to me. With that, Jerome, you can conclude today's call. Operator : That does conclude the BorgWarner 2020 Third Quarter Results Conference Call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Welcome to the BorgWarner 2020 Fourth Quarter and Full Year Results conference call. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to Patrick Nolan, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Nolan, you may begin your conference. Patrick Nolan : Thank you, Sharon. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We issued our earnings release this morning. It is posted on our website, borgwarner.com on our home page and on our Investor Relations home page.  With regard to our Investor Relations calendar, we will be attending multiple conferences between now and our next earnings release. Please see the Events section of our Investor Relations home page for a full list. Before we begin, I need to inform you that during this call, we may make forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties as detailed in our 10-K. Our actual results may differ significantly from the matters discussed today.  During today's presentation, we will highlight certain non-GAAP measures in order to provide a clearer picture of how the core business performed and for comparison purposes of prior periods. When you hear us say on a comparable basis, that means excluding the impact of FX, net M&A and other noncomparable items. When you hear us say adjusted, that means excluding noncomparable items. When you hear us say organic, that means excluding the impact of FX and net M&A.  We will also refer to our growth compared to our markets. When you hear us say market, that means the change in light and commercial vehicle production weighted for our geographic exposure. Our outgrowth is defined as our organic revenue change versus this market. Please note that we've posted an earnings call presentation to the IR page of our website. We encourage you to follow along with these slides during our discussion. With that, I'm happy to turn the call over to Fred. Frederic Lissalde : Thank you, Pat, and good morning, everyone. We're very pleased to share our results for 2020 and provide an overall company update. Starting on Slide 5. I'm very proud with our stronger-than-expected top line and cash flow performance for the year. With approximately $10.2 billion in sales, we were down about 11% organically. This compares to our market being down approximately 17%.  And so outgrowth was about 630 basis points for the year, which was ahead of our expectations going into the fourth quarter. For the full year, we saw our growth in all major regions. We delivered close to 15% outgrowth in China. Our European and North American operations outgrowth were both in the low single-digit range.  While our full year earnings per share declined year-over-year due to the impact of COVID-19, our decremental margin performance was in line with our expectations. Importantly, our margin performance was achieved while preserving R&D spending to support future growth. We delivered very strong free cash flow of $743 million for the year. This represents a record for free cash flow generation for the company. This is a testament to the intense focus we've put on improving free cash flow generation over the last few years.  While managing the operation the operational challenges of 2020, we successfully completed the largest acquisition in the company's history and secured numerous business award for electrified vehicles over the course of the year.  Now let's discuss some of those new business awards. First, I'm happy to announce on Slide 6 that we have secured an 800-volt electric motor award, with a global commercial vehicle customer launching in 2024. This program will use 4 different variants of our latest airplane motor design. Using our 800 volts rated machine, customers can significantly reduce charging time and achieve a higher power density through the 800-volt architecture, enabling an even brighter future for electric trucks and buses. I am very pleased with this program. We will continue to focus on the electrification opportunities in commercial vehicles in addition to opportunities in our light vehicle market. Next, I would like to highlight another inverter win on Slide 7. We are partnering with a major European OEM to supply our 400-volt silicon carbide inverter for the next-generation BEVs that are expected to launch in 2022. While I can't share the details of this program, I can tell you that this is our second largest inverter program to date. This illustrates our ongoing innovation in power electronics as we're leading the market trend to upgrade from silicon to silicon carbide. This enables lower energy losses and drives higher efficiency. With the latest win, I would like to give you an update of our positioning in the European inverter market on Slide 8. We've had tremendous success establishing ourselves in this market. When I think about BorgWarner's competitive advantages in power electronics, it's driven by first, the breadth of our product portfolio. This allows us to be faster and more effective at bringing products to market.  Second, our ability to innovate. We continue our innovations in part by our vertical integration strategy. We have in-house capabilities for power modules, integrated circuit development and software.  I think that the last driver is our ability to leverage the electronic scale that we already have, especially in our engine control unit business. The result is that we've secured significant new business award.  On the chart on the right side of the slide, you will see the inverter programs we've secured with 3 large European OEs. As you can see, we expect that we'll be delivering around 1.1 million inverters in 2025.  As a result of the successes we're achieving, we're increasing our R&D spending in 2021 to support our continued innovation and new business awards in our power electronics portfolio. Kevin will touch on that a little later.  Next, I would like to give you an update on the Delphi Technologies integration on Slide 9. Bottom line, all is on track. Starting with Q4 results. The Delphi Technologies contribution to both revenue and operating income was ahead of our expectations. I'm seeing good progress across all the former Delphi businesses. The cost synergies related to the Delphi transaction are tracking in line with our plan, as Kevin will discuss later.  And the customer feedback remains very positive. In addition to inverter wins that I just highlighted, we won new businesses across the rest of the Delphi portfolio, including awards in GDA. My overall takeaway is that the integration is on track from all perspectives.  Before I wrap up on Slide 10, we are announcing our plan to hold an upcoming Investor Day on March 23. The event will be virtually broadcasted from the BorgWarner world headquarters in Auburn Hills, Michigan. It will provide insights into our technologies and into the acceleration of our positioning in an electrified world. I look forward to interacting with you during the event.  So let me summarize our 2020 results and our outlook on Slide 11. 2020 was an extremely challenging year in terms of the operating environment, and we've put the health and safety of our people first. Even in this challenging environment, we delivered better-than-expected outgrowth and generated record free cash flow, and our bookings on BEVs are accelerating. We closed on the Delphi transaction. We're successfully integrating the companies, and we are on track to deliver the synergies as planned.  As we look ahead, we expect to deliver another record year of free cash flow in 2021, which enables us to continue to invest in the business to successfully position the company for the future. The demand for our efficiency improving products is growing, leading to a continued increase in our content per vehicle. In fact as Kevin will highlight, when you look at our 3-year backlog, 45% of it is already coming from e-products.  And finally, I'm excited about our long-term positioning as we look to capitalize on the profound industry shift towards electrification. We are winning. We are ramping up R&D and focusing heavily on the acceleration of the company towards electrification. With that, I'll turn the call over to you, Kevin. Kevin Nowlan : Thank you, Fred, and good morning, everyone. Before I review the financials in detail, I'd like to provide an overview of the 3 key takeaways from our fourth quarter results. First, our revenue was ahead of our guidance, driven by stronger-than-expected outgrowth and higher levels of sales from the Delphi Technologies acquisition. Second, our margin performance was better than expected, both in the legacy BorgWarner business and in the legacy Delphi business. And third, our free cash flow was very strong at $197 million in the quarter, which resulted in record free cash flow for the full year. So let's turn to Slide 12. As we look at our year-over-year revenue walk for Q4, you can see that foreign currencies increased revenue by about 3.4% from a year ago. Excluding this impact, our organic sales were up more than 6% and compared to a less than 2% increase in weighted average market production.  That means we delivered 460 basis points of outgrowth in the quarter, which breaks down as follows : In China, we outperformed the light vehicle market by about 13%. Strong DCT demand continues to be a key contributor to our sizable outgrowth in the region. In Europe, our light vehicle organic revenue performed roughly in line with the market. In North America, we underperformed the market by approximately 3%, just as we expected, primarily due to the impact of the changeover of the Ford F-150. And finally, our commercial vehicle and off-highway mbusinesses drove about 50 basis points of our outgrowth in the quarter as our China business more than offset declining commercial vehicle revenue in other regions. Now some of the strong outgrowth we delivered in Q4 and for the full year, particularly in China, was a pull forward of 2021 outgrowth. That will have an impact on our expected 2021 year-over-year outgrowth. But on a cumulative 2-year basis, we're tracking right in line with our longer-term expectations. So in the end, we're pleased with the strong finish of 2020. Moving past our backlog and outgrowth, you can see that the Delphi Technologies acquisition added a little more than $1.1 billion to our fourth quarter revenue. The sum of all this was just over $3.9 billion of revenue in Q4. Now let's look at our earnings and cash flow performance on Slide 13. Our fourth quarter adjusted operating income was $448 million compared to $340 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. This yielded an adjusted operating margin of 11.4%, which was well ahead of our margin guidance of 8.8% to 9.6% for the quarter. On a comparable basis, adjusted operating income decreased $7 million on $159 million of higher sales. Remember, we delivered outsized margin performance of 13.3% in Q4 2019, which makes for a tough year-over-year comparable. If you look at the legacy BorgWarner margin excluding the impact of Delphi Technologies, we delivered just over 12% for the quarter, which is consistent with the company's historical top quartile margin profile. Then the Delphi Technologies business added $109 million to adjusted operating income. This was well ahead of our expectations due to the higher-than-expected revenue and stronger underlying margins in the business. Moving on to cash flow. We're proud of the fact that we generated $197 million of positive free cash flow during the fourth quarter. As a result of that, our full year 2020 free cash flow came in at $743 million, which was a record level for the company. With those strong cash flow results and with our confidence in the business looking ahead to 2021, we repurchased $216 million of our shares during the fourth quarter. Let's now turn to Slide 14, where you can see our perspectives on global industry production for 2021. First, let me point out that our market assumptions now incorporate our view of the commercial vehicle and off-highway markets, given our increasing exposure to those markets. With that background in mind, we expect our global weighted light vehicle and commercial vehicle markets to increase in the range of 11% to 14% this year. Looking at this by region, we're planning for North America to be up 22% to 25%. In Europe, we expect a blended market increase of 11% to 14%. And in China, we expect the overall market to be roughly flat year-over-year, as growth in light vehicle production is offset by anticipated declines in the commercial vehicle market. Now let's talk about our full year financial outlook on Slide 15. Starting with our pro forma 2020 sales, which adds back the $2.6 billion of revenue from the first 3 quarters of Delphi Technologies in 2020. As you know, those revenues were not part of our P&L last year, but in order to provide year-over-year comparability, we thought this pro forma revenue approach for the 2020 baseline would be useful. Building on that pro forma revenue base, you can see that our end market assumptions from the prior slide are expected to drive an increase in revenue of roughly $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion. Next, we expect to drive market outgrowth for the full year of approximately 100 to 300 basis points. Embedded in that outgrowth range is a roughly 200 basis point headwind from declining light-duty diesel and a 40 basis point headwind from an expectation of normalized market share in our China commercial vehicle business after considering outsized market share in 2020.  Based on these assumptions, we expect our 2021 organic revenue to increase 12% to 17% relative to 2020 pro forma revenue. Then adding a $355 million benefit from stronger foreign currencies, we're projecting total 2021 revenue to be in the range of $14.7 billion to $15.3 billion.  From a margin perspective, we expect our full year adjusted operating margin to be in the range of 10.0% to 10.5% compared to a pro forma 2020 adjusted operating margin of 8.3%. This contemplates the business delivering full year incrementals in the low 20% range before the impact of Delphi-related cost synergies and purchase price accounting. From a cost synergy perspective, our margin guidance includes $70 million to $80 million of incremental benefit in 2021. That puts us right on track to achieve 50% of our total expected cost synergies in 2021, just as we've previously told you to expect.  One more point on our margin outlook. It's important to note that this outlook is inclusive of a planned increase in R&D spending to 5% of revenue to continue to drive the growth we're seeing in electrification opportunities. That's fully baked into the guidance. So based on this revenue and margin outlook, we're expecting full year adjusted EPS of $3.85 to $4.25 per diluted share. And finally, we have line of sight to delivering free cash flow of $800 million to $900 million, which is a significant increase over our record year in 2020.  That's our 2021 outlook. Let's turn to Slide 16 to review our medium-term growth outlook. As I mentioned earlier, we expect light vehicle diesel to be a headwind to our outgrowth in 2021. The largest portion of this headwind comes from the legacy Delphi portfolio. As you can see on the left side of this slide, we expect the impact within this business to be approximately $140 million in 2021. However, you can also see that this headwind is expected to lessen each year as we head towards 2024. This is what we saw in due diligence, which simply means that it's in line with our original planning assumptions. Now let's move to the right side of the slide, where we profile our multiyear backlog. As you know, our backlog is a net backlog, which means it reflects increases in revenue net of decreases in revenue. So the diesel headwinds from the left side are incorporated into this net backlog.  And what you can see is that even with this headwind, we still expect to deliver 100 to 300 basis points of outgrowth in 2021. Then as you look ahead to 2022 to 2024, we expect a combined net new business backlog inclusive of aftermarket growth to be approximately $2.8 billion. Importantly, we believe this 2022 to 2024 backlog supports our previously communicated midterm outgrowth for the combined company in the mid-4% range. And there's one more critical point to note about this backlog. About 45% of this net backlog is driven by our e-products, 45%. We're winning business and positioning the company for continued growth in this area.  So let me summarize my financial remarks. Overall we had a really solid year despite the headwinds resulting from COVID-19. We delivered 630 basis points of market outgrowth and $743 million of free cash flow. Not only did these results significantly exceed our most recent guidance, they also exceeded the guidance that we provided in January of last year prior to the pandemic.  Now as we head into the new year, we're focused on leveraging our financial strength to drive continued long-term profitable growth in the business. In 2021, that means we'll be keenly focused on delivering on our near-term financial commitments, successfully integrating the Delphi acquisition, and continuing to make the necessary investments to win electrification business that will secure outgrowth and financial strength long into the future. With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Pat. Patrick Nolan : Thank you, Kevin. Sharon, let's open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. First question comes from Chris McNally with Evercore. Christopher McNally : Fred, if I can ask two questions on EVs. The first is around market share. Really appreciate the color on the 3 big inverter wins with the units attached. And I know you can't give explicit numbers, but sort of if we work into what that means on a market share basis, assuming you have some Asian wins as well, you could be getting roughly a 20% share of the outsourced business.  Would just love some color about the competitive environment, because that would probably put you in the top 3 external suppliers. And obviously there's a lot of players here. It's not only inverters. We obviously have a heavily competitive in-source for motors and drivetrain. So if you could just talk about the competitive environment for e-business right now? Frederic Lissalde : Chris, we're definitely a leader in this field, and I feel really good about the progress. I see -- I feel really good about the momentum. I feel really good about the fact that the technology that we got with Delphi is really strong, high-voltage silicon carbide, driving efficiency. And I feel really good about the combination. We bring financial strength and customer intimacy, and we're booking business. And so the positioning is strong. The customer feedback is positive. I'm kind of happy where the company is right now and more to come. Christopher McNally : That's great. We received a lot of questions about this idea of sort of the legacy OEMs, right? I'd put maybe three European OEMs in that camp versus this next gen of startups. Could you talk about just what does it like to win business on the startups? Are you seeing them at a similar proportion of in-sourced first outsourced, just because it's such a new environment for everyone involved? Frederic Lissalde : Yes. We are working with both, right, both the legacy OEM, as you call them, and new startups. We have actually been pretty successful towards those 2 customer market segments. Obviously, in our business, we are in the business of long-term relationships. And that solid foundation that we have and the solid customer intimacy that we have across the world -- certainly matters. Christopher McNally : And if I could just squeeze in one last one on the profitability ramp of EV. I mean clearly there's a lower margin on any new business, any new backlog. But I guess everyone is very curious about -- since this is a much longer and much more aggressive ramp on EVs, can you talk about how does the EV business start to really flow through 2022 on? How much it may be sort of a degradation to margins? Or a rule of thumb for when EV business may actually reach corporate levels of profitability? Kevin Nowlan : Yes, Chris, this is Kevin. I'd say I mean keep in mind as we talked about in the past, we stay focused whether it's a legacy, I'll call it combustion business, or it's our new EV portfolios, that we drive toward a return on invested capital target consistently across those types of businesses. But obviously as we're in ramp-up mode for a business like our EV portfolio, we're investing a lot more in the front end, and we're not at steady state yet from a revenue perspective. So those ROIC targets are over the life of the program, but the cost tends to come in at the front end, particularly from an R&D perspective.  And so just as you saw, we talked about today ramping up our R&D to 5%. Some of that is contemplating -- it's really contemplating the increased investments we're making in that EV portfolio as we're securing new business wins. So that does become a headwind to margin in the near term on a discrete basis. But overall we're managing that within our portfolio, and you can see that in our margin guide. I mean the 10.0% to 10.5% contemplates that increase in R&D.  And you see our backlog is getting skewed more and more toward e-products, which is great. We feel great about that. And we still remain on track for our 2023 margin target, with all that considered, of delivering over 11% operating margin.  So it's obviously a business we're investing in. It creates a little pressure on margins, but we're managing that across the portfolio, and right on track to deliver with our long-term margin targets. Operator : Next question comes from John Murphy with Bank of America. John Murphy : Just a first question on the change in segmentation. And I'm just curious as you look at the new four segments, now that you've carved off or identified fuel injection and aftermarket as separate segments, are those maybe more separable and potentially could be up for sale over time, as it might be much slower growth than the other two segments? Kevin Nowlan : Yes, I guess that's not how we're thinking about it. I mean we look at those businesses, they're businesses that, from an accounting perspective, needed to be reported separately. And that's part of the reason that they reported that way. And our focus is really on growing the profitability of those 2 portfolios.  As you look at the FIS business, as Fred talked about in his remarks, we're seeing wins in GDI, and we see some real growth prospects in that business along with the leading positions that, that business already has. I think as we look at it, we see opportunity to improve the profitability of that portfolio, and that's really the focus there.  And from an aftermarket perspective, we feel good about the margin progress that we saw in that business in the fourth quarter. And we would expect to continue to drive margin performance in that business. So that's really how we look at those right now. John Murphy : Okay. And then just a follow-up, Kevin, if we think about -- I just wondering if you could give us some color on what you think about what's going on the chip disruption, what it means, shortage and the disruption in production as a result of that? Should we think about any kind of lost sales decremental?  And then also just on the outlook, I mean I think you're being very humble in the performance in the fourth quarter, because the F-150 being down really matters. Just how do you think about sort of the bounce back up as that gets up and running and the impact of mix on the F-150, and maybe more generally in the industry remaining pretty positive through 2021? Frederic Lissalde : John, what we see is certainly some kind of disruption, mostly in the first half. The second half recovery is currently unknown. What we have put in the low end of our guidance, John, is a net production impact greater than 1 million vehicle, and that's reflected in the low end of the guidance. That's for the full year. John Murphy : That's helpful. And then on the mix, particularly around the F-150? Frederic Lissalde : What's your question on the mix? John Murphy : No, I mean it was a benefit for most in the industry in the fourth quarter and through most of 2020. But obviously you got dinged a bit with the F-150 being down in the fourth quarter, so your performance was probably even better than it looked. I'm just curious as you think about mix going forward in the 2021 guidance, how strong is mix going to remain? And particularly with the ramp back up in the F-150, how big a benefit will that be? Kevin Nowlan : Yes. I mean the F-150 will definitely help us from just an overall revenue outgrowth perspective. It is the reason that we underperformed in North America in the fourth quarter. I want to say it was probably around a $25 million, $30 million type of revenue impact on us. So we would expect obviously that headwind to abate and that be -- not be an overhang on outgrowth as we look ahead to 2021. Operator : Next question comes from James Picariello with KeyBanc Capital. James Picariello : Just on the Delphi upside in the quarter, what were the primary drivers of that relative to your outlook? And because cost synergies and purchase accounting obviously came in as expected, just curious what drove that. And then can you dimension at all what's baked in for the full year guide related to Delphi's inorganic contribution? Kevin Nowlan : Yes. On the fourth quarter, I mean we were pleased with the results that came in from Delphi, both from a top line perspective and from a margin perspective. The biggest upside that we saw in terms of revenue being up effectively from the midpoint of our guide by about $145 million really came in the fuel injection and the legacy powertrain products portfolio. And so we are pleased with that performance, because that also actually helps from a margin perspective, because those are two of the stronger portions of the business from a margin contribution perspective. So that's a big driver of what caused us to generate some upside. I'd say also it's probably fair to say we were one month into the -- owning Delphi and just starting to really get our hands around some top line and bottom line drivers in the business. And so we did make some cautious assumptions as we gave Q4 guidance with respect to the Delphi portfolio, and those proved to be too conservative at the end of the day. James Picariello : Does that conservatism carry through to this year and related to the accretion framework that you laid out a few months ago? Kevin Nowlan : Yes. I think with respect to 2021, we feel really good about our ability to deliver on the guidance that we're giving, with the outgrowth of 100 to 300 basis points in totality, which basically assumes that Delphi outgrowth flat to actually slightly negative because of that diesel headwind. So we feel good about our ability to deliver on that outgrowth for the year, to deliver on that improving margin profile, the 10% to 10.5% in totality for the company, and delivering strong cash flow. And in terms of what that means for us as we look to 2021 and even beyond, we think we're right on track to deliver the greater than 11% operating margin as we progress toward 2023. James Picariello : Okay. Got it. And then just to clarify, the 45% of your $2.8 billion backlog tied to e-products, that excludes hybrid, correct? That's just battery electric? And then for the free cash flow strength, clearly apparent in the guide. The company already repurchased $216 million this past quarter. I mean how should we be thinking about the buyback effort for this year? Frederic Lissalde : So it includes a little bit of hybrid when it comes to high-voltage plug-in hybrids that are new energy -- under the new energy vehicle credits in China. That's a very small portion of the 45%. Kevin, do you want to take that? Kevin Nowlan : Yes. In terms of -- I mean as we look ahead to capital allocation priorities in 2021, I would tell you that we are actively exploring several M&A opportunities that we think accelerate our position and growth in electrification. And I would say that is a priority for us as we look into 2021. From there, we'll assess our buyback capacity through the course of the year based on how those M&A opportunities materialize. But our focus is definitely shifting towards more aggressively deploying capital to support growth initiatives and positioning in electrification. You can see that both in our R&D investment stepping up to 5% this year, and you'll see it as we continue to pursue M&A opportunities. James Picariello : Do that supplement some of the $1 billion buyback target? Kevin Nowlan : I'm sorry, say that again? James Picariello : With the potential M&A, that would supplement the $1 billion targeted buybacks? Or it doesn't... Kevin Nowlan : It doesn't supplement. It's just it's how we look at deploying the $800 million to $900 million of free cash flow this year that we expect to generate in 2021. Our priority is going to be really focused on some of these M&A opportunities that improve our positioning and growth in electrification. In terms of the $1 billion program, we remain committed to the program, as you can see by the evidence of what we did in our Q4 repurchase activity. But as it relates to how we're looking ahead here in '21 and beyond, we're definitely focused on exploring some of these key M&A opportunities that we're pursuing. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Next question comes from Rod Lache with Wolfe Research. Rod Lache : Yes, why don't I first ask you about the backlog data that you show on Slide 16? Have you historically included aftermarket in that backlog forecast? I know that last year, you had, over a 4-year period 2.5 billion to 2.6 billion prospectively. Now it's 3.2 to 3.4. I was hoping you can give us some of the pluses and minuses as you look out as far as how much Delphi contributed, what backlog contributed, and what kind of headwind you've got from combustion technologies. Kevin Nowlan : Yes. I guess the -- I mean the backlog has always included all of our revenue relative to the measurement of our market performance. And so as you look at this as well, it's included on the same basis. I mean it's a much smaller piece of the backlog than the rest of it on the OE side, primarily because our focus on the aftermarket business isn't necessarily driving rapid growth. It's making sure we sustain strong levels of profitability. Rod Lache : Okay. And how much did Delphi contribute to this backlog? Kevin Nowlan : We don't have it broken down, I think, by -- we're trying to get away from the idea of Delphi versus not Delphi. But overall when you look at this, 4.5% outgrowth is what's effectively implied by this 2022 to 2024 backlog, which I would tell you is directionally consistent with what we provided a year ago when we talked about 4.5% or mid-4% outgrowth across the combined portfolio, which had the legacy BorgWarner more in that 5% ZIP code and the legacy Delphi with some of those near-term headwinds in diesel, more in that 3%.  I'd say we're not breaking it that way anymore, but directionally, I'd say that's a fair way to think about it. But as you look ahead, Delphi is probably a little bit more of that backlog because now we're looking at 22% to 24% as opposed to 21% to 23% where there was a little bit more of that diesel headwind. Rod Lache : Okay. And just secondly, you did north of 11% margin in the quarter. And I'm wondering if that says anything about your longer-term 2023 target of 11%. I think that you'd be annualizing it at more than the $15.5 billion or so that you annualize at in Q4. So is that starting to look conservative? And if you could just repeat, did you say that inorganic or strategic actions might include divestitures as well? Or you're simply looking at more acquisitions? Kevin Nowlan : Yes. I guess on the -- when you look at the Q4 performance, we're obviously really pleased with the fact that we delivered 11.4%. And now that's an annualized revenue of $15.7 billion, so obviously higher than the run rate that we're walking into here in 2021 where at the midpoint of our guidance 15 and actually 300 million of that is even driven by currency. So Q4 is really about $1 billion higher annualized revenue than where 2021 is x foreign currency.  But I think directionally, you're looking at it the right way. We feel that between the incremental synergies that we expect to deliver even beyond 2021, which is another $85 million, with the additional margin improvement that we're driving in certain portions of the legacy Delphi businesses in particular, and with the revenue growth inclusive of that backlog we just highlighted and our ability to convert on that, we feel very comfortable with our ability to deliver on that greater than 11% margin in 2023.  And then on the other question you asked around M&A, I was actually speaking more to the acquisition side, but we do have an active portfolio management process. And I would say we're spending a lot of time thinking about that as we look ahead. Because I think you should expect that, that will be a more active part of what we're looking at on a go-forward basis. But my comments really were focused on some M&A activities -- opportunities that we're looking at that could utilize cash flow that we're generating this year. Operator : Next question comes from Dan Levy with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Dan Levy : First, I wanted to ask on Delphi. You've had the Delphi result. I believe the margin they just posted in the quarter was the best quarterly operating margin for Delphi since 2018.  Maybe you could just walk us through some of the moving pieces that drove the recovered margin in Delphi? Was it just restructuring paying off? Is it good mix? Any color would be helpful on the Delphi piece, which obviously came in much better not only versus what you were talking about in your guidance, but versus what we've seen in the recent years. Kevin Nowlan : Yes. I mean I think the first thing you look at when you look at the Q4 performance, which was in the upper 9% margin range for that as a stand-alone business, I mean keep in mind, Q4 was a really strong revenue quarter, going back to the highest levels relative to maybe a couple of years ago. So $1.1 billion in the quarter, on an annualized basis almost $4.5 billion, so that's a pretty strong level of revenue. And part of the upside that the business was seeing there came in some of the portions of the portfolio that have had historically stronger margins. So I think that's an important piece to keep in mind. That said, I think the restructuring actions that the company had been taking pre-closing and that we're continuing on a post-closing basis will continue to support that margin profile. But remember, we're continuing to offset that headwind that's coming from that legacy diesel business. And you see from my slides that in 2021, that's expected to be about $140 million revenue decline. And that comes with some outsized margin because it's a strong margin performing piece of the portfolio. And that's where the restructuring actions that we're continuing to execute that legacy Project Pioneer are helping to mitigate the impact of those headwinds. But overall when you look at it, it was strong margin and getting some tailwind from some of the cost performance actions that the business has been executing over the last couple of years. Dan Levy : Okay. And then just another follow-up on Delphi. You've had now Delphi under your roof for a quarter. Maybe you could just give us an update, I guess similar always to the line of questions from some of the prior folks, an update on your restructuring programs. You have your own core restructuring program. This is being one in parallel with Delphi's restructuring program, Pioneer. How long before we could see maybe incremental restructuring actions? Does that contemplate -- maybe you've talked about there's an ongoing portfolio process, but more on head count, footprint, et cetera. I mean how long before, I guess, we start to really see, I guess, a steady-state BorgWarner with everything fully cleaned up? Kevin Nowlan : Well, I... Frederic Lissalde : So what I would say is restructuring is part of what we do, and we always want to do that in a position of strength. We did restructuring, we are on track. Delphi did Pioneer, we are continuing that, we are on track. And on top of that, we have the synergies, and also we are on track. Dan Levy : And potential for additional actions? Or... Kevin Nowlan : Yes, I think we're really focused on completing the actions that we're already in the midst on. The restructuring program that we announced about a year ago on the legacy BorgWarner side is going well. And we have more actions that we're executing on as we go through '21 and 22, so we're focused on executing that. Project Pioneer still has some more work to do predominantly in 2021, and we're going to continue to execute that program through '21 and a little bit into '22. And then we have the cost synergies that we're executing on.  So we have a lot on our plate right now already that we're really focused on delivering on, and we would expect those to be completed over the next couple of years. And then we'll take stock of where we are and if there's anything else we need to do at that point. Operator : Next question comes from Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank. Emmanuel Rosner : I was hoping to follow up a couple of questions, again on the backlog. So maybe tackling it from a different angle, what I'm trying to understand is really what pieces are growing sort of like at what pace? And what pieces of the business are sort of either slowing down or fading?  So if I take last year's backlog, which was on a BorgWarner stand-alone basis, I think for the half year 3-year period, it was 2.1 billion, which was about 700 million a year. Now you're [indiscernible] you're talking still about 700 million a year or so, $2.8 billion over the 4 years. But obviously in the meantime, light vehicle production has gone worse in terms of the outlook, but you also integrated Delphi within it.  And so can you please give us a sense of in your backlog, how do you sort of shake out with a similar level of, I guess, revenue outgrowth? What are the puts and takes within that? Frederic Lissalde : I would say, Emmanuel, that the backlog is in line with what we discussed over the past quarter, leading to outgrowth to south of 500 basis points. I'm very, very happy with the fact that, as we discussed before, 45% of that backlog is on e-products. And the rest is all-wheel drive and turbos and a little bit of emissions. But 45% pure e, except those products that go in high-voltage BEV in China, which is small within that 45%.  This is a very, very good performance. I think it speaks volume to our ability to win one. And it speaks volume to our ability to deliver growth in this growing segment, leading to additional content per vehicle in this segment. So I feel pretty good about where we are. Kevin Nowlan : And just one thing to correct, Emmanuel, the $2.8 billion we display is a 3-year number, just 2022 to 2024. Emmanuel Rosner : Okay, yes. No, that's that makes sense. And then I guess one way you used to break it down as well the backlog was maybe is versus hybrid versus EVs, I guess across technologies. So would you have a similar breakdown for your current backlog? Frederic Lissalde : So we don't -- again, 45% is in e, okay? And the rest is either in CE or in H, but 45% of the backlog are products that translate into BEV. Kevin Nowlan : And then on a net basis if you're referring to how we've broken it out a little bit, electrification including hybrid, over 100% of that net backlog on a net basis is coming from hybrid and electric. But we're really starting to focus more and more as we talk to you about the e-products, to make sure you have visibility on the e-products that are really truly applicable to the battery electric vehicles. And that's the point of this 45% of the backlog that we're really focused on. But over 100% of the net backlog is effectively hybrid and electric vehicles. Frederic Lissalde : That's right. Emmanuel Rosner : Okay. Great. And then as a follow-up, the R&D needs towards electrification going to 5% of revenue, you view it as a sort of new steady state or multiyear state? Or is it sort of like an initial larger investment? Kevin Nowlan : Yes. We expect as we look ahead that our R&D is going to be at that level, 5%. Maybe even a little bit higher than that 5%, to the low 5s as we look out over the next couple of years, and still in line with our ability to deliver on our margin targets as we look ahead to 2023.  So I think you should think from a planning perspective, because of the momentum that we have and the wins that we're seeing in the marketplace in electrification, that we're going to continue to invest more aggressively, probably in that 5% to even upwards of 5.5% range over the coming years. Operator : Next question comes from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Noah Kaye : I'm glad we got to touch a little bit already on cash flow. Because the free cash flow performance was very strong, and the guide is very strong compared to consensus. So can we talk a little bit about the CapEx component of that 4.5% of sales, I guess? Near the low end of the historical range after you conserved CapEx in 2020. Can you give us a little bit of color on what drives sort of this relatively low CapEx level? Are there fewer product launches this year? When, if at all, would you see that reverting back towards sort of the 5% or 5.5% level? Kevin Nowlan : As you look at us over the last few years, I mean I know we've talked about being in that 5.5% range or even progressing toward 5%. I think you can see over the last few years, we've actually been more in that mid- to high 4% range. And as we've really scrubbed our planning and looked at that on a go-forward basis, I think we're probably going to be in that 5%-ish range on a go-forward basis. This year a little bit lighter, but it's actually pretty comparable to the types of CapEx investment we've been investing over the last few years. So I think for this year, you can see it's kind of in the 4.5%. Maybe it will trend up a little bit higher towards the upper end of that guidance range, we'll see. But I think as you think about planning ahead for the coming years, it's probably in that 5% ZIP code is the right way to think about us. Noah Kaye : And then maybe a follow-up question on the M&A landscape and opportunity, really what you're looking for here. And I think the company has talked in the past, and particularly after announcing Delphi, about pretty unmatched capabilities around integration and a broad portfolio for powertrain electrification. So at this point, as you look at M&A needs, would it be more about competencies or about scale? Can you help us understand what the priorities might be? Frederic Lissalde : So no, the -- Delphi, I'm very happy with Delphi. Delphi was done to gain scale in power electronics, electronic software predominantly. And now we can think about -- and the combination is on track. You heard me saying that the team is really strong. Now it's time, with this new base with this new portfolio and technology breadth of -- breadth, it's time to accelerate. And as I mentioned, the strategy will be shared at Investor Day. We're not looking for -- we don't want to disturb the Delphi integration.  And we will focus into technologies, we will focus into technologies that allows us to stronger in all the elements that -- where electrons go in a battery electric vehicle be it PassCar or commercial vehicle. That's the -- that would be the clear target around technology. And the Delphi integration is a key focus, and we're not going to disturb that. Kevin Nowlan : Free cash flow... Frederic Lissalde : And those two things, the two questions are linked to each other. Free cash flow is a strong enabler of us being able to do what I just said. And our focus on free cash flow since about 3, 4 years ago has been the right thing to do with that strategy in mind. Operator : Next question comes from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Ryan Brinkman : Regarding the announcement of the 800-volt electric motor for commercial vehicles, can you talk about the 4 different variants? Do they have different use cases? What kind of commercial vehicles will the motor be used in? And how are you thinking about the potential for other commercial vehicle OEMs to potentially use this motor? Are you able to provide an overview of the different products that you supply into or could supply into commercial vehicles to facilitate electrification?  So there's this motor. I think there's some thermal management. But are your silicon carbide inverters or other products for the light vehicle industry also applicable for the commercial industry? Frederic Lissalde : All the products that we do for PassCar are available for commercial vehicle. The different variants are going to be used for different power demand and functional demand from our customers. It is a family of product that can be translated into other types of commercial vehicle demands.  On top of those motors, we have motor controller. You know that we are also into the commercial vehicle battery pack area. And so we are -- this market segment is really important for us. The electrification of those vehicles will also, we think, be profound, and we're ready. Ryan Brinkman : Okay. And I see you have incorporated in your guidance global light and commercial vehicle production up 11% to 14% in '21 weighted for your geographies, which is seemingly more conservative at the midpoint versus IHS' mid-January expectation for plus 14% for light vehicles globally. But at the same time, maybe a bit more optimistic than some supplier peers have assumed, given the semiconductor shortage issue, which I thought I heard you quantify at about 1 million units.  Are you able to tell us what your outlook is for global light vehicle production that rolls up into that 11% to 14% across light and commercial end markets weighted for your geographies? And I'd be interested to know too if you expect any direct exposure to the semiconductor issue, I don't know, in your power electronics or any of your other components. Or if you're just looking at it for more of an indirect impact from lower customer production at this point. Kevin Nowlan : Ryan, with respect to the specific market assumptions that we're using in the breakdown by geography even of light vehicle, commercial vehicle and in total, we actually included a slide in our backup. it's Slide 21 in the appendix materials to help you have that visibility.  So our global weighted light vehicle market range is 12.5% to 15.5% growth in 2021, which that's the portion for light vehicle. Commercial vehicle global weighted is 3.5% to 6.5%. That blend gets you to the 11% to 14%. Ryan Brinkman : I see, super helpful. And on the semiconductor issue, do you think it's just indirect or any direct exposure? Frederic Lissalde : So we have direct exposures since we are delivering a vast amount of electronics systems and subsystems. We've been jumping through hoops over the past 2, 3 months to keep everything going. So far, so good, I would say, from a direct exposure. And overall, we are including, in the low end of our guide, an impact of slightly more than 1 million vehicle for the full year. That's the exposure that we see on the low end of the guide, being direct or indirect. Operator : Next question comes from Luke Junk with Baird. Luke Junk : I wanted to ask first about post-Delphi customer conversations. So I assume based on the time line that you've put out, you've probably completed most of those meetings at this point. And Fred, just wondering if there's any additional color you can provide on the tone of those conversations versus your expectations going into the process. You said that customer feedback is very positive, and yes, just wondering if you could expand on that. Frederic Lissalde : Yes. It's very positive. I would -- so yes, we've covered more than 75% of all customers on the planet being PassCar and CV. I see 3 areas of synergies. First, when Delphi brings technology that we didn't have, for example silicon carbide, BorgWarner's booking. When BorgWarner brings financial strength and customer intimacy, which is an example of one of the product that I alluded to in my prepared remarks, BorgWarner is booking. And the last combination that exists are product combination, a system combination. And obviously this will take a little bit more time, but BorgWarner will be booking. Luke Junk : Great, and then if I could ask another customer-related question, specifically regarding U.S. emission standards. So now that the Biden administration has been in place for a month, we're seeing sort of the lawmakers back away from their support for the Trump-era emissions rules. And I'm just wondering, has that changed yet at least your conversations around turbochargers, GDI, et cetera, specific to the U.S.? Frederic Lissalde : We're not seeing any impact to our discussion to our discussion with our North American customers. And from a product portfolio perspective, from a technology perspective, we are ready to accelerate at the pace they would like to accelerate. We're already with great technologies leading to very, very good efficiency gains in battery electric vehicles. Operator : Next question comes from Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets. Joseph Spak : One more maybe crack at the backlog. I think previously, you talked about 3% combustion outgrowth, 10% on hybrid, 17% on electric. What does that look like now under the new backlog? Recognizing there's a bunch of moving pieces, both with customer plans and hybrids, but also the integration of Delphi. Kevin Nowlan : For today's meeting, we weren't going to go through that in detail. We wanted to give a profile that made sure you understood how we're tracking toward our midterm outgrowth performance. And we still expect to be in that mid-4.5% range, just as we talked about a year ago.  I think the big-picture items that we wanted to make sure you're aware of coming out of today are the fact that 45%-plus are in e-products, and we continue to have the greater than 100% of the backlog on a net basis in hybrid and electric. But today we're not going to be breaking down anything further than that from a combustion, hybrid or electric perspective. Joseph Spak : Okay. Maybe just as a follow-up, and recognizing we'll probably hear more about that later. Like one thing you did sort of update, right, was the addressable content. Because I think the last time you gave those numbers were pre-Delphi.  So now looks like on electric, it's like 2.4k. And before it was I think just under two. And on combustion, it's a little bit over 900, and it was 600 before. So a couple of hundred bucks higher on each.  You also used to give like an average CPV content. And I think that assumed your participation rate of about 1/3 on electric. Can you let us know if that has changed at all? Is that still roughly what you think you can get post-Delphi? Or have the numbers changed, especially with some of the inverter stuff you were talking about? Kevin Nowlan : Yes. I think back on the content per vehicle opportunity that we talked about on the earlier slide, we've actually put those numbers out here a couple of months ago. So they're consistent with what we've been sharing for the last couple of months, which contemplated basically combining the legacy BorgWarner and Delphi content opportunities.  When you look at the electric side, you can obviously see the number has increased quite a bit. Before, we did have inverters in there because we had capability inverters in inverters even prior to Delphi. But we didn't have it at scale and with the technological leadership position in light vehicle that Delphi has. So I think the probability of us delivering on that content opportunity has increased. And then the dollar amounts actually increased because of some of the other power electronics capabilities, in particular that Delphi brings to the table.  And so as we talk about possibly peeling back the onion here or giving a little bit more data, I think you should be on the watch for Investor Day. And we'll give more color to how we expect the business to be evolving over the coming years. Operator : Next question comes from Brian Johnson with Barclays. Brian Johnson : Yes. Rather than doing some random housekeeping questions, just want to clarify on your strategy. I'm not going to ask you, but I'd love to hear within your backlog how much is e-motors versus inverters.  But you put out some interesting slides in December after our [indiscernible] discussion about what's in-sourced, what's outsourced in e-motors versus inverters. So in the e-motor world, you talked about 50% being in-sourced, 50% outsourced. Kind of a couple of questions. Do you have any update on that based on what you're seeing in the market? And then second, with this CV win and obviously with Kevin's background in CV, is that where -- and given most, if not all, of CV motors are going to be outsourced, do you see more pivot to the commercial vehicle sector?  And then kind of third, within that, Meritor and Dana talked a lot about integrating the motors into the axle set. This looks like something you could put under the hood of a freight line or something and just drive through the traditional transmission. So just maybe technically how that product works would be helpful as well. Frederic Lissalde : Brian, our view of in-sourcing versus outsourcing has not changed from what we presented in December. And our view that our family of motors can be applicable in both PassCar and CV has not changed either. And so we started booking some CV business a few years ago, and this one is certainly getting it to another dimension. But we've always planned our product portfolio across PassCar and CV and learned from those two market segment to be at the forefront of technology and reliability. Brian Johnson : And in terms of being in the axle versus away from the axle? Frederic Lissalde : For us, it doesn't really matter if the motor is away from the axle or in the axle. You will always need for very high-power density motor with a very smart controller attached to it. What we're saying is that more and more customers not wanting to be in the middle of the motor on the motor controller, and I think those synergies are going to make our customers' life easier going forward as we are able to have a great motor and a great motor controller supplied -- developed and supplied together. Operator : Next question comes from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Adam Jonas : One question, one follow-up, first on asset write-downs. Auto companies have been announcing plans to aggressively decommission ICE tech, and some are planning out, right, to stop sales in the next 15 years. So I'm wondering if you see scope for this to trigger some asset impairment or write-down of some of your long-lived IP and assets to reflect the curtailment of their useful lives? Are we at a point where you could run such tests past your auditors? Could we see potential write-downs in the next year or 2? And at the same time, could BorgWarner be compensated by OEMs for the curtailments, given the upfront R&D investments you made that may not -- all the advanced ICE tech that might not get the full engineering cycle behind it? Kevin Nowlan : Yes, I think as we look at it at the moment, we don't see any sort of accelerated asset write-down. I mean the bulk of the investment we make when it comes to Capex, for instance, is depreciated over the life of the programs. And so we're really supporting programs and amortizing on that basis.  And then just keep in mind, some of our core businesses are continuing to grow even in the ICE space as we see some movement towards hybrids, whether you think of turbos and VCT and EDR. But again, the basis of the way we depreciate assets is predominantly over the life of the programs that those assets are there to support.  And then when you think of footprint, remember, we are predominantly an assembly model business in terms of our manufacturing footprint. And so we actually can leverage using that footprint in different ways as we look ahead if we need to pivot. Adam Jonas : Great. And just a follow-up, I'm going to go back to Slide 16 again, and it's a pretty simple question. But the previous way you described the backlog, it just said net light vehicle. Here it's a bit more of an elaborate definition : light vehicle, CV, net backlog, plus aftermarket. I just want to confirm because it wasn't -- I think I know the answer, but just wasn't quite clear that there was no definitional or scope change from the previous way you described the backlog to now.  And then I'm curious how much aftermarket growth contributes to the mid-4% range. What would that be if it didn't have that extra part to the right of the ampersand? Kevin Nowlan : Yes. Good questions, Adam. I mean the -- in terms of the way that we're calculating the backlog, the one thing that's changed is the way we're measuring market. Because commercial vehicle has become a much bigger part of our portfolio, especially with the Delphi acquisition, we're now using market assumptions for commercial vehicle in addition to light vehicle and then comparing our organic revenue growth against that weighted market. So that is one change that we have in the measurement. The backlog then has always included aftermarket as from a dollar perspective in totality measured against those markets.  When we measure the outgrowth, though, what we do is we're measuring the outgrowth, but we're excluding aftermarket as a measure of that outgrowth against the markets. Because we're really measuring against the OE markets, and we're measuring the revenue that we're generating. So when you see that mid-4% range, the math actually doesn't include any tailwind from aftermarket in the mid-4% range, but the backlog is comprehensive. Operator : We have time for one final question, and that question comes from David Kelley with Jefferies. David Kelley : And maybe just a follow-up on the inverter discussion, I believe you had previously noted 4 billion or 4-plus billion addressable inverter market by 2025. We were just curious as to how much of that, in your view, is likely to be tied directly to silicon carbide? And also curious to hear your thoughts on how the competitive landscape might shift as the inverter market appears to be transitioning to silicon carbide. Frederic Lissalde : So we're leading the market with high-voltage and silicon carbide. And in our world, it's all about efficiency. And it's certainly a fact that high voltage and silicon carbide enables lower losses and higher efficiency. And we're laser-focused into enhancing this technology to the highest possible level. And I am -- and I'm very happy with what we're seeing. The fact that we have vertically integrated power module, ASICS, software development is also an advantage that we have that the customer also values quite a bit. David Kelley : Okay. Got it. And then maybe just one quick follow-up, I believe Delphi had established a partnership with Cree as the silicon supplier for 800-volt silicon carbide inverters. That was prior to your acquisition. So I guess a, is that partnership still at play here? And also, are they the supplier for the 400-volt transition you referenced that should be a big part of some of the growth go forward? Frederic Lissalde : The relationship still exist. I will not comment about sourcing of the silicon carbide, but the partnership with Cree has not changed and is being nurtured. Patrick Nolan : Thank you. With that, I'd like to thank you all for your great questions today. If you have any follow-ups, feel free to reach out to me or ready. With that, Sharon, please close the call. Operator : That does conclude the BorgWarner 2020 fourth quarter and full year results conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the BorgWarner 2021 First Quarter Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to Patrick Nolan, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Nolan, you may begin your conference. Patrick Nolan : Thank you, Sharon. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We issued our earnings release earlier this morning. It is posted on our website, borgwarner.com, on our home page and on our Investor Relations home page. With regard to our Investor Relations calendar, we will be attending multiple conferences between now and our next earnings release. Please see the Events section of our Investor Relations home page for a full list. Before we begin, I need to inform you that during this call, we may make forward-looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties as detailed in our 10-K. Our actual results may differ significantly from the matters discussed today. During today's presentation, we will highlight certain non-GAAP measures in order to provide a clearer picture of how the core business performed and for comparison purposes to prior periods. When you hear us say on a comparable basis, that means excluding the impact of FX, net M&A, and other non-comparable items. When you hear us say adjusted, that means excluding non-comparable items. When you hear us say organic, that means excluding the impact of FX and net M&A. We will also refer to our growth compared to our markets. When you hear us say market, that means the change in light and commercial vehicle production weighted for our geographic exposure. Our outgrowth is defined as our organic revenue change versus the market. Please note that we've posted an earnings call presentation to the IR page of our website. We encourage you to follow along these slides during our discussion. With that, I'm happy to turn the call over to Fred. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric B. Lissalde: Thank you Pat and good day to everyone. We're very pleased to share our results today for the first quarter of 2021 and provide an overall company update starting on Slide 5. I'm very proud of our strong start of the year despite the component supply headwinds. With just over 4 billion in sales our first quarter revenue increased over 18% organically. This compares to a market being up less than 13%. So our outgrowth was about 570 basis points for the quarter which was ahead of our expectation and our guidance for the year. We saw strong outgrowth in North America and Europe.  Our earnings per share increased year-over-year due to the impact of our higher revenue. Our incremental margin performance was in line with our expectations. We delivered strong free cash flow of 147 million for the quarter, a good start towards our full year guidance. We also secured additional new business awards for electrified vehicles which I will speak about in a moment. And finally during the quarter we announced our planned acquisition of AKASOL. The key strategic elements of the AKASOL acquisitions are detailed on Slide 6. Based on the last couple of years of experience we have in this space we're believers in the prospect of easy battery systems and are very familiar with the industry players.  As a leader in this space AKASOL had been on our radar for a long time as a potential partner. We're confident that AKASOL is an excellent strategic fit for BorgWarner and we are really excited about adding their capabilities to our portfolio. In particular, we are attracted to AKASOL\u2019s following strengths; flexible battery technology across multiple cell architectures, proven technology and products with established manufacturing facilities already in serial production today, strong order backlog of about $2.4 billion primarily from leading OEMs, and a focus on the bus CV and off-highway application. We're extremely excited and expect to complete the transaction during the second quarter. Next I would like to highlight a significant new program win for electric vehicles on Slide 7. BorgWarner's integrated drive module or as we call it our iDM was selected by a major non-Chinese Asian OEM for its upcoming global A-segment electric vehicle production planned to start in mid-2023. This is a significant program for the company as it is our first iDM award combining BorgWarner\u2019s and legacy Delphi Technologies portfolio. It is a validation of the potential we saw in bringing our two companies together. I want to thank the team\u2019s intense efforts to get to such a significant booking only seven months after the close of the Delphi transaction. And there is more to come. This idea features our electric motor, [indiscernible], and our integrated power electronics. It operates at 400 volts and has exceptional peak power of 135 KW. The iDM weight and space are reduced by integrating our gearbox, our 400 volt silicon inverter, and our motor. This results in a maximized power density and functionality. The iDM also offers a scalable and modular inverter design making it easily adaptable to customer requirements. This is an important step for the company with a great partner.  Next on Slide 8 let me summarize our new strategy called Project Charging Forward that we unveiled at our Investor Day in late March. With successful execution of this strategy we expect to deliver over 25% of our revenue from electric vehicles by 2025 and approximately 45% by 2030. That compares to under 3% of revenue today. Project Charging Forward has three pillars; one, we plan to profitably scale eLVs through our continued integration of Delphi and our ability to capture synergies. The new iDM win is a great example. We would also pursue other organic and inorganic actions. Two, we intend to expand more aggressively into eCVs. We will do that by leveraging our strong intimacy with CV customers as well as our position in eLVs. We're building out a go-to-market product portfolio and operation capabilities organically and inorganically. Our AKASOL acquisition is a key part of this expansion. And three, we plan to optimize our combustion portfolio, reducing our exposure by disposing part of the portfolio that we believe our lower growth that don\u2019t have path to product to ship, or that are not expected to deliver strong margins. We believe we can fund the EV growth underlying Project Charging Forward primarily from the capital generated by our existing operations. This is not a sudden change in the company's direction, it is a logical extension to what we've been building since 2015. We're excited about the acceleration of the market towards electrification and about the momentum that we are building with our customers. I want to take a moment to thank all the BorgWarner employees who are working very hard to both manage the present and accelerate the future of the company to what\u2019s best.  Next on Slide 9, I'm proud to announce that BorgWarner achieved The Great Place to Work Certified Status for the second consecutive year. Great Place to Work is the global authority on workplace culture. This certification validates BorgWarner\u2019s positive work environment. I've said before that the BorgWarner secret sauce starts with our people. To lead, develop, and attract the best talents we strive to be an employer of choice where we operate around the world. We cultivate a workplace environment that is collaborative, transparent, inclusive, and that promotes continuous learning and excellence.  So let me summarize our first quarter results and our outlook. The first quarter was a good start to the year, particularly considering the supply challenges currently impacting the industry. We delivered strong top line growth and we believe we're tracking well towards our full year margin and free cash flow objectives. Our first quarter performance has led us to increase our full year revenue and adjusted earnings per share guidance despite a lower industrial production outlook, as Kevin will detail. As we look beyond 2021, I'm extremely excited about our long-term positioning. We are continuing to take significant steps that we believe will help us to secure our profitable growth well into the future. We are winning in line with our expectations in the electric world, both from a component standpoint like inverters and e-heaters for example, and also from the latest generation systems standpoint with our iDMs. We're focusing on the disciplined inorganic investment approach, like the planned acquisition of AKASOL which adds great technology to our portfolio while supplementing our growth profile. With that, I'll turn the call over to you, Kevin. Kevin Nowlan : Thank you Fred and good morning everyone. Before I review the financials in detail, I'd like to provide a quick overview of the two key takeaways from our first quarter results. First, our revenue came in stronger than we were expecting going into the year. This was driven by the fact that we delivered solid outgrowth with both the legacy BorgWarner and former Delphi Technologies businesses performing better than expected. Second, our margin and cash flow performance in the quarter were strong, driven by the topline results as well as our cost saving measures.  So let's turn to Slide 10. As we look at our year-over-year revenue walk for Q1, we begin with pro forma 2020 revenue of $3.2 billion, which includes $945 million of revenue from Delphi Technologies. You can see the foreign currencies increased revenue by about 6% from a year ago, then our organic growth year-over-year was over 18%, compared to a less than 13% increase in weighted average market production. That translates to 570 basis points of outgrowth in the quarter, which breaks down as follows; in Europe, we outperformed by mid to high single digits, driven by growth in small gasoline turbochargers and strong performance in multiple former Delfi Technologies businesses, most notably fuel injection. In North America we outperformed the market by high single-digits as we saw a nice benefit from the ramp up of the new Ford F-150 and other new business launches. In China, we underperformed the market by mid-single-digits against very strong outperformance in the first quarter of 2020. Also keep in mind, Q1 was a very unusual quarter last year in the face of COVID-19 primarily in China.  The sum of all this was just over $4 billion of revenue in Q1, which was a new quarterly record for the company. Now, we do believe that some of the strong outgrowth we delivered in Q1 was a result of the production of build and hold vehicles by our customers in multiple regions of the world. That means it's likely that some level of our reported outgrowth in Q1 is inflated due to a pull forward of production into the quarter. This will have an offsetting impact on our expected out growth later in the year. However, our outgrowth for the full year is still expected to be above our prior guidance as I will discuss further in a moment. With all that background in mind, we're pleased with the strong start to 2021. Now, let's look at our earnings and cash flow performance on Slide 11. Our first quarter adjusted operating income was $444 million compared to the pro forma 274 million in the first quarter of 2020. This yielded an adjusted operating margin of 11.1%, which was up compared to the 10.3% margin for BorgWarner only in the first quarter of 2020. On a comparable basis, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, adjusted operating income increased $145 million on 591 million of higher sales. That translates to an incremental margin of roughly 25%. This solid performance was driven by conversion on higher volumes, restructuring savings, and Delphi Technologies synergies in excess of purchase price amortization. We were particularly pleased with this performance given elevated supplier costs that we experienced during the quarter. Moving on to free cash flow, we're proud of the fact that we generated $147 million of positive free cash flow during the first quarter, which was roughly flat year-over-year despite increased investment in working capital.  Let's now turn to Slide 12, where you can see our perspectives of global industry production for 2021. As a reminder, our market assumptions incorporate our view of both the light vehicle and on highway commercial vehicle markets. As you can see, we expect our global weighted light vehicle and commercial vehicle markets to increase in the range of 9% to 12%, which is down from our previous assumption of an 11% to 14% increase. This reduction to our prior market outlook reflects the ongoing impact of the semiconductor shortage on industry production. Looking at this by region, we're planning for North America to be up 17% to 20%. We see the largest incremental impact of the semiconductor shortage in North America, with our market expectations down approximately 500 basis points from our initial assumptions. In Europe, we expect a blended market increase of 9% to 12%, with that range being down approximately 200 basis points from our earlier planning assumption. And in China, we expect the overall market to be roughly flat year-over-year, similar to our previous estimate.  Now, let's talk about our full year financial outlook on Slide 13. Starting with our pro forma 2020 sales, which includes $2.6 billion of revenue from the first three quarters of Delphi Technologies in 2020. As you know, those revenues were not part of our P&L last year, but to provide year-over-year comparability we thought this pro forma revenue approach for the 2020 baseline would be useful. You can see that our end market assumptions from the prior slide are expected to drive an increase in revenue of roughly $0.9 billion to $1.3 billion. Next, we expect to drive market outgrowth for the full year of approximately 300 to 500 basis points, which is a meaningful step up from our previous guidance of 100 to 300 basis points. Our higher outgrowth guidance is based on the stronger than expected outgrowth in the first quarter and outgrowth for the balance of the year being higher than our previous guidance based on better than previously expected revenue trends in a number of former Delphi Technologies product lines.  Based on these assumptions, we expect our 2021 organic revenue to increase about 12% to 17% relative to 2020 pro forma revenue. Then adding a $400 million benefit from stronger foreign currencies, we're projecting total 2021 revenue to be in the range of $14.8 billion to $15.4 billion. That's up from our prior guidance by about $100 million at both ends of the revenue range. Even with weaker end market outlook, our stronger revenue outgrowth is driving an overall increase in our revenue guidance from the guidance we gave last quarter. Also, you should note that we're maintaining a wider than typical revenue range at this point of the year due to the wide range of potential production scenarios that I discussed on the previous slide, which stems from the volatility and uncertainty in end markets arising from the industrywide semiconductor issues.  From a margin perspective, we expect our full year adjusted operating margin to be in the range of 10.1% to 10.5%, compared to a pro forma 2020 adjusted operating margin of 8.3%. This contemplates the business delivering full year incrementals in the low 20% range before the impact of Delphi related cost synergies and purchase price accounting. From a cost synergy perspective, our margin guidance includes $70 million to $80 million of incremental benefit in 2021. That puts us right on track to achieve 50% of our total expected cost synergies in 2021 and based on our year-to-date performance, we believe that we're tracking at the high end of this range. Based on this revenue and margin outlook, we're expecting full year adjusted EPS of $4 to $4.35 per diluted share, which is an increase from our prior guidance of $3.85 to $4.25 per diluted share. I would point out that this guidance now assumes a 31% tax rate versus our prior guidance of 32% as a result of the successful execution of certain international tax planning initiatives. And finally, we continue to expect that we'll deliver free cash flow in the $800 million to $900 million range for the full year. This is flat with our prior guidance as we expect the higher sales outlook to drive an increase in working capital that largely offset higher adjusted operating income. This would still represent a record annual free cash flow generation for the company. That's our 2021 outlook.  Let's turn to Slide 14 for an update on the near-term actions related to Project Charging Forward. On the acquisition front, we believe we remain on track to complete the AKASOL acquisition in the second quarter. We've now received regulatory approvals in all required jurisdictions. The tender offer is in progress, with the final acceptance period expected to be completed later this month and then with a closing shortly thereafter. AKASOL represents an important part of Project Charging Forward as it represents approximately 20% to 25% of the estimated 2025 revenue from acquisitions underlying our plan. And it significantly increases our exposure to the eCV space. As it relates to portfolio optimization, we continue to target combustion related dispositions with annual revenue of approximately $1 billion to be executed over the next 12 to 18 months. The process for these dispositions is underway. We would expect to update you on our progress there as we get closer to executing those transactions.  So let me summarize my financial remarks. Overall we had a really solid start to the year despite the industry supply headwinds. We delivered 570 basis points of market outgrowth and 11.1% adjusted operating margin and $147 million of free cash flow. And we increased our full year revenue and earnings guidance despite moderating our industry production assumptions. Looking beyond our near-term results, we're taking the necessary steps to accelerate the company's progression towards electrification. The AKASOL acquisition and today's iDM announcement are great examples of our progression. And importantly, we're executing our strategy from a position of financial strength. Ultimately, we expect that the successful execution of our strategy will drive value creation for our shareholders. With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Pat. Patrick Nolan : Thank you, Kevin. Sharon we are ready to open up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. This question comes from Chris McNally with Evercore ISI. Christopher McNally : Thanks so much team. Wanted to ask two high level questions around EV demand and the first is around lead times. The business that you're winning in 2021 for the most part is it fair to say that the start of production for 2025 and beyond I was kind of surprised by the comments that you made about the iDM would be as early as 2023. Just trying to get a sense of the mega awards out there and what type of lead times we're looking at? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric B. Lissalde: Yeah. We're talking about start of production in the second half of 2023. This is something that depending on the production ramp up can be very well achieved. I don't see any issues with that at all. Christopher McNally : But is it sort of surprising that they're leading that business out to be awarded so soon or is it maybe you just were only able to actually disclose that you had that specific customer just now? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric B. Lissalde: No, we're disclosing that win pretty much at the same time we wanted. We're not disclosing the name as you've noticed and we'll do that when we can. Kevin Nowlan : Hi Chris, I think it's hard to say but it's normally -- it is a three-year type of a lead time. So most of the production awards we would be looking to win in 2021 are probably more likely going to be in that 2024, 2025 time frame. But there's some fluctuation around that and this one happens to launch later in the latter part of 2023. Christopher McNally : No, it's super helpful. I mean the reason I ask is basically there was another European supplier that was mentioning some of the mega programs like VW. Basically we're only going to award business for 2025, 2026, 2027 later in the year. So I just wanted to check with you guys, it's super helpful. The second question is maybe by region and I know it's hard to be this sort of overarching question, but where do you think specifically for the BorgWarner suite of products, are you seeing right now the most amount of interest when we think about it on a region basis? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric B. Lissalde: No, I think on the [indiscernible] we see growth in all regions and some regions will be more on component, some regions will be more on systems, even if that is not a clean cut. We see growth in all major region. It is also true that those -- the regions don't move at the same pace on the electrification so you see potential growth in North America a little bit later than in other parts of the world. Christopher McNally : Great, and then if I could sneak in one last one just to be greedy, I mean, the iDM win looks super interesting. Since it's in A-segment car, should we expect lower content per vehicle or can you still get that 1500 plus data you had sort of laid out in some of the detail at the Analyst Day? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric B. Lissalde: I'm not totally able to answer the price point at this point in time. I don't think you can adjust the price point depending on the size. There is a little bit of that, but I am not in the position to answer that in detail Chris. Christopher McNally : Fair, thanks so much Fred. Operator : Next question comes from James Picariello with KeyBanc Capital Markets. James Picariello : Hey, good morning guys. On the guidance, could you just provide some context on the second quarter in terms of what you're seeing thus far in OEM build schedules related to the chip shortage and just how you foresee that situation playing out in the back half relative to the market assumptions you laid out? Kevin Nowlan : As you know we're not providing quarterly guidance, but what I can tell you is that we do expect the bigger impact from the semiconductor shortage issue to occur really in the second quarter and a little less so in the third quarter. If you look at, the way I would help you dimension it is, if you look at what's implied at the mid-point of our guide for instance, about the last nine months, it implies that the average quarterly revenue somewhere in that $3.7 billion zip code, and you should assume that probably again, the semiconductor issue is more likely going to have a bigger impact in the near-term as opposed to the back end of the year. James Picariello : Okay. That makes sense. And then on BorgWarner's outgrowth, I mean, clearly the first quarter came in stronger. To provide color from maybe a product perspective, segment perspective, I mean, what drove the quarter strength because, I mean, I thought the first half you had a difficult diesel comp from an outgrowth standpoint. So just curious on the upside and how we should be thinking about crossover markets the rest of the year and then I guess also within the context of the chip shortage and lower volumes maybe near term? Kevin Nowlan : Yeah. I mean, I think a few of the things that we saw from a pure product perspective, the Ford F-150 launch was actually helpful in terms of driving some of the outgrowth that we saw in North America. We saw gas turbo business in Europe, which was helpful, and we saw good performance across the legacy Delphi Technologies businesses, stronger than what we were anticipating as we started the year particularly in the fuel injection business. So, I mean I think we saw it across a wide variety of our businesses. And so as we look at the back half of the year, you saw that we took up the full year outgrowth guidance. I think before we were at 100 to 300 basis points for the full year, now we're seeing the full year is 300 to 500 basis points based on both what we saw in Q1, as well as what we're expecting in the back nine months of the year. So in the last nine months of the year, I think it stacks up to be about 200 to 450 basis points or so of implied outgrowth in that full year guide. James Picariello : Yeah, very helpful. Thanks. Operator : Next question comes from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Noah Kaye : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. So the organic growth in the quarter just year-over-year being paced by e-propulsion and drive train at 36%, what were the major drivers of that growth, just trying to get a sense if the segment is more geographically weighted to last year's more effected markets, whether there was some significant e-business growth, I mean, just give us some color on the segment? Kevin Nowlan : Yeah, I mean, we're not -- we haven't really disclosed outgrowth by segment, but clearly when you look at that segment that we do have a lot of business in that segment coming out of China and the global markets were simply up a lot more in China. If you look at our global way to production, it increased about 80% in China versus you look at Europe and North America, much smaller increases or even down in North America on a blended basis. So that's part of the reason you see stronger revenue numbers year-over-year in that business. It has a little bit more disproportionate skewing to the Chinese market than some of our other businesses. Noah Kaye : Sure, makes sense. Thanks. And then maybe just if you can comment on the drivers for the increased CAPEX outlook, stressing out those new programs getting pulled forward and the other factors to consider in increasing the CAPEX outlook for the year? Kevin Nowlan : Not specifically. I think as we've just rolled up our programs and rolled up our forecast, we've realized that it probably needed to take that up a little bit. Along with that there are some of the investments we're making associated with the Delphi Technologies integration particularly on the IT side that are actually being bucketed in capital that we didn't anticipate. We thought it would be in a different line item. So we're bucketing that now on CAPEX as well. So that has a little bit of an impact, although that's just a left pocket right pocket when it comes to free cash flow outlook. Noah Kaye : Makes sense. Alright, thanks very much for the color. Operator : Next question comes from Dan Levy with Credit Suisse. Dan Levy : Hi, good morning. Thank you. Just wanted to start on the growth side. One of your key customers is highlighting a particularly challenged volume outlook. So maybe you could just give us a sense for -- and I know you've given us some ranges there, but to what extent is this end market guidance reflecting maybe some of the more draconian outlooks that have been cited? And also if you could just comment on the quarter, how much revenue growth did you get from maybe partially built vehicles, vehicles that may not be reflected in the production builds, but that you shipped goods to? Kevin Nowlan : As we look at, I mean, you can see our end market production assumptions. We've taken down about 200 basis points globally, which factors in the intelligence we have based on production schedules, based on conversations with our customers, and based on other things that we see going on in the marketplace. So, based on the things we've seen, announced or discussed with customers as late as last week, that's contemplated in our full year guidance. And that's part of the reason we took our guidance down from a production perspective, particularly in the North American market. Well, I'm sorry, Dan what was the second part of your question? Dan Levy : Was there any growth benefit or revenue benefit in 1Q from partially built vehicles? Kevin Nowlan : Yes, we think the answer to that is yes although it's hard to tell for certain. When you look at that outgrowth coming in at about 570 basis points, as we're trying to sort through the numbers, it's not a 100% clear, but our expectation is the amount of outperformance we're generating relative to call it that 300 to 500 basis points full year is probably the amount that's arguably linked to the build and hold vehicles that we're seeing. But it's really hard to dimension that for sure, but that's our assumption at the moment. Dan Levy : Great, great. And then my follow-up is really just more of a I'd say a follow-up from the Investor Day, and it's around silicon carbide and high voltage inverters. So, I think this is an area that you mentioned you have some market leadership, you've obviously got some pretty chunky winds here. The content could be a pretty material step up over some of the base IGBT could you just maybe walk us through your view of how you see mix for yourself or for the industry of silicon carbide or high voltage versus IGBT over time, maybe the margin and content differences and you know, where -- how is the competitive environment different, wondering is there -- as we get more silicon carbide, does that incrementally favor you more versus some of your competition? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric B. Lissalde: Yeah, you see, one of the advantage that we have is that we can do lower voltage silicon, higher voltage silicon carbide, very high voltage or 800 volts silicon carbide and we are positioning ourselves more in the high voltage or let's say lower losses type of product, more efficient product with silicon carbide. The tendency is to increase efficiency so the tendency is to go to those direction of a higher efficiency technologies. At the end of the day, it's the customer's choice who wants to -- who's going to decide what they want. And so you can count by is primarily on high-end vehicles today. They might find their way down to the two other ranges in the future. Dan Levy : And the competitive environment, your competitive positioning versus others on silicon carbide or high voltage? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric B. Lissalde: I really like where we are. Dan Levy : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from Rod Lache with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Rod Lache : Hi everybody. So it does look like the adjustments that you're making in the global production and North American production go beyond what we heard from Ford last week. And I'm just wondering if whether you think your customers are providing transparency into the constraints that are kind of bubbling up through the supply chain from tier three to tier twos at this level, obviously some questions about that in light of what we saw from Ford and do you see other OEMs moderating their forecast anywhere near what we're seeing for that one customer? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric B. Lissalde: So what I would say is that for sure we are very aware about what we are delivering. Meaning that we are on top of making sure that we can continue the flow of product and we have a lot of three-party meetings with our customers, ourselves, and the semiconductor suppliers. And we manage that very, very, very intensively and very as accurately as we can. We see some customers that have announced shut down. Obviously, we are sometimes aware through the schedule changes, but we are more aware through the discussions that we have with our customers, more than looking at the schedules and that is informing also our market intelligence on what is likely to happen. Rod Lache : Okay. I was hoping maybe you just can elaborate on just two points. One is the strong turbo and GDI mix. Are there any changes that are happening here, obviously we've seen very strong performance in hybrids in Europe recently, but are you detecting any kind of durable strength that's happening there and any color on what you've experienced in terms of commodity costs and your outlook for that? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric B. Lissalde: So obviously Rod, there is a strong demand for efficient downsize gasoline engine and all efficient downsize gasoline engine are usually turbocharged and include GDA injection, right. So, that is one key element for combustion based engines, as well as for hybrid based engines. The second part of your question is around raw material. We are seeing some increases. We have incorporated what we had seen so far in our guide, and the color I wanted to give you is that on the biggest raw material purchases, we have about 60% pass through with our customers. And when we go into discussing those items with them, we usually do a little bit better than that. So that's the situation on raw material. And yes, we're seeing some inflation. Rod Lache : What\u2019s the magnitude of that? Kevin Nowlan : We're not disclosing that. It's just embedded in our guidance and so the good news is we're able to offset that with the performance we're seeing in the business and able to actually even take up the bottom end of our margin range for the full year. Rod Lache : Understood. Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets. Joseph Spak : Thanks everyone. Maybe just to follow-up on that last point with Kevin. So, you are pointing to some weaker margins over the balance of the year, and now as you pointed out, like the average sort of revenue is lower in the first quarter. So, is it really just a volume sort of flow-through dynamic or is there sort of a less or a bigger net raw material headwind, or maybe some other things like freight has obviously been some that's been called out as big constraint in the system? Kevin Nowlan : Yeah. I mean, it's really fundamentally linked to volume more than anything else. If you look at what's implied by our guide about the back half of the year, it still suggests that we're going to convert in the low 20%, call it 23% to 25% over the last nine months of the year. Pretty much in line with what we saw in Q1 on a year-over-year basis. So, nothing beyond volume. Certainly there's puts and takes in our P&L. You have certain things going one way, certain things going in other, but overall what it comes down to in our guide is really the conversion on incremental revenue. Joseph Spak : Okay. Second question would be on the iDM award, the first using combined BorgWarner and Delphi Technologies. I know you said it's for A-segment of vehicle. Can you just spend a little time talking about like how scalable is that, that was what you're showing there for larger vehicles and is it actually like an easier or harder for larger small vehicles, I imagine each comes with some of its own engineering complexities? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric B. Lissalde: It is scalable. It's is modular from an inverter standpoint, the building blocks are modular. Same for a motor standpoint, we have family of motor and the transmission that is hosting the whole thing. We size up depending on the talk that we need to give. So it's fairly modular. I would not think that smaller iDMs or A Class vehicle iDM are more or less complicated than C Class vehicle iDMs, there are different types of complexities. For sure, with the customers that we have, wait, perfect NVH, and good power density, very good power density with key elements for us to win this program, as way of competitiveness hopefully. And I think this is the recipe for success for the other iDMs that will hopefully come in the future. So you will see a continuous booking, both from a component standpoint, power electronics, combined power electronics boxes, combining inverters and DCDC converter, or any other type of combination. You will see also hopefully continuous booking on the system like this iDM. Joseph Spak : Okay. If I could just sneak one in, any update on the billion dollars of dispositions or the market for that, that you expect by next year and like can we expect some of that to occur in 2021? Kevin Nowlan : Yeah, I think the process is underway. Nothing to report, obviously we're 45 days removed from announcing our Project Charging Forward strategy. And I think we still feel good about the ability to deliver on that approximately $1 billion of dispositions over the next 12 to 18 months. So we'll update you when we're closer to executing transactions, but nothing additional to report at this point sitting here today. Joseph Spak : Okay, thank you. Operator : Next question comes from John Murphy with Bank of America. John Murphy : Good morning guys. Just a first question to follow-up on the production outlook. Without naming names or maybe if you could give us groups, how variable to the upside and the downside are the changes in schedules been. Because it just seems like some automakers, particularly Japanese who've gone through this with the tsunami in the past had a better handle on this and had higher buffer stocks. Europeans, maybe somewhere in the middle and it seems like the North American companies are less prepared for this. And that's the reason there's maybe these extreme divergences as opposed to the companies not being up to date. I'm just curious what your perspective on sort of the variances between your customer's preparedness to this and why we might be seeing these divergences? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric B. Lissalde: So the thing is it varies a lot of cross region across customers. It depends upon their sourcing strategies and things like that. We -- and by program, it's very difficult for us to figure out those dynamics. We're not in that detail of what OEMs -- what the OEM's issues and details are, right. So what I can tell you is that it varies, and I don't have a way to ring fence this either by region or by customer types. It's not possible at least for us. John Murphy : Okay, and then maybe just a follow up on the iDM, congrats on the award, it is the kind of thing that everybody was skeptical that you would ever get and it seems like you've gotten it pretty early on. So it's a good sign. As you think about this transition towards the electric powertrain, they're sort of skeptics on your company to believe the automakers are going to in source everything. And then there some optimists or realists as I would call them that they understand at least part of the parts that will get outsourced and maybe over time, full iDM's might be a way things go. As you look at the shift in technology, how different do you think it is versus other shifts in technology you have seen in the past where the automakers are trying to learn what's going on, and sometimes they might in source and sometimes they might outsource and how do you think this is going to shape up differently or similarly to pass transitions in technology? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric B. Lissalde: So John, I think at the end of the day, product leadership and scale will prevail. The force of that will win. There will be some insourcing, the market is very big and the content per vehicle that we have on E is three times more than we have on C. And I gave some examples sometimes then one inverter is equivalent to pretty much what we can sell if we say it all on combustion. So as you mentioned, the iDM is a very, very good example. There is more to come on system outsourcing. And again you will see some customers that are outsourcing. They won't learn in order to buy better. Some customers will in-source some platforms, outsource some others, and that varies across customers and across region. And that will also vary over time where I think when suppliers like us will have a very good product leadership and scale in an iDM, for example, but you have other products. I think, the likelihood for us to be able to sell more systems is becoming -- will become higher over time. John Murphy : But I'm sorry, just one follow up on that. How different do you think that is in the commercial vehicle market, I mean, it just seems like there's huge potential for outsourcing there, consolidation with the AKASOL acquisition. It seems like your right to play is pretty strong. I mean, is there even a greater opportunity on the commercial vehicle side, at least for the foreseeable future? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric B. Lissalde: I would say that, especially on the battery pack stand point, there is obviously way more opportunities on the commercial vehicle for us then on Pascal, that is one of the reason why we went and focused on commercial vehicle, that recharging systems, and battery systems. So, on the, on that front, there is certainly more room for outsourcing than on the Pascal side. John Murphy : And on the iDM? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric B. Lissalde: Well, on the iDM, I think generally the likelihood of outsourcing in commercial vehicle by the volumes of those industries and by the diversity of what is required is at the high level leading to maybe more outsourcing than in other segments. You will see in the commercial vehicle I think maybe more combination of motor and power electronics as those two go together, one controls the other than iDMs from a commercial view propulsion standpoint. John Murphy : Okay, thank you very much. Operator : Next question comes from Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank. Emmanuel Rosner : Hi, good morning everybody. I was hoping to follow-up on your comments about the insourcing versus outsourcing of electric power train. And wondering how much we can read into these specific first win. So, are you able to comment on whether this customer has other EVs either up or coming up and what would the sourcing strategy have been on those, so I'm wondering if there's a way to read into a shift towards sort of like more insourcing or whether depending on which platform and which class of vehicle there's sort of like different sourcing strategy within that one OEM? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric B. Lissalde: Obviously won't give you -- can\u2019t give you detail on the customer. What I can give you is that I think what it means is that, great technology is making a difference. And in line with my prepared remarks, I want to again thank the BorgWarner team that have been working since the closing of the Delphi transaction together to get in the world of this magnitude and that strategic impact seven months after close I think is pretty remarkable. Emmanuel Rosner : Yes, definitely. Are you able to comment on the volume expected for this program? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric B. Lissalde: No, I can't. Emmanuel Rosner : Okay. So I guess then the different topics, so the volatility around the semi shortages, I was wondering how do you manage this on the ground and I guess in your operations, not to keep baking on Ford, but I guess I get some pretty clear outlook last week. Feels like a lot of their factories may be shut for a prolonged amount of time in Europe potentially, six to eight weeks or so. And so, -- and with pretty low amount of notice, a little notice, so how do you manage this in terms of cost efficiencies and making sure that things continue to run at the right level of margin? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric B. Lissalde: So there is two facets to that. First is the facet of what we supply to our customers that as semiconductor and we are working very well with our customers and with our semi-conductor suppliers in order to keep it going. Second is when we are impacted by somebody else's shut down and you're taking for that as an example well, we are agile enough to be able to manage that. And, with the notice we have, this is something that we do for a living. We can flex and this particular element is in the grand scheme of BorgWarner. It is not going to move the needle to a point where it is impacting us too much, and the plants and the plant managers know how to flex, where they have to flex in order to cope with the latest schedules. Emmanuel Rosner : Guys that great to hear and then the final follow-up on this topic is you are mentioning it in the prepared remarks some supplier elevated costs, anyway to quantify this and how material dose were in the quarter? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric B. Lissalde: Yeah, there were two things that are really impacting us. One of the bigger item was really a troubled supplier situation that we have impacting one of our segment in Europe and you'll see that disclosed in the 10-Q as well and that had about an $80 million impact in the quarter. And then the second as we talked about earlier is that the impact of commodity costs on it but we are seeing some escalation there. As Fred noted we do have recovery mechanisms for the underlying movement in the raw materials that are just a subset of our material purchases but that does have an impact on us and we will continue to have an impact as we look ahead to the balance of the year but again both those things are contemplated in the 11% margin performance in Q1 as well as the full your guide of 10.1 to 10.5. Emmanuel Rosner : Great thank you. Operator : Next question comes from David Kelley with Jefferies. David Kelley : Hey, good morning and good afternoon. Maybe starting with a follow-up on that last semi-conductor point. Just given your electronics mix you referenced discussions ongoing with your semiconductor partners. I guess can you talk about if you're currently seeing any price inflation in electronics or if you expect to see increases and then also was curious to hear if you get so if you see an opportunity to pass through. We're not saying anything important so far? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric B. Lissalde: It is -- the situation is as you know still very volatile but we've not been faced with those types of demand yet. David Kelley : Okay, got it, thank you. And then maybe quickly shifting gears, you raced your commercial vehicle underlying outlook, just curious if you could talk a bit more about contribution to the quarter and how you're thinking about the CV outgrowth through the balance of the year that would be great? Kevin Nowlan : Yeah, I mean that the main thing that we saw from a CV perspective was really China coming in a little bit stronger including one from a production standpoint than what we were previously guiding to. But that's really all that is coming on at this point. It's mainly coming from that. David Kelley : Okay, got it, thanks. And Kevin maybe one quick follow-up on that, can you remind us of typical an incremental margin contribution from commercial vehicles? Kevin Nowlan : We haven\u2019t broken it down between commercial vehicle and light vehicle. I think it is appropriate to think of us just in totality as being normally in that high teens from a conversion standpoint. Obviously our guide this year both will be delivered in Q1e and what we're guiding to for the full year suggest that we are in the low 20 percentiles from a conversion year-over-year perspective which would contemplate anything in both the CV and the light vehicle space. And obviously we're getting a tailwind from things like the cost synergies in excess of purchase price amortization, getting a tail wind from the execution of our restructuring initiatives both in the legacy BorgWarner side and project pioneered at Delphi and so it is leading the conversion that this year is in the low 20s right now. David Kelley : Okay, great. That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : We have time for one final question and that question comes from Brian Johnson with Barclays. Brian Johnson : Yes, good day everyone. It's a less glamorous part of the E drive and power electronics businessman in pure [indiscernible] but can you comment a bit on the pace of your business and plug in hybrids and just how that couldn't hold in the next couple of years before further inflection and perhaps later in the decade or mid-decade? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric B. Lissalde: We are seeing a pool, a strong pool actually for plug in hybrids especially coming from Europe. Also a little bit from China. And as you know Brian we are more into the high voltage plug in hybrids more than in the lower voltages and we see strong pool. We are very, very happy with the programs that we had and the pool that we are seeing especially in Europe. Brian Johnson : Okay and I can think of few people that fit on commodities but in the past there been some hot special alloys. I think forget which the alloy that paid you about five to six years ago was. It is not going to be a particular problem now in terms of the input cost of that alloy. And two, are you now fully protected with pass throughs of that particular alloy? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric B. Lissalde: Yeah, I mean when it comes to steel costs we are seeing underlying inflationary pressures in the raw material underlying our material. Remember material spend for us runs around 55% of revenue and the underlying raw material is a relatively modest percentage of that. But within that spend, the bulk of which from a raw material exposure perspective would be on the steel side we are seeing some inflationary pressures. But as Fred mentioned we do have cost recovery mechanisms with our customers associated with the underlying raw material increases. But there is an impact, it's hitting us this year and it's embedded in our guidance. Brian Johnson : Okay, thank you. Patrick Nolan : Going to thank you all for your great questions today. Sharon you can go ahead and close out the call. Operator : That does conclude the BorgWarner 2021 first quarter results conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the BorgWarner 2021 Second Quarter Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to Patrick Nolan, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Nolan, you may begin your conference. Patrick Nolan : Thank you, Jerome. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. We issued our earnings release earlier this morning. It is posted on our website, borgwarner.com, on our home page and on our Investor Relations home page. With regard to our Investor Relations calendar, we will be attending multiple conferences between now and our next earnings release. Please see the Events section of our Investor Relations home page for a full list. Before we begin, I need to inform you that during this call, we may make forward-looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties as detailed in our 10-K. Our actual results may differ significantly from the matters discussed today. During today's presentation, we will highlight certain non-GAAP measures in order to provide a clearer picture of how the core business performed and for comparison purposes to prior periods. When you hear us say on a comparable basis, that means excluding the impact of FX, net M&A, and other non-comparable items. When you hear us say adjusted, that means excluding non-comparable items. When you hear us say organic, that means excluding the impact of FX and net M&A. We will also refer to our growth compared to our markets. When you hear us say market, that means the change in light vehicle and commercial vehicle production weighted for our geographic exposure. Our outgrowth is defined as our organic revenue change versus the market.  Please note that we've posted an earnings call presentation to the IR page of our website. We encourage you to follow along with these slides during our discussion. With that, I'm happy to turn the call over to Fred. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric B. Lissalde: Thank you Pat and good day everyone. First on Slide 5, I'm very proud of our strong performance in the quarter despite the ongoing component supply headwinds. With just under 3.8 billion in sales, our second quarter revenue increased over 72% organically with strong incremental margins and free cash flow. As Kevin will discuss we're increasing our full year guidance as we believe higher our growth in synergies, offsetting commodity and other headwinds. That's for the short-term execution. Now going forward, I'm very proud of our sustainability strategy highlighted in our report that our team just published. The acquisition of AKASOL was completed in early June, I'm very positive about what I see, great technology, great entrepreneurial spirit and mindset, welcome AKASOL to BorgWarner. And we secured multiple new product awards for electrified vehicles which I will speak about in a few moments. Starting with our over-arching sustainability topic and our vision to a cleaner and more energy efficient world, I would like to highlight some key takeaways from our global sustainability report called Evolving for All on Slide 6. Evolving for All compiles into one document where it is possible when nearly 50,000 people resolve to do the right things. It is a testament to our commitment to create an enterprise that is shaping the future of sustainable mobility. We are accelerating our clean mobility technologies, we're reducing our carbon footprint and are well on our way to achieving our stated goal of carbon neutrality by 2035. The report also includes Scope 3 emissions data to illustrate how our products are improving the world in which we all live with fostering a diverse and safe workplace and giving back to our communities. And our payer equity analysis shows parity results. I'm extremely proud of our sustainability focus.  Moving on to another pillar of charging forward we have completed the takeover offer of AKASOL early June as detailed on Slide 7. Since then, we have increased our ownership stake to approximately 93% through additional share purchases. We have informed AKASOL of our intention to progress towards a squeeze out process to achieve 100% ownership. To put in perspective, we expect AKASOL to represent 20% to 25% of the M&A portion of our charging forward project announced just four months ago. AKASOL also continues to secure additional new business awards. Last month we announced an agreement to supply their battery systems to a major bus and commercial vehicle manufacturer from Belgium. AKASOL will supply the second and third generation of their high energy battery systems for the customer\u2019s new all electric city bus starting in 2021.  Now let's go to China and look at other recently announced new product awards for electrified vehicles on Slide 8. First, we announced new contracts to supply dual inverters for Great Wall Motor and another major Chinese OEM. The dual inverters will be featured on both hybrid electric vehicles and plug in electric vehicles for these customers. By combining different power electronic technologies into one compact package our dual inverter provides unrivaled functionality. A single unit can control and drive two electric motors while delivering cost and weight reductions. These advanced inverter awards showcase not only the product leadership we have in these domains but also the trust and confidence we have built in our electrified applications with multiple OEMs globally. In addition to our mid-term revenue opportunities, advanced hybrid programs such as these allow us to drive additional scale and product capabilities that help improve our overall competitiveness in the world of battery electric vehicles. Also downstream the battery I would like to highlight another iDM award. This new three-in-one has the biggest size and output functionalities than the one already announced a few months ago with Hyundai. This one is also [indiscernible] mechanical motors vertically integrated electronics and software. We are partnering with a leading luxury new energy vehicle maker in China with SOP in 2023. Designed, developed, and manufactured by BorgWarner, this iDM features our electric motor, our gear box, and our integrated power electronics. It operates at 400 watts and has a peak power of 250 kilowatts.  Now adjacent to the battery packs I would like to shed some light today on our high voltage coolant heaters on Slide 9. This product line is a great example of advanced products developed organically by BorgWarner and now commercialize and manufactured at scale. It helps improve the battery operated range of our customer battery electric vehicles by controlling the battery temperature at an optimal level while also increasing passenger comfort, through the delivery of an ideal entire climate. We recently expanded our existing business with the launch of the new program with Geely. And as you can see by the chart on the Slide, the business is expected to grow rapidly from 600,000 units in 2021 to 4 million units by 2025, that's a 60% CAGR. With multiple customer awards, we expect the high voltage coolant heaters to already account for $400 million in revenue by 2025. Or to put it in another way, we expect this product to account for close to 10% of our planned EV revenue by 2025 and are charging forward. This product line does not get as much attention as the more high profile product lines like iDM inverters or motors but still contributes meaningfully to our EV content. So let me summarize our second quarter results and our outlook. The second quarter results were strong particularly configuring the supply challenges currently impacting the industry. We delivered strong top line growth and we believe we're tracking well towards our full year margin and free cash flow objectives. We're increasing our full year revenue and adjusted earnings per share guidance. As we look beyond these near-term results, I'm extremely excited about our long-term positioning. We are continuing to secure new business for electric vehicles to support our long-term revenue targets, and I'm pleased to see awards both on the component and on the system level. BorgWarner continues to develop clean and energy efficient solutions like our iDM family of products, and lastly we're focusing on a disciplined inorganic investment approach like the acquisition of AKASOL that add great technology and additional scale to our portfolio while supplementing our growth profile. With that I'll turn the call over to Kevin. Kevin Nowlan : Thank you, Fred and good morning, everyone. Given the number of financial topics we have to get through this morning, I'm going to dive right into the details. So let's turn to Slide 10. As we look at our year-over-year revenue walk for Q2, we begin with pro forma 2020 revenue of just under $2.1 billion, which includes 628 million of revenue from Delphi Technologies. Foreign currencies increased revenue by about 11% from a year ago. Then, our organic growth year-over-year was more than 72% compared to a 64% increase in weighted average market production. The significant year-over-year changes in industry production and the varying levels of supply disruptions among our customers make it difficult to draw conclusions from the quarterly outgrowth figures. Nonetheless, we were pleased with our performance in the quarter. Looking at our regional performance, in Europe we outperformed by double-digits, driven by growth in small gasoline turbochargers, VCT, and fuel injection. In China, we also outperformed the market by double-digits driven by growth in DCT, all-wheel drive, and fuel injection. And in North America we underperform the market primarily due to customer exposure. The sum of all this was just under $3.8 billion of revenue in Q2. Now let's look at our earnings and cash flow performance on Slide 11. Our second quarter adjusted operating income was $401 million, compared to a pro forma loss of $52 million in the second quarter of 2020. This yielded an adjusted operating margin of 10.7%. On a comparable basis excluding the impact of foreign exchange, adjusted operating income increased $423 million on about 1.5 billion of higher sales. That translates to strong incremental margin of over 28% driven by conversion on higher volumes, restructuring savings, and Delphi related synergies in excess of purchase price amortization. We were particularly pleased with this performance, given elevated supplier and commodity costs that we experienced during the quarter. Moving on to cash flow, we're proud of the fact that we generated $133 million of positive free cash flow during the second quarter, which was achieved despite an investment in inventory to help us better manage the challenging production environment.  Let's now turn to Slide 12, where you can see our perspective on global industry production for 2021. As you can see, we expect our global weighted light vehicle and commercial vehicle markets to increase in the range of 8.5% to 11%, which is down from our previous assumption of a 9% to 12% increase. This reduction from our prior market outlook reflects the ongoing impact of the semiconductor shortage on industry production, which is reducing our expectations for North American and European industry growth. We do expect light vehicle industry production to improve sequentially in the third and fourth quarters relative to Q2 as we believe the impact of the semiconductor shortages will be lower in the second half of the year than what we saw last quarter. However, given lower commercial vehicle production in the second half and the varying impact of ongoing supply constraints on our mix of customers, we're not expecting Q2 and Q4 revenues to return to Q1 levels. Now let's talk about our full year financial outlook on Slide 13. You can see that our end market assumptions from the prior slide are expected to drive an increase in revenue of roughly $965 million to $1.2 billion. Next, we expected drive market out growth for the full year of approximately 500 to 600 basis points, which is a meaningful step up from our previous guidance of 300 to 500 basis points. Based on these assumptions, we expect our 2021 organic revenue to increase about 14% to 17% relative to 2020 pro forma revenue. Then, adding a $520 million benefit from stronger foreign currencies and $75 million of revenue related to the acquisition of AKASO, we're projecting total 2021 revenue to be in the range of $15.2 billion to $15.6 billion.  From a margin perspective, we expect our full year adjusted operating margin to be in the range of 10.2% to 10.5% compared to a pro form of 2020 margin of 8.3%. This contemplates the business delivering full year incrementals in the low 20% range before the impact of Delphi related cost synergies and purchase price accounting. From a cost synergy perspective, our margin guidance includes $100 million to $105 million of incremental benefit in 2021, which is higher than our previous guidance of $70 million to $80 million. As I'll discuss in more detail, momentarily, the cost synergies are simply being realized faster than we previously expected.  Partially offsetting this favorability are two things; first, the acquisition of AKASO is expected to reduce full year margins by 10 basis points. And second, we're anticipating a net negative impact from commodities in the range of $70 million to $90 million, which is worse than we previously expected. But even with these two headwinds, we're holding our margin roughly in line with our prior guidance. Based on this revenue and margin outlook, we're now expecting full year adjusted EPS of $4.15 to $4.40 per diluted share, which is an increase from our prior guidance of $4 to $4.35 per diluted share. And finally, we continue to expect that we'll deliver free cash flow in the $800 million to $900 million range for the full year. This is flat with our prior guidance as we expect the higher sales outlook to drive an increase in working capital that largely offset higher adjusted operating income. This would still represent record free cash flow generation for the company. That's our 2021 outlook.  Let's turn to Slide 14 for an update on the financial impact of the Delphi Technologies acquisition. As I alluded to earlier, the cost synergies related to the transaction are being realized more quickly than we previously expected. The primary driver is faster execution of headcount reductions related to our planned SG&A cost energies. In fact, at this point, we've completed more than 95% of the headcount reductions associated with our synergy plan. As a result, we now expect 2021 cost synergies to be $100 million to $105 million, which means that cumulatively we expect to have achieved synergies of $115 million to $120 million by the end of the year. But to be clear, this is an acceleration of the timing of our synergies as opposed to an overall increase in our performance. Therefore, our total cost energy target of $175 million is unchanged.  In addition to higher cost synergies, Delphi's revenue contribution in 2021 is also tracking ahead of our original expectations. As a result of these two factors, the accretion to 2021 adjusted EPS from the Delphi acquisition is now expected to be positive $0.20 to $0.30 versus our expectation at closing of a dilutive impact of approximately $0.15. This is a great result and a testament to the work being done by the integration teams across the company. And as we look beyond 2021, it's important to note that the revenue synergies associated with the transaction are also progressing very well. We're pleased with the systems awards that we generated through combining our electric vehicle capabilities, including the iDM award in China that Fred mentioned earlier, we've been able to secure these and other components awards as a result of leveraging Delphi\u2019s technology leadership with BorgWarner\u2019s commercial relationships, operational capabilities, and financial strength.  Let's turn to Slide 15 for a summary of the financial impact of the AKASOL acquisition. As you can see, we expect AKASOL to contribute 2021 sales of $75 million to BorgWarner\u2019s second half results. Then we would expect those sales to grow significantly over the next few years with 2024 sales still expected to be in the $0.5 billion range. This growth is supported by AKASOL\u2019s previously reported backlog. From an EPS perspective, we expect AKASOL to have a roughly breakeven impact on the total company in 2021 excluding the impact of purchase price amortization. Then as the business grows sequentially each year, we do expect to see conversion on the incremental revenue, which we expect to drive accretion of $0.12 by 2024 also excluding the impact of purchase price amortization. We're pleased with the transaction and the medium to long term benefits it is expected to deliver.  So let me summarize my financial remarks. Overall, we had another solid quarter despite the industry challenges. We meaningfully outperformed the market, delivered a 10.7% operating margin, and generated $133 million of free cash flow. And then coming off that Q2 performance, we've increased our full year revenue and earnings guidance even while moderating our industry production assumptions and considering higher commodity costs. Looking beyond our near-term results, we believe the faster accretion from the Delphi Technologies acquisition and the completion of the AKASOL acquisition illustrate our ability to execute the inorganic actions that are part of our project charging forward initiative.  The electrification wins discussed by Fred also highlights some of our progress towards the organic portion of our plan. Ultimately, it's the pillars of near-term execution, securing future profitable growth and disciplined inorganic investments that will drive the success of our strategy and thus try value creation for our shareholders. With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Pat. Patrick Nolan : Thank you, Kevin. Jerome, we are ready to open up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Chris McNally with Evercore. Your line is open. Christopher McNally : Great. Thanks so much, everyone. Wanted to maybe talk a little bit about the second half assumption. Just based on your guidance, you had a very strong first half of 850 million of EBIT guidance in the second half implied something lower in the 750 million to 800 million range, which would obviously be down sequentially, but also down year-over-year versus the pro formas that you have provided on up revenue. So if you could just provide some of the puts and takes there, that would be really helpful? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric B. Lissalde: Yeah, I think maybe to make it simple why don\u2019t I speak relative to the midpoint of the range. But as you think first half to second half, I think when you exclude the impact of AKASOL which is $75 million revenue sequentially, first half to second half is down a couple of hundred million dollars. So obviously we have lost conversion on that revenue. But then on top of that as you're going first half to second half, you've got the net commodity headwinds, which are an incremental $20 million to $40 million in the second half. Our R&D on a net basis is stepping up in the second half, another $25 million to $30 million and those things are being partially offset by about $20 million to $25 million of incremental synergies. So, that's kind of the walk as you look first half to second half.  I think the thing if you look year-over-year, if you're talking second half of this year versus our pro form a second half of last year, I think one of the things you have to keep in mind is part of the revenue walk is AKASOL of $75 million and foreign exchange, which is a little bit over $100 million, so $200 million of our revenue improvement comes with virtually no margin because FX converts to basically our operating income and AKASOL actually because of purchase price amortization is dilutive this year about $10 million. The net is no conversion on that incremental $200 million which means what it means then on the revenue that's left, there's actually the downside conversion at the midpoint of our guide, plus those other things I spoke of the commodity costs, R&D being up, but synergies being a little bit of an offset. So hopefully that helps. Christopher McNally : Yeah, that's great detail. Thanks so much. And then if we talk to the second side of the business and you announced several EV wins in the quarter. Of note the three on my voltage that are obviously are of more significant value, the dual inverter and iDM. Could you talk about just relative how you may think of a hard number but relative to the -- are we talking about hundreds of million into the backlog in addition where these are 100,000 per year type vehicles or is it something that you expect a little bit smaller? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric B. Lissalde: I think the volumes are meaningful and what we've seen also is it is time we book a business in this field, volume expectation is going up and up. So, those are two great programs for us. And from an iDM perspective, as you've seen, we're building a modular portfolio, it's a different power output, different power level, and so very happy about that and hitting the market with great products. Christopher McNally : Great. Thanks so much. Operator : Your next question comes from Luke Junk with Baird. Your line is open. Luke Junk : Yeah, good morning. First question I want to ask is if there's any additional color that you could share in the scope of the iDM whether you disclose today, should we think about this as an award on the single vehicle or could it potentially cut across platform at the customer? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric B. Lissalde: So right now the iDM -- the iDM is a power level. So within that power level, it cuts across the vehicles that the customer wants to tailor for that power level. So that's the color I can give you. It starts with the platform and we'll cut across 250 kilowatt power level. Luke Junk : Okay, that's helpful. Thank you. And then bigger picture, one of the filters here is that you had highlighted at your Investor Day in March was iDMs in Asia in general, seeing here five to six months later, you've now booked a couple of these awards and we're still not even a year out from the closure of the Delphi deal, is it fair to say that the level of interest in Asia is consistent with or it maybe even a little better than you had anticipated in March? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric B. Lissalde: It's in line with what we expected and this is currently where the music is played the loudest from an EV acceleration standpoint. This is where we're going to gain scale early, very happy about that. And the technology that we bring in to the market and the competitiveness that we bring into the market with in house transmission, motor electronic software is very, very well received. Operator : Your next question comes from Brian Johnson with Barclays. Your line is open. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric B. Lissalde: Brian, are you there? Operator : Brian Johnson from Barclays, your line is open. Patrick Nolan : Jerome, I think we can go to the next question. Operator : Okay. Your next question comes from Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Joseph Spak : Thank you very much. And thanks for that first half to second half walk, that was helpful. I guess just on the commodities, if I'm following along it seems like on a year-over-year basis, you're talking about another $55 million or so headwind in the back half. I just want to confirm that. And also if you could just sort of remind us of your policy here because I thought over time, you tend to get some recoveries there, so as we begin to think about the bridge into 2022, does this sort of headwind remain or do you start to get some of those recoveries on the raw materials? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric B. Lissalde: Yeah, I think you've got the number right. As you look at the second half of the year on a year-over-year basis it's in the $45 million to $64 million range. So you've hit the midpoint exactly right. And that is a net number, net of our recoveries. Now obviously, there are some timing lags as it relates to recoveries, but the bulk of those recoveries are expected to be in our results as we progress through the year. And so that number that we're talking about the 45 to 65 in the back half of the year on a year-over-year basis is net of the recoveries already. But there might be a little bit of a tailwind heading into the first quarter of next year. Joseph Spak : So, I mean -- if these commodity levels hold, then it's fair to assume at an absolute level there's still a headwind in the first half of next year, even if maybe it's mitigated somewhat by some of the recovery timing? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric B. Lissalde: Yes, a little bit. So certainly because the headwinds as we go first half to second half or definitely more negative call it $20 million to $40 million and as that carries over to the -- to the extent it carries over into Q1 of next year, that would be an incremental headwind on a year-over-year basis relative to Q1 of this year. But of course, there's lots of moving pieces as we head into the beginning of the year. We know next year in 2023 we got another 55 million to 60 million of synergies to recoup from the Delphi transaction. We've got the legacy BorgWarner restructuring actions we announced 18 months ago and you remember, we said those actions were to mitigate unknown risks. These are the types of risk exactly that we were geared toward, things that were unforeseen at the time, and that's another 25 plus million of tailwind next year with the legacy Delphi restructuring actions project, which is incremental tailwind next year. And then any conversion on our continued outgrowth. So there's a lots of puts and takes as we head toward next year, but incrementally if commodity levels held, there would be an incremental headwind heading into next Q1 versus this year's Q1. Joseph Spak : Okay. And then the second question is just Fred, maybe this is a question we've been getting a lot from investors, right. So at your Analyst Day, I think you sort of put up a slide to show you fit 80% of inverters would be outsourced. It seems like during the quarter, whether it was [indiscernible] some others like there's more and more announcements of automakers trying to do power electronics themselves. And so it seems like -- it would seem like maybe that figure is incrementally more challenged. I'm curious whether your view has changed there or is this just a definition issue, meaning like by in sourcing, you mean like the OEMs actually make it but in reality in some of these cases like the OEMs might help with design, but they won't necessarily build. Joseph Spak : Yes. I think in relative we -- I believe we are in a very, very strong position. And we've already announced more than a 1.1 million units by 2025 in Europe. If you do the math, it's a significant share of the overall European inverter volume for that and since then, more booking happened. We don't see too much change. I think and it's due to two to three reasons, we are successful in this field for three reasons. First, it's our product leadership. The different voltage 400 and 800 silicon carbide, we continue to innovate with cost and rate reduction with more efficiencies. Two is we have scale. And I absolutely believe that this continues to be a strength. And we are leveraging the whole electronics business that we have. And last but not least, I think we also have a high degree of vertical integration, in house capabilities, integrated silicate development, software power modules, and maybe more in the future. I think this is a very competitive business. You have to have the best efficiency at the best costs. You have to have scale. And I'm very confident that we are in a very good position to grab a significant portion of what will be outsourced and we're not seeing a change from about 80% of outsourced inverter volume to suppliers. Joseph Spak : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Colin Langan with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Colin Langan : Great, thanks for taking my question. You've done a pretty good job here. You keep cutting your sort of production assumption and yet you keep raising your sales guidance. I mean, what is driving that much better than expected growth over market, does mix have anything to do with that with the commercial maybe holding it better? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric B. Lissalde: So, I think we all grew the market in Q2. We under performed in North America due to customer exposures and we over performed in Europe and China double-digit, driven pretty much by all products. There is not one product that drives more than the other. Now in Q2, I must admit there was a lot of moving pieces. And we're not looking at our growth per quarter, that is too finite. So, we're very happy with the way our top line is evolving this year. And very happy to be able to beat and raise in the short-term. Also very focused in the long-term. We are investing in R&D in order to support the programs that have been booked and very happy with where we are both short-term on the margin and cash flow and also the activities from a long-term booking. And I want to take the example, people focus a lot on downstream at that rate, but the example of that high voltage I think it's a great example where BorgWarner can develop in house and really solve a problem of battery electric vehicle. Battery electric vehicle require innovation solutions for two critical functions, battery thermal and cabin heating. And the solution that we gave to the market is taking a lot of traction. You won't be surprised we have our own integrated electronics and software and we are leveraging the hinting technologies that we have from other BorgWarner product lines. So very happy about where we are both organic and in inorganic in the long term. Colin Langan : Got it. And any color on the commercial market, I kind of thought that was holding in better, but if I look at your guidance from Q1 to Q2 actually your outlook is getting -- it actually came down. So did that actually hold up better in the quarter, does it get a lot worse in the second half now because I know that's a pretty high margin business I think with the top five deal, it's a larger chunk of your business now? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric B. Lissalde: Yeah, I mean, one of the big things is that China we would expect to see headwinds as we look at the back half of the year from a year-over-year production perspective and that obviously has an impact on us and our overall outlook. Colin Langan : Okay. And is that -- okay. So the second half is getting weaker. Okay, thanks for taking my question. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric B. Lissalde: Yeah, second half is weaker on a year-over-year basis definitely. And China is a big driver of that. Colin Langan : Got it. Operator : And your next question comes from Dan Levy with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Dan Levy : Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking the question. I just want to follow-up on Colin\u2019s question there just from the outgrowth. Can you maybe unpack some of the items that you saw in the second quarter that drove the outgrowth between DCT and Turbo and GDI, just maybe a little more color on what exactly was driving that and as we're thinking about especially in Europe to push the beds, is there any shift in where GDI and Turbo sits in automakers pushing toward their Co2 targets? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric B. Lissalde: Yes. And as I mentioned before, we out grew Europe and China double-digit driven by a lot of factors. But you're right, gas turbos, VCTs and GDI in Europe also drives. And so this is driven by also -- don't forget that in any hybrid architecture, you've got a good gasoline engine with Turbo and GDI and other elements. And don't forget that hybrid power trainer, especially in Europe, but also in China and the business that we booked with the dual inverter is a good example is ramping up very, very fast. And that is giving us on the e-side scale and lounge expertise that are translatable into the world of Bev. And on the combustion side, it just pulls our products that drive efficient combustion engine. So I think it's -- I think it's that particular reason. I don't have the color about how much is Turbo versus VCT or GDI or all-wheel drive, but I'm pretty sure Pat can follow-up offline with you. Dan Levy : Okay. And then the line of sight for the remainder of year as far as GDI and Turbo in Europe, is that something that it's still playing rolling in driving Co2 targets? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric B. Lissalde: Absolutely it does. Absolutely it does. It does in reducing the Co2 and emissions of combustion engines. It does because it is an enabler of hybrid power trains and as you've seen, this is helping car makers in Europe especially to meet the Co2 target. So absolutely it does help. Dan Levy : Great. Thanks. And then as a follow-up, I just wanted a follow-up on the last quarter's announcement, which with a little more color in June, the iDM award with Hyundai. So you have an A segment car here and it's putting in iDM content that's -- I had to guess its $1000 give or take if you can maybe comment on the content, but the question is, usually an A segment car is going to be a much tighter content cost, there's a much lower budget for content. So what does it tell us about going into B or C segment platforms, does that tell you that there is better potential to scale that up to B or C segment, or is there something unique about an A segment vehicle that makes them more likely to approach you on an iDM as opposed to doing it in house? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric B. Lissalde: So last quarter, we announced the iDM award on Class A, so small. Small doesn't mean simple, but small. This quarter we're announcing a different type of iDM, bigger with about twice the output power than the one from Hyundai. And as I mentioned in the last call, we're building iDM modular portfolio, and this is a great example of launching two different power level although made in Asia. Combined with the iDMs that we are currently producing as an integrator, you see that we're starting seeing a path of integrating with other motors or even other inverters if the customer wishes to do that. A path for different power levels, different sizes of iDM, all BorgWarner made transmission, motor power electronic software and vertically integrated on the ASIC and so on. And a path with components. And as we mentioned in past calls, we're very happy to sell inverters to customers who want to make iDM in house. So you're seeing the strategy of developing and commercializing a portfolio of iDMs globally that is seeing daylight. Dan Levy : Great. Thank you. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric B. Lissalde: You are welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Noah Kaye : Thanks. Good morning. Appreciate your taking the questions. I guess first, congrats on closing AKASOL. Just wanted to understand what margins roughly are you assuming for AKASOL by 2024 and the accretion estimates you provided excluding amortization. And then more strategically, how do you see AKASOL maintaining competitive differentiation in battery tax over time? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric B. Lissalde: Yeah. With respect to the margin, we're not disclosing a margin outlook at this point in time, but I think you can probably do some math underlying our EPS and get a sense as to what the pretax assumptions are as it relates to the overall performance of that P&L relative to the 0.5 billion or so of revenue that we're expecting by the year 2024. But at this point, again, not going to disclose any margin profiles other than we think it's going to be a profitable business over time. As far as far as technology -- technological edge at AKASOL, a few things Noah. First, they are currently producing the Gen 2, they are launching their Gen 3 later this year and being able to launch generation and improve efficiency and power density regularly is key. Now they are part of, soon they will be fully part of BorgWarner. And you can imagine that we will be working with them and linking them with the battery management system and software that we have currently in production coming from Delphi Technologies. We certainly are going to link them also to the high voltage coolant heaters. Those elements are heating the coolant for the batteries. And I expect that we're going to find innovation and products that are going to be generating value for our customers and for BorgWarner going forward. Noah Kaye : Very helpful. Thanks. And then just around R&D to clarify the new guidance, 725 million of spend that compares to 5% previously. So, just to understand, are you actually bumping up R&D levels from prior guidance and so is that driven by EV programs, kind of where is the focus, just help us understand? Kevin Nowlan : Yeah. I'll take that, a couple of things worth noting around the R&D guide, first thing is that when you look at our Q2 results, I mean, when you get a chance to go through our 10Q, you'll see that our net R&D sequentially was down in the second quarter versus the first quarter. But it's because we actually had higher customer recoveries from engineering perspective than we had anticipated and then we had in Q1 by about $20 million. If you look at our gross R&D going from Q1 to Q2, it was actually up sequentially, but the net was down. And so what that means is that that's actually had an impact. We've actually brought down our implied full year R&D from what was about $740 million implicitly at the beginning of the year to about $725 million as our current guide. And so that's really being driven by the higher than anticipated customer recoveries that we generated in the second quarter.  As you look at it as a percent, the reason we gave a dollar guide as opposed to a percentage guide is the percentage is coming down. And the reason the percentage in 2021 is coming down is because revenue is going up. So it's not because we're cutting our R&D spend, we had better recoveries, but our R&D spend is actually still $725 million. But with revenue coming -- going up, the R&D as a percent of sales is actually now 4.6% to 4.8% which just looks like a lower percentage, but it's implying lower spend, but it really isn't the case. So, as we look to the full year, that's what the 725 represents about a $15 million reduction but really driven by the recoveries. And then as we think ahead to next year and beyond, we continue to expect that we're going to be driving R&D spend in that 5% plus range on a go forward basis. Noah Kaye : That's very helpful detail. Thanks Kevin. I will jump back. Patrick Nolan : Jerome, we are ready for the next question. Operator : Your next question comes from David Kelley with Jefferies. Your line is open. Gavin Kennedy : Hi guys, this is Gavin Kennedy on for David. Two from my end. First, you mentioned that North America customer mix was a headwind in 2Q. Just was curious what BorgWarner is seeing as far as visibility to customer schedules in North America three year in? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric B. Lissalde: What we're seeing is a better mix and recovery coming into Q3 and Q4 from the Q2 level and still very volatile, especially because of the semiconductor supply issues, that's what we are currently seeing Gavin. Gavin Kennedy : Okay. That's helpful. And then switching gears, at your Investor Day you mentioned 3 billion to 4 billion in targeted legacy ice disposition by 25 and about call it 1 billion in the next year or so. Can you comment on how disposition conversations are going, particularly given the volatile current environment and any additional commentary you can give us on what products you might be focused on in these dispositions, that would be helpful? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric B. Lissalde: Yeah, I mean, it's in progress. Just as you noted, the 1 billion or so we expected to execute over a 12 to 18 month timeframe from what we announced at Investor Day, which means as we get to the end of Q3 we expect to complete that full billion or so. And we're in progress right now. And as we talked about, we're really focused on disposing product lines or businesses that don't meet the long-term financial objectives of our portfolio. Which means they lack one of three things, they either lack product leadership, they lack medium to long term growth prospects, or they lack strong margin and cash flow generating ability. And so if our product line or a business doesn't tick off three of those boxes, if a candidate for disposition. So, at this point, we're actively moving forward in line with what we talked about at our Investor Day, and we think we're on track to deliver that billion or so of dispositions, I call it mid to late 2022 consistent with the timeframe that we laid out back at Investor Day. And then we continue to expect $3 billion to $4 billion by the end of 2025. Gavin Kennedy : Great. Thank you, everyone. Operator : Your next question comes from Brian Johnson with Barclays. Your line is open. Brian Johnson : Thank you. And I apologize if this was covered in the opening, but I kind of doubt it. When you look at the 800 volt mark and I was struck at the Chicago Auto Show by the Hyundai 800 volt systems and of course, the advantages. A small question is, can you confirm it around that or not? But the bigger question is 800 volts started in the high performance market with the Porsche. Now we see it in Hyundai. I know your new EV motor runs on 800 volts for commercial. So my question is, do you see 800 volts as a big trend, one? Two, is the inverter product line you got from Delphi Tech uniquely positioned in that market relative to competitors? And three, are there synergies then between your 800 volt converter capability, your e-motor capability, and where AKASOL could go and is AKASOL capable of doing 800 volt packs? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric B. Lissalde: So, the answer to your first question is 800 volt a big trend and is it going down in vehicle size? The answer is yes. Why, because it increases the power density and decreases the charging time. Are we well equipped, absolutely. The answer is absolutely yes. We are going to be one of the first one launching very soon, 800 volt silicon carbide at high volume. This is a competitive advantage that we have to master high voltage silicon carbide and also master 800 volts made in house power module, which is the heart of the inverter. Synergies, absolutely I was talking at about high voltage coolant heaters. We will start in 2024 a 800 volt high voltage coolant heater and yet our synergies across the different product portfolio that we have running at 800 volts Brian. Brian Johnson : And could AKASOL do 800 volt packs? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric B. Lissalde: I need to check that. My answer is yes, but I need to go back to you on this one particularly. Brian Johnson : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from Emmanuel Rosner from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Emmanuel Rosner : Thank you and good morning everybody. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric B. Lissalde: Good morning. Emmanuel Rosner : The first question was about your crossover market outlook. It is good to see you boosting the outlook for the full year. Can you talk in a little bit more detail around what you are expecting for the second half of the year, obviously, you mentioned mix improving and customer mix in particular, but then obviously, you had pretty solid growth of market already in the second quarter and then for the full year, you had 500 to 600 basis points. How would you see this play out in the second half? And then just looking a little bit more forward, how should we think about the mix going forward, does this then represent a headwind in 2022, does this acceleration in growth of market make you rethink your framework for growth of our market? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric B. Lissalde: Yes. I mean, a couple of things. When you look at the first half year-to-date, we're somewhere between 650 to 700 basis points of cumulative outgrowth for the first half. And so as we look at the second half of the year, we don't think we'll be operating at quite that pace. We think we're probably in the 400 to 550 basis points for that second half. The first half we've benefited from some mix. We've probably benefited from some production of vehicles that were ultimately in the production numbers of the OE. So there's probably some level of impact that's implied in our numbers in the second half, which is why you see a lower year-over-year and implicitly step down sequentially going from the first half to the second half. But overall feel good about our ability to deliver 500 to 600 basis points for the full year.  In terms of what that translates to for future years, not prepared to give any update on that. I mean, we feel good about the backlog we've disclosed previously looking out 2022 to 2024 and we'll probably give an update on that as we get into the beginning of next year. Emmanuel Rosner : Okay, thanks. And then second question on iDM, just diving a little bit deeper here, can you just give us a sense of how you think about the range of content per vehicle and how would you see your either volume or revenue and margin profile of that line of business evolve over the next few years. So sort of like a mid-term outlook and how you would see iDM go from here. Kevin Nowlan : Our rich comprehensive vehicle is going to range from about $1000 for the small versions and times 3 or 4 for much higher sizes. I'm not going to comment on volumes, I am not allowed to comment on volumes. Only I think that gives you some color on the content vehicle. And then on the margin side of the equation, because we've talked about before, any new product programs, whether they're combustion based product or an EV product like an iDM, we look at on our return on invested capital basis. And given that we are predominantly from a manufacturing perspective in the assembly business, what that means is the capital intensity of our programs including the iDM tend to be similar to our other product lines. And so as we drive to deliver consistent ROIC across our product portfolio and we have relatively consistent capital intensity, it means the margin profile on any discrete program looks substantially similar to the margin programs of other business that we approved throughout company, whether it's EV or not. Emmanuel Rosner : And that would be from day one or is there a target data on this? Kevin Nowlan : Well, that's the life of a program. So when you look at our EV programs, generally speaking, they tend to have much more R&D intensity, which tends to be upfront. So as we're growing in EVs, what happens is we have a lot more R&D hitting the P&L upfront. And then you generate the contribution margins over time and the blend of all that hits our ROIC targets over the life of the program. But what that means as you're in ramp up mode across EV, your R&D is much higher proportionately relative to the conversion you're generating on the incremental revenue because the revenue is still coming in the future. So the EV portfolio in total has a more depressed margin while you're in gross mode, but that's not because of the underlying fundamentals of the business. It's because we're growing and investing in R&D to support the contribution margins that we will generate over the coming years as we start to generate the revenue. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric B. Lissalde: Two things I would add. I mean first is that everything that Kevin has said is and the additional R&D that we do for EV is already in our margin profile, right? And two, we are currently spending 30% of R&D and EV when our revenue is 3% to 5% like -- or like the market is quite frankly. So that shows you how deliberate we are in accelerating the path forwards electrification. Emmanuel Rosner : Yes, definitely. Appreciate it. Thanks. Operator : We have time for one final question and that question comes from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Mark Delaney : Yes. Good morning and thanks very much for taking the question. First, I wanted to talk on Delphi and reflecting back when that was announced. Part of the industrial logic was that Delphi would give the company a broader set of technologies, including for EVs. I know some of that's with iDM but more holistically, so you that you've had that asset for a longer period of time, you have a few wins with iDM, can you give more clarity on your win rates and to what extent you're converting on that broader set of solutions is to the extent that you had been anticipating? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric B. Lissalde:  So, yeah, we -- only six months after the close we booked iDM, which is very important, but it's not limited to those systems. We also booked a lot of inverters that we think could be booked only with that combination. We are also accelerating on battery management system, the software battery management system. So from a top line synergy perspective, we're absolutely on track with what we expected coming into the Delphi acquisition. Mark Delaney : Got it, it\u2019s helpful. And then you talked already a little bit about the supply chain situation and your views on a second half versus the first half. But maybe you talk a little bit more on the longer-term implications from the supply shortages, some of the OEMs have said that they want to change, are they going to procure supply and then work more directly with some semiconductor companies and how do you think that may impact a Tier one like BorgWarner in terms of how you may partner both with your customers and suppliers and some of the implications around margins and working capital? Thanks. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric B. Lissalde: So, we are not seeing that trend at least in the products that we focus on. But what that thing -- with that semiconductor issue has told us is that it is extremely important to partner, upstream and downstream. Upstream with our customers and downstream with our semiconductor suppliers. The second thing that it has taught us I think is that scale matters and is easier to get going when you have scaled enough. And I think those two lessons, we're going to keep very close to our mind when we move forward in the next year. Mark Delaney : Got it. Thank you. Patrick Nolan : Thank you all for your great questions today. If you have any other follow-up questions feel free to reach out to me directly. Jerome, go ahead and close up the call. Operator : Alright. That concludes the BorgWarner 2021 second quarter results conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BorgWarner 2021 Third Quarter Results conference call. All lines have been placed in mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to Patrick Nolan, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Nolan, you may begin your conference. Patrick Nolan : Thank you, Jay. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We issued our earnings release earlier this morning. It's posted on our website, borgwarner.com, on our homepage and on our Investor Relations homepage. With regard to our Investor Relations calendar, we will be attending multiple conferences between now and our next earnings release. Please see the event section of our Investor Relations homepage for a full list. Before we begin, I need to inform you that during this call, we may make forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties as detailed in our 10-K. Our actual results may differ significantly from the matters discussed today.  During today's presentation, we will highlight certain non-GAAP measures in order to provide a clearer picture of the core business performance and to prepare us in purposes for prior periods. When you hear us say on a comparable basis, that means excluding the impact of FX, net M&A other noncomparable items. When you hear us say adjusted, that means excluding noncomparable items. When you hear us say organic, that means excluding the impact of FX and net M&A. We will also refer to our growth compared to our market.  When you hear us say market, that means the change in light and commercial vehicle production waited for our geographic exposure. Our outgrowth is defined as our organic revenue change versus this market. Please note that we posted an earnings call presentation, the [Indiscernible] page of our website. We encourage you to follow along to these slides during our discussion. With that, I'm happy to turn the call over to Fred. Frederic B. Lissalde : Thank you [Indiscernible] and good day, everyone. Let's start on Slide 5. We're very pleased to share our results for the third quarter and provide an overall Company update. The third quarter operating environment was very challenged, both from an absolute volume perspective and in light of the production volatility we experienced throughout this quarter. Overall, we're doing a solid job managing the near-term environment, while securing our future growth. With just over $3.4 billion in sales, our third quarter revenue decreased by about 7% organically.  Excluding the year-over-year growth in our aftermarket business, our OEM business declined 9% compared to the 22% decline in our market during the quarter as we benefited from new business and favorable mix. Our margin and cash flow performance in the quarter was impacted by the volatile production environment, which put pressure on near-term cost containment and drove excess inventory within our plans. Even with those challenges, we're still on track to delivering a near double-digit operating margin for the full year.  And we still expect full-year free cash flow to be amongst the strongest results in our history. I want to thank all our employees and particularly our plant managers and plant management teams around the world, who are working very hard to manage the short-term and serve our customers. At the same time, we're very focused on ensuring that we secure our future. To that end, this past quarter, we won multiple new product awards for electric vehicles, which I will speak about in a few moments. As a result of these awards, along with wins in prior quarters, we are well on our way to achieving the organic, electric vehicle 2025 revenue target, and delaying our project challenging forward.  In fact, we estimate that more than 90% of that target is already booked. Let's now turn to slide 6, where you can see our perspective on global industry production for the remainder of 2021. The market environment continues to be extremely volatile, with the risk of future production disruption rising from ongoing supply constraints. With that in mind, on the full-year basis, we now expect our global weighted light vehicle and commercial vehicle markets to be down 2.5% to flat year-over-year. This is down materially from our previous assumption, reflecting both the third quarter decline and our most recent expectations for the fourth quarter. As you can see from the line chart, showing the different scenario we do expect light vehicle industry production to improve sequentially, Q3 to Q4. Underlying customer demand remains robust however, just like we saw in the third quarter, industry production levels will be dependent on the varying impact of ongoing supply constraints and on the potential impact on our customer mix. Overall, we expect the challenging environment to continue throughout the remainder of 2021. And at this point, we think it will carry on well into 2022. As we manage this challenging environment, we are also continuing to focus on securing our mid to long-term opportunities in electric vehicle. And we did just that during this quarter, securing several awards for electric vehicle programs. I'm very proud of the team. Two of those awards are highlighted on slide 7. First, we secured a major award for North American inverter with a global OEM expected to launch in 2024. This high-voltage silicon carbide program is our largest inverter win to-date. This business award also marks the Company's first major win in the North American market. It will also be used in multiple battery-electric vehicle platforms, including [Indiscernible] and trucks. Our product performance, scalability, cost competitiveness, size optimization, and global manufacturing footprint all contributed to securing this business win. Additionally, we announced a new 800-volt silicon carbide inverter award with a German OEM expected to launch in early 2025. This award expense, our existing 400-volt inverter business with the same German customer, by now adding 800-volt products.  This new technology offers enhanced power density, proven performance, and long-term reliability. Given these two new and significant inverter awards, I would like to give you an update on our positioning in the inverter market on slide eight. We've had tremendous success establishing ourselves in this market. When I think about BorgWarner's competitive advantages in power electronics, it's driven by. First, the breadth of our product portfolio, this allows us to be faster and more effective at bringing products to market. Second, our ability to innovate, like with our Viper power module technology. We can continue our innovations in part, due to our vertical integration strategy. We have in-house capabilities for power modules, integrated circuit development, and software, which we feel our advantage in the marketplace. And finally, I think the last driver is our ability to leverage the electronic scale that we already have across our Company, and especially within our engine control units. The result is that we have secured significant new business award. And as you can see by the chart on this slide, we expect the business to grow rapidly from about 500 thousand units in 2021 to 2.5 million units by 2025, representing about 50% CAGR. We expect this volume to drive total inverter sales of $1.7 billion by 2025 -- in 2025, sorry.  And remember, these programs are already booked. We continue to pursue additional inverter opportunities with production volumes in 2025 and beyond, and would expect to secure more rewards in the coming quarters. And one more thing, with the business we've already won, we believe that we are positioned to be the #1 non-captive inverter producer globally by 2025. With that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin. Kevin Nowlan : Thank you, Fred. And good morning, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 9. As we look at our year-over-year revenue walk for Q3, we begin with pro-forma 2020 revenue of just under $3.6 billion, which includes a little over $1 billion of revenue from Delphi Technologies. Next, you can see those foreign currencies increased revenue by about 2%. Then our organic revenue declined year-over-year, was approximately 7% or almost 9% excluding growth in our aftermarket segment. That compares to a 22% decrease in weighted average market production, which suggests that our outgrowth in the quarter was more than 13%. Now with that said, the significant volatility in production schedules and the varying levels of supply disruptions among our customers are continuing to make it difficult to draw conclusions from the quarterly outgrowth figures. Nonetheless, we were pleased that we delivered strong relative revenue performance in all three major markets, despite the overall decline in revenue. Regionally in Europe, we outperformed, driven by new business and small gasoline turbochargers and fuel injection products. In China, we also outperformed the market driven by the resilience in the form of Delphi businesses. And in North America, we outperformed the market primarily due to new business, as well as vehicle and customer mix. The sum of all this was just over $3.4 billion of revenue in Q3. Now let's look at our earnings and cash flow performance on Slide 10. Our third quarter adjusted operating income was $311 million compared to pro forma operating income of 396 million last year.  This yielded an adjusted operating margin of 9.1% On a comparable basis, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and the impact of AKASOL, adjusted operating income decreased $79 million on $261 million of lower sales. That translates to a decremental margin of approximately 30%. This higher than typical decremental margin was primarily driven by $24 million of higher commodity costs net of customer recoveries. Excluding these higher commodity costs, our year-over-year decremental margin was approximately 19%, which we view as a sign that we're effectively managing our operating cost performance in spite of the supply-chain disruptions.  Moving on to cash flow, we consume $10 million of free cash flow during the 3rd quarter. This was worse than our expectations going into the quarter due to lower-than-expected operating income, as well as higher than planned inventories. Fundamentally, when production declines this rapidly and unexpectedly, it's difficult to get an inventory out of the system in the near term. We expect inventory to improve in the coming quarters, once we see less volatility in production orders, which will give us the ability to right-size our supply chain demands accordingly. Now let's talk about our full-year financial outlook on Slide 11. We now expect our end markets to be down 2.5% to flat for the year. Next, we expect to drive market outgrowth for the full year of approximately 1,000 basis points.  This contemplates the strong performance to date, with a sequential step-down in the fourth quarter, as we expect to return to more normalized year-over-year outgrowth in Q4. Based on these assumptions, we expect our 2021 organic revenue, to increase approximately 8.5% to 11% relative to 2020 pro forma revenue. Then, adding an expected $425 million benefit from stronger foreign currencies and an expected $70 million related to the acquisition of AKASOL, we're projecting total 2021 revenue to be in the range of $14.4 billion to $14.7 billion.  This wide revenue guidance range reflects the continued production uncertainty we have in the fourth quarter. From a margin perspective, we expect our full-year adjusted operating margin to be in the range of 9.6% to 10.0% compared to a pro forma 2020 margin of 8.3%. This contemplates the business delivering full-year incremental in the low 20% range before the impact of Delphi related cost synergies and purchase price accounting. From a cost synergy perspective, our margin guidance continues to include $100 million to $105 million of incremental benefit in 2021, the same as our prior guidance.  Based on this revenue and margin outlook, we're now expecting full year adjusted EPS of $3.65 to $3.95 per diluted share. And finally, we expect that we'll deliver free cash flow in the range of $600 million to $700 million for the full year. The reduction versus our prior guidance is a little larger than our projected decline in operating income as we expect inventory to remain higher than usual through the fourth quarter. Then once we head into 2022, we expect to start to see reductions in inventory toward more normalized levels. That's our 2021 outlook.  Let's turn to Slide 12. Given the uncertain outlook for the remainder of 2021, we felt it appropriate to provide you with some of our initial thoughts on some key financial drivers and strategic priorities heading into 2022. Starting with our top-line, as of right now, we do expect to see supply chain challenges, particularly with respect to semiconductors continue well into 2022. Ultimately, where full-year 2022 industry production shakes out, will depend on the scope and duration of these challenges. But at this point, we would still expect a modest level of growth in industry production next year.  Next, we expect to deliver outgrowth in 2022. However, we're currently assessing the extent to which the much stronger-than-expected outgrowth in 2021 will result in any headwind to our outgrowth next year. From a cost perspective, we expect incremental Delphi related cost synergies in the $40 million to $45 million range, and we also expect incremental restructuring savings of $40 million to $50 million. These combined savings are expected to largely offset our estimated increase in R&D spending of approximately $100 million. We're planning for the significant increase in R&D spending in order to support the new business wins we've achieved to date, and to pursue additional EV opportunities consistent with our charging forward organic growth objectives.  And finally, we're building our plans based on the assumption that we'll see sustained levels of commodity inflation continuing into 2022, which means we expect that to create a year-over-year headwind during the first and second quarters. That's the near term. But while we're managing the near-term, we're also focused on securing our long-term future. Consistent with our charging forward initiative, we have 3 key strategic priorities heading into next year. First, we plan to continue to pursue and secure additional electric vehicle awards, for both components and systems. Second, we intend to execute additional M&A to accelerate our positioning electric vehicles. And finally, we expect to complete the disposition of approximately $1 billion in combustion revenue. Ultimately, it's the pillars of near-term execution, securing future profitable growth, and disciplined inorganic investments that will drive the success of our strategy and thus drive value creation for our shareholders. With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Fred. Frederic B. Lissalde : Thank you, Kevin. I'm not really excited to share an update of our progress towards our project challenging forward targets on Slide 13. As evidenced by our program announcements over the past several quarters, including the 2 wins that I alluded to earlier, we're making significant progress on the organic growth in electric vehicles underlying our charging forward plan. As of this call, we have now booked electric vehicle programs leading to about $2.3 billion of revenue in 2025. Or to put it another way, with this booked business, we're more than 90% of the way towards our $2.5 billion organic revenue target we gave you back in March. The breakdown of this program is highlighted on the chart to the left.  We're excited about the mix of both components and system awards and importantly, our booked business is across all major regions with leading OEMs. Plus, we expect to add to this booked business portfolio over the next quarters by securing additional EV awards with 2025 revenues. And then, we will supplement this organically-developed revenue with EV revenues from AKASOL and any future acquisitions. The takeaway from today is this. It's a challenging near-term environment, but, once again, BorgWarner is successfully managing the present and delivering solid financial results. At the same time, we're delivering our future. We're doing this by establishing product leadership and winning new business in the world of electrification. And with these wins, we are successfully executing on our long-term strategy, challenging forward, which will deliver value to our shareholders long into the future. With that I'd like to turn the call back over to Pat. Patrick Nolan : Thank you, Fred. Jay, we're ready to open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. In the interest of time, please limit your questions to one question and one follow-up question. We'll pause for a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Our first question comes from the line of Colin Langan of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Colin Langan : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Just looking sequentially, the midpoint of guidance would imply sales are down and also margins are down sequentially. Just any color on one -- I think you commented that you thought the market was up, so is there a certain sort of product mix that's a headwind as you go into Q4? And why would margin slide sequentially? Kevin Nowlan : Yes. Thanks, Colin. A couple things. Even though production is expected to be sequentially up, our revenue when you look at what's embedded in our guidance is expected to be under a little bit more pressure because we had 13+% outgrowth in Q4 or Q3, but as you step into Q4, our implicit guidance somewhere of outgrowth in the range of 7.5% to 8.5%. So sequentially, actually, it's a revenue headwind even though market production is up. So, when you look at our revenue, our revenue actually is under more pressure on a sequential basis. The other thing you have is commodities are still a continuing headwind and that's true on a sequential basis, where it steps up probably in the range of $5 million to $15 million going from Q3 to Q4. So, I'd say those are a couple of the big drivers. Colin Langan : Got it. And just more strategically, pretty impressive with the inverter targets being a leader by 2025. How is that market shaking out? Is that going to be a significant percent of the market by 2025, and there's going to be 3 or 4 top players there, or is it still just a very fragmented market? I guess there's some concern that it's still going to be fragmented and competitive as we go out. Frederic B. Lissalde : I think it's -- 2025, as far as we see it is going to be the inflection point, the volume in 2025, who is starting production in 2023, 2024, 2025, it's only going to go up from there. This is a product where you need a lot of product leadership. You need skill in electronics. You need a certain level of vertical integration to innovate freely. And I think we have all that, we have global manufacturing footprint and we're very, very pleased with the product leadership. I'm hearing a lot of good feedback from customers, so very pleased with the momentum we have in power electronics at this point in time. Colin Langan : Okay, all right, thanks for taking my question. Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from the line of John Murphy of Bank of America. Your line is open. John Murphy : Good morning, guys. Fred, just on So, slide 13, it's pretty impressive that you are this far long in your goal. I'm just curious, you're typically around the power train. we'd think about solid 4 or 5 year lead time, for bookings if not more. I'm just curious as we're going through this transition and even maybe EVs, more generally, is the time frame compressed in which you can win business, meaning instead of 4 to 5 plus years, we're now looking at like 2 to 3 plus years. So, there's a whole lot more than my pile in here. Frederic B. Lissalde : Yes. John, I think you are around 3. It's pretty much what we have in electronics between award and start of production. In some cases, since we have allowance breadth of product, and very modular design, in some cases we can be faster than that. But I think a good proxy, John would be 3 years from booking to SOP. John Murphy : So, it'd be fair to say that you have a solid year left to build on what you might be able to win for 2025. Is that a fair statement you think, Fred, at least? Frederic B. Lissalde : I think it's fair. John Murphy : Okay. Second question on capital, got $1.5 billion roughly in balance sheet, you generated $6700 million this year, assume your next year is no worse, but maybe better. We're looking at north -- well north of $2 billion of cash plus are going to sell a billion dollars of EVIES business, presuming you get something for that. We're probably going to be approaching $2.5 billion of cash on the balance sheet in the next 12 months, that's a pretty heavy load. How do you think about -- in a good way, how do you think about allocating that capital to the organic business, the acquisitions or directly back to shareholders? It just seems like that's going to give you a lot of dry powder to potentially make some pretty intriguing acquisitions. Kevin Nowlan : Yeah, that's right, and it's consistent with what we laid out in our charging forward Investor Day presentation back in March. We expected -- just like the math you've gone through, we expect to be able to generate a lot of capital over the planning horizon here. And we believe that capital is available to support our dividend policy, as well as the complete -- ultimately, the buyback program that we have outstanding.  But right now, the priority for us is to preserve that dry powder for M&A priorities over the near-term and the medium-term to accelerate the path toward winning in electrification for this Company, consistent with our charging forward initiative. So that's where the priority and the focus is right now. And so, to the extent that we have pipelines of opportunities built up that we think will potentially utilize that capital, we're going to maintain that capital to be ready to support those types of M&A initiatives. John Murphy : Kevin, just -- I'm sorry. That billion dollar you're talking about selling by 2022, I mean, that's a pretty direct statement. Is this stuff in process, it is just a matter of timing that your kind of almost lock the motor at this port at this point? Kevin Nowlan : I mean, there's a couple of dispositions that I'd say we are actively in progress. In fact, when you look at 10-Q, that's going to get filed later today, you're going to see some assets and liabilities on one of those transactions. Actually, were moved into held for sale accounting, so you can see we're making some progress there, although we don't have anything specific to announce today. But those couple of transactions that are in progress are really the start point. We have a couple of others that I would say are in the planning phases that we think when you combine those things that we look at the 2022, we think we're on the path to disposing of a billion dollars of combustion revenue consistent with what we laid out back in March. John Murphy : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson of Barclays. Your line is open. Brian Johnson : Thank you. Yeah, I want to follow up on Collins's question around power electronics and the competitive environment. And especially they value add that BorgWarner brings you may -- You have a comment in there that you're talking about custom silicon, proprietary integrated circuit development. Is that custom silicon and you have a fab to do that? And that gets to the bigger question, which is how do you quantify the value add against the margins in power electronics when a cynic might say OEM goes to clear one of the many prior electronic suppliers, like SiC, silicon carbide. And they're really just looking for a Tier-1 that packages and ship it, which is more of a build-to-print function. Frederic B. Lissalde : Yes. Brian, we are not making silicon or silicon carbide. We have very, very strong relationship with our supply base. We're developing products together. And those are very important elements when you think about the fact that those elements are embedded into our power modules. And for inverters, those are really critical elements. As far as -- do you want to take the margin? Kevin Nowlan : I think on the margin, even looking at the two programs that Fred presented today, we look at those types of programs on the same way we look at all of our other programs. We focus on the ROIC of those programs, and given the capital intensity of those types of programs being substantially similar to what we see in the bulk of our business, it means that the margin profile of those businesses ends up looking substantially similar to the types of programs we've booked historically at this Company. We -- those programs, in particular, as well as any others actually come up through Fred and me. We look at those, we look at the ROIC and the margin that comes out of that and we're pleased with what we see. Frederic B. Lissalde : The financial discipline of this Company has not changed in whatever we quote, and in the world of electric vehicle, we have the same discipline -- absolutely the same discipline. Brian Johnson : So, what is the key value add more of that drives your win rate and also creates the margins that you like? Frederic B. Lissalde : I think we just simply have better products. Better products that package better, that are lighter, that are more competitive than competition. And this is linked to better product leadership, better innovation. And also, ability to innovate in our verticals, which are power modules, software, ASIC and design. There is no magic there. You need to be better in all those elements and the proof is in the putting, we are. Brian Johnson : Great. Okay, thanks. And look forward to chatting with you in a few weeks. Frederic B. Lissalde : Likewise. Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Noah Kaye of Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Noah Kaye : Good morning and thanks for taking the question. So, the CEO of a leading premium European OEM was talking this morning in public commentary about the lack of charging infrastructure in Europe, just not keeping pace with the growth and demand, and the availability of new models. As you think about growth verticals and opportunities for the companies, how do you look at the EV charging opportunity? Are you doing any work there as an area of potential growth for you? Can you comment on that? Frederic B. Lissalde : We have a small operations and business today producing challenging stations. We also think that the future is fast challenging may and that very packs in there. And we're looking at -- and that using the value that we can add to the market, this is something we're looking at right now. Noah Kaye : And then as it relates to the step-up of a $100 million in R&D that you're expecting for next year, and understanding, it sounds like significant portion of that is just to support new EV programs and development. Should we start to see operating leverage from an R&D perspective on EV sales growth? Is R&D within EV as a percentage of sales going to stay the same or decline next year? It's helpful, I think, to understand the trajectory because by 2025, presumably your ID intensity will have significantly declined to achieve those target margins. Kevin Nowlan : Absolutely. I think I would refer you to the slide that we had provided back at our Investor Day because I think that's a good way to think about it, which showed how the R&D right now is heavy particularly relative to the revenue that we have when we're running it $300 million or $400 million of EV revenue. But we're investing -- of that $725 million of R&D this year, around a 1/3 of that being focused on the e-product portfolio. Obviously, that math doesn't work from a near-term profitability perspective. As we go out over time, we start to launch some of these programs from an EV perspective.  The EV businesses start to get some real gross margin and contribution margin that starts to help to fund on its own, some of those R&D Investment. So, R&D is continuing to ramp over the next few years, but ultimately, that contribution margin is coming on more quickly and you start to get the leverage that you alluded to. And you can see as we laid out in the Investor Day that by the time you get to call it 2024 - ish time frame is when we start to cross and you start to see profitability on a standalone basis as the, contribution margin on an incremental sales start to overtake the R&D investments that we're making.  And I would say as you think about that for the long term, as we think about the steady-state for that business, the margin profile of that business, we think, is a good margin business. It's just that we're in growth mode for a long period of time. Until you stop the growth, you never fully offset the R&D from a normal operating margin perspective. We're always continuing to invest, as long as we're growing. But we start to get the real leverage in the coming years here. Noah Kaye : Great, thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Dan Levy of Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Dan Levy : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thank you. First on 2022, I know on Slide 12, you give us some parameters, but I just want to aggregate this. What type of incremental margins might be -- and I realize it's early here, but what type of incremental margins might we be able to expect on any volume recovery? And I think when we add up to items listed here, seems like incremental should be a little lower than usual, but just want to see if there's an aggregate view on all that. Kevin Nowlan : I mean, the good news right now is as we're looking at the decremental we experienced in Q3, and even what's implicit in our Q4 guide. We're suggesting there's a 30% decremental, but about 10 points of that is being driven by the commodity cost headwinds. So, underlying the performance outside of commodity costs, we're managing right around that 20% mark on a year-over-year basis. Which is good considering how much revenue has come out on a year-over-year basis.  When volumes come out relatively quickly like that, and then they recover we would expect generally to incremented -- increment directionally at the rate at which we decremented. when you have a drop down and then a snap back. And then as you look longer term, we continue to expect, once you get into a more normalized operating environment, incremental go back to a more normalized wherein the high-teens tends to be where we operate from a pure incremental perspective. Dan Levy : All-in that could lead to incremental next year, potentially in the 20% range. Kevin Nowlan : On recovery of volume from the low levels that we're operating at now, absolutely. And then as you get into a more normalized outgrowth relative to normalized market expectations then you would expect to return to more normalized incremental margins. But when we get a snap back from production drops like we would anticipate at some point here, we would expect to be able to increment at the rate at which we decremented. No different than what we saw coming out of COVID.  When COVID started to -- when we started the snap back at the end of last year, we had obviously decremented at a pretty healthy rate earlier in the year and it came back very quickly and we incremented at the rates in which we decremented. I think that's the right way to think about us as we come out of hopefully the production challenges that we're seeing in the market today sometime during '22. Dan Levy : Great. Thank you. And then my follow-up is that, I know there's been a number of questions on inverters here, but I'll ask another one. I think it's pretty clear, inverters are effectively becoming your signature product, which is the same way that turbos are the signature products in a nice world. If we're making the Inverter versus Turbo comparison, maybe you can just give us a sense where Turbos clearly, you have a very concentrated position, what type of competitive environment you anticipate for inverters that you talked about earlier? And how would that compare to motors and drive units?  And then maybe you could also just give us a sense, I assume that given, historically, turbos -- we'll call it like a quarter or a third of revenue, you probably allocated disproportionate resources and certainly deservedly so. How are you thinking about allocating resources to inverters internally versus other products? Is this going to get disproportionate attention just given this is going to be your signature product in the future? Frederic B. Lissalde : A lot of questions in your question. So first, very happy with the inverter positioning. And as I alluded to in my prepared remark, we think we're going to be the number 1 non-captive inverter producer by 2025. 2.5 million inverters in 2025 and absolutely growing from there. More to be booked, already 90% booked, and that the ramp up in R&D is to support that booking rate and also the high level of pursuits that we do. So, I am very happy with that.  I would not call that the finished product. When you look at Slide 13, you add other products in the mix. It's true that this product does a high content per vehicle, but we're very successful with systems iDMs. We've announced quite a few wins and more to come, very successful with the surrounding of the batteries. Needless to say, that Slide 13 does not include AKASOL because we don't totally own it yet. We are in the squeeze-out period. It's not a one product. There are a lot of products in the world of electric vehicles that we are excelling at.  Now inverters, as I mentioned in prior calls, are the products that are outsourced by our customers by the vast majority because it's very products complex to do. It requires a lot of scales in their electronics and lot of vertical integration. And so we're very successful with that. On motors, we are embedding our own motors in our iDM 's, we're also selling standalone motors. I would say that the market in motors is still more fragmented, that the competitors in inverters, that is becoming more and more concentrated. That's what I would tell you if I hope I covered most of your question. Dan Levy : Thank you, I know there's a lot there. I appreciate it. It's very helpful. Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Rosner of Deutsche Bank your line is open. Emmanuel Rosner : Thank you very much. My first question is around some of the elements of outlook that you provided for 2022, which are really helpful. Maybe focusing on the top-line and the growth first, I think that you mentioned expecting additional at least modest LVP growth and then still assessing like, the gross over-markets outlook. Could you provide us a little bit more color around your early thinking? I would think modest LVP gross is probably quite a bit more conservative than IHS maybe, or even what we've heard from some of the automakers that have spoken so far. And then on the growth of the market side, to what extent some of the growth that you saw this year -- I guess, what would be a cause for this coming out of next year's growth? Kevin Nowlan : Yes. So, look, a couple of things on the outlook for next year, obviously still early days and we're still operating in a very volatile environment, as evidenced by the fact that we still got $300 million revenue range on our Q4 revenue outlook. And so that just gives you an indication as to the volatility in the environment. And as we look out into 2022, from where we sit today, we don't see a rapid solution to the semiconductor challenges and a sudden snap back in volume -- market volumes coming. So, our expectation is that there's going to be continuing impact of the supply chain disruptions well into 2022.  That's why we're suggesting, given where we sit today, we expect that probably translates to modest growth from a year-over-year production perspective. But I'd say, you're sitting here in early November trying to project what next year looks like when we're still struggling with Q4 production. is pretty challenging to project right now. But we don't see necessarily an end in the near-term in terms of some of the supply chain disruptions. Which might be a little bit different than some others who are guiding you to a much more rapid recovery.  In terms of the outgrowth, it starts with what was your outgrowth in 2021 and how much of that might have been effectively a pull-forward or a benefit you would've otherwise expected over the couple of years. So, the fact that we outgrew the market based on our guidance or expect to outgrow the market by 10% in 2021. That's obviously not a normal outgrowth for this Company. We're happy with it, but it suggests to us that knowing that we normally grow in the mid-single-digit range, or at least half for the last number of years that some of that may had been a pull forward of things we would've otherwise expected in 2022. But we're in the middle of that assessment right now.  We're in the middle of our long-range planning process and really understanding in this volatile environment how much of that is a headwind in next year's year-over-year outgrowth versus we expect to -- this as the new base from which we grow. So still in the middle of the assessment, but that wouldn't be a bad thing. It would just be that [Indiscernible] accelerated into this year, and you can really see that in our full-year guide, where our backlog in our full-year guide is a billion and a half in 2021. I mean, it tells you the strength of what we've been able to accomplish this year. And it's just a question of how much of that might have been a pull forward from next year. Emmanuel Rosner : Understood. And then second question, around your strategic priority to dispose some of these ICE revenue by the end of next year, can you provide a framework of how to think about potential implication on margin, like is it typically business that would be at average margins or below margin? And then more broadly as the combustion engine revenues may be declining over time while obviously going fast and electric vehicle side, how do you plan on managing the impact of profitability from essentially a declining, very profitable business, either organically or through disposal? And then obviously the gross in EV, which is at least initially doesn't necessarily have the scale for that. Kevin Nowlan : So, the margin profile of the businesses and products that we would consider for disposition, it depends. I'd say some probably have below average, Company average margins, some might not. They might have at or even above the Company average margins. Remember when we're looking at the framework for what we don't think is a business or product that fits with BorgWarner longer term, if a business or product that doesn't tick one or more of three boxes, we look and say, do we have product leadership in the space? Do we have medium to long-term growth prospects? Do we have a strong margin profile?  So, you can have businesses that might have a solid or strong margin profile, but actually just don't have the growth prospects that we would expect or product leadership, that would be a candidate for disposition. At the same time, we have products that are undoubtedly below the average margin profile that are candidates for disposition. So, when we at Investor Day talked about our longer-term margin guide, we contemplated the types of businesses that we thought would be included in our disposition strategy.  And still thought, that over the longer term, that we would be in the double-digit margin range on a go-forward basis that contemplates to dispositions. And it also contemplates the impact of growing the EV portfolio. And the one thing you have to keep in mind when we talk about the growth in the portfolio. The impact on our P&L is already in our results today. It's already there because we're investing over $200 million in R&D right now in our P&L in 2021 and we only have $300 million to $400 million of EV related revenue in our P&L.  So that's only a tailwind as we continue to grow that business going forward because we start to get contribution margin that's more than offsetting the incremental R&D as we look out over the coming years. You can't look at that business and say, well, it's a negative margin business and I'm growing a negative margin business. We're growing from where we are today and starting to generate the contribution margin on the incremental revenue that comes into the P&L. And the margin profiles of those businesses, we feel very good about. Emmanuel Rosner : Okay, that's very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Luke Junk of Baird. Your line is open. Luke Junk : Good morning. Thanks for taking questions. First question I had is, if there's any additional color you can provide on the North America and inverter awards specifically, was described as a high-voltage program. And just wondering if that includes both 400 volt and 800-volt business, and whether that'd be all EV or if there's a hybrid element here to just trying to impact the breadth of your competitive edge through the lens of this specific award and this previous one question, we've gotten this morning? Frederic B. Lissalde : Look, I'd love to give you more detail I can't. The only thing I'd tell you it's that it is all EV. Luke Junk : All EV. Okay. Great. I will take that. Follow-up question, wondering Fred, to what extent is there the potential for award activity to not only sustain an EVs, but to pick up from here. Obviously, you've got good momentum going to the 2025 EV targets already, but it's only been about a year since you closed the deal. In other words, we're just now served on the front end of the 12 months to 18-month window that you had originally outlined for rewards for the combined Company. Any high-level thoughts there would be great as well. Thanks. Frederic B. Lissalde : From an organic standpoint, we are at 90%, and our target was $2.5 billion, we are $2.3 billion, very happy about that. From an inorganic standpoint, AKASOL, as we mentioned in the past, represents about 1/4 of the inorganic sales underlying project charging forward, and we have a few, few years to go. Very happy with the pipeline that we have. Good, healthy pipeline. We are engaged with some targets. And of course, right now we're focused on preparing the AKASOL integration, which is not totally ours until the squeeze out process is happening. We are on track for disposition overall. We are on track versus what we presented to you back in March, and very happy to see that momentum both organically and inorganically. Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from the line Joseph Spak of RBC. Your line is open. Joseph Spak : Thank you. Good morning. Kevin, I want to go back to some of the comments made on growth over market. You keep saying pull forward, but how much -- it would seem to me that part of the better growth over mark this year is more mix-related, right? Because you're comparing a dollar value to a unit number. And the units that were made this year tended to be probably have higher dollar content. So I'm curious if you could add -- if you have an estimate of how much of that was just mix-related and then moving to '22, I get the tough comps. I think what people are trying to understand is that going to be -- does that mean back to your mid-single-digit target or potentially below it because the path for margins next year seems really dependent on the conversion on volume versus some of the headwinds you've laid out here. Kevin Nowlan : So the first question in terms of the growth over my -- it's a combination of those things. It's absolutely a fair comment that is some of this potentially mix. And that's mix of product, mix of customer, absolutely that's potentially a piece of the equation and that's what we're assessing right now. And I think that undoubtedly had some impact on Q3 where we delivered over 13% growth, if you just look at the quarter in isolation growth over market on a year-over-year basis. We're in the process of assessing what do we think 2022 looks like and versus that 10%. Are we back to the average or is it slightly below the average, I don't think where we sit today, we're expecting to be delivering 10% growth above market again. So it's a matter of a question of, are we back to normal growth rates that we've delivered over the last few years? Or that we have projected before? Or is there any headwind relative to that based on, the really strong outgrowth in backlog we delivered this year. In the middle of that assessment right now. Joseph Spak : And then just Fred maybe a bigger picture is obviously really good to see the traction towards that $2.5 billion number in '25. But I'm curious because it seems like the pace of BEV announcements and penetration are only increasing and forecasts are moving up, which is clearly helping you in that opportunity. But does this change -- does this is meaningfully change the mix of BEV relative to ICE that you are leveraging laid out in '25, I think it was originally still don't like 15% BEV. And I guess the question is, is the mix of ICE decelerating a little bit faster as BEV accelerates faster? Frederic B. Lissalde : Joe, I think in 2025, we still think that our assumptions are accurate. If you remember, back in March, in our Investor Day, talked about 30% of BEV market in light vehicle in 2030. I think we might be on the low side. The market might be higher than 30% BEV. Remember, our target in 2030 was 45% BEV. But I don't think 2025 is going to move meaningfully. 2030 might be north of 30%, actually, might be north of what we thought back in March. And you are right, the pace of BEV volume is accelerating and the pace of requests for sourcing is accelerating too. And the volumes of what we are booking, they are in the several hundreds of thousands of pounds, right. We're not talking about low volume here, so it's significant. The acceleration is here and I'm very happy to be a big part of it. Joseph Spak : Thank you for that. Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Adam Uhlman of Cleaveland Research. Your line is open. Adam Uhlman : Hey, guys, good morning. I want to go back to the margin commentary for next year and I'm wondering if you could share with us if commodities stay where they're at today. How much of an additional headwind do you might expect to see in 2022 and then combined with that outside of commodities, you've incurred a bunch of other non-material costs. I wonder if you could frame for us the potential commercial recoveries that you could expect and if that could be meaningful, offset to the commodity headwinds. Kevin Nowlan : In terms of the commodity headwind, remember this year we're effectively got embedded in our guidance a net commodity headwind of about $80 million to $90 million for the full year. And as I mentioned, Q4 supposed to be up $30 million to $40 million of that. So the bulk of the commodity headwind we've experienced has been in the back half of the year as opposed to the front half of the year. We started to see it little bit in Q1, but it really started to accelerate in Q2 and in Q3 and Q4. In Q3, $24 million, in Q4, $30 million to $40 million. And so you can do the math based on that and assume that if commodities remained at those types of levels, it's a year-over-year headwind as you look at Q1 and Q2.  That's what I would say, given where we stand at this point, those are the planning assumptions that we're using but it remains to be seen where we actually end up. In terms of the other costs, TBD, those are embedded in the P&L today in terms of our guide, because of the impact on us. I think the biggest impact though, is what we're seeing at the moment is really the commodity headwind when we look at the impact on our financials this year. Adam Uhlman : Got it. Thanks. And then lastly, a near-term question. I'm wondering what you're seeing so far here in the fourth quarter in terms of customer call-offs, and perhaps any color on geographies of that. Just given the wide range of the fourth quarter revenue guidance. I'm wondering if maybe it started off a little rockier than previously expected or anything you could share there. Frederic B. Lissalde : It's a tough one that's why our guidance is so wide for the remainder of the year. Volatility happens in all regions and can change from one day to another. Staying close to customers is the [Indiscernible] key, but surprise do happen where our schedules are in place, ready to ship, and the customers is stuck with no path. It is a very volatile environment and I don't think it would be wise for me to answer that question regionally in detail. It's still a pretty wide world right now. Operator : Thank you. We have time for one final question and that question comes from David Kelley of Jefferies. Your line is open. David Kelley : Hey, good morning team. Thanks for squeezing me in. Maybe Kevin, to follow up on that last commodity headwind question, your comments in the next year. Could you remind us of the pass-through timing and opportunity as we start thinking about first half 2022? I believe you have about 60% capacity rate typically on purchases, but just any color there would be helpful. Kevin Nowlan : Our typical pass-through, when you look at the blend of all the pass-through mechanisms, we have contractually as it relates to steel, aluminum, nickel, copper, the things that we're most exposed to, the contractual pass - throughs are about 50% on a fully blended basis. A couple of things to note about that. When we talk about the net commodity headwind that we've disclosed $80 million to $90 million, that is on a net basis and so, we've been executing at or around that 50% level thus far in our guidance this year, which means the gross impact of those commodity headwinds is roughly double what we talked about, roughly.  And so the $80 million to $90 million already contemplates recoveries in it. So if you think about how that translates into next year, maybe you get a little benefit from some of the lag that's in there but we're already pretty close to 50%, I'd say today. The second thing I would just note is when you get into more sustained inflationary environments of such a high degree like we're seeing there, it's not uncommon to see suppliers having conversations across the industry with customers about what to do beyond the So, contractual pass-through mechanism. So the 50% than what we're experiencing to-date is really the contractual piece and we'll see how long the inflationary environment last and at what level and whether that warrants additional conversations that we or others have with the customer base heading into next year. David Kelley : Okay, got it. Thank you. And then maybe one last one, commercial vehicle traction, maybe if you could talk about, kind of your outgrowth in the quarter, and any color on how you're thinking about the fourth-quarter contribution from your commercial vehicle exposure would be great. Kevin Nowlan : Our commercial vehicle is still running in that low teens caught around 13% of our total portfolio. So not a material changes as you look out, whether it's the balance of this year, as we think about where we are going to be next year. The things that move the needle would be at this point, anything that we do on an acquisition front. Obviously, AKASOL is really focused on the commercial vehicle and industrial space. And so, as they ramp up over the coming years, we'll get a tailwind from that in terms of a mix percentage perspective. But we're continuing to operate in that low-teens range in terms of a mix. David Kelley : Great. Thank you. Frederic B. Lissalde : So, with that, I'd like to thank you all for your great questions today. If you have any follow-ups, feel free to reach out to me and the rest of the team. With that Jay, you can go ahead and close the call. Operator : Thank you. And that does conclude the BorgWarner 2021 Third Quarter Results Conference Call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Jerome, and I will be your conference facilitator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BorgWarner 2021 Fourth Quarter and Full Year Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Patrick Nolan, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Nolan, you may begin your conference. Patrick Nolan : Thank you, Jerome. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We issued our earnings release earlier this morning. It's posted on our website, borgwarner.com, on both our home page and our Investor Relations home page. With regard to our Investor Relations calendar, we will be attending multiple conferences between now and our next earnings release. Please see the Events section of our Investor Relations home page for a full list. Before we begin, I need to inform you that during this call, we may make forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties as detailed in our 10-K. Our actual results may differ significantly from the matters discussed today. During today's presentation, we will highlight certain non-GAAP measures in order to provide a clearer picture of how the core business performs and for comparison purposes with prior periods. When you hear us say on a comparable basis, that means excluding the impact of FX, net M&A and other noncomparable items. When you hear us say adjusted, that means excluding noncomparable items. When you hear us say organic, that means excluding the impact of FX and net M&A. We will also refer to our market growth. When we say market, this means the change in light and commercial vehicle production weighted for our geographic exposure. Please note that we posted an earnings call presentation to the IR page of our website. We encourage you to follow along with these slides during our discussion. With that, I'm happy to turn the call over to Fred. Frederic Lissalde : Thank you, Pat, and good day, everyone. We're very pleased to share our results for 2021 and provide an overall company update, starting on Slide 5. I am very proud of our strong top line performance relative to the industry declines. With approximately $14.8 billion in sales, we were up about 12% organically and we outperformed in all major regions. I'm also pleased with our margin performance despite the significant production volatility we faced during 2021. This was achieved while continuing to significantly increase our R&D investment to support our e-product growth. These investments will continue and accelerate. We also delivered solid cash flow performance despite the impact of a onetime warranty payment for combustion-based products during the fourth quarter. We also have seen progress on all 3 pillars underlying our Charging Forward plan. We secured multiple new EV program awards during the fourth quarter, which I will discuss in a moment, and we are already beating our booking target. We completed the acquisition of AKASOL earlier this month. And today, we announced the acquisition of Santroll's light vehicle eMotor business. We also completed the first step in the combustion disposition goals with the sale of the Water Valley, Mississippi facility to Atar Capital. Now let's discuss some of our recent new business awards starting on Slide 6. I'm happy to highlight 2 new product awards for the commercial vehicle market. First, I'm excited to announce our first win for our hydrogen injection system. This is a product that we've been discussing with our customers for quite some time. Hydrogen internal combustion is a quick-to-market powertrain solution that requires only slight adjustments to the traditional ICEs. This is our first award, and the program is with a top global manufacturer of construction equipment that is expected to launch in 2024. BorgWarner will be providing the full system, including injectors, rails, ECUs, system integration and calibration. Next we announced that BorgWarner has secured its first high-voltage eFan system with a global commercial vehicle OEM. Fully electric-powered heavy-duty trucks will require dedicated high-voltage thermal management solutions like the eFan systems for cooling components such as the e-motor, batteries and electronics. BorgWarner has specifically optimized its fan design for performance and efficiency. The high-voltage eFan is driven by a robust e-motor, which is powered from the vehicle's electrical system via an inverter. This is another application of the 3-in-1 concept with mechanical, motor and inverter. The system will be utilized in a battery electric heavy-duty long-haul trucks expected to launch in 2024. Both the hydrogen injection system and the eFan are great examples of us continuing to organically develop new products to drive profitable growth in innovative powertrain systems. On Slide 7, I'm happy to highlight 2 more wins in North America : First, BorgWarner has been awarded the Generator Inverter for an innovative electrified architecture. The North American program is anticipated to launch in 2024. Our product will be used in a range of extension system to charge the main battery. This win highlights our technical capabilities in managing continuous high currents. Next I would like to highlight a new battery system award for the North American electric commercial vehicle market that we expect to launch in 2023. BorgWarner will supply GILLIG, a leading manufacturer of heavy-duty transit buses in North America, with a third generation of our ultra-high energy battery system. The battery system was developed for long-distance application and can be scaled for the customer needs. It can offer close to 700-kilowatt hour of available energy. This is the largest capacity in the North American transit bus. The system will be produced in our Hazel Park manufacturing facility here in Michigan. On Slide 8, we highlight 2 additional 800 volts awards in China. First, I'm glad to announce that we have secured an 800-volt silicon carbide inverter with a leading Chinese OEM for electric vehicle anticipated to launch in 2023. The award includes inverters for front and rear drive modules. Our 800-volt silicon carbide technology offered enhanced power density, proven performance and long-term reliability. And our leadership in this area continues to be recognized by our customers globally. We're also partnering with a leading luxury new energy vehicle maker in China to supply an 800-volt iDM, expected to launch in 2023. Designed, developed and manufactured by BorgWarner, the 800-volt iDM includes our electric motor, inverter and gearbox. It features our exclusive and compact Viper power module, which is the core of the silicon carbide inverter. This is BorgWarner's first 800-volt iDM project worldwide, opening a new chapter in the company's global electric drive business. We're pleased to continue our long-standing partnership with this leading domestic manufacturer of luxury electric vehicle. As you can clearly recognize, we're seeing a strong pool for our new e-products. We are increasing our e-R&D investment by $130 million to $160 million this year to support this growth. Now on Slide 9, I would like to expand on our announced acquisition of Santroll's Light Vehicle eMotor business. eMotor is a key element of BorgWarner's electric vehicle growth strategy. The acquisition of Santroll's business is expected to have multiple benefits for us. First, we expect this acquisition to improve both our eMotor product leadership and our manufacturing capabilities, adding state-of-the-art equipment design and proven automation expertise. This acquisition will also expand our eMotor portfolio breadth and scale. Post this transaction, BorgWarner expects to produce more than 3.5 million units in 2026 for a wide range of customers and regions. With Santroll, BorgWarner now has a full suite of e-motor product at scale with application in small and larger passenger vehicles as well as for commercial vehicles. And we obviously see potential for significant revenue synergies overtime globally. The acquisition will be funded with existing cash balances and is expected to close late in the first quarter 2022. As you can see, on Slide 10, we've made significant progress towards our Charging Forward plan, starting first with the organic electric vehicle revenue growth. With the award secured as of this call, we now have electric vehicle programs that we expect will generate about $2.7 billion of booked revenue in 2025. This is an amazing achievement by the BorgWarner team. Turning to M&A, which includes the complete acquisition of AKASOL and the planned acquisition of Santroll's eMotor business. We've secured additional businesses that we expect to generate more than $600 million to $700 million of additional EV-related revenue for 2025, and we expect to take additional M&A steps and are actively engaged with a number of potential targets, which will impact multiple parts of our EV portfolio.  Related to disposition, we completed the sale of our Water Valley, Mississippi facility to Atar Capital during the fourth quarter. With just under $200 million of revenue in 2021, this transaction represents 20% of the dispositions that we plan to complete by late 2022. With less than a year since the announcement of Charging Forward, I am pleased that we've made significant progress across all pillars of this plan. The takeaway from today is this : BorgWarner successfully managed a volatile production environment during 2021. Our revenue growth outperformed the industry, and we delivered strong margins and free cash flow. We're seeing strong demand for our product as evidenced by the numerous awards that we have secured throughout the course of the year. We're making the necessary organic and inorganic investment to support this significant growth in E. In short, we are successfully executing on our long-term strategy, Charging Forward, which will deliver value to our shareholders long into the future. With that, I turn the call over to Kevin. Kevin Nowlan : Thank you, Fred, and good morning, everyone. Before I dive into the financials, I'd like to provide a quick overview of our fourth quarter results. First, our revenue came in higher than we were expecting going into the quarter due to better-than-expected industry volume. Second, our margin performance in the quarter was strong, driven by better-than-expected revenue and cost synergy performance. Additionally, our net R&D investment was lower than our guidance due entirely to higher customer reimbursements of engineering expense than we had anticipated. And finally, our cash flow performance in the quarter was strong despite the impact of a onetime cash warranty settlement payment. Let's turn to Slide 11 for a look at our year-over-year revenue walk for Q4. We start that walk with last year's revenue, which was just over $3.9 billion. Currencies had a very small impact when comparing Q4 of last year to Q4 of this year. Then you can see the decrease in our organic revenue, about 7% year-over-year. That compares to a 15% decrease in weighted average market production. So we delivered another quarter of strong outperformance in the face of challenging end market environment. And we're pleased with the fact that this outperformance occurred in all 3 major markets. On top of that, what's particularly exciting to see in our outgrowth is that we're seeing a portion of it coming from our electronics and electrification products, especially in China and North America. And finally, you add to that the $34 million of Q4 battery pack revenue coming from AKASOL. The sum of all this was just under $3.7 billion of revenue in Q4. Now let's look at our earnings and cash flow performance on Slide 12. Our fourth quarter adjusted operating income was $375 million or 10.3%, which compares to adjusted operating income of $448 million or 11.4% from a year ago. On a comparable basis, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and the impact of AKASOL, adjusted operating income decreased $60 million on $256 million of lower sales. That translates to a decremental margin of approximately 23%. That's not a bad decremental for such a volatile environment, especially considering the roughly $16 million of net commodity cost headwinds that we experienced in the quarter. Excluding these higher commodity costs, our year-over-year decremental margin was approximately 17%, which we view as a sign that we're effectively managing our operating cost performance.  Moving on to free cash flow, we generated $370 million during the fourth. Our free cash flow included a $130 million payment to a customer, which was related to a warranty claim that we settled in the quarter for an engine-related component. Based on the agreement with our customer, this onetime payment fully resolved the claim. Let's now turn to Slide 13, where you can see our perspective on global industry production for 2022. When you look at this slide, you can see that our market assumptions incorporate a wide range of potential outcomes. That's primarily a result of the semiconductor supply challenges that we think will continue to impact the industry during 2022. With that background in mind, we expect our global weighted light and commercial vehicle markets to increase in the range of 6% to 9% this year. Looking at this by region, we're planning for our weighted North American markets to be up 13% to 15%. In Europe, we expect a blended market increase of 12% to 15%. And in China, we expect the overall market to be down 2% to 5%, mainly due to a mid-teens decline in commercial vehicle volumes.  Before moving to our financial outlook, I wanted to highlight a change we're implementing in 2022 with respect to how we report our adjusted operating income and margin. You can see this summarized on Slide 14. As you know, M&A is expected to play a significant role in project Charging Forward. And given the nature of the likely acquisitions, we anticipate the potential for significant goodwill and intangibles associated with these transactions. Importantly, intangible asset amortization expense flows through our adjusted operating income line. Now sitting here today, we don't know the magnitude of the intangible amortization expense that may come from future potential acquisitions. But what we do know is that it's likely to make true underlying operating performance as measured in our operating margin, less comparable to previous periods. Therefore, we believe that excluding intangible asset amortization expense from adjusted operating income will improve year-over-year earnings comparability and provide a clearer picture of the real performance of our ongoing operations. But it's important to also note that the impact of intangible amortization expense will continue to be included in our adjusted earnings per share. Now let's talk about our full year financial outlook on Slide 15. As I mentioned earlier, we expect our end markets to be up 6% to 9% for the year. Next, we expect our revenue growth to continue to exceed industry growth, driven by new business launches. Based on these assumptions, we expect our 2022 organic revenue to increase approximately 10% to 14% relative to 2021 pro forma revenue, which means that we expect to outgrow the market by 4% to 5%. Then subtracting an expected $220 million headwind from weaker foreign currencies, we're projecting total 2022 revenue to be in the range of $15.9 million to $16.5 billion.  From a margin perspective, we expect our full year adjusted operating margin to be in the range of 10.2% to 10.7% compared to a pro forma 2021 margin of 10.9% when adjusted for intangible asset amortization expense. This 2022 margin outlook contemplates the business delivering full year incrementals in the low to mid-teens on an all-in basis before the impact of a planned increase in R&D investment. Underlying those incrementals, we expect tailwinds from continued cost synergies and restructuring savings and headwinds from the continuing impact of higher commodity costs and the mounting pressure of other supply chain cost increases. As it relates to R&D investment, we're continuing to win new business. You saw it in the 6 new wins Fred profiled earlier, and you can see it in our 2025 EV business, which now stands at more than $3 billion. With this continued success, we are leaning forward and continuing to invest more in R&D for our e-products portfolio. In fact, our guidance anticipates a $130 million to $160 million increase in R&D investment in 2022, and that increase is 100% related to our e-products portfolio.  This is higher than the $100 million increase we signaled on last quarter's call for 2 reasons. First, as I mentioned earlier, our 2021 net R&D expense came in lower than our expectations due to higher-than-anticipated engineering reimbursements from our customers. Second, and more importantly, the larger increase is a reflection of our bullishness on the prospects for securing additional EV wins in the coming quarters.  Based on this revenue and margin outlook, we're now expecting full year adjusted EPS of $4.15 to $4.60 per diluted share. This EPS guidance contemplates our effective tax rate coming down to 28%, which is declining from the peak of more than 30% that we experienced over the last couple quarters -- excuse me, the last couple years. And finally, we expect that we'll deliver free cash flow in the range of $700 million to $800 million for the full year, despite a significant increase in capital spending year-over-year, that supports the aggressive growth we're seeing, particularly in our EV portfolio. That's our 2022 outlook. So let me summarize my financial remarks. Overall, we had a solid year despite a really challenging end market environment, one where we saw significant volatility during the last 2 quarters. And remember, it was a year with only 76 million light vehicles produced globally. In the face of this environment, we outgrew the market. We drove 10% operating margins by executing on our cost synergies and restructuring savings while also investing more in R&D to support the future of our e-business, and we delivered another year of strong cash flow. And as we continue to successfully manage the present, we were delivering on the future by making significant progress on our charging forward plan. Now as we look ahead to 2022, we're keenly focused on continuing to manage the presence by sustaining our strong margin and cash flow profile, maintaining the momentum and delivering new business wins on electric vehicle programs and continuing to make disciplined investments, both organic and inorganic, that will help secure our growth and financial strength long into the future.  With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Pat. Patrick Nolan : Thank you, Kevin. Jerome, we\u2019re ready to open up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America. John Murphy : I wanted to focus on Slide 10. And if we look at this, Fred, it seems like your awards are coming faster than we traditionally seen. So it's from booking to actual launch. I'm just curious how much room you have or how much progress you think you're going to make on this first bar? And how much you're bidding on there? And then also, as we think about this, is there more of an opportunity on the commercial vehicle business in EVs because there's maybe some less competition and implementation is coming faster. I'm just trying to understand, are we speeding things up here? And is there maybe even more of an opportunity on the commercial vehicle side near term? Frederic Lissalde : John, Yes. I think you're right, there are more opportunities on the organic side. We still have 9 to 12 months to go in order to book business that will see daylight in 2025, our organic target was at 2.5. We're at 2.7 and continuing to book business. Yes, you see opportunities in Pass car and commercial vehicles. Some of the products I alluded to our own commercial vehicles. And on the M&A, I would say that we are engaged with a few targets. We have a healthy pipeline of M&A targets. And I'm pretty happy where we are on Charging Forward. I'm laser-focused on charging forward. We're winning. Target is $4.5 billion of BEV revenue in 2025, and we are absolutely on target. John Murphy : Okay. And just a follow-up. As we look at the middle bar there, AKASOL and Santroll, I thought AKASOL was going to be about $500 million by 2024. So it seems like AKASOL plus Santroll should be closer to sort of an $800 million-ish number. There is something changed in the AKASOL business? And then also just a follow-up on the reimbursements in the R&D for 2021. I mean why were those larger in 2021? Is that something that's changing in sort of relationship with automakers where there's greater R&D reimbursement? Or is that just of timing? Kevin Nowlan : I'll take that, John, on the AKASOL, I think previously what we had disclosed was $0.5 billion of revenue in 2024. We've rolled this forward to 2025, which suggests we're probably more in that $600 million ZIP code. When you look at Santoll, which is in that number as well. Santroll's actually predominantly at least the revenue that we see through 2025 more eMotor business in high-voltage hybrids. So the bulk of their revenue is not likely going to count toward our explicit battery electric vehicle goal. It actually doesn't add a lot to that particular bar, but it adds a lot to our capabilities, and that's what we're really excited about with Santoll. With respect to the R&D reimbursements, it's really just a function of what we were able to accomplish at the end of the year. Recoveries sometimes come in higher or lumpier in certain quarters, and that's exactly what we saw in Q4. I mean our recoveries were up $20 million or so from what we were previously expecting. I wouldn't view that as a trend. I think that's just sometimes you get some lumpiness when you go quarter to quarter or year to year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Wolfe Research. Rod Lache : A couple of things I wanted to ask you about. The company today is something like 70% North America and Europe. And it looks like you have 13% to 15% upside in North America. 12% to 15% in Europe production, but you're only talking about 7% to 9% on a weighted basis. So I was hoping you can maybe address what you're anticipating in terms of mix headwinds presumably. And I wanted to also just check -- on the year-over-year bridge, if I added back the amortization that you -- the $88 million to 2021, am I correct that your incrementals on the $1.7 billion, $1.8 billion of organic growth at the midpoint is in the 12% range. And if that's right, what are some of the puts-and-takes I should be thinking about to bring that up to the normal high teens to 20% that you normally get? Kevin Nowlan : Rod, it's Kevin. A couple of things. First, on the growth in the market outlook. Remember, when we're quoting our 6% to 9%, we're also including commercial vehicles. So this is a weighted average of our markets, which is the light vehicle, which is displayed on that slide. but the commercial vehicle as well. And you can see the blend in the backup slides that we provided.  So we know China actually from a commercial vehicle standpoint is going to be a headwind in that market in the high teens. Or when you look at Europe, Europe light vehicle might be growing in the mid-teens, but the commercial vehicle side of that single-digit growth. So when you factor all those growth elements in across light and commercial vehicle, the way we're weighted, it comes out to 6% to 9%. So if you take a look at that backup slide we have in the appendix materials and hopefully, that will help answer that question. On the conversion question you had, I'm sorry, were you asking a '21 versus '20? Or a '22 versus '21 question? I didn\u2019t -- Rod Lache : It's '21 to '22. Just looking at -- I made the adjustment that $88 million on amortization that you pointed out on 2021. And then I'm trying to bridge the various components that you've given that looks like -- the organic growth looks like it's about 1.46 to 2.06 excluding the -- well, I think all in, maybe you can just address that. Kevin Nowlan : Sure. When you look at the conversion, the way to think about it, if you look at on an all-in basis, we're converting year-over-year in that, call it, 2% to 10%-ish kind of a range, ZIP code. But that includes the $130 million to $160 million of R&D. And so if you back out the increase, that $130 million to $160 million of R&D, we're actually converting year-over-year in the low to mid-teens. Call it, more in that 13% to 15% range. And so what are the puts-and-takes on that? Well, on the negative side, we have commodity cost headwinds because remember, last year, that $65 million net impact that we experienced over the course of the year was predominantly in Q3 and Q4. And so as we come into the new year, we're going to continue to get that impact in the first couple of quarters. That's going to be about $50 million to $60 million in those first couple of quarters. On top of that, we are seeing some additional inflationary pressures coming from the supply base that are part of our guide as well, not as big as what we're seeing on the commodity side, but there is definitely inflationary cost pressure coming through that's factored in. And then those things are being offset by restructuring savings that we're continuing to drive as well as incremental cost synergies on a year-over-year basis. And so those puts-and-takes, commodity costs, supplier inflation, restructuring synergies, those are basically offsetting to get us to that, call it, low to mid-teens conversion year-over-year. Rod Lache : Okay. And just -- maybe just a follow-up. Can you give us a sense of what the mechanisms are for recovering some of these inflationary pressures, whether it's commodities or what you're seeing from Tier 2 suppliers. It seems like it's a pervasive issue in the industry. Are you able to make adjustments to pricing or things along those lines with your OEM customers for that? Frederic Lissalde : Yes. It's true that the situation is a bit unusual with commodity and other increases. And so discussions are happening with our customers, and we expect everyone to pay their fair share, to be honest, in this situation. Logistic issues have been also impacted by never-ending customer schedule changes. And so we're talking to our customers and hopefully getting to some resolutions. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Noah Kaye : I just wanted to go back and check past transcripts to confirm this, but I don't seem to even remember you talking about hydrogen combustion as a potential R&D opportunity development. And this quarter, you come out and actually announced a program award. We've heard a lot of folks in the powertrain space talking about prototyping development of hydrogen. It just seems like to go from kind of a stealth mode to announcing, this is pretty remarkable. So I was wondering if you could take us through on the design cycle and development work for this award? And then I think what do you say about the company's approach to R&D going forward to kind of get this tie into market? Frederic Lissalde : Yes. Thanks, Noah. So hydrogen can be used in 2 ways, right? First, you inject it into combustion. And second, you use it as a fuel cell, which is a range extender of a battery electric vehicle. Here, this win, a small in nature is hydrogen as a mean of combustion. So you inject hydrogen rather than injecting gasoline. We've been working with a lot of customers actually on this. This is a pretty appealing technology -- and we've actually had in our tech centers engine fired up with hydrogen as a combustion mean over the past few months. And yes, it's something that can be of interest. And we are focusing especially on commercial vehicle, construction and agricultural opportunities at this point in time. And so one thing I would add, this is not a big part of the R&D increase at all, right? It is the biggest part of the -- 100% part of the R&D increase is linked to BEV, right? And if you compute the numbers, this year we will have 45%, 45% of our total R&D focused in BEV, which is for me, absolutely exciting because I think it really validates the essence of Charging Forward. And I'm very proud about where we are. Noah Kaye : Great. Let me just follow up on the M&A question I asked earlier here. Are you seeing any kind of a reset on valuations for EV targets? I mean, clearly, some of the public means in the space have gone through a pretty hard reset to start the year. Execution has not been easy. There's been supply chain challenges. So just curious to know what that does to your pipeline and potential for closing something relatively near term? Kevin Nowlan : Really, I think that ultimately impacts the seller willingness to be able to execute a transaction. When we go into a transaction, we're looking at a discounted cash flow analysis based on the long-term prospects for the business. And obviously, if you have a relatively frothy public market, it influences the way that sellers can think about valuation. So that makes it sometimes more difficult to bridge difference in perspectives on valuation. So as those types of valuations come down in the public markets, that undoubtedly helps in some of the discussions that we have on the buy side. But again, that's a data point. But for us, we're really focused on the long-term value of the business through the intrinsic value, which is built based on our discounted cash flow analysis. Noah Kaye : Okay. And then, Kevin, sorry, I'll just sneak 1 more in, but just to clarify, the $50 million to $60 million of cost headwinds from commodities you talked about in the first half. Is that a net number year-over-year? Kevin Nowlan : Yes. Noah Kaye : Or is that -- okay. That's net of price increases? Kevin Nowlan : That's net of the recovery mechanisms with our customers. That's correct. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Chris McNally with Evercore. ChrisMcNally: So just 2 questions on the margin. I think you answered my first question in -- during Rod\u2019s. It seems like the core incrementals, if we go pro forma for the accounting change, its about 13% to 15% year-over-year. Is that what you -- I just want to make sure that was the number that was given. Kevin Nowlan : Excluding R&D, that's exactly right. Chris McNally : Excluding R&D, perfect. So then the R&D and leverage question. So when we think about the step-up of that $145 million midpoint year-over-year, should I think about that as sort of RD&E, meaning the engineering expense associated with launching these platforms? Or is it more about R&D to work on new platforms? Because then clearly the follow-on question would be, should we expect similar increases in the future? Or is this sort of a new elevated level if it will grow with sales, but not to the extent of $145 million going forward? Frederic Lissalde : Chris, first of all, R&D, it's more development and application engineering than R&D, right? We're not scratching our heads to figure out what product we're going to develop, right? We have that portfolio. So it is both for launches and high confidence pursuits. Chris McNally : Perfect. Yes, that's exactly my question. Okay. So it then becomes a more of a onetime step-up. And then obviously, if the business continues to grow, the opportunities are more than the $2.7 billion, and it will -- it could grow. But for now, this is largely a relatively sizable onetime step-up. Kevin Nowlan : That's correct. And remember, when we talked about this as part of Charging Forward even, we talked about our expectation that R&D would step up to the low to mid-5% range on a go-forward basis. And that stepped up here as part of our 2022 guide. As we, again, have high confidence pursuits as well as the wins that we've generated and that we're working on launching, it's driving that, but it's right in line with our prior expectations of being in that 5% to 5.5% ZIP code on R&D. Chris McNally : Perfect. And then the only -- the small one on margin. AKASOL, I mean it's obviously about 30 to 40 basis points dilutive to margin now. You've given some revenue outlook. But could you also just help us to when we could think about breakeven on an EBIT basis? Kevin Nowlan : Yes. If you exclude purchase price amortization, it's still we expect it's going to be a little bit negative this year just based on where we're jumping into it. Again, we haven't had control of that operation yet until effectively last Thursday. Last Thursday, we completed the merger squeeze-out process which allows us to now fully control that operation. And so we're excited to get in there and really run the day-to-day operations of that business going forward and manage it the way we would at BorgWarner, which continuing to drive the types of revenue growth that they're seeing, which probably has more upside than downside from what we've seen as well as driving the types of profitability and cash generation we would expect. But a little bit of a margin headwind this year because it will be a little bit less than breakeven before PPA. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Colin Langan with Wells Fargo. Colin Langan : Just a follow-up on the walk from '21, '22. You mentioned last quarter, there were cost synergies of 40 to 45 and restructuring of 40 to 50. Are those still the right numbers? And that would kind of imply there's another additional $30 million to $35 million of other inflationary pressures that are offsetting those synergies with the commodity costs. Kevin Nowlan : Yes, good question. Synergies actually ended up coming in stronger towards the end of the year than we anticipated. Some of the things that we were executing on benefited us in Q4. So actually, part of the tailwind we saw in Q4 relative to our guide with synergies coming in stronger. So cumulatively, through the end of 2021, we're at about $140 million which included year-over-year, last year $125 million, which means to now get to our ultimate $175 million of objective, there's only $35 million of synergies left to go. So a little bit lighter remaining in 2022 relative to what we signaled last quarter, only because of the acceleration into 2021. And then on restructuring, you're right, we had guided that $30 million to $35 million is what we signaled last quarter. I'd say we should be at least at that level, if not slightly higher as we come out of 2022. Colin Langan : Okay. And then going back to earlier questions about growth over market. So it's kind of hard this year, since there's such a product mix tailwind last year. I mean, how are you thinking about it? It looks like your weighted average market outlook sort of implies about 300 basis points of geographic mix tailwinds, but then that seems to also imply that there's another 400, 500 of -- how much is backlog of just pure new business? How much is platform mix being positive? Or is that viewed as a negative as some of these platforms may be normalized? Where are the puts and takes into the organic growth outlook? Kevin Nowlan : Well, the geographic mix for us isn't a tailwind because what we do is we report on a weighted average market basis. So we're not looking at just global markets. We're looking at our weighted average mix. So the fact that you're seeing higher growth in jurisdictions where we might be more weighted, that's already factored into our assessment of market and embedded in that 6% to 9% guide for blended market. So when you look at us in 2022, what we're effectively guiding toward is our growth above that market, our weighted average market is in that 4% to 5% range this year. And that's jumping off of last year's about 1,000 basis points of outgrowth on a year-over-year basis. So continuing to deliver that mid-single-digit outgrowth as we look ahead. Now for us, our focus is less on outgrowth each year and more about how we execute relative to Charging Forward in 2025. 25% EV mix in 2025, which corresponds to roughly $4.5 billion of EV-related revenue. And that's really how we're measuring success. But underlying that is the expectation that we'll continue that mid-single-digit outgrowth on a go-forward basis. Colin Langan : Yes. Just a follow-up. I kind of get the 4 to 5 range. The 4 to 5 though, how do you think about it though? Is that all just brand-new business wins? Or are you factoring any tailwinds or headwinds from platform mix? I think other suppliers have indicated that you had such a rich luxury SUV mix last year that some of that unwinds. Is that incorporated in here? Or is it fairly neutral? Any color there? Kevin Nowlan : It's not really driven by any sort of a mix benefit as we look ahead into 2022. It's really some of the product launches, some of the strength that we have on particular programs that are ramping up still. And so there's nothing unusual from a pure mix perspective about that outgrowth. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays. Brian Johnson : I have a couple of questions just around the evolution of the portfolio. With regard to the acquisition in China, you had already won that Hyundai Class -- A Class China iDM business. So what does the acquisition bring you that you hadn't had before? And kind of when you think about the Chinese marketplace, what range of vehicles in terms of price points range would this get you into that perhaps you weren't in before? Frederic Lissalde : HMC was for the -- as you mentioned, for A-class iDM. With Santroll, we are really bringing a portfolio of motors for whole suite of power level. And so this is -- this acquisition is not linked to that iDM with Hyundai since this was a motor that we were already doing in-house.  So the logic is around -- I sometimes alluded to vertical integration as part of our M&A focus. This is clearly a vertical integration with great manufacturing capabilities. And it really expands the eMotor portfolio at scale from the A class that you can think about with Hyundai to long-haul trucks at scaling different power levels. So that's pretty much the highlights of the logic of that acquisition from a portfolio standpoint. Brian Johnson : Okay. And kind of second question. I know I\u2019ve asked this before, but you still have a lot of acquisition budget left. In the commercial vehicle market some of the competitors would highlight the advantages of e-axle that is integrating the motor into the axle, your historical application was more of DM1 motor, would be similar data where you have an electric motor and through additional drivetrain. So are you thinking about tuck-in acquisitions around the e-axle space? Kevin Nowlan : I mean I'll start in general, our components can be utilized. Our e-components can be utilized, whether it's light vehicle or commercial vehicle. And as we think about e-axle, e-axle is definitely an important piece of the market on a go-forward basis in CV, but it's not the entirety of the market either. And so our ability to supply components into that market, whether it's e-motors like we've had success on, whether it's inverters or other things, that opportunity is absolutely there, and we've been generating those wins. And then you can even see what we talked about today with the eFan win as well as the GILLIG announcements on battery packs. So there's definitely opportunity for us in CV, and e-axles aren't an end all be all that drives whether we can be successful in the CV market. Brian Johnson : Okay. And final question on the disposition of ICE. You did complete 1 deal. However, it is relatively small relative to your goals. What does the pipeline of dispositions look like? And second, to the extent that things have happened faster, is it buyer uncertainty over production environment and not wanting to buy and lever if it's private equity with choppy production? Or is it a general hesitation about taking on even profitable ICE assets in terms of what their terminal value is? Kevin Nowlan : Yes. I think we're pleased that we were able to accomplish step 1 here, the sale of about $200 million of revenue relative toward that $1 billion goal. So we are pretty pleased with that. I will say that the current end market environment conditions with the volatility we've seen with the $76 million global light vehicle market and with the supply chain uncertainties, has absolutely had an impact on buyers -- broadly buyers' willingness to engage in some of these discussions over the last couple of quarters. But we do have a pipeline that we're pursuing to drive toward that $1 billion of dispositions later this year. I think it's just going to be helpful for us to see a more stable market environment because I think appetite is there when the market is more stable and more certain. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank. Emmanuel Rosner : First question is on the margin outlook and progression -- trajectory for margins, I guess, beyond this year. So as part of your 2022 outlook, you're essentially guiding on a comparable basis for margins taking a small step down despite some meaningful revenue growth in the double digits. And so I'm just wondering from here, how should we think about it in terms of trajectory, what are sort of like more normalized margin? And is there a trade-off between investment in growth and sort of like ability to maintain margins? Or do you feel like once you've had this step-up in R&D, now the percentage of revenue sort of like -- will be fairly stable from here, then you can show better operating leverage going forward? Kevin Nowlan : Yes. As we look ahead after 2022, our expectation is that we're going to continue to deliver the types of cost performance we've been generating over the last few years, driving restructuring savings that have been coming into the P&L and will continue to come into the P&L. Maybe still a little bit of a tail left on some of the cost synergies from a Delphi perspective.  But at the end of the day, what's really going to drive the margin performance jumping off of 2022 into the next few years is going to be where end markets are, because obviously, we're talking about a guide that's based on -- at the midpoint, about 80 million light vehicles. And so our ability to deliver continued improvement in our margin profile is going to be markets returning to a more normalized level, call it, the high 80s of millions of units or even where IHS is now talking about being in the 90 million next year. Ultimately, our ability to convert on incremental revenue on growing markets is there the same way it's always been, but markets are going to be a big driver of our ability to improve the margin from where we are today. In terms of that question about trade-off in growth versus margin, we're willing to make that trade-off to the extent that the new business wins are there to support investment in R&D. And you can see that in what we're doing in 2022, stepping up our R&D $130 million to $160 million is obviously a pretty meaningful step-up at greater than 20% increase in our R&D. And so we're willing to do that if we see the growth opportunities there because we think it's the right thing to do for the company. So the more growth opportunities to see, the more we're willing to invest in those growth opportunities through R&D. And if that comes at the expense of near-term margin, so be it. But we still see the trajectory of margin growing over the coming years. Emmanuel Rosner : Understood. And just following up on this last point. So I mean, presumably, the pipeline of available EV opportunity is only going to grow, right? EV is at the beginning of a penetration and eventually, it's going to make its way towards 100% of the industrial or something thereabout. So there's going to be a lot to invest in towards EV. So I guess, when would you want to start seeing it as a margin of a driver \u2013 as a margin expansion? Or in other words, how long would you be willing to sort of like take margin compression as an investment into EV growth? Kevin Nowlan : Well, I think we saw obviously the big step-up this year. We had guided before that we thought we'd be in the 5% to 5.5% range on a go-forward basis, and we were running below 5% the last couple of years. So this is a major step-up that we thought aligned with our longer-term objectives. So we would expect to continue to invest in increasing R&D, but probably in that ZIP code of where we're operating today in that 5% to 5.5%. But what's important to also note is that we're now starting to see the EV revenue coming into the P&L. And we expect to have healthy contribution margins on that. I mean you can see we indicated in our press release today that our EV revenue is north of $800 million in 2022, embedded in our guidance, which is more than double what it was last year.  So we're getting contribution on that incremental revenue, which is now starting help fund that increase in R&D investment. So I'd say less of a headwind as we go forward because we start to operate at a more normalized R&D that's more of our steady-state run rate R&D expense on a go-forward basis as a percent of sales and then getting contribution margin on that revenue as it comes into the P&L. Emmanuel Rosner : Okay. And then just one quick final one still on this topic. So you very helpfully broke out sort of the EV revenues for 2022 versus 2021. And we get to see how much of the growth comes from here and then also back into how much of the revenue growth still comes from the combustion engine side of the business? When, over the next few years, would you expect sort of like this ratio to sort of flip for essentially more of the EV -- more of the revenue growth would come from EV than from combustion engine? And I remain impressed and positively surprised that you still have so much revenue growth from combustion engine when sort of in fact the industry production seems to be heading in the other direction. Frederic Lissalde : We're targeting $4.5 billion in 2025. And as part of challenging forward, we're pretty much half and half in 2030, and that's absolutely part of the plan. Kevin, do you want to add anything? Kevin Nowlan : No, I was going to comment on that. I mean, really, it's the drive toward about $4.5 billion under our Charging Forward plan, which is the 25% EV mix. So as we jump off of 2022, $800 million, growing to $4.5 billion or so in 2025, I mean that's the type of growth you should expect. Part of that coming from acquisitions, but the bulk of that really coming from the -- what's already in our business today. Frederic Lissalde : And it's true that 2025 might be -- '24, '25 might be a key inflection point. And for us, jumping off that inflection point already having in-house. Right now, as of this call, $3.3 billion of booked business, I'm not talking about other things than booked, with the target of being at 4.5% or above is a great jump-off point. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Ryan Brinkman : Congrats on now having fully booked your targeted 2025 electrification revenue. I thought to ask, given the very strong expected top line growth at Santroll, it looks like from de minimis revenue in '21 to 300 million and \u201825. Are you able to say how much of that growth has also been booked versus maybe requires more bookings? Kevin Nowlan : We're not going to comment on that right now. We'll give you more clarity around the outlook on that when we close on the transaction. Ryan Brinkman : Okay. And then you got 1 question already on the multiples you might pay for acquired companies and how that could be impacted by the decline in public company multiples. Maybe the flip side of that question, has there been -- I mean, there has been, at least like a relative rotation, right, from growth value in the public markets this year. So with slower growth companies that are generating a healthy margin and cash flow is now similar to those you're looking to dispose benefiting relative to the currently unprofitable high-growth companies whose cash inflows are in the future, like similar to those you're looking to buy.  So might you benefit from both ends because of this rotation? Or what has been the appetite for some of the businesses that you're shopping? Are you -- how are you thinking about the value of some of these businesses now versus, I don't know, maybe like a year from now after the industry has continued to claw back some of the volume from the chip shortage, et cetera? Kevin Nowlan : We'll see. I think just as you alluded to there at the end of your question, I think it's really going to be dependent on a more stable end market environment. So undoubtedly, the end markets inform buyers and sellers as to how to think about valuation. I'll tell you in this market right now with the choppiness we're seeing and the volatility and only an 80 million unit global end market that we're projecting at the moment, it makes things a little bit more challenged on the disposition side.  But we'll see how things progress from here because I think as market conditions stabilize. And if there's continued rotation toward more value-related investments, maybe that will be a tailwind, but we'll see. Our focus is on executing our strategic plans, controlling what we can control and making sure we get good value for the assets that we dispose of. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Luke Junk with Baird. Luke Junk : Fred, hoping we could start with a big picture question this morning, and it's some project, Charging Forward. Looking back on when you first outlined the company's current strategy about a year ago now. How does where the company stands today compared to your initial expectations on all 3 of the major fronts : organic bookings, which clearly look to be above expectations, M&A and the asset positions. Where are you ahead of expectations? And is there anywhere that you're not? And if not, what's driving that? Frederic Lissalde : I think we are on track. And personally, I'm fully focused on Charging Forward. And with the broader team, I think we're absolutely on track. We are ahead of organic bookings, and I'm very proud of that. I would say that our decentralized operating model allows me and a few others at the top of the house to really spend a lot of time charging forward. And I'm really excited to up our game on R&D with 45% of R&D on EV next year. I think it really, really validates the essence of using the cash that we generate and reinvesting it in the business with the traction that we have for all the e-products that we now have in our portfolio. I am happy with where we are just a year after or maybe less than a year after the announcement of Charging Forward. Luke Junk : And then my follow-up question, can you just remind us now that the squeeze out process is completed at AKASOL, what the initial steps are as you're able to take a little more control? Frederic Lissalde : I think, as Kevin alluded to before, we see some good prospects and the pipeline of growth is strong with that -- investments go with it. And we're not shy about investing for the future of battery pack technologies and battery pack product leadership. We are -- we have literally -- we are in-charge in last Thursday. So we're putting in place the different steps to run the company the way we would like it to be run. I am very impressed by the talents in this company. The technology leadership that they have and the bookings that they've been able to generate in Europe and in the U.S. will be one of the only one in the world having production facilities for high-volume commercial vehicle battery packs in both sides of the pump. So A lot of work to be done, but very, very excited about running with the AKASOL people and talents. Operator : We have time for one final question, and that question comes from Dan Levy with Credit Suisse. Dan Levy : Wanted to go and just revisit some of the assumptions on the combustion set. So if you're saying you're going to grow EV by $400 million this year, that basically implies that sort of the outgrowth related to the ICE pieces maybe a point or so as opposed to, call it, 3, 3.5 points-or-so from EV. So just wondering, that's obviously a clear deceleration versus what we saw in 2021, and I assume 2021 was more driven by ICE outgrowth. So maybe you could just give us a sense of the underlying outgrowth dynamics from your combustion products? And then maybe you could also just talk through the underlying margins? Obviously, do you strip out the elevated R&D and the margin track from your EV products, wondering what those margins for combustion would look like? Kevin Nowlan : Yes. I mean when you look at that, you're right, a good chunk of outgrowth this year is being driven by the EV and we're excited about that. But we're continuing to see some level of that organic growth coming from the combustion business as well. So the combustion business has actually been holding up well and actually outperforming the market. So not sure what to add to that other than I think we feel pretty good that the combustion portfolio is holding up and the e-business is now really starting to gain traction and coming through in the P&L. Dan Levy : And are you seeing increased penetration of, say, turbos and GDI? Is that an increased trend? Kevin Nowlan : We're definitely seeing that as it relates to hybrids. I mean, when you look at the advanced hybrid technologies, those products lend themselves to driving more efficiency and downsizing of the engine. And so we do see adoption rates of products like turbos, VCT, GDI actually increasing in the hybrid world. And so that is a piece of what we expect to be a tailwind for the coming years and why we continue to expect underlying growth in that C-portfolio over the next few years. Dan Levy : Okay. And then the second question is just on your longer-term planning assumptions. I think when you gave your targets, your 2030 plan was assuming global BEV penetration of 30%. But I think what we've seen is just broadly OEMs, third-party forecasters. These long-term assumptions just keep on skewing higher and higher, and this is occurring in just a very short period of time. So I think some would argue that 30% is now looking conservative. So -- to the extent -- 2030 is a ways out, but to the extent we continue to see easy expectations accelerating, maybe you can unpack what that does to your plans on acquisitions, dispositions or organic growth initiatives. Frederic Lissalde : Dan, I think you're right, the EV market adoption appears to be accelerating based on public comments and also with conversation with our customers. What's very important for us is our positioning in 2025, and that's really key to our long-term success target of $4.5 billion of BEV product in 2025. We're at $3.3 million and we have time to book more organic business, and we have a healthy pipeline of M&A. So more to come on that. I think the jump-off point of 2025 is really, really important having the right portfolio, the right product leadership, the right customer intimacy and the right base of a significant multibillion-dollar BEV revenue in 2025 is going to be key to our success. Patrick Nolan : Thank you all for your great questions today. If you have any follow-ups, feel free to reach out to me or my team. With that, Jerome, you can go ahead and conclude the call. Operator : All right. That does conclude the BorgWarner 2021 Fourth Quarter and Full Year Results Conference Call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BorgWarner 2022 First Quarter Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to Patrick Nolan, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Nolan, you may begin your conference. Patrick Nolan : Thank you, Jerome. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. We issued our earnings release earlier this morning. It's posted on our Web site, borgwarner.com, on both our home page and our Investor Relations home page. With regard to our Investor Relations calendar, we will be attending multiple conferences between now and our next earnings release. Please see the Events section of our IR home page for a full list. Before we begin, I need to inform you that during this call, we may make forward-looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties as detailed in our 10-K. Our actual results may differ significantly from the matters discussed during this call. During today's presentation, we will highlight certain non-GAAP measures in order to provide a clearer picture of how the core business performs and for comparison purposes with prior periods. When you hear us say on a comparable basis, that means excluding the impact of FX, net M&A and other non-comparable items. When you hear us say adjusted, that means excluding non-comparable items. When you hear us say organic, that means excluding the impact of FX and net M&A. We will also refer to our growth compared to our market. When you hear us say market, that means the change in light and commercial vehicle production weighted for our geographic exposure. Please note that we posted an earnings call presentation to the IR page of our Web site. We encourage you to follow along with these slides during the discussion. With that, I'm happy to turn the call over to Fred. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : Thank you, Pat, and good day, everyone. We're very pleased to share our results for the first quarter 2022 and provide an overall company update starting on Slide 5. I am pleased with the resilience of our revenue relative to the industry decline. With approximately 3.9 billion in sales, we were up about 1% organically and we outperformed in both Europe and North America. Our margin performance was negatively impacted by higher commodities and other inflationary costs. However, our M&A synergies and restructuring savings helped partially mitigate these headwinds. Free cash flow was a usage during the quarter due to inventory increases. However, we still expect to generate significant free cash flow in 2022.  While navigating the near-term industry headwinds, we took steps to drive our long-term positioning during the quarter. We completed the acquisition of Santroll's light vehicle eMotor business. In addition to deploying capital to our M&A investment, we opportunistically repurchased $40 million of stock. And lastly, we secured multiple new electrification program awards.  Let's look at two electrification awards on Slide 6. First, I'm excited to announce our first OEM business win for our flexible battery management system. We have been selected by a leading global vehicle manufacturer to equip all its B-segment, C-segment and light commercial vehicles, with production expected to begin in 2023.  We've been working with this global manufacturer for over two decades, and are delighted to further strengthen our relationship by contributing our advanced battery management solutions for their vehicle platforms of tomorrow.  Our battery management system for hybrid and electric is designed to monitor the state of charge, the state of health and the battery temperature of each individual battery cell while precisely measuring current flow in and out of the battery pack. The cell balancing is performed during both the charge and discharge consumption cycles.  It allows the highest state of charge to be achieved, optimizes battery lifespan and enhances battery safety by preventing over or undercharging. The system is suitable for battery applications operating at up to 800 volts. This is another great example of our wide range of products available for electrified vehicles.  Next, I'm excited to announce our second dual inverter program. We will be providing a leading Chinese OEM with our highly efficient dual inverter for high voltage hybrid vehicle models slated to launch in 2023. By combining different power electronic technologies into one compact package, our dual inverter provides unrivaled functionality. A single unit can control and drive two electric motors while delivering cost and weight reductions. It also comes with a DC/DC converter as an option. These advanced inverter awards showcase not only the product leadership we have in these domains, but also the trust and confidence we've built in our electric side application with multiple OEMs globally.  In addition to their midterm revenue opportunities, advanced high voltage hybrid programs such as these allow us to drive additional scale and product capabilities that help improve our overall competitiveness in the world of battery electric vehicle.  On Slide 7, I'm happy to highlight an additional eMotor award. BorgWarner has been selected to provide our high-voltage hairpin eMotors for a leading electric vehicle brand in China. The eMotors will be used in the company's second generation 800 volt propulsion system platform.  The first vehicle equipped with this platform is expected to start mass production in 2023. These motors deliver peak efficiency of over 96% and feature our patented high-voltage hairpin stator winding technology.  As you can see by the chart on the slide, our booked eMotor volumes, which are a testament to the recognition of our customers, are expected to grow rapidly from 800,000 units in 2022 to 2 million units by 2025, more than a 30% CAGR. With the additional booking opportunities that we see over the next one to two years, we believe our eMotor volume could reach more than 3 million units by 2025.  Santroll's acquisition is a key part of our eMotor strategy, and I would like to provide a brief update on this acquisition on Slide 8. Starting with revenue, we expect Santroll acquisition to contribute $60 million to $70 million to 2022 revenue over the next three quarters. We expect the impact to EBIT to be a modest negative for the full year. However, we did not acquire Santroll for its near-term impact on results. We continue to expect the Santroll acquisition to drive approximately 300 million of revenue by 2025, inclusive of assumed revenue synergies. Santroll's added manufacturing capabilities and eMotor design improvement should advance our overall competitiveness in eMotors. With Santroll, BorgWarner now has a full suite of eMotor products at scale, with application in small and larger passenger vehicle as well as commercial vehicles that we will bring on a global scale.  On the right side of the slide, we've provided a sampling of the revenue synergies that we're now in position to pursue. And we're excited that we've already secured two programs on the synergy list, and we expect to see additional success in the coming quarters. So let me summarize our first quarter results and our outlook. Overall, our first quarter performance was respectable. Our revenue once again proved more resilience than the industry volume. And while our margins are being negatively impacted by inflation, the proactive steps we have been taking to implement restructuring and cost synergies over the past several months and years are helping to partially mitigate these headwinds.  As Kevin will detail shortly, our reduced full year 2022 outlook is a reflection of the FX of date, the moderated industry volume outlook at the top end of our range, and increased commodity costs. However, I'm encouraged that our relative revenue performance outlook has nonetheless improved.  We are not accepting our current environment and its impact on our profitability and cash flow. As a management team, we are absolutely taking the measures that we believe are necessary to continue to optimize the short-term margins and cash flow.  My eyes are focused on the longer term, and I'm extremely excited about charging forward. We're taking significant steps that we believe will help us to secure our profitable growth well into the future. We're continuing to secure business in the electric world, and we have now booked significant scale across multiple product lines for electrified vehicles.  By 2025, we have booked programs that will support approximately 2 million eMotors, 3 million inverters and close to 4 million e-heaters, together with iDM, eDM, battery management systems and battery packs. This represents more than 3.3 billion of book business already in 2025, ready to carry on booking more and acquiring great assets to become even stronger.  We're focused on disciplined inorganic investments, like the acquisitions of AKASOL and Santroll's eMotor, which already are adding great technology to our portfolio while supplementing our growth profile.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin. Kevin Nowlan : Thank you, Fred, and good morning, everyone. Before I dive into the financials, I'd like to provide a quick overview of our first quarter results. First, our revenue came in at the high end of our expectations, despite significantly weaker industry volume in Europe, which is our largest light vehicle market.  Second, our margin performance in the quarter was respectable given inflationary pressures that our business is currently facing. Performance was supported by our synergy and cost restructuring actions that we've been executing on for the last couple of years. Let's turn to Slide 9 for a look at our year-over-year revenue walk for Q1. We start with last year's revenue, which was just under $4 billion after adjusting for the disposition of our Water Valley facility this past December. You can see that foreign currencies decreased revenue by about 3% from a year ago, the U.S. dollar strengthened year-over-year and has continued to strengthen beyond the quarter end.  Then you can see the increase in our organic revenue, about 1% year-over-year. That compares to a 7% decrease in weighted average market production. That means we delivered another quarter of strong outperformance in the face of a challenging end market environment. This outperformance was driven by Europe, North America and Korea. The sum of all this was just under $3.9 billion of revenue in Q1.  Now let's look at our earnings and cash flow performance on Slide 10. Our first quarter adjusted operating income was $389 million, or 10.0%, which compares to adjusted operating income of $464 million, or 11.6%, from a year ago. On a comparable basis, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and the impact of the Water Valley disposition, adjusted operating income decreased $62 million on $30 million of higher sales.  This performance includes nearly $50 million of net commodity and other material cost headwinds that we experienced in the quarter. The balance of the operating income decline year-over-year is explained by the impact of higher e-products related R&D and the acquisition of AKASOL. Moving on to free cash flow. Our free cash flow was a $61 million usage during the first quarter due to increased inventory as a result of ongoing production volatility.  Let's now turn to Slide 11, where you can see our perspective on global light vehicle industry production for 2022. When you look at this slide, you can see that our market assumptions incorporate a range of potential outcomes. That's primarily a result of the semiconductor supply challenges, the additional supply chain impacts as a result of the conflict in Ukraine, and the impact of COVID-related shutdowns in China.  With that background in mind, we expect our global weighted light and commercial vehicle markets to increase in the range of 2.5% to 5% this year, which is down from our previous assumption of a 6% to 9% increase. Looking at this by region, Europe is where we see the largest reduction relative to our prior guidance. We expect a blended market increase of 2% to 4%, which is down significantly from our prior outlook of plus 12% to 15%. This is driven by weaker production in both light and commercial vehicle markets.  In North America, we're planning for our weighted markets to be up 11% to 13%. And in China, we expect the overall market to be down 4% to 7%, which is worse than our previous outlook. This has an underlying assumption that the COVID-related shutdowns are resolved by early June, and that most of the loss volumes can be recovered in the second half of the year.  Now let's talk about our full year outlook on Slide 12. First, our guidance assumes an expected $650 million headwind from weaker foreign currencies, which is based on FX rates as of the end of April. While the U.S. dollar had already appreciated somewhat against foreign currencies through the end of March, we've seen additional meaningful appreciation of the dollar through the month of April as well. So we factored that into our outlook for the balance of the year. But remember, our strategy is to produce and purchase components in the same region as our customers. As a result, the impact of currencies on our guidance is predominantly translational in nature.  Next, as I previously mentioned, we expect our end markets to be up 2.5% to 5% for the year. But we expect our overall organic revenue growth to continue to exceed industry growth. In fact, our current outlook for outperformance is stronger than our prior outlook based on both our year-to-date performance and an increase in our expected pricing recoveries for commodity and other inflationary costs.  Based on these assumptions, we expect our 2022 organic revenue to increase approximately 10% to 13% relative to 2021 pro Forma revenue. That means we expect to outgrow the market by approximately 7% to 8%, which is higher than our prior outlook of 4% to 5%. To look at it in another way, our stronger relative performance is almost entirely offsetting the impact of lower industry production.  Finally, as it relates to our revenue outlook, the Santroll acquisition is expected to add $60 million to $70 million to 2022 revenue, as Fred previously noted. Adding these items together, we're projecting total 2022 revenue to be in the range of $15.5 billion to $16.0 billion.  From a margin perspective, we expect our full year adjusted operating margin to be in the range of 9.8% to 10.2% compared to a pro forma 2021 margin of 10.9%. This represents a 40 to 50 basis point reduction versus our prior outlook. Of this, approximately 40 basis points, or just over $60 million, is the result of higher commodity and other inflationary costs, net of additional pricing recoveries, and about 10 basis points relates to the Santroll acquisition, which is expected to be modestly diluted this year.  As it relates to R&D investment, our guidance still anticipates a $130 million to $160 million increase in e-products R&D investment in 2022. Despite this challenging environment, we are not constraining the key investments that support the long-term growth of this company. Excluding inflation, and this e-products R&D investment, our 2022 margin outlook contemplates the business delivering four-year incrementals in the high teens.  Based on this revenue and margin outlook, we're now expecting full year adjusted EPS of $3.90 to $4.25 per diluted share. It's important to note that the translation impact alone of the strengthening U.S. dollar is impacting our year-over-year EPS outlook by about $0.20 per share. And finally, we expect that we'll deliver free cash flow in the range of $650 million to $750 million for the full year. The reduction from our prior guidance is being driven by our lower adjusted operating income, partially offset by lower capital spending expectations. That's our 2022 outlook.  So let me summarize my financial remarks. Overall, we had a respectable start to the year. Our revenue proved more resilient than the decline in industry volume, with our outgrowth tracking ahead of our expectations coming into the year. And we still delivered double digit margins despite significant material cost inflation and higher R&D investment.  As we look out to the balance of 2022, near-term industry pressures are likely to continue with ongoing production disruptions in multiple markets, as well as continuing material cost inflation pressure. As a management team, we continue to work to strike a balance between managing the present by sustaining our strong margin and cash flow profile, while at the same time maintaining the momentum and delivering our long-term plans under charging forward. But we know how to meet this challenge. Managing near-term results and long-term profitable growth has been and will continue to be the hallmark of BorgWarner's success.  With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Pat. Patrick Nolan : Thank you, Kevin. Jerome, we're ready to open up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Colin Langan with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Colin Langan : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Just to start, I think you mentioned there's about a 60 million increase in the assumption on commodities. Where does that sort of bring your sort of full year headwind for commodity and input costs? And quite frankly, surprisingly not nearly as bad as a lot of other suppliers are talking about, it seems like a pretty relatively small number. And you're doing a really good job offsetting that because the incrementals on the sales cut aren't really that bad. What are the sort of key offsets that are kind of keeping those detrimentals in a pretty low range? Kevin Nowlan : So a couple of things. On the 60 million, if you remember last quarter, we talked about having $50 million to $60 million of net commodity headwind and then we talked about double digit million of additional inflationary pressures. With the 60 million addition where we're actually at on a full year basis for both elements, the commodity piece and the other inflationary pressures, it's about $130 million to $140 million net. That's net of the recoveries. And so that's an increase of $60 million. In terms of managing the incrementals on the sales cut, aside from the $60 million flowing through, keep in mind, the bulk of the sales cut is really driven by foreign exchange. If you look at the production cuts, the math of the production cuts that we're talking about in our guide translates to somewhere around $500 million to $600 million of lower revenue. But the increased outgrowth that we're delivering is kind of in that $450 million range. So it's substantially offsetting the production impact. So the lower revenue is really predominantly driven by the foreign exchange. That's why you're not seeing a huge detrimental on lower revenues, because it's mainly translation. Colin Langan : Got it. Thanks. Any update on the divestitures that you were planning for internal combustion engines? It seems like the recent volatility is probably not helping the market currently. I think the target was to do 1 billion by the end of this year. Kevin Nowlan : Yes. We're still actively involved in our processes. But I'd say it's highly likely that the current market environment is going to have some impact on the timing of that disposition process. I think until there's more clarity around things like the resolution of inflationary cost pressures, the impact of Russia-Ukraine, the impact of COVID lockdowns in China, I think it has the potential to impact certain buyers, making them a little bit more hesitant in different processes that we're undertaking. So I think that's okay. We're not a desperate seller. We're looking at disciplined approaches to selling positive cash flow generating businesses that have a certain value to us. So I would tell you those processes we're involved in right now are continuing to progress. But I think it's fair to assume that this has the potential to impact the market environment for executing these dispositions in the near term, until there's more clarity about the situation. This situation being the market situation. Colin Langan : Okay. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America. Your line is open. Aileen Smith : Good morning, everyone. This is Aileen Smith on for John. Of course, I wanted to start asking the flipside to Colin's question from a longer term perspective and the charging forward plan. You mentioned that there may be some impacts of timing around the divestiture target for this year. But does the volatility in the capital markets and what may be going on with valuations from a public and a private side of things change anything from your perspective in terms of the acquisition opportunities that are available? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : Aileen, I think you need to think about it depending on the attributes or the characteristics of the target. So if you have an acquisition that we're going after that has a substantial current business in production, the current market conditions will have more impact on us looking at it versus a target that would be more of a startup in nature. And that's the way we look at it. The startup in nature, if there is a low level of production and if the bulk of the business comes in the years to come, the impact is way more marginal. In any case, we've always applied a very disciplined approach as far as M&A is concerned, actually MD&A is concerned. This will carry on. And over the past two quarters, we've turned down some acquisitions that we looked at for economical reason. So very disciplined in those approaches. Aileen Smith : Okay, got it. That's helpful. And then we've asked this question a few different ways to suppliers on the cost inflation side, but your automaker customers have been pretty successful in passing on cost inflation more recently to their customers in the form of price. And I think we can understand the dynamic of commodities and pass-throughs between you and your customers, the cost inflation is really everywhere. So in the past few months, have automakers been in any way receptive or kind of opened the door to discussions of taking on some incremental cost burden from you beyond commodity as they may be able to pass it down to their customers? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : Yes, I think I am getting encouraged by the discussions that we have with our customers. Those are not easy discussions, but we're making progress. And I think we will have substantially more clarity in the next earnings call to give you more detail. But the discussion is ongoing and encouraged by the tones. Aileen Smith : Okay, great. And one quick housekeeping or clarification question, if I may. The battery management system win that you highlighted on Slide 6, is that technology that came from the AKASOL acquisition? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : No. It's a technology that came with the Delphi acquisition that has been enhanced since we're together. Aileen Smith : Fantastic. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Noah Kaye : Thanks so much. I just wanted to ask about the pace of quoting and award activity. It feels like from what we can see, it's continuing to accelerate. You've maintained your outlook for R&D spend this year. Any considerations that we should have about maintaining that with activity picking up? Just wondering how to reconcile the two? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : We're very happy with the intensity of discussion with the customers' intensity of quotes and book business, and also very happy with the increase of 130 million to 160 million year-over-year on R&D on E. And we want to maintain that. And again, this increase is linked to application engineering and launch and quoting activities for businesses where we have high confidence. It's not R&D, scratching our heads on what products we're going to develop. It's really concrete, linked to launch activities. And we feel good about those numbers. Noah Kaye : Okay, very helpful. Thanks, Fred. And then just to clarify, how much of the anticipated weakness in the European markets have you really started to see here quarter-to-date versus what you're thinking for the back half? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : So I would tell you that I think that the people that have been impacted by the Ukraine war directly, and it's not really our case, have done a pretty good job over the past weeks getting around some of the origin or supply chain that we saw when this conflict arose. And so we've reduced the midpoint of our European forecast by about 1.3 million units. But remember, 40% of that reduction is Russia where we have very, very low exposure. So I think even if Q2 is going to be under pressure still, I think our customers are really doing an effective job managing through those supply issues in Europe. Noah Kaye : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Rod Lache : Good morning, everybody. Just first of all, a couple of housekeeping things. You originally at the beginning of the year pointed to 4% to 5% growth of the market. Now it's 7.5% to 8% relative to your weighted production assumption. Within that organic growth, what is the commodity reimbursement? And to Kevin, you mentioned two numbers for net inflation, one was 60 million and one was 130 million to 140 million. Which one is the net for the year? Kevin Nowlan : Yes, so the increase in the outgrowth effectively going up 300 basis points is really a combination of the flow through of what we saw in Q1, the good news, as well as the incremental pricing recoveries that we're anticipating. Now, ultimately, the pricing -- the additional pricing, which is both related to commodities, the contractual commodities, as well as some of the non-contractual things that we're working on, it's really going to be subject to the negotiations that ultimately transpire both with the suppliers, how much of that flows through to us and how much of that passes through to customers? I think you should assume that that of the 3 points of additional outgrowth, that's somewhere in the zip code of plus or minus 2 points of that 3 points and the Q1 outgrowth coming through being the rest of it, so still even without that delivering 5 or 6 points of outgrowth on a full year basis. In terms of that 130 million to 140 million, what I was trying to get at, I apologize if I confused the situation, but 130 million to 140 million represents the total net impact of material cost inflation, inclusive of commodities, on a year-over-year basis. That's a $60 million increase from what was embedded in our prior guide. Rod Lache : Okay. Thanks. And your R&D increase for the year, the definition changed a little bit. Originally, it was R&D. Now it's e-products R&D. I just wanted to see if there's anything there. And it seems like you have a different cadence of margin expectations than we've heard from others that you did roughly 10% margin in Q1, and you've got the midpoint of your margin targets around 10% for the year. Can you maybe give us a little bit of color on how you expect the year to evolve? Does this production look a little bit better or a mix for commodity absorption later in the year? Kevin Nowlan : Yes, so the R&D -- on the R&D, you're right. We changed the wording a little bit. And the main reason we did that is because actually as part of managing our cost structure along with other things that we manage within our P&L, we actually did manage our R&D on the combustion side lower in the quarter than what was implicitly in our guidance. So it was part of our cost management actions. So if you look at total R&D for the company, it was up $8 million year-over-year. But our e-products R&D in the first quarter was actually up over $20 million, which just means combustion-based R&D was down on a year-over-year basis. So we wanted to make sure it was clear that we haven't come off the expectation that we're continuing to invest the same amount of e-R&D on a year-over-year basis. With respect to the cadence of margins, we're obviously not giving quarterly guidance. But what I would suggest to you is Q2 is likely going to come under the most pressure because that's where we're likely to see a lot of the volume headwinds. As Fred talked about with Europe, some of the challenges that we're likely going to see in Europe from a production perspective are going to be most pronounced probably in the second quarter. And we're obviously living right now through the impacts of the China shutdowns. And that's going to have an impact on second quarter revenue as well. So we'll obviously see impacts of that from a conversion perspective. As we then get back to the back half of the year, we would expect those types of pressures to abate as some of the OEMs are working on solutions to navigate the European situation. And we would expect the China situation to recover in the back half of the year, most of the volume that gets lost in the second quarter. And then on top of that, we expect that we'll see significant progress even over the next 90 days or so, as we work with our customers on these recovery mechanisms, which should help to further mitigate some of the headwinds that we're expecting to see there as part of that 130 million to 140 million net. Rod Lache : Okay. And just really quick, Fred, this BMS contract, it seems like it's very short lead timing. Is that going to be typical and any thoughts on the size of that contract? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : Yes, this is a little untypical. We've been working with this customer for quite some time. And we've announced it since they have really spread the volumes to all those platforms. I would still say that for such a product, 18 months would be a good proxy, 18 to 24 months. Usually, we do not start from scratch. We have modular battery management systems available. And this is why we can launch very rapidly. You've seen some of the other launches also in eMotors. eMotors also linked to the modular design, we can be up and running pretty rapidly. So 18 months would be a good proxy. Rod Lache : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open? Emmanuel Rosner : Thank you very much. I was hoping to come back to the topic of commodities. And in particular, can you give us a little bit more color around how some of this recovery mechanisms work for you? How you expect them to play out for the rest of the year? Because, obviously, you seem to be very successful of setting a lot of these costs, but 130 million to 140 million is still less than that for the year. Is there any prospective through this mechanism to get some of it back in 2023? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : Yes, it is ongoing. As I mentioned before, Emmanuel, progress are being made and encouraged by the mindset of the interaction and the discussion with the customers. And so, yes, I am absolutely confident that we're going to get to the target that we set to ourselves, both managing the count [ph] and we're not -- as you know, we're not in the business of making deals. We're in the business of a long-term relationship, and I expect fairness in the relationship in the short term into semi, to volume, to inflation, and also improving and nurturing the relationship on the longer term with great e-products at the lowest total cost of ownership for our customers. We're doing both. And as a side note, I've been in sales-related function for about 20 years of my life. So this is something that I've got a little bit of experience of. Kevin Nowlan : Just to clear, Emmanuel, the 130 million to 140 million is net. It's net of our assumption about pricing recoveries, which is both the normal contractual commodity recoveries which is still working the way they're designed at 50%, but also an assumption that we're going to be continuing to work with our customers to try to recover some of the extra inflationary impacts that we're seeing. And so the 130 million to 140 million is net of the assumption about those recoveries. Emmanuel Rosner : No, I understand. But I guess my question is, so at the end of the day you're left by the end of the year with sort of like this headwind to your margin profile of $130 million to $140 million net of recoveries. Do you have either contractual, mechanical or just commercial discussion process to then continue these discussions next year, assuming spot prices stay where they are, and go back to the automakers and say, hey, look, the margins are not where they should be, we were still left holding this amount. Can we do something towards that? Or at this point, this is sort of the result of your negotiations will be seen this year and not necessarily additional upside in 2023? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : It's already difficult enough to get to a resolution for this year. We don't want to speculate for what's happening next year. Next year will be the next year. Right now, the focus is to get to our targets in some fairness this year. Emmanuel Rosner : Okay, that's fair. So then second question will be on the e-products R&D and then the overall R&D for the company. So as you mentioned in the remarks, as part of guidance, the margins are under year-over-year pressure, both because of some of this inflation but also because of extra investment in R&D. How should we think about it going forward? I obviously assume e-products R&D will keep growing, but what about the R&D at the company level? Does that remain a headwind to margins? Or does that stabilize on a same level as a percentage of revenue? Kevin Nowlan : Well, we haven't -- we're not giving updated guidance on R&D in total for the company. It's obviously one of the levers that we have to be able to manage our cost structure when we look at the non-e-related R&D. But I think you should continue to expect that we're going to drive the investment and growth in the e-R&D that's necessary to support the launch of our programs and the profitable growth of the future. So we continue to expect that to be growing at $130 million to $160 million this year. I think it's still also overall a good way to think about as being in that 5% to 5.5% range from a total R&D perspective on a full year basis. And that's where we are based on what's underlying our current guidance. Emmanuel Rosner : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays. Your line is open. Brian Johnson : Thank you. Just wanted to talk a little bit about price and particularly plug-in hybrids. A couple of things. When you look at your growth over market, how much is still driven by uptake of your product line on ICE vehicles? Is there perhaps a mix effect there [indiscernible] might have felt better. But secondly, given all the discussion around both costs and shortages of battery materials, it seems like the same amount of minerals that could power one EV could power 10 plug-in hybrids, which for most of the week could be operating in all electric mode. So are you seeing any renewed interest in plug-in hybrids? Are you seeing any uptick? The sales have gone well insofar [ph] in your sales and is that helping drive that near-term performance? And is there may be more upside on the midterm than most investors would think? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : Brian, I think we're focusing charging forward on pure BEV and it's the right thing to do. Hybrid is simply a combination of good combustion product and great BEV product. The dual inverter program in China is a good example of that, and we're seeing high voltage plug-in hybrids, 400 volts and above. Still taking some share of the market. And for us, what's really important to understand is that this is giving us scale. This is giving us launch experience in motors, in those inverters that apply in high voltage plug-in hybrids for now, but would get us really scaling in BEV too. So high voltage plug-in hybrids is a clear trend as well as BEV. And with both, we are able to serve our customers without being painted to whether they want BEV or high voltage plug-in hybrids. And all that converges into getting us scale. I was mentioning 3.3 billion of pure BEV revenue in 2025. If you add the high voltage plug-in hybrids on top of that, I don't have a number today, but it's pretty significant. Kevin Nowlan : And then in terms of the specific outgrowth-related numbers, Brian, I guess if you look at what's embedded in our guidance, that 7% to 8% outgrowth, that translates to more than a $1 billion of outgrowth this year. And separately, we've disclosed that we expect our EV revenue this year to be over 800 million, which is more than double what it was last year. So you can see, hey, there's 400 million plus coming from EVs and the rest of its coming from everything else. So to answer your question, yes, we're still seeing outgrowth in parts of our business other than EV. Brian Johnson : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dan Levy with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Dan Levy : Hi. Good morning. Maybe we could just start with the margins in the first quarter. And could give us a sense of the extent to which the China COVID shutdowns and the Ukraine war impact your margins? Meaning, excluding those items, what would we have otherwise seen? Kevin Nowlan : Yes, I think China really started to have an impact very late in the quarter. It's really more of an impact here as we get into Q2. But then in terms of Europe, you can just see the loss production. Obviously, we normally -- as we talked about in the past, we normally convert in the high teens on incremental revenue. And so as we start to lose revenue, it has an impact on our conversion accordingly. If you just cut through the math of what happened to us in the first quarter from a margin perspective, on a comparable basis, when you exclude FX and you exclude the Water Valley disposition, there were really just three things that moved the needle for us. It was the net material cost impacts that we talked about year-over-year, almost $50 million. It was the incremental e-products-related R&D of $20 million, and then a little bit of impact from AKASOL. Other than that, it was pretty normal conversion. So again, if we had more production coming out of different geographies, we would expect to convert on that normally at our typical incremental margins. Dan Levy : And the go-forward guidance, is that assuming any additional supply impacts from Europe or any lumpiness around the China COVID shutdowns? Kevin Nowlan : It assumes a couple of things. We're expecting that Q2 will be the most challenged quarter from a production perspective, because I think some of the lingering impacts of the Russia-Ukraine situation will likely manifest in Q2 and then probably see some recovery in production beyond that. In China, the lockdowns are going on right now. And our expectation underlying our guide is that the situation in China gets resolved in the early part of June and that we see the bulk of those volumes get recovered later in the year. So embedded in the guide is that Q2 will be the most challenge from a production perspective. Dan Levy : Great. And then, as a follow up, I want to understand in this inflationary environment, how costs are trending between EV versus combustion products, and most notably on the EV side inverters? Is there any difference in the input costs on each side for you? And given the likely added margin pressure for EV products, maybe there's margin pressure for everything, are the levers to mitigate those headwinds any different than what you'd have price? Kevin Nowlan : In terms of the input costs, a lot of it goes back to the overall inflationary environment is really having an impact on, I'd say, just about everything. You see it on semiconductors, you see it on a lot of underlying commodities. Take a commodity like nickel; nickel gets used in batteries, nickel gets used in stainless steel. So that's having an impact across both types of propulsion architectures, whether you're talking about EVs or ICE. So the way we go about managing our cost structure is pretty much the same whether it's an ICE-based component or an EV component, except that on the EV side, we're very cognizant of making sure that we're continuing to make the incremental e-R&D investments to support our long-term growth and the launch of the programs that are coming into the P&L over the coming years. Dan Levy : Okay. So the cost pressures aren't any worse for EV products than they are for ICE, correct? Kevin Nowlan : We're seeing cost pressures in both. If you look at the indices, even just in the last 90 days what's happened to stainless steel, to nickel, to aluminum, copper, those types of things, you're seeing 20%, 30%, 40% increases in some of those indices. And so that cuts across that can be ICE-based technology or it can be EV-based technology. And then logistics costs, freight costs, labor costs at some of the suppliers, those are impacting across the propulsion type as well. So I wouldn't say it's limited to one technology or the other. Dan Levy : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of James Picariello with BNP Paribas. Your line is open. James Picariello : Hi. Good morning, guys. Kevin Nowlan : Good morning. James Picariello : I really appreciate the eMotors detail on Slide 7. From an industry perspective, you provided the average CPV for motors at around $500. Just curious if this is trending in line with what BorgWarner is seeing, what it has in backlog? And then within the 2 million units slated for 2025, can you share roughly what the iDM mix is? And is there any way to think about the margin differential between any more eMotor component sale versus the full iDM system? Thanks. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : I don't have all the detail. Pat, will you please come back to James. What I can tell you at least that on one of your question is most of the 2 million of eMotor volume in 2025 are standalone motors. And a few go into iDM, but by far not the vast majority. For the rest, Pat is going to come back to you. James Picariello : Okay. And just like at a high level, just the margin differential for the full IBM system versus eMotors, is the IBM system materially margin accretive relative to the component? Kevin Nowlan : Yes, we price our business substantially similar. Whether it's a system or a component, we look at the return on the invested capital or look at the capital that's required. And it tends to be, since we're in the assembly business, whether it's a system or a standalone motor that we likely have relatively comparable capital intensity for that individual sale, which means that the margin profile on a percentage basis tends to look similar. Obviously, if you're selling more content through a system, the dollar amounts might be bigger, but the ROIC in the margin profile tend to look directionally similar. James Picariello : Okay, understood. And then is there a tally as to how many BMS-related awards you have in backlog? And then you do have five months inorganic contribution from AKASOL this year. So curious if you could share what AKASOL's revenue was in the quarter? And how you're thinking about that business for the rest of the year? Thanks. Kevin Nowlan : So with respect to AKASOL, I'll take that question. AKASOL, we delivered between $40 million and $50 million of revenue this first quarter. And I would say, we tend to be trending stronger in terms of what we're seeing is the longer term prospects for that business from a growth perspective. James Picariello : Okay. And the tally on the BMS-related awards, is this your first one that you announced or --? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : So this is the first major one that we announced cutting across a lot of volume and a lot of platform for launch globally. There are other BMS businesses in the company that came with the Delphi acquisition. And, of course, we're doing our own BMS as far as commercial vehicle battery packs are concerned. We will not flag that out independently from the battery pack revenue. So that's a little bit of California, James. James Picariello : I appreciate it. Thanks. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Mark Delaney : Yes. Good morning. And thank you very much for taking the question. I was hoping to better understand the 2025 booked EV-related revenue. I think last quarter, you talked about 2.7 billion was already booked. This quarter, you talked about over 3.3 billion. I'm a little unclear if those are apples-to-apples, or if there's some differences in how M&A has been treated. But the second part of that question is can you bridge us to what's driving that increase from the 2.7 billion to the 3.3 billion? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : That's easy. The 2.7 billion is organic. It's the first bar of charging forward [indiscernible] that you can see on our Web site. The additional 600 or 700 is coming from acquisition. And it's essentially AKASOL and a little bit of Santroll and 2.7 plus points is a bit more than 0.6, which is 0.6 to 0.7 [indiscernible] 3.3. That's how the math works. Mark Delaney : Got it. That's helpful. And I guess the follow up is you got the BMS win you're speaking about today that starts late '23. So I was thinking that might have some contribution to the '25 EV target. So maybe talk a little bit more on what kind of revenue we can be expecting from the BMS program? You spoke a little bit already around what led you to win there. But that's a pretty competitive segment and I thought it was very encouraging that you picked up the BMS win. So if you could also speak to what's differentiating your BMS product line, what allowed you to win? Thanks. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : Yes, so on the 2.7, we're not updating three or four digit after the coma. So this is a rounding. We're not going to dig that each time we book a business. So as far as the BMS, that's a competitive advantage. It is our ability to combine again hardware and software. And this is part of the winning equation that I always alluded to mechanical, hardware and software altogether. And this is what we do very well and starting being absolutely recognized globally for a whole suite of products, including now battery management systems for [indiscernible] independently, but also together with AKASOL commercial vehicles. Mark Delaney : Thank you. Operator : All right, we have time for one final question. And that question comes from David Kelley with Jefferies. Your line is open. Gavin Kennedy : Hi, team. This is Gavin Kennedy on for David Kelley. I believe you mentioned that M&A synergies and restructuring savings partially offset the margin headwinds we saw in the first quarter. Can you remind us of your expectations for synergies and restructuring savings for the full year? Kevin Nowlan : For the full year, it's north of $100 million combined. Gavin Kennedy : Great. And then of the major wins you highlight in your presentation today in electrification, two are for China. Do you expect the pace of new business awards and bids to be impacted by the COVID-related shutdowns in that region, or is it business as usual despite the disruption? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : It's business as usual, except when it comes to production. But I'm not expecting any delay as far as new technology and sourcing are concerned. Gavin Kennedy : All right. Thanks, team. Patrick Nolan : I'd like to thank you all for your great questions today. If you have any follow up questions, feel free to reach out to me or any member of my team. Jerome, you can go ahead and conclude the call. Operator : That does conclude the BorgWarner 2022 first quarter results conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BorgWarner 2022 Second Quarter Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to Patrick Nolan, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Nolan, you may begin your conference. Patrick Nolan : Thank you, Chelsea. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. We issued our earnings release earlier this morning. It's posted on our website, borgwarner.com, on our homepage and on our Investor Relations home page. With regard to our Investor Relations calendar, we will be attending multiple conferences between now and our next earnings release. Please see the Events section of our IR homepage for a full list.  Before we begin, I need to inform you that during this call, we may make forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties as detailed in our 10-K. Our actual results may differ significantly from the matters discussed today. During today's presentation, we will highlight certain non-GAAP measures in order to provide a clearer picture of how the core business performed and for comparison purposes with prior periods. When you hear us say on a comparable basis, that means excluding the impact of FX, net M&A and other noncomparable items. When you hear us say adjusted, that means excluding noncomparable items. When you hear us say organic, that means excluding the impact of FX and net M&A. We will also refer to our growth compared to our markets. When you hear us say market, that means the change in light vehicle and commercial vehicle production weighted for our geographic exposure. Please note that we have posted an earnings call presentation to the IR page of our website. We encourage you to follow along with these slides during our discussion.  With that, I'm happy to turn the call over to Fred. Frederic Lissalde : Thank you, Pat, and good day, everyone.  We're pleased to share our results for the second quarter 2022 and provide an overall company update, starting on Slide 5. I continue to be impressed with the strength of our revenue relative to the overall industry. With approximately $3.8 billion in sales, we were up about 7% organically despite global production being down slightly and we outperformed in North America and Europe.  From a margin perspective, our performance was negatively impacted by a planned increase in eProducts R&D investment, net material headwinds and sudden production shutdowns in China during this quarter. That said, we were able to partially mitigate these impacts through overall cost performance and progress on executing customer pricing actions with a number of key customers.  You will see that our guidance implies a sequential improvement in margin into the second half of 2022, which is driven by volume improvements and our expectation of continued success in executing our customer pricing actions. We are pleased with the progress we made in Q2 on this front. However, there are still some other ongoing customer discussions that we expect to resolve in the back half of the year. We expect that the successful execution of these actions will position our financials more strongly heading into 2023. While navigating the near-term industry environment, we also took step to drive our long-term positioning during the quarter. First, we completed the acquisition of Rhombus Energy Solutions. In addition to deploying capital to fund our M&A investment, we opportunistically repurchased $100 million of stock. And lastly, we secured multiple new electrification program awards.  Next, I would like to highlight our recent ESG report on Slide 6. In June, we released our 2022 Sustainability Report called Charging Forward Together. I am proud of the work of BorgWarner employees around the globe, delivering on our vision of a clean, energy-efficient world and embodying our beliefs of inclusion, integrity, excellence, responsibility and collaboration. And this comes across in the report. Together, we are accelerating the world's transition to eMobility by empowering everyone to drive sustainably leave -- by leaving cleaner, healthier and safer lives.  Our Charging Forward target to generate 45% of our revenue from electric vehicles by 2030 is consistent with our environmental goals. We remain committed to cover neutrality in Scopes 1 and 2 by 2035. In addition, we have now introduced a target to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by 85% by 2030.  We have formalized our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion with measurable targets. We continue to advance towards our vision and build our future each day with the industry's top talent. Our employees are changing the world's mobility. I invite you to read more in our 2022 Sustainability Report on our website and join us on this journey.  Next, I would like to highlight our eProducts portfolio for hybrids on Slide 7. Over the last quarter, we've been asked about the amount of revenue we were generating from these products on advanced hybrids. And as you can see on this slide, it's actually quite sizable. We have a wide range of eHybrid products that are helping our customers bridge to EVs. To name a few, these include inductors, motors, advanced and efficient drive modules and high-voltage cooling heaters.  The hybrid products help provide the bridge to EVs for many OEMs by pairing efficient gasoline engines with electric drivetrains. In many instances, and as I have mentioned before several times, the technical profiles of these products are very similar to the same eProducts used in a full electric vehicle. This is what allows us to drive additional scale and product capabilities that help improve our overall competitiveness in the world of battery electric vehicle.  As you can see from the chart, we expect our eHybrid sales to be close to $1.1 billion by 2025. And this does not include our highly efficient combustion product that will also be used on many of these same hybrid vehicles. So this is a substantial revenue opportunity for BorgWarner and one that really reinforces our product leadership in electrification, which goes beyond pure battery electric vehicles.  Now let's look at some pure BEV awards on Slide 8. First, I'm happy to announce that we have secured 2 additional high-voltage coolant heater programs. One is for global OEM and the other is for an emerging electric vehicle brands in China. By offering consistent temperature distribution inside the battery pack and itself, BorgWarner's high-voltage coolant heaters can be used for improving battery energy performance. They also allow comfortable cabin temperature to be generated in a short time, improving passenger experience. This is a great internally developed product success story at BorgWarner and one where we've quickly established product leadership.  Second, BorgWarner has been selected to deliver battery systems for a European commercial vehicle OEM. This battery system will be utilized in the company's first range of heavy-duty electric trucks expected to announce in 2024. For this exciting new project, our customer will benefit from the latest generation of our ultra-high energy battery system which provides a 50% increase in energy density over its predecessor. This upgrade increases vehicle range significantly, making it a great solution for long-distance electrified commercial transportation.  Lastly, I'm excited to share that the first units of the new BorgWarner fast-charging station, Iperion-120, have been installed in Italy. We've been working on the organic development of charging capabilities at BorgWarner since 2017. And I'm really pleased to see our investments in this space starting to bear fruit. We will look to accelerate our success in stationary charging with some inorganic investments as well which I will discuss on the next slide. This quarter's award activity once again highlighted a wide range of products and our grid 2-wheel capabilities.  Next, on Slide 9, I would like to discuss the acquisition of Rhombus Energy Solutions, which we announced this morning. We plan to accelerate charging business with particular focus on high-value DC fast-challenging hardware and enabling software. We believe that we can leverage the local knowledge and footprint of Rhombus to complement our existing BorgWarner charging capability to accelerate organic growth. Specifically, Rhombus will add North America [indiscernible] we plan to leverage BorgWarner synergies across product quality, engineering, supply chain, manufacturing and global sales. We also see potential synergies with battery system customers. In terms of revenue, we expect Rhombus to add approximately $10 million to our 2022 revenue over the next 2 quarters. We expect our combined DC fast-charging business to approach $175 million to $200 million in revenue by 2025.  As a supplier to the auto and commercial vehicle market, we are not only delivering innovative products for electric drivetrain but we also care about supporting certain key elements of the infrastructure for electric mobility, especially charging. And as we look ahead, we believe you will see further success as we continue to strengthen our capabilities in this area.  As you can see, we've made progress on key aspects of our Charging Forward strategy. So let's look at what this means in the progress report on Slide 10. Starting first with organic electric vehicle revenue growth. With the awards secured as of this call, we now have electric vehicle programs that we believe account for about $2.9 billion of booked revenue in 2025. This is a great achievement by the BorgWarner teams.  Turning to M&A. We have now completed 3 acquisitions since the start of Charging Forward : AKASOL, Central's late vehicle e-motor business and Rhombus Energy Solutions. Based on our due diligence, we believe those businesses will generate $800 million of additional EV-related revenue in 2025. We're not done either. We expect to take additional M&A steps, and we are actively engaged with a number of potential targets, which could enhance various parts of our EV portfolio. So less than 18 months since the announcement of Charging Forward, we're on track to achieve approximately $3.7 billion of electric vehicle revenue by 2025 based on new business awards and actions announced to date.  So let me summarize our second quarter results and our outlook. Overall, our second quarter performance was solid. Our revenue once again outperformed the industry volume as we delivered strong organic growth. We also made key progress in the quarter on the pricing actions necessary to deliver our full year commitments. As Kevin will detail shortly, our full year 2022 outlook is unchanged from a top line and margin perspective despite industry volume pressure in our largest market in Europe and sizable [indiscernible], our relative revenue performance outlook has improved and we believe we are on track to deliver double-digit organic growth this year.  As I look beyond 2022, I'm very proud of the continuing progress on Charging Forward. We're booking electric vehicle revenue across our portfolio and we are successfully executing our disciplined M&A process. Our booked organic BEV business and M&A completed to date puts us on track to achieve $3.7 billion in electric vehicle revenue by 2025. Combined with our hybrid business, our total eProducts portfolio is now expected to reach approximately $4.8 billion in 2025 with what we've already achieved.  To put that in context, this is nearly half the size of the company when I became CEO in 2018, but we're not done. We intend to carry out on, on booking more new business and acquiring great assets to become even stronger as the world continues to accelerate towards electrification. And I look forward to sharing the additional progress with you in the future.  With that, I will turn the call over to Kevin. Kevin Nowlan : Thank you, Fred, and good morning, everyone. Before I dive into the financial details, I'm going to provide you with the key takeaways coming out of our second quarter. First, our revenue came in at the high end of our expectations, driven by strong relative revenue performance in North America and Europe. Second, our year-over-year margin performance was impacted by our planned increase in eProducts R&D investment, material cost inflation and the sudden production shutdowns in China. And finally, our guidance reflects more normal underlying incremental margin performance in the second half of the year. Let's turn to Slide 11 for a look at our year-over-year revenue walk for Q2. After adjusting for the disposition of our Water Valley facility, last year's revenue was just over $3.7 billion. You can see that the strengthening U.S. dollar drove a year-over-year decrease in revenue of about 6% or more than $220 million. Then you can see the increase in our organic revenue about 7% year-over-year. That compares to a 1% decrease in weighted average market production, which means we delivered another quarter of strong outperformance. The sum of all this was just under $3.8 billion of revenue in Q2.  Turning to Slide 12. You can see our earnings and cash flow performance for the quarter. Our second quarter adjusted operating income was $348 million or 9.3%, which compares to adjusted operating income of $421 million or 11.2% from a year ago. On a comparable basis, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and the impact of the Water Valley disposition, adjusted operating income decreased $51 million on $268 million of higher sales.  There were 3 primary drivers of this margin performance. The biggest driver was the planned step-up in eProducts R&D, where we increased our investments by $56 million. Second, net material cost inflation was a $25 million year-over-year headwind in the quarter. And finally, COVID-19 drove disruptions and lower overall production in China. All of these items were expected when we provided our guidance in early May, which is why we anticipated second quarter margins being the most challenged for the year. And importantly, excluding these items, our incremental margin would have looked more normal for our business.  Although our adjusted operating income was -- saw a sizable decline from last year, our adjusted EPS was down only $0.03 in the second quarter. That's because our effective tax rate came in below 20% due to the favorable geographic mix of earnings and the benefits of previous tax planning initiatives starting to materialize. While the Q2 rate isn't sustainable at that sub-20% level, we are expecting to see some improvement in our full year tax rate for 2022 and beyond, which I'll speak about more when I talk about our full year guidance. And finally, free cash flow. We generated $62 million of positive free cash flow during the second quarter. Our cash flow continues to be impacted by elevated levels of inventory driven by supply chain challenges and the overall choppiness of global production.  Let's now turn to Slide 13, where you can see our perspective on global light vehicle industry production for 2022. When you look at this slide, you can see that our market assumptions incorporate a range of potential outcomes. That's primarily a result of the ongoing semiconductor supply challenges, European production and demand challenges stemming from the conflict in Ukraine and the trajectory of the recovery in Chinese vehicle production. With that background in mind, we expect our global weighted light and commercial vehicle end markets to increase in the range of 2.5% to 5% this year, which is flat relative to the assumptions underlying our prior guidance.  Now let's take a look at our full year outlook on Slide 14. First, it's important to note that our guidance assumes an expected $820 million headwind from weaker foreign currencies. While the appreciation of the U.S. dollar is having a significant top line impact, remember that our strategy is generally to purchase and produce components in the same region as our customers. As a result, the impact of currencies on our guidance is predominantly translational in nature.  Next, as I previously mentioned, we expect our end markets to be up 2.5% to 5% for the year, which contribute to the organic net sales change you see on the slide. But the much bigger impact on that line item is the continued revenue growth we expect to generate above growth in end market production. That's about $1.3 billion of our organic revenue growth or about 9% growth above market. That current outlook for outperformance is stronger than our prior outlook, primarily due to the impact of estimated pricing recoveries from material inflation and other costs.  Finally, as it relates to our revenue outlook, the Santroll and Rhombus acquisitions are expected to cumulatively add $45 million to $55 million to 2022 revenue. The result of all of this is that even though FX rates have deteriorated our current outlook by $170 million from our prior guidance, our overall revenue outlook is unchanged at $15.5 billion to $16.0 billion.  Switching to margin. We continue to expect our full year adjusted operating margin to be in the range of 9.8% to 10.2%, which is also unchanged from our prior outlook. While higher material cost inflation continues to negatively impact our financials, we're pleased with the progress we've made in negotiating recoveries of a portion of these costs from our customers, and that's already started to help mitigate the impact on our P&L. We expect that the customer recoveries we're continuing to negotiate and put in place will continue to partially mitigate the impact of the inflationary headwinds that we're facing. For the full year, we now expect net material cost inflation to negatively impact our results by $145 million to $155 million.  As it relates to R&D investment, our guidance anticipates a $145 million to $160 million increase in eProducts-related R&D investment in 2022. This is at the higher end of our prior guidance, driven by continued new business wins. Excluding the impact of material cost inflation in this eProducts R&D investment, our 2022 margin outlook contemplates the business delivering full year incrementals in the high teens. And that effectively implies that as volumes recover in the second half of the year, we expect them to flow through at normalized conversion, which supports the sequential step-up in the second half operating margin implied by our guidance.  Even though our revenue and margin outlooks are unchanged, we're now expecting full year adjusted EPS of $4 to $4.40 per diluted share. This is an increase versus our prior guidance, reflecting 2 things. First, we're expecting a lower full year tax rate of 27%, down from our prior guidance of 28%, driven by our mix of earnings and the benefits of previous year's tax planning initiatives. Second, we are benefiting a bit from the lower average share count as a result of the stock buybacks we executed during the second quarter. And finally, we continue to expect that we'll deliver free cash flow in the range of $650 million to $750 million for the full year. That's our 2022 outlook.  So let me summarize. Overall, we had a solid quarter. We delivered positive organic growth despite industry volume declines. Our team successfully negotiated pricing recoveries with several key customers, and we're making progress on other key customers which we believe helps to position us for a sequential margin improvement in the second half. And we believe we're positioned to deliver our full year guidance, including a step-up in adjusted EPS despite additional external headwinds.  And as we said in prior quarters, while we focus on managing the present, we're also working to drive profitable growth and invest in our future. To that end, we had another quarter in which we secured meaningful new business awards for electric vehicles across multiple parts of our portfolio, and we deployed cash to create value for shareholders through the acquisition of Rhombus and the repurchase of $100 million of stock during the quarter. Our ability to balance these near-term commitments with our long-term objectives is the key to our ongoing success.  With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Pat. Patrick Nolan : Thank you, Kevin. Chelsea, we're ready to open up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from John Murphy with Bank of America. John Murphy : Just wanted to ask a first question on Slide 10. Fred, as you look at this, you're outperforming on organic EV sales and not yet underperforming on the M&A. But as you look at these 2 bars together, could you consider, if you keep outperforming on organic that you might not need to do the M&A that you have targeted here and you look at this as sort of a total target as opposed to one that's specifically split between organic and M&A? Frederic Lissalde : So I think the way we look at M&A is very strategic. We look at technology and product leadership and scale. And so I would say those are independent kind of work streams. We're not looking at revenue for revenue's sake. And even if at one point, maybe we collapse those 2 bars because we're not going to keep the March 2021 as a jump-off, which is the Capital Markets Day where we announced Charging Forward, I think those 2 things are somehow a little different. John Murphy : Okay. If I could ask a follow-up just on the pricing and commercial settlements that you're getting from your customers to help out with cost inflation. I'm just curious how those are being structured because we're looking at what might be peak cost inflation on raws and other input costs and the automakers are playing ball right now. But if we saw some easing in this inflation or God forbid, an actual reversal. Would that benefit go to them the way things are being structured right now? Or would you be able to capture some of that benefit as spreads would open up again? Kevin Nowlan : Yes. As we look at the material cost recoveries that we're negotiating with our customers, we're generally trying to drive a meaningful portion of those through price adjustments in the portfolio. But undoubtedly, there is a linkage between those price adjustments that we're making and the material cost inflation that we're experiencing such that if there's continued movement of inflation higher, then we would expect to have further discussions with our customers. Just like as if we thought or if we experience inflation starting to unwind, I think it's fair to think that we would expect to have to unwind some of those price increases. So I think that's the right way to think about it. John Murphy : So it does sound like there could be a period where if raws actually reversed as volumes are going up, you may actually be able to capture it for some period of time, and there could be a real upward pressure on margins for a period of time. Is that a fair statement that there is some lag that would go on there? Kevin Nowlan : I'm not sure, I guess we'll have to see when we get to that point. I mean I think it's a discussion that we'll ultimately have with the customers. It's not necessarily an automatic mechanism that's in place in terms of how those things are just additionally upward or downward, it'll lead to further discussion. So we'll have to see if and when we get to that point. Operator : Our next question will come from Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank. Emmanuel Rosner : Can you make our lives easier and maybe talk a little bit about the first half to second half walk the way you see it based on what's implied in your outlook? What are sort of like the puts and takes? I assume obviously volume is higher, but its growth over market is higher, how does materials play out? And then mostly recoveries. Is there -- are you expecting more of those in the second half than in the first? Kevin Nowlan : Yes. I think the right way to think about it big picture, 50,000-foot level, is as you look at the first half versus second half, the material cost headwinds that we're expecting kind of on a year-over-year basis when you look at both the commodity side of the equation and the other inflationary costs coming through from our suppliers and the recoveries we're getting, it's somewhat of a push first half to second half in terms of the total magnitude on a year-over-year basis. . And same with eR&D. As you think about going from first half to second half, I think I would put it in a bit similar ZIP code. It's not a substantial headwind going from one half of the year to the next, which means what? It means what's happening is as we continue to drive those pricing recoveries with our customers to mitigate the impact of what we're seeing coming through inflation, it supports our ability to allow the incremental volume to drive conversion. And that's effectively what's happening. Volume is stepping up in the back half of the year. We're getting the incremental conversion on that, that we would ordinarily expect, and we're managing the rest of the cost structure similar to how we're managing the first half of the year. Emmanuel Rosner : And then in terms of growth, second half versus first half, I think you mentioned 9% growth over market for the year. Does that mean sort of like double digit in the back half? Kevin Nowlan : Yes. I think what it implies -- I'm not sure -- I mean it's somewhere in that high single digit to maybe low double-digit ZIP code when you look at the second half of the year, depending if you're at the low end or the high end of our guidance. But on an overall basis, 9% or so for the full year. Emmanuel Rosner : Okay. And now when I look sort of at your implied second half outlook, to what extent is it a good base to try to forecast your 2023 outlook? Like is the second half in the margin run rate sort of like a clean way to look at it as an exit rate? Kevin Nowlan : Yes. I think what we're trying to do is we negotiate the price recoveries with our customers along with the inflationary impacts we're seeing from the supply base is get to the point where we have a stable jump-off point using the second half margin profile as we head into 2023. That's really our objective. And so we go into 2023, and we can have hopefully, a more normalized year from a conversion standpoint. But obviously, we're going to need inflationary pressures to cooperate with us and not create more noise as we head into next year. Operator : Your next question will come from David Kelley with Jefferies. David Kelley : Maybe starting with the Rhombus acquisition, meaningful revenue step up to 2025, obviously, a lot of charging infrastructure to build out here in North America. So can you talk about the visibility to their build pipeline, maybe segments where they're winning and the kind of the makeup of that revenue trajectory? Frederic Lissalde : Yes. Their focus is essentially right now in North America and especially on commercial vehicle, electric buses, trucks and depots which, as you can imagine, we see quite some synergies what we're doing from a varied tax standpoint, kind of the same customer profiles and vectors of growth. We really like the synergies, both on top line and bottom line, that we can bring with our current footprint in Europe, which is more focused on DC fast charging car and here more commercial vehicle in the post. So we're pretty excited about the outlook for this combination. David Kelley : Okay. Got it. And then your core charging expertise in Europe is more light vehicles, North America is more in the commercial space. So can you just elaborate on the leverageability of the 2 businesses? Do you expect to go after the light vehicle charging market in North America? Frederic Lissalde : Yes, we expect to harvest the synergies on the top line and technology on manufacturing. So it's fair to assume that our goal is to be local as far as the demand and the product definition is concerned. But global and leveraging the global scale of the company as far as the back office, the technology and the modularity of the design is concerned. By the way, there is a supplemental deck on the BorgWarner IR website where you will see a little bit more granularity around the acquisition of Rhombus. Operator : Your next question comes from Colin Langan with Wells Fargo. Colin Langan : There's been some talk about automakers moving to more of a sole source model for internal combustion engine components in the future as they kind of try to be more sort of focused on their ICE investments. Are you seeing this at all? And does that change any of your view on what to do with those assets? Because it seems like kind of a positive trend if you're going to be one of the -- in a position to be a core supplier for those components. Frederic Lissalde : I think going forward, you will see a focus on efficiency for those combustion products and also cost competitiveness, i.e., what we call product leadership at BorgWarner. And if you are a top buyer at one of the key OEMs that you need for suppliers for one commodity in combustion, maybe not. And so similarly, I think you're going to see -- we think you're going to see some consolidation in the supplier panel in some of those key OEMs. And again, I think in this case, competitiveness forefront of product leadership from an efficiency standpoint and scale will be important to support our customers around the globe with maybe fewer suppliers for that combustion market. Colin Langan : Got it. And then on the target for $3.5 billion in ICE dispositions I mean, any update on the time line there? It just seems like a pretty rough market to be trying to divest assets give any uncertainty out there. Kevin Nowlan : Yes. And it is. I think it's fair to assume that given the current market environment, our disposition projects right now are temporarily on hold. I mean simply put, and you're alluding to it, Colin, the debt financing markets are not open to finance transactions in this nature right now. But that's okay. We're not a desperate seller here. These are cash flow-generating businesses that we're happy to hold for the time being.  And then when the debt financing markets do reopen, which they eventually will, then we'll resume our disposition processes. But I think it's fair to think right now, it's just not practical to execute those transactions. And so again, we'll continue to drive the performance of those businesses and generate the cash flow to continue to support our investment strategies. Operator : Your next question will come from Rod Lache with Wolfe Research. Rod Lache : I believe on the inflation side, you mentioned $60 million in Q1 and then $25 million in Q2. So if I'm understanding this correctly, there's another $65 million in the second half. I just was hoping maybe you can tell me if that's about right and just based on just the pricing negotiations, how much benefit kind of spills over into 2023 on a net basis? And then secondly, you mentioned the e-R&D increase, was the overall R&D up similarly? Or did you reduce the other R&D? Kevin Nowlan : Yes. So on the net material cost inflation, the cost net of the recoveries in the first quarter, I think we talked about $55 million, if I'm not mistaken. The second quarter, $25 million. So we're actually at about $80 million year-to-date on a year-over-year basis which implies now that we're saying about $145 million to $155 million for the full year, there's another $70 million year-over-year headwind in the back half of the year. So roughly comparable to the headwind in the first half of the year, that's similar to my comments that I was responding to Emmanuel's question on.  So that's maybe the first point. In terms of the spillover effect, I mean our focus is really on addressing the P&L issues we're seeing from the material cost inflation, addressing those with our customers this year. And so that's what's embedded in our guidance and effectively allows us to mitigate the incremental headwinds that we are seeing in the back half of the year so we can manage that year-over-year headwind somewhere in that $65 million to $75 million ZIP code.  And then the -- and then what that allows us to effectively do is have more normalized conversion as revenue comes back into the P&L in the last 6 months. On the e-R&D question, the second quarter, we were up $56 million in eProducts related R&D, which means we're up a little over $80 million in the first half of the year, which is right in line with our guide for the full year being up $145 million to $160 million on a full year basis. With respect to the other R&D in the quarter, the other R&D was actually down $15 million. So total R&D was up 41, of which 8 products was up 56 and call it, combustion-based R&D was down 15. Rod Lache : Okay. And then just secondly, on the M&A side. Obviously, just in light of the challenges in divestitures, I was hoping you might be able to just pass along just high-level thoughts on scenarios. So what would the impact be on kind of mid-decade targets if you wound up holding on to some of those businesses that you were considering selling instead of divesting of them? And then just lastly, really quickly, any kind of high-level thoughts on what the competitive moats are for Rhombus. Kevin Nowlan : I'll have Fred talk about the competitive moat. Let me take that first question. I mean to be honest, we view this as a temporary hold in the execution of the disposition strategy. I mean all of us, including you, have lived through these types of markets before where the debt financing markets can shut down and become cost prohibitive for a period of time, but they're generally not closed for years. And so from our perspective, we've got multiple years before we really want to hit our EV objectives and deliver on the priorities that we laid out at our Investor Day 1.5 years ago, and we expect to execute on that.  So we're not looking at scenarios where we're unable to dispose of these businesses through the middle of the decade. We still have plenty of time, and our process is still ready. I mean it's ready to go when the debt markets reopen, we'll resume those processes. And maybe I'll turn it to Fred for your second question. Frederic Lissalde : What's your question, Rod, on... Rod Lache : My question was just if you could just describe the competitive moat for this Rhombus acquisition. Frederic Lissalde : Okay. Yes, we know that market, we've been in that market organically since quite some time, and we're selling products in Europe. The market is growing dramatically. And in the regions that we're now addressing with BorgWarner footprint, it's around $9 billion in 2030. It's still very fragmented, and I think we shall expect consolidation in this field, too. Again, I think technology is important, and Rhombus is one of the first one with bidirectional charging with U.S.-certified technologies in this field, which we really like. And hopefully help them grow with these products.  We feel -- we think that this market will need a strong local presence but also a very strong back office in purchasing in technology, in low-volume manufacturing. We also are very used to low-volume manufacturing with our commercial vehicle products around the world. And we also see quite some pull from our customers related to CV trucks and buses who want to offer complete solutions for their customers and we can be an enabler for them to be able to do that. Operator : Our next question comes from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer & Co. Noah Kaye : Maybe just a follow-up here. I think -- first of all, it's good to see you get deeper into the EV charging space, good growth opportunity. You've already got in-house some very high-quality domain expertise around efficient power conversion, right, and utilizing advanced materials and how electrons going to flow into an EV or an electrified powertrain. And then there's really, as we think about charging kind of the software side of it and the efficient dispatch of the charging at certain points in time and reading signals from the grid. So is what -- from a technology perspective, is what Rhombus brings more the latter or more the former or a combination thereof in terms of augmenting your core competence around power electronics? Frederic Lissalde : I think it's both of them and also they're helping us, and we can help them. We have, I think, a substantial knowledge of the bill of material that goes into those challenging devices. We have global reach. We see some trends in power electronics where we can leverage our know-how to those topical products. We see synergies with our sales and government affairs relationship around the globe, really excited about bringing BorgWarner to this charging business, stationary charging business. I think we can bring a lot of technology and a lot of competitiveness in this field. Noah Kaye : Okay. Helpful. And then a financial question, I guess, perhaps for Kevin. What's implied in the free cash flow outlook in terms of working capital in the back half? You guys have been paying your bills pretty timely and receivables and inventories have built here in the first half of the year. So where do you expect that to trend in the back half? Kevin Nowlan : Yes. Fundamentally, we're expecting that the inventory that we've built in the first half of the year that we were able to unwind that in the back half of the year as we start to see volumes ramp up and consume some of that inventory. We also saw a little bit of elevated receivable balances because with the China shutdowns, we saw some of our China customers paying a little bit later than they ordinarily would. And we expect that to reverse as well as we get into the third quarter here. So that we're expecting to get back to effectively where we were to start the year from a working capital perspective. Operator : Our next question will come from James Picariello with BNP Paribas Exane Research. James Picariello : Just a quick follow-on on the Rhombus Energy and the charging infrastructure. How much of a factor does scale play into the competitive landscape in the space? And any color on just what the content per charging unit opportunity is so that we can maybe start to work through the TAM. Frederic Lissalde : So today, I would say that it is still very regional. It will still require some regional specificities as far as certification is concerned, as far as sales channel, as far as government contacts are concerned. But when the business ramps up like any businesses related to quite significant electronics and power electronics content, scale will matter and scale always matter. As far as the TAM, I think, Pat, maybe you -- go ahead, Kevin. Kevin Nowlan : Yes, I was going to say, I think Pat will come back to you on maybe some ways to think about CPV, but as we've mentioned, the market looking after 2030, we think it's about an $18 billion global market opportunity, of which about half of that is in North America and Europe, where we're positioned to play right now. But Pat can give you a little bit more detail on how to think about the different elements of CPV there. James Picariello : Okay. And then China, the China normalization and ICE programs called out in the quarter, to what extent is this just tied to weaker commercial truck production? Is this a dynamic that's expected to sustain in the back half? And just how are we thinking about China [indiscernible]. Kevin Nowlan : [Indiscernible] a little bit last year when we were talking about some of our programs actually exceeding our expectations last year because we were having higher customer penetrations on a few programs than we were anticipating as being steady state. And then we started to see in the back half of last year, in particular that I'll say, outsized penetration unwound a little bit. And so that's what we're calling the normalization effectively of a key program or 2 in China. So we start to lap that benefit now as we head into the third quarter, and you shouldn't see that headwind materially anymore in our outgrowth. Operator : Our next question comes from Luke Junk with Baird. Luke Junk : I wanted to start with your 2025 organic EV revenue outlook. So insofar that you gave us an updated look at that this morning, it also provides a window into bookings for the first half of this year. And I'm just wondering how you'd characterize the bookings environment right now, especially as it relates to electrification. And how do you think the second half sets up on that front? Frederic Lissalde : I think there is a lot of momentum into the EV-related request and request for quotes and quotation globally. What we also see is an accelerated demand for capacity increase on what we have launched and also funny enough, what we have not launched yet, but where there is higher demand in the coming years. Overall, I see only acceleration in the EV booking and request for quotation second half versus first half. Luke Junk : Okay. And then my follow-up question -- several questions about the impact of current marketing conditions in terms of dispositions, which I understand. I want to flip it though and ask in terms of M&A, to what extent, if any, the volatility that we're seeing in equity markets right now, rising rates and all the things in the current environment, does that change the quality of assets available to you in the market? Does it change competition for deals? And does the Rhombus deal in particular signal anything different in this regard? Kevin Nowlan : Yes. I think generally speaking, if you think about the types of companies we look to acquire, they have -- they look generically like one of 2 companies, either one, a company that has a little bit more mature income statement. Or two, one that's in the infancy of its growth trajectory and still doesn't have much in the way of a P&L. Those businesses that have a more mature income statement are much more exposed to the current market environment and the inflationary environment that we're seeing.  And that creates a lot more uncertainty and due diligence about the ability to recover on some of those -- from customers, the pricing inflation issues that, that business is seeing, which sometimes can create a bid-ask spread between a buyer and seller until there's clarity and resolution around those topics. So those types of companies are a little bit harder to transact on in the current environment. And we saw that like we talked about last quarter, where we walked away from a particular transaction, we simply couldn't close the gap on some of those issues.  When you look at companies that are earlier in their growth trajectory, they're really focused on developing their technology, driving new business wins that come into the P&L and, say, '24, '25, '26, those are the types of companies that we're more apt to execute on in the near term given the environment. And that's a lot like Santroll, a lot like Rhombus, companies that have more of a profile of that. And on the margin, it's helped by the fact that because of the challenging capital markets, there -- it tends to be it's more limited options for those companies to secure capital to fund their growth objectives, whereas we have the ability to provide that kind of funding. So the strategic capital that we can bring to bear actually gives us a bit of an advantage in working with companies like that in this type of an environment. Operator : Our next question will come from Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets. Joseph Spak : Sorry, I just want to go back to charging, which I guess is the theme of the day, but you did have the installation in Italy and now the Rhombus acquisition. And you talked about how this is still a pretty fragmented segment. You talked about the importance of scale. I mean should we expect that this will be -- continue to be an area you look to build capabilities? Or do you think between what you have organically and what you're getting via this acquisition, that's enough to sort of really begin to scale in the 2 theaters, you mentioned North America and Europe? And also maybe if you could add like how much of the $3.7 billion do you expect to come from charging? Frederic Lissalde : So first, yes, you should expect us focusing on both organic and inorganic growth in this field of stationary charging, focusing on high-power DC fast charging. And the second question was the -- out of the $3.7 billion, we expect, I think, in my prepared remarks, it was about $150 million for Rhombus and overall, I think, $175 million to $200 million overall, including our organic exposure in these devices. Joseph Spak : Okay. And then secondarily, I'm just curious, Fred, if you could tell us sort of almost in real time what your conversations are like with your -- particularly with your European customers, and everyone's sort of had been concerned about energy shortages may be a little bit lesser than sort of at the peak, but how they are sort of planning for the balance of the year here, how you are preparing? And are you seeing any evidence of maybe moving some production into the third quarter or maybe fewer summer shutdowns to get ahead of what could be a more difficult winter? Frederic Lissalde : I think it's honestly too early to say. I have not been exposed to discussions along those lines. I think this will come when actually Europe comes back after the summer break. I would say early September -- end of August, early September, we know more about the profile of production around and in the winter. Operator : We have time for one final question, and that question comes from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Mark Delaney : A question on the EV business. And nice to see the momentum both in terms of the additional M&A as well as the organic bookings. When we start thinking about what that may mean for your prior comments for the EV business reaching breakeven, I believe, in the '23, '24 time frame, is there any change in when you think you may reach that breakeven when you consider some of these changes in terms of the M&A, organic revenue and also some of the OpEx comments you made? Kevin Nowlan : Yes. I think at this point, we're -- we haven't really updated that guidance, but I think it's fair to say it's in the same ZIP code as to where we were from a breakeven perspective. But there's a couple of key variables to keep an eye on. One is, as we continue to invest more in eProducts-related R&D that can become a headwind to that near-term breakeven. But on the other hand, as our EV revenue grows like we're seeing now $850 million, our expectation for the full year 2022, that gives us incremental contribution, which is a tailwind. So those are the 2 key variables to keep an eye on and how both of those items grow. But I think directionally, there's no real significant change in our outlook even though we're not going to provide a specific update today. Mark Delaney : That's helpful. My second was more conceptual on the pricing recoveries. And thanks for all the comments you already made around your expectations for net pricing this year. More high level, though, a lot of companies are trying to manage expenses more tightly given some of the macroeconomic risk that are out there. And are you seeing that all reflected in your ability to get net pricing? And is that potentially going to be harder to the extent some of the macroeconomic challenges do persist? Frederic Lissalde : We always focused on staying lean and looking at any room for cost reductions overall. And I think the actions that we've taken 2, 3 years ago really allows us to manage through this, right? And if you compute, we have about $100 million benefit this year from restructuring and cost reduction planning that we've started 2, 3 years ago. So I think we're doing that. It's part of what we do in the position of strength without compromising the long-term trajectory in E. And the -- we won't do anything that compromises this, and we're not going to constrain anyone within BorgWarner to grow in the field of battery elective vehicle. Patrick Nolan : Well, thank you all for your great questions today. Chelsea, you can go ahead and wrap up the call. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the BorgWarner 2022 Second Quarter Results Conference Call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BorgWarner 2022 Third Quarter Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Patrick Nolan, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Nolan, you may begin your conference. Patrick Nolan : Thank you, Shelby. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We issued our earnings release earlier this morning. It's posted on our Web site, borgwarner.com, on our homepage and on our Investor Relations home page. With regard to our IR calendar, we will be attending multiple conferences between now and our next earnings release. Please see the Events section of our IR page for a full list. Before we begin, I need to inform you that during this call, we may make forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties as detailed in our 10-K. Our actual results may differ significantly from the matters discussed today. During today's presentation, we will highlight certain non-GAAP measures in order to provide a clearer picture of how the core business performed, and for comparison purposes with prior periods. When you hear us say, on a comparable basis, that means, excluding the impact of FX, net M&A, and other non-comparable items. When you hear us say adjusted, that means excluding non-comparable items. When you hear us say organic, that means excluding the impact of FX and net M&A. We will also refer to our growth compared to our market. When you hear us say market, that means the change in light and commercial vehicle production weighted for our geographic exposure. Please note that we posted an earnings call presentation to the IR page of our Web site. We encourage you to follow along with these slides during our discussion. With that, I'm happy to turn the call over to Fred. Frederic Lissalde : Thank you, Pat, and good day, everyone. We're pleased to share our results for the third quarter 2022, and provide an overall company update, starting on slide five. I continue to be impressed with the strength of our revenue relative to the overall industry; with about $4.1 billion in sales, we were up over 29% organically. This is approximately 7% better than the year-over-year growth in industry production. This outperformance was in part supported by the execution of the pricing actions with our customers around the world. From a margin perspective, our performance was very strong in the quarter, and also benefited from our customer pricing. While navigating the near-term industry environment, we continued to take steps to drive our long-term positioning during this quarter. Year-to-date, we have repurchased $240 million of stock. During the third quarter, we announced the acquisition of the charging business of SSE, in China. And we secured new electrification program awards. Next, on slide six, I would like to discuss the acquisition of the charging business of SSE, which we announced last month. SSE will add a China presence to our existing European and North American footprint. So, we have now established global charging capability upon which to build. The SSE acquisition is expected to close in early 2023, so there will be no revenue impact in 2022. However, we now expect our total DC fast charging-related annual revenue to be in a range of $225 million to $275 million by 2025. Our charging strategy can be summarized in four points. One, our initial focus will be on high-value DC fast charging hardware enabling software and services. Two, our objective is to establish product leadership and competitiveness in this category. We will improve the chargers' quality that is key to enabling electric mobility. Also, over 50% of the different material in a DC fast charger is in components where BorgWarner has existing expertise and global scale. Three, we plan to leverage BorgWarner's regional sales capabilities and government interaction. And four, we want to explore potential sales synergies with our CV customers, and especially the customers buying our battery packs. As we look ahead, we believe you will see further success as we continue to strengthen our capabilities in the charging area. Now, let's look at some new electrification awards, on slide seven. First, BorgWarner will supply its integrated drive module to a leading Chinese automotive manufacturer. This marks the first time that we have supplied our iDM on a hybrid P4. And this is also the first time that this manufacturer has awarded this system to an external supplier. Importantly, this iDM is substantially similar to the iDM used in future EV-specific application which will drive additional scale benefits for this product. Second, BorgWarner will supply electric motors for the E-Axles of a European commercial vehicle OEM. This E-Axel is designed to equip new electric light commercial trucks ranging up to 7.5 tons. Production is expected to begin in early 2023. It will use our very modular HVH250 motors, and we can supply them in various stack length and winding configuration, either as fully assembled motors or as rotor/stator assemblies. Lastly, BorgWarner has been granted a production increase supply its 800 volt silicon carbide inventors for a premium European OEM. The initial order has now been significantly increased. The suitability of our product has been further endorsed by this uplift. Our power loss reducing silicon carbide inverter technology is helping our customer reach its strategic goals of a high-energy efficient drive train with exceptional electric driving range. Importantly, the increase of volumes to previously awarded programs is more and more becoming the new normal for many of our EV products. As you can see, we have made progress on key aspects of our Charging Forward strategy. So, let's look at what this means in the progress report, on slide eight, starting first with organic electric vehicle revenue growth. With the awards secured as of this goal, we now have electric vehicle programs that we believe will account for about $3.1 billion of booked revenue in 2025. Turning to M&A, we have now completed or announced four acquisitions since the start of Charging Forward, AKASOL, Santroll, Rhombus, and SSE. Based on our due diligence, we believe those businesses will generate $900 million of additional EV-related revenue in 2025. We're not done here though. We expect to take additional M&A steps and are actively engaged with several potential targets which could enhance various part of our EV portfolio. So, we are already on track to achieve about $4 billion of electric vehicle revenue by 2025 based on new business awards and actions announced to date. This is a great achievement by the BorgWarner teams, and a significant milestone for the company. And we believe it puts us well on our way towards our $4.5 billion EV revenue target for 2025. So, let me summarize our third quarter results and our outlook. Overall, our third quarter performance was strong. We delivered strong organic growth. We also made key progress in the quarter on the pricing actions with multiple customers. As Kevin will detail shortly, we have increased the low-end of our full-year 2022 outlook for both organic growth and margins based on our performance year-to-date, and our full-year EPS guide has also increased. Looking beyond this year, I'm very proud of the steady progress on Charging Forward, and extremely excited that we're now on track to achieve $4 billion in pure electric vehicle revenue by 2025. It is clear to me that our EV business is accelerating, but I expect more to come. We intend to carry on booking more new business across our vast portfolio. We expect to utilize our strong cash generation to acquire great assets, to become even strong as the world continues to accelerate towards electrification. And I look forward to sharing with you additional progress in the future. With that, let me turn the call over to Kevin. Kevin Nowlan : Thank you, Fred, and good morning, everyone. Before I dive into the financial details, I'm going to provide you the key takeaways coming out of our third quarter. First, we reported strong organic growth driven by customer pricing actions and industry volumes that were at the high end of our expectations going into the quarter. Second, our year-over-year margin performance benefited from normalized conversion on higher revenue and successful execution of our customer pricing actions. However, these benefits were partially mitigated by our planned increase in e-products R&D investment. Let's turn to slide nine for a look at our year-over-year revenue walk for Q3. After adjusting for the disposition of our Water Valley facility, last year's Q3 revenue was almost $3.4 billion. You can see that the strengthening U.S. dollars drove a year-over-year decrease in revenue of over 9% or approximately $320 million. Then, you can see the increase in our organic revenue about 29% year-over-year. That compares to a 22% increase in weighted average market production, which means we delivered another quarter of strong outperformance. The sum of all this was just under $4.1 billion of revenue in Q3. Turning to slide 10, you can see our earnings and cash flow performance for the quarter. Our third quarter adjusted operating income was $438 million or 10.8%, which compares to adjusted operating income of $336 million or 9.8% from a year ago. On a comparable basis, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and the impact of the Water Valley disposition, adjusted operating income increased $138 million on $990 million of higher sales. The biggest positive driver of this performance was that we converted at approximately 17% on our additional sales. But this conversion was partially offset by two things. First, we continued to execute on our planned increase in e-products R&D. In Q3, we increased these investments by $24 million relative to last year. Second, material cost inflation net of customer pricing recoveries was an $8 million year-over-year headwind in the quarter. Our adjusted EPS improved by $0.44 in the third quarter driven by the $138 million improvement in our adjusted operating income and a much lower effective tax rate that we have been experiencing in the last couple of years. This tax rate reduction was a driven by a favorable mix of earnings across taxing jurisdictions and the impacts of ongoing tax planning initiatives. And finally, free cash flow; we generated $167 million of positive free cash flow during the third quarter. Let's now turn to slide 11. We can see our perspective on global light vehicle industry production for 2022. As we can see our market assumptions incorporate a range of potential outcomes. However, we have incorporated several adjustments to prior assumption including a small decrease in the high end of the North American market, continued production increases in China as we expect third quarter strength to continue into Q4, and a further decrease in European production due to the market uncertainty associated with the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. As a result of these assumptions, we now expect our global weighted light and commercial vehicle markets to increase in the range of 3% to 4.5% this year, which is a bit narrower than the range underlined in our prior guidance. Now let's take a look at our full-year outlook on slide 12. First, it's important to note that our guidance assumes an expected full-year headwind from weaker foreign currencies of more than $1 billion. This represents an additional headwind of $230 million versus prior guidance. While the appreciation of the U.S. dollar is having a significant top line impact, remember that our strategy is generally to purchase and produce components in the same region as our customer. As a result, the impact of currencies in our guidance is predominantly translational in nature. Next as I previously mentioned, we expect our end markets to be up 3% to 4.5% for the year, which contributes to the organic net sales changes you see on the slide. But the much bigger impact on that line item is the continued revenue growth we expect to generate above growth in end market production. That's about $1.4 billion of our organic revenue growth or just over 9% growth above market. That current outlook for our outperformance is stronger than our prior outlook, primarily due to the impact of estimated pricing recoveries for material inflation, which we now estimate will contribute just under 4% of our growth for the full year. Finally, as it relates to our revenue outlook, the Santroll and Rhombus acquisitions are expected to cumulatively add $45 million to $55 million to 2022 revenue. Adding these items together, we're projecting total 2022 revenue to be slightly lower than before in the range of $15.4 to $15.7 billion. This slightly lower revenue outlook is being driven almost entirely by the additional FX headwinds. However, our expectation for organic growth is increased at 12% to 14% compared to our previous outlook of 11% to 14%. That is helping to mitigate the FX impact we're seeing. Switching to margin, we're updating our full year adjusted margin outlook to 10.0% to 10.2%, compared to our prior outlook of 9.8% to 10.2%. So, higher material costs inflation continues to negatively impact our financials, we're pleased with the progress we've made in negotiating recoveries of a portion of these costs from our customers. And that's helping mitigate the impact on our P&L. For the full year, we now expect net material cost inflation to negatively impact our results by $110 million to $120 million, which is lower than our previous expectation of $145 million to $155 million. As it relates to R&D investments, our guidance anticipates a $145 million to $150 million increase in e-products related R&D investment in 2022. Excluding the impact of net material cost inflation, and the increase in e-products related R&D investments. Our 2022 margin outlook contemplates the business delivering full year incremental in the high teens. We're now expecting full year adjusted EPS of $4.25 to $4.45 per diluted share. This is an increase from our prior guidance reflecting two things. First, we're expecting a lower full year tax rate of 25% down from our prior guidance of 27% driven by our expected mix of earnings and the benefits of tax planning initiatives we've been executing the last couple years. Second, we're benefiting a bit from the lower average share count, which is a result of the stock buyback we executed during the quarter. And finally, we continue to expect that we'll deliver free cash flow in the range of $650 million to $750 million for the full year. That's our 2022 outlook. So, let me summarize. Overall, we had a strong quarter. We delivered robust organic growth. Our margin performance was strong driven by incremental margin performance and successfully negotiated pricing recoveries with our customers. And we are increasing the midpoint of our EPS outlook for the full year driven by our strong year-to-date performance and a lower tax rate going forward. Year-to-date, we've taken a number of actions to drive our future profitable growth and to create value for our shareholders. We've continued our disciplined M&A with the completed acquisitions of Santroll and Rhombus, as well as the announced acquisition of SSE. We've returned more than $360 million of cash to our shareholders to our buybacks and dividends. And we've secured meaningful New Business Awards for electric vehicles across multiple parts of our portfolio. These awards have added more than $800 million to our booked electric vehicle revenue for 2025 compared to the same point last year. As a result of our bookings and M&A, we believe that we have already achieved an important milestone $4 million of secured EV revenue for 2025. We view this as a huge success for the company. But we've done all of this while still delivering on our near-term commitment, once again showing the balance that is the key to our ongoing success. With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Pat. Patrick Nolan : Thank you, Kevin. Shelby, we are ready to open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. I will take our first question from John Murphy with Bank of America. John Murphy : Good morning, guys, and thanks for the time this morning. A first question just around what's going on with customers on recoveries and settlements, and pricing, which is all kind of being put together in the same basket in discussions often from suppliers and automakers. But I'm just curious, as you're going through the process of getting recoveries, is some of this one-time in nature or do you think there's kind of a little bit of a paradigm shift here in what's going on with pricing with some of your customers or pass-throughs in the indexing? I'm just trying to understand if this is true-ups or is this a change in attitude going forward? And I think we've heard from some of the automakers, they didn't realize how much the volatility was impacting the suppliers, which is intriguing because they're in the middle of it. But they -- and some of this stuff was a result of making up for some of the inefficiencies around volatility. And then as schedules normalize, maybe these recoveries might not be as great going forward. So, what is your take on this? Frederic Lissalde : Hi, John. So, some of it is in price some of it is one-time. But it's true that when we negotiate and when we talk to our customers, they realize that this is a big hit, and that big hit may be to stay. So, I expect that, for 2023, we will have ongoing discussions with our customers around inflation. What's important is that we make sure that the nature of the recovery that we get from our customer base match pretty much the nature of the help that we giving to our supply base. And that will be our goal also going forward. Kevin Nowlan : And maybe, John, I'll just jump in and add on the one-time nature of certain elements of recoveries that we generated in the quarter. Included in that 10.8% margin that we posted was about a 40 basis point margin benefit arising from retroactive pricing recoveries partially offset by retroactive supplier costs. So, there was a little bit of a tailwind in the quarter, about 40 basis points coming from that in our margin. John Murphy : But that 40 basis point is the net of those two, Kevin, is that correct? Kevin Nowlan : That's the net of the two. John Murphy : Okay. And just really one quick follow-up, on slide eight, it looks like, as you've mentioned, you did $4 billion combined here versus the total target of $4.5 billion. So, you're overperforming on organic, and a little bit underperforming on M&A so far. Fred, as you think about this going forward, is it necessary to catch up on M&A or chase things if you're winning more and more on organic and it might get you to your total goal more on the organic side as opposed to the M&A side? Or is there something specifically on the technology side that might not be as associated with a dollar number here that you're trying to get to in M&A, instead of just bolstering that, the total revenue number? How do you think the balance of these two is really the key question? Frederic Lissalde : Yes, John. First, I would say that I'm very proud at where we are, 18 months into Charging Forward we're already 45% on our way into a five-year plan, so very proud of that. From an M&A perspective, what we are focusing on is building capabilities, product leadership, and scale from grid to wheel in this, that's the target. And so, we're not chasing a number, we're chasing that type of mindset really. John Murphy : Okay, that's helpful, thank you very much, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Noah Kaye : Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Next to the traction on those pricing recovery, just illustratively, how should we think about rollover benefits for 2023 at this point just given the timing of these actions seems reasonable to assume a couple points benefit for next year. Maybe you could comment on that. And I think, Fred, you mentioned that some of the recovery discussions would remain dynamic. So, maybe you can help us think about timing of potential further recoveries as we look over the coming quarters? Kevin Nowlan : Yes, I'll start. As it relates to 2023, as we look at 2022 and the recoveries and the costs that we've been incurring, if -- we don't have an expectation that we're going to ultimately fully offset all the costs that come into the P&L. We've been negotiating recoveries to defer a portion of those cost increases, a substantial portion, but not entirely. So, we're bearing some of that cost. So, as you look ahead to 2023, I wouldn't necessarily look there -- at there being a tailwind for our margin because we don't ultimately expect to offset all the cost increase that we're incurring in 2022. Noah Kaye : Right. I mean, the question is for the top line, that there'll be some benefit to the top line from those recoveries rolling over. Kevin Nowlan : Yes, I mean to the extent that those -- that the inflationary impacts continue as we head into 2023, and that pricing needs to stay in place to defray the continued inflationary costs, if that's where it goes, then we would expect to continue to generate that top line benefit within our revenue. If you just take a step back, if you look at our outgrowth for the year, we're delivering about 9% outgrowth underlying our guidance, a little bit north of 9%. And just under 4% of that is coming from these -- the customer pricing recoveries associated with material inflation costs, which means then we have five points or so of outgrowth coming from everything else. But that's the way to think about what's happening in 2022. And then you can make assumptions about how you expect the inflationary environment to play out in '23, and how that nearly 4% pricing would carry over. Noah Kaye : Right. And then just to clarify, Kevin, have your expectations of that material cost inflation changed relative to last quarter or are we still looking at the same number? Kevin Nowlan : They have. I think, last quarter, we were expecting that the contribution to our outgrowth from the pricing recoveries was closer to 3%. I think now we're suggesting in our guidance that the full-year impact of those pricing recoveries is a little bit under 4%. And that's part of the reason that you see in my remarks, that the net impact that we're now expect on a year from material cost inflation is down from our prior guide, it's $110 million to $120 million, which is a $35 million improvement from what we guided to last quarter. And it's being driven by improved customer pricing actions. Noah Kaye : All right, great, and nice to see that improving. And then, I guess, sort of shifting to, Fred, some of your commentary around the management of the portfolio and how you view M&A. That certainly makes sense on a high level, strategically. I'm curious to know what the tenor and the -- like the activity within the pipeline is like at this point? Obviously, there's still a volatile production environment and lots of challenges for nascent EV businesses. But maybe you can talk a little bit about the depth and kind of the actionability of the pipeline at this point? Frederic Lissalde : Right. It's very active. We are engaged with a certain number of companies as targets, still focusing on the same things, again scale on products from grid to wheel, product leadership which -- and I mean by that, essentially, around efficiency of moving electrons across that grid to wheel, and potentially new products too in the field of EV. So, it's pretty active. Noah Kaye : Terrific, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Colin Langan with Wells Fargo. Colin Langan : Great, thanks for taking my questions. You mentioned, at the midpoint, the inflationary costs were down about $35 million. If I look at operating margins, the outlook for the year is still fairly flat, looks like sales down just a bit at the midpoint of guidance. What is offsetting that underlying $35 million of good news? Kevin Nowlan : Well, I think it depends when you look at the guide. I mean, if you look at the top end of our guide, one of the things to keep in mind is we took industry production down, and so that has an impact on organic growth in the high end of our guidance range. And then at the low end of our guidance range, as you look at Q4, that it's actually not being offset, it's really flowing through that $35 million benefit, which is why we raised the bottom end from 9.8% to 10%. Colin Langan : Okay. And then as I look into the implied guidance implies sort of a sales decline into Q4. Again, I think like IHS has light vehicle production up. Are you not seeing the market up, is it just FX that's washing all that out, is it commercial offsetting some of that, what's causing the softness into Q4? Kevin Nowlan : Yes, sequentially going into Q4, we do have an almost $90 million FX headwind Q3 to Q4. So, that is a big piece of what's impacting revenue. And then the range of outlook that we have going from basically with underlying our $15.4 billion to $15.7 billion revenue guide is at the lower end and at the midpoint some pressure on organic growth. Sequentially that is. Colin Langan : Got it. And then just lastly, the 110 to 120 impact, how was in Q3? And how much would be less for Q4 as headwind, so we can model that? Thanks. Kevin Nowlan : We didn't break that out in terms of Q3 and Q4. But because of the nature of some the retroactive recoveries on a net basis that we generated in Q3, it really mitigated the impact on Q3 relative to the other quarters that we have seen. So, in Q3 we had a negative $8 million impact. I think as we looked at Q4, it's on a year-over-year basis a little bit larger because we don't expect the same size of retroactive-related benefits of what we got in Q3. Colin Langan : Got it. Thank you very much for taking my questions. Operator : Your next question comes from Chris McNally with Evercore. Chris McNally : Thanks so much guys. Maybe we could start on actually some of the ICE products. In particularly, the margins, the revenue, the fuel injection aftermarket has been quite good. And we haven't really discussed sort of individual segment margins some of them are new. Maybe you could talk about some of the strength you have been seeing and ways to think about some of the segment margins for fuel injection or aftermarket on a go-forward basis? Frederic Lissalde : Chris, I think the team has done a formidable job right after the closing of the Delphi transaction to turn this business around. Should look back the fuel system margins that we took the business at and what it is now, it's been pretty good both on the fuel system side and aftermarket as well. Chris McNally : Perfect. And then anything -- is there any extraordinaries in sort of some of the margins we are seeing Q3 in terms of the some of the benefits on onetime price recovery? We are just trying to trend it out. It has been pretty variable on a margin perspective over the first three quarters. So, just anything qualitative on just the rate of margin here, what sort of normalized? Kevin Nowlan : Yes, I mean I think it's hard to compare on quarter-to-quarter this year because there has been such volatility. Q2 obviously we were pretty significantly impacted by the combination of revenue being relatively low as well as material cost inflation and the recoveries haven't entirely been kicking in yet. As you go to Q3, you see obviously we delivered over $4 billion of revenue in the quarter and a strong level of customer recoveries. And so, you are seeing a lot of swings quarter to quarter right now in this volatile environment. And that's really pushing through the segments as well. So, I think that's why you look in Q2 going to Q3 you saw air management up quite a bit. You saw fuel systems up quite a bit as well. And I think it's really function of what we are seeing from both the revenue and cost recovery perspective. Chris McNally : Okay, great, super helpful. And then if we move to the EV outlook and then obviously the $4 billion -- I really appreciate the consistency as you guys are updating. In terms of the methodology as we see global EV volumes increasing, can you just talk about how often you're marking to market sort of the 24-25 assumptions on base business? Is that something that's done on quarterly basis or yearly? Just curious when you are booking the business obviously projections go up if that's a benefit? And then just a second, anything you could add on what you are seeing in Europe for EV outlook maybe next year? Frederic Lissalde : So, the way we compute those EV wins is we look at the individual businesses, the volume that we are booking the business at. We sometime apply some market intelligence adjustments and that's how we are monitoring the 2025 organic revenue bookings. As far as your second question around Europe, I would say overall EV is accelerating. And we can see that in the marketplace. We can see that with the intensity with which we are discussing with our customers and we can see that with our business too. And that also applies for Europe, and very happy to see our growth in EV being across the three continents and also across a pretty sizable product portfolio. Chris McNally : Okay. Thanks much guys. Operator : Your next question comes from Luke Junk with Baird. Luke Junk : Thank you for taking the question. I apologize, if just said this in the prepared comments, I had to log on late here, but just wondering first question regarding the granting of increased production on the inverter award that you disclosed this quarter, to possibly give us a better feel of how widespread this sort of activity might be going forward? Especially thinking relative to the 2025 Organic EV awards that you've booked already? Are we talking tens of millions, or maybe even hundreds of millions of potential upside from these sorts of activities? Frederic Lissalde : Yes, it is. I won't quantify that. But it's sizable and I would say that this is not a one-off. There is a lot of discussions with uplifting volumes. And I would say that, one thing that it's important is that the scale that we have in electronics and in power electronics, in both purchasing and manufacturing, electronics and power electronics, allows us to offer our customers specific supply chains that are not are not intertwined. And so and so, I think this is a very, very good success for us. It enforces the fact that we have great products, great efficiency, and also that resiliency of our supply chain is something that our customers have trust in. Luke Junk : Okay. That's helpful. And then it kind of leads into my second question on the E-Axle award, so you said in the release that this can scale up to seven and a half ton trucks. I'm wondering, was that the customer's specific need, or could you've scale that up to even larger trucks with your current portfolio? And then related question, bigger pictures wondering how important scale is in the e-motor business as it relates to pursuing commercial vehicle opportunities? Can you leverage your scale in light vehicle as you go into that world and you clearly very important in color electronics, just learning how transferable that would be in commercial vehicle as well, any modern thinking? Frederic Lissalde : Yes, no, for sure our motors can go above seven and a half tons. And this came from the customer's specification on all this can go much higher than that. And yes, the answer to your second question is absolutely yes. Scale matters in CV for product leadership, but also competitiveness. This is a strategy that has been applied for one or for many, many years, where we have numerous products that cut across fast car, and commercial vehicle. We learn from both segments, and we can offer our commerce commercial vehicle customers, products that one fit for their function, but also our competitive because we have that scale. Luke Junk : I will leave it there. Thank you. Frederic Lissalde : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from David Kelley with Jefferies. Gavin Kennedy : Hi, team. This is Gavin Kennedy on for David Kelley. First question, can you just remind us of your disposition strategy? I believe prior expectations were for $3.5 billion in targeted dispositions by 2025? Kevin Nowlan : Yes, we're still that's still part of our charging for a plan. As I mentioned last quarter, that challenging, and market environments really disrupted those potential disposition processes in the short-term. And that's really due to two things. The uncertainty and industry production and the inflationary impacts and how those are going to play out impacts potential buyers and those types of businesses in the near term. And second, there're obviously challenges in the capital markets and the financing markets more generally. So, those things have really slowed down our ability to transact over the last couple quarters. But it doesn't change the direction where we're headed over time here. But that pause is okay, because as you know, we have a lot of high quality cash flow generating assets in our portfolio. So, we're not under pressure at all to sell anything. And we're perfectly content to continue to generate the benefits of the cash flows from those businesses, and then assess those as the market situation improves to look at reengaging in some of those disposition processes to make sure that we deliver a disposition that's going to generate appropriate value for our shareholders. But until the markets clear up from that, we're perfectly content to continue to generate strong cash flows from these businesses. Gavin Kennedy : Got it? That makes sense. And then as a follow up switching gears, you raise your DC fast charging expectations to $225 million to $275 million by 2025, which is good to see. Can you give us any commentary on margins today, and expectations for margins going forward as these charging businesses scale? Thank you. Kevin Nowlan : We're not giving margin guidance yet as it relates to any of the specific acquisitions. But I think the strategy of BorgWarner and establishing product leadership as we get into different product categories and driving top quartile margin performance as a company over time. And so you should expect that as we get into any of these product lines, that the expectations for what we ultimately deliver financially on those products, is the same as what we expect to deliver from all parts of our business. Gavin Kennedy : Great. Thanks, everyone. Operator : Your next question comes from James Picariello with BNP Paribas Exane. James Picariello : I guess I wanted to ask about AKASOL noted as a growth driver in Europe. And while we first ask about the revenue trajectory, maybe just any color relative to the targets that you laid out for AKASOL then also as it relates to IRA in the battery, the battery pack assembly credit, is there an opportunity for AKASOL to benefit at least from the 10 kilowatt hour, 10 megawatt per kilowatt hour portion of that subsidy in the U.S.? Frederic Lissalde : James, we get a lot of good customer tool for battery packs, and from AKASOL. We are increasing year-over-year about 200 million from '21 to '22. And we're pretty confident that this business is going to -- is going to grow to plan. We have the right technology. We are going to expand AKASOL. We are actually expanding AKASOL as we speak in North America. And this is -- these products really are answering a lot of our customers' questions and feeding a lot of their needs. Kevin, do you want to take the IRA question? Kevin Nowlan : Yes, I mean, we think there's a real opportunity for us to benefit from the IRA as we continue to invest to increase our capacity and manufacturing capability in the U.S. So, we'll continue to look at the opportunities afforded by the Inflation Reduction Act and see what opportunities are afforded to us. But we think there's a real opportunity there. James Picariello : And AKASOL has somewhat of a U.S. footprint right, there's at least one facility, I believe. Kevin Nowlan : Yes, there is one facility in the U.S. right now in Michigan. And we're looking at extending the U.S. footprint, actually, as we speak. James Picariello : Got it, understood. And then, for China, the industry production obviously picked up pretty dramatically in the third quarter. It appears that there's some customer mix, normalization of programs. Just curious is it tied to one or two important customers in China? And is there a path? Is this something that's a sustainable, a sustained dynamic or something that could revert to the positive figures in terms of trying to production in your mix there? Frederic Lissalde : I'm not sure I have that granularity for you, James, at this point. Maybe Pat can follow-up with you offline? I don't know if that's going right for the Chinese country. James Picariello : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank. Emmanuel Rosner : Thank you very much and would now apologize again for joining the call later with some of this was discussed before I apologize, but I was curious if you could give us sort of a high level walk of search quarter through in place fourth quarter outlook, it looks like you basically going for the lower revenues, but also in the lower margins. And so, just if you could just discuss some of the puts and takes there? Kevin Nowlan : Were you saying both outgrowth and margin, Emmanuel, is that what you said or just -- [multiple speakers]\u2026 Emmanuel Rosner : Yes, revenue and margin. Kevin Nowlan : Revenue and margin going Q3 to Q4, I think as you look -- let me start with revenue. As you go from Q3 to Q4 and you look at the range, the $300 million range we're providing on revenue. At the upper-end of that range we have -- you see revenue a little bit down, and that's really driven entirely by foreign exchange, it's about a $90 million headwind going sequentially from Q3 to Q4. If you look at the low end of the range, we're still assuming about that $90 million foreign exchange related headwind, but then there's about $280 million sequential headwind in organic growth. So, that's the way to think about revenue going Q3 to Q4. When you look at margin, you've got to start by looking at Q3, that 10.8%. And remember my comments earlier, there's about 40 basis points of that margin coming from the net benefit of retroactive customer pricing recoveries net of the retroactive supplier cost increases. So, that's about a 40 basis point tailwind in Q3. So, as you then adjust Q3 and look ahead to Q4, say Q4 at the high end of our guide is relatively flat, maybe slightly up from that adjusted level. And if you look at the low end of our guide, which is around 9.5% or so in Q4, it's really jumping off that adjusted Q3 level, and then recognizing that we have downside conversion on that, roughly, $280 million organic decline sequentially. And that's how you really get to the math of it. Emmanuel Rosner : And the $280 million headwind sequentially itself, could you please just provide a little bit more color, and again, apologies if I missed it? Kevin Nowlan : I'm sorry the -- that what's really driving the sequential is the production assumptions that are underlying the guide. And we saw at the low end of the range, you can see that production is down sequentially going from Q3 to Q4. Frederic Lissalde : And I think it represents the volatility that still exists in this marketplace, Emmanuel. And especially, I would say in Q4, especially in Europe with everything that is happening. So, taking in consideration also in our Q4 top line guide, which is a little wider than usual, but it represents the market environment. Kevin Nowlan : Yes, so if you're looking at like IHS as an example, our Q4, at the low end of the range, is almost a million units below IHS from a light vehicle perspective, globally. Emmanuel Rosner : Okay, that's helpful. And then just about your free cash flow use priorities in the current environment, you obviously mentioned that disruptive environments for dispositions, I assume that some of it applies to acquisitions as well. So, is this the kind of environment where return to shareholders will be prioritized or would you'd rather -- positive drive for future uses on the M&A side? Kevin Nowlan : Yes, I mean you can obviously see we've been deploying cash really for -- in a couple different ways over the course of 2022. We've been executing on our acquisition strategy, as we've communicated, as part of Charging Forward with the deals that we've done to date, this year. And we've also been repurchasing stock as well, $100 million in the quarter, which means it's $240 million year-to-date. And so, we've been pleased with deploying cash to support both of those objectives. While we continue to assess the right moments to be opportunistic in buying back our stock, I'd say, as you look ahead, I want to continue to emphasis what we've been emphasizing in prior quarters, that investing in attractive electrification opportunities, including M&A, is really the near-term priority for our uses of capital. That's what we're going to focus it as a priority. Emmanuel Rosner : All right, thank you. Operator : We have time for one final question, and that question comes from Joe Spak with RBC Capital Markets. Joe Spak : Thanks so much for squeezing me in, everyone. Fred, maybe just, first, to go back to some of your comments on IRA, the expansion of AKASOL in the U.S. or the potential expansion, is that sort of a BorgWarner initiative or is that something being driven by customer demand asking you to sort of help build that out? And then also, I know like the IRA Bill sort of talks about inverters really more in a solar sense. But we've heard that there's some -- and I guess we'll wait for a treasury ruling, but we've heard there's some talk that maybe that could apply for vehicles as well. So, do you think there's any opportunity in that bill from inverters or even charging hardware? Frederic Lissalde : Yes, Joe, first, the expansion in the U.S. is definitely driven by programs secured with the customers that we've -- that the customers that we've had when we acquired AKASOL, plus new customers that we've announced over the past quarters. Kevin, do you want to take this? Kevin Nowlan : Yes, in terms of the question about inverter, I think based on our read of the legislation to date and our understanding of it; it doesn't apply to the inverters for automotive. I think the opportunity for us as it relates to IRA is really more around battery modules and battery packs. And so, we're assessing that as we're looking to increase our manufacturing footprint, here in the U.S., to support our customer demands. Joe Spak : Would you consider inverters for solar applications or it's sort of a different competency? Frederic Lissalde : They are slightly different, but not dramatically different. Actually, as part of our acquisition of SSE, as part of some charging integration that they do, they include solar battery pack and chargers. And that might be something we look at. I would tell you that it's not currently the priority but, in the future, that might be a nice diversification going forward based on the current technology. Joe Spak : Okay. And then, I guess, finally, you've talked about the sort of overall enterprise-level R&D and highlight, I guess, some of the changes there. I was wondering though if -- I mean, it seems to me, but correct me if I'm wrong, that like that sort of predominantly centered in that E-Propulsion & Drivetrain segment. And I was wondering if you could give us a sense of like how much of a basis point drag has that additional or step-up investment weighed specifically in that segment? Kevin Nowlan : Yes, I mean if you look at the -- you're right; the eProducts-related R&D is disproportionately in the E-Propulsion & Drivetrain segment. And so, when you look at our eProducts investment to date, it's been over $300 million, and for the full-year it'll be over $400 million. And the bulk of that is really coming in that segment, and so that -- you can really see the impact that that's had on the margin of that business. Now, as we look at ahead to 2023, we would expect that as our EV revenue is growing, that we would expect the contributions margins on that growth in EV revenue to be growing at a faster pace than our eProducts-related R&D. And so, we'll start to get some improvement in margin in that segment as that contribution grows at a faster pace than that eProducts-related R&D. Joe Spak : And that R&D, Kevin, is really -- it's sort of engineering ahead of launch or is it sort of some more like truly like research-type for future product, like how should we think about how quickly you guys start to get a return on that investment? Frederic Lissalde : It is definitely application engineering and engineering for launch that business that we have booked, or engineering for businesses that we are at the verge of booking. Joe Spak : Okay, thank you so much. Patrick Nolan : And I would like to thank you all for your questions today. Shelby, you can go ahead and conclude the call.

So we have issued our press release earlier this morning. It's posted on our website, borgwarner.com, on our homepage and on our Investor Relations home page.  Before we begin, I to inform in joining this call, we may make forward-looking statements which involves risks and uncertainties as detailed in our 10-K. Our actual results may differ significantly from the matters discussed today. During today's presentation, we will highlight certain non-GAAP measures in order to provide a clearer picture of how the core business performed and for comparison purposes with prior period.  When you hear us say on a comparable basis, that is excluding the impact of FX, net M&A and other noncomparable items. And here say adjusted that means excluding noncomparable items. When you hear us say organic, that means excluding the impact of FX and net M&A. We also refer to our growth compared to on market. when he say market, that means the change in light vehicle and commercial vehicle production weighted for our geographic exposure. Please note that we've posted an earnings call presentation to the IR page of our website. We encourage you to follow along with these slides during our discussion.  With that, I'm happy to turn the call over to Fred. Frederic Lissalde : Thank you, Pat, and good morning, everyone. I have a bit of an allergic reaction this morning impacting my speech. So Kevin will cover the prepared remarks. I'll stay with you and answer the questions. Kevin? Kevin Nowlan : All right. Thanks, Fred, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to share our results for 2022 and provide an overall company update, starting on Slide 5.  We continue to be very proud of the strength of our sales relative to the overall industry. With about $15.8 billion in sales, we were up approximately 14% compared to our market, which was up a little less than 4%. Importantly, our BEV-related sales contributed meaningfully to this growth. We're also pleased with our solid margin performance, which we delivered despite the significant production volatility and inflationary headwinds that we faced during 2022.  This performance was achieved while continuing to significantly increase our R&D investment to support the continued growth in our e-product portfolio.  We also delivered record free cash flow which allowed us to continue to make inorganic investments that support our future while at the same time returning cash to our shareholders. Beyond our near-term results, we continue to drive our long-term positioning during the quarter. We took several leading steps in our sustainability efforts. I'll detail those more in just a moment. We made a significant advancement in charging forward with the announcement of the planned separation of the Fuel Systems and Aftermarket segments. And we also secured multiple new electrification program awards since our last earnings report.  Next, on Slide 6, I'd like to give you more color with respect to our progress in our SBTi targets. In mid-December, BorgWarner announced its commitment to reduce its absolute Scope 3 emissions by at least 25% by 2031 from a 2021 baseline. The Scope 3 target along with our previously announced target to achieve 85% absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions reductions by 2030 was formally submitted for validation to SBTi. These science-based targets align with charging forward or accelerated path through electrification by aiming to achieve a net 0 carbon emission future for all. We've made some meaningful progress in 2022 toward achieving our Scope 1 and 2 emissions targets as we had tied employee bonus opportunities across our global operations to reducing energy intensity while also promoting energy management certification and the procurement of renewable energy. To meet the Scope 3 target, BorgWarner intends to focus its efforts on a number of actions including transitioning the product portfolio to electrification, increasing content of recyclable remanufactured material, reducing product weight and driving sustainable raw material selection. We'll also be working with our supply base to do the same. Next, on Slide 7, I'd like to summarize the planned separation of our fuel systems and aftermarket segments, which we refer to as NewCo. We announced this planned separation in December as we believe that now is the right time to separate these businesses and unlock shareholder value. For NewCo, we've driven significant margin improvement over the last couple of years despite the challenging industry environment. From a product leadership standpoint, we solidified NewCo's position in the commercial vehicle segment, including with hydrogen injection in the passenger car segment with our cutting-edge GDI technologies and in the aftermarket business. We believe these things position NewCo well for success as a stand-alone public company. For BorgWarner, we believe the intended separation accelerates our Charging Forward strategy and focuses all of our energy towards electrified propulsion. It enhances all of our management attention, our focus and our flexibility to pursue attractive EV investments and supports our vision of a clean, energy-efficient world. The intended separation will allow each company to pursue its own strategies with an overarching focus on maximizing the value opportunity for our shareholders. The teams are progressing well through the various work streams and we plan to provide updates as appropriate. We continue to expect the intended separation to close in late 2023. Now let's look at some new electrification awards on Slide 8. First, BorgWarner will supply a major German vehicle manufacturer with innovative battery cooling plates for the OEM's next-generation electric vehicles in Europe and the United States. This is our first award for this new organically developed product with an expected launch in 2025. Compared to alternative solutions, the BorgWarner cooling places provide greater cooling capacity within a smaller installation space as well as reduced weight and cost. We believe that as a global market leader in exhaust gas recirculation cooler technology BorgWarner's expertise and thermal management and the associated manufacturing processes positions the company to be an ideal pioneer of new developments for the battery cooling market. On the right side of the slide, you can see that we're announcing a sizable expansion of our silicon carbide inverter business with a top global OEM with an 800-volt award. After partnering with this car manufacturing on a 400-volt inverter product, we're now being sourced to launch two new 800-volt variants in 2025, 250 kilowatts for an all-wheel drive crossover utility vehicle and a 350-kilowatt module for the OEMs performance vehicles. This expanded business strengthens our position as one of the strategic inverter suppliers for this long-standing customer as that customer transitions to the next phase of its BEV strategy. As you can see, we've made further progress toward our charging forward objectives.  So let's look at what this means in our progress report on Slide 9. Starting first with organic electric vehicle sales growth. With the awards secured as of this call, we now have pure BEV programs that we estimate accounts for about $3 billion of booked sales in 2025. Of note, this estimate reflects about a $150 million headwind versus our prior disclosure, stemming from an update to reflect the FX rates underlying our 2023 guidance. This FX headwind was partially offset by the new business wins I discussed on the prior slide.  Turning to M&A. We've now completed or announced 5 acquisitions since the start of Charging Forward; Akasol, Santroll, Rhombus, SSE and Drivetek. Based on our due diligence, we believe those businesses will generate about $1.3 billion of EV-related sales in 2025. This is higher than our previous outlook based on our revised projections for Akasol, which is seeing a faster ramp-up in sales than we initially anticipated. But we're not done here. We continue to expect that we'll execute additional acquisitions and are actively engaged with a handful of potential targets that we think will enhance various parts of our EV portfolio. And finally, the planned separation of NewCo will address the third pillar of charging forward for which we set an original goal to complete about $3.5 billion in dispositions by 2025. With all that we've accomplished in the last couple of years, we believe we're already on track to achieve about $4.3 billion of pure electric vehicle sales in 2025 and we believe it puts us within striking distance of our $4.5 billion EV sales target for 2025.  Now let's move into the financials, starting on Slide 10 for a look at our year-over-year revenue walk for Q4. After adjusting for the disposition of our Water Valley facility, last year's Q4 revenue was just over $3.6 billion. You can see that the strengthening US dollar drove a year-over-year decrease in revenue of over 8% or approximately $307 million. Then you can see the increase in our organic revenue about 21% year-over-year. That compares to a less than 1% increase in weighted average market production, which means we delivered another quarter of strong outperformance. The sum of all this was just over $4.1 billion of revenue in Q4, a strong finish to the year.  Turning to Slide 11. You can see our earnings and cash flow performance for the quarter. Our fourth quarter adjusted operating income was $428 million, equating to a 10.4% margin. That compares to adjusted operating income of $398 million or 10.9% from a year ago. On a comparable basis, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and the impact of M&A, adjusted operating income increased $74 million on $769 million of higher sales. The biggest positive driver of this performance was that we converted at approximately 15% on our additional sales. But this conversion was partially offset by our planned increase in e-products R&D. In Q4, we increased these R&D investments by $38 million relative to last year.  Our adjusted EPS improved by $0.20 in the fourth quarter driven by the improvement in our adjusted operating income and a nearly 400 basis points lower year-over-year tax rate. That lower tax rate was driven by a favorable mix of earnings across taxing jurisdictions, qualifying for more favorable tax rates in certain jurisdictions and the impact of ongoing tax structuring initiatives, all of which we believe should contribute to a lower tax rate going forward than what we've experienced over the last few years. And finally, free cash flow. We generated $670 million plus of positive free cash flow during Q4. The year-over-year increase was driven by 3 things : the improvement in operating income, the timing of collection of a meaningful amount of inflationary price recoveries from our customers and the nonrecurrence of a onetime $130 million warranty payment to a customer last year.  Let's now turn to Slide 12, where you can see our perspective on global industry production for 2023. When you look at this slide, you can see that our market assumptions continue to contemplate the types of macro uncertainty we've been experiencing over the last few years. With that background in mind, we expect our global weighted light and commercial vehicle markets to be flat to up 3% this year. Looking at this by region, we're planning for our weighted North American markets to be up about 2% to 5%. In Europe, we expect our blended market to be up 1% to down 2% year-over-year. And in China, we expect the overall market to be roughly flat to up 3%.  Now let's take a look at our full year outlook on Slide 13. First, it's important to note that our guidance assumes an expected full year headwind from weaker foreign currencies of $285 million. Second, as I previously mentioned, we expect our end markets to be flat to up 3% for the year, which contributes to the organic net sales change you see on the slide. But more important than that slight growth in end markets, we expect our revenue to continue to grow well in excess of industry production driven by new business launches and higher electric vehicle revenue. In fact, in 2023, we're expecting to deliver between $1.5 billion and $1.8 billion in EV revenue which is up significantly from the $870 million we generated in 2022.  Finally, the Santroll and Rhombus acquisitions are expected to add approximately $35 million to 2023 revenue. Based on these assumptions, we're projecting total 2023 revenue in the range of $16.7 billion to $17.5 billion, which equates to organic growth of approximately 7% to 12%.  Switching to margin. We expect our full year adjusted operating margin to be in the range of 10.0% to 10.4% compared to our 2022 margin of 10.1%. We do expect some variation in the margin level across the quarters in 2023. Specifically, we believe that Q1 is likely to be the weakest reported margin during the year. as we work with our customers and suppliers on finalizing the extent to which inflationary pricing actions negotiated in 2022 carry over into 2023.  In the end, our current expectations are that the year-over-year impact of inflationary pressures on full year margins is likely to be negligible. However, we could see some negative impact in Q1.  As it relates to R&D, our full year 2023 guidance anticipates a $60 million to $70 million increase in e products-related R&D investment. With our continued success securing new electrified business wins, we're continuing to lean forward and invest more in R&D to support our eProducts portfolio. But importantly, as you see on the slide, the year-over-year increase in 2023 is expected to be lower than the year-over-year increase in 2022. Excluding the impact of this increase in eProducts related to R&D, our 2023 margin outlook contemplates the business delivering full year incrementals in the mid-teens, which we view as a solid conversion given the amount of product launches and ramp-ups occurring this year. Based on this revenue and margin outlook, we're expecting full year adjusted EPS of $4.50 to $5 per diluted share. This EPS guidance contemplates two slight headwinds relative to 2022. First, we expect an effective tax rate of approximately 25%, up a couple of percentage points relative to last year. However, that rate remains far lower than what we've experienced in recent years, and we think it's a rate that's likely to be sustainable on a go-forward basis. Second, our EPS guidance assumes a $0.13 per share negative impact coming from higher net pension expense as a result of higher discount rates. Turning to free cash flow. We expect it will deliver free cash flow in the range of $550 million to $650 million for the full year. This cash flow outlook includes a onetime cash cost of approximately $150 million related to the intended spin-off of our Fuel Systems and Aftermarket businesses, arising from outside adviser fees, cash tax payments to facilitate the separation and IT costs to create a stand-alone IT environment for NewCo. Excluding these onetime costs, our cash flow guidance would be $700 million to $800 million which is only slightly lower than the record free cash flow of $846 million we generated in 2022. That's our 2023 outlook. So let me summarize this morning's remarks. Overall, we delivered strong performance in 2022 despite a volatile end market environment and significant inflation headwinds. In the face of this environment, we outgrew the market significantly. We maintained our adjusted operating margins above 10% by delivering incremental margins on our higher sales and successfully completing commercial negotiations with our customers. while also investing $150 million more in R&D to support the future growth of our e-business. And finally, we delivered a record year of free cash flow.  As we continue to successfully manage the present, we were also continuing to successfully deliver on the future by making significant progress on our charging forward plan. Now as we look ahead to 2023, we'll be keenly focused on continuing to manage the present by sustaining strong high single-digit revenue outperformance compared to industry volumes and driving conversion on this revenue growth, successfully executing the intended spin-off of our Fuel Systems and Aftermarket businesses, and continuing to make disciplined investments, both organic and inorganic, that will help secure our growth and financial strength long into the future.  With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Pat. Patrick Nolan : Thank you, Kevin. Operator, we're ready to open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Colin Langan with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Colin Langan : Just a little follow-up on the comments on inflationary costs. I think you said the guidance implies a negligible impact. I mean so far, it seems like other suppliers have kind of guided to pretty large headwinds. And particularly around labor. Any color on the underlying growth impact that you're expecting that you'll need to get price concessions to offset? And any color why you're not seeing as big of a factor are the suppliers is just the business structure or some other benefits? Kevin Nowlan : Yes. I think our expectation right now is that we're going to continue to manage inflationary levels at the way we exited 2022. So to the extent that we continue to see elevated levels of inflation from the supply base, we would expect to continue to maintain the pricing in place with our customers on a go-forward basis to mitigate that. So that's really what's underlying the guidance. Colin Langan : And based on your comments, it sounds like you're really just renegotiating what you've gotten last year? Or are you seeing more increases in the [indiscernible] these costs this year too or no? Kevin Nowlan : I think we're expecting that we're going to enter the year and the focus of the negotiations last year was really about how we are 2022, and then we essentially align with the customer base that we would look ahead to 2023 as we were entering the new year and see what types of pricing levels were appropriate to continue to mitigate those impacts. And so as you can imagine, we'll have those discussions here as we enter the new year about the pricing and cost environment. Colin Langan : Got it. And your outlook based on your market guidance, it looks like it's about 8% over market. And I believe you used to historically talk about more 4% to 5%. So what's driving the strong growth over market this year? Is that sustainable? How should we think about it going forward? Frederic Lissalde : Yes, Colin, the outgrowth next year is -- you're right around midpoint of 8%, and we're very proud of that. About 2/3 of it is be products and other products for plug-in hybrids. So next year, we'll be between $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion of fuel BEV revenue which is approaching 10% of our revenue. I'm very proud about this acceleration. Colin Langan : And is there anything onetime in nature in the growth for this year? Frederic Lissalde : Not at all. This confirms that we are on track, marching towards our target of $4.5 billion of fuel BEV revenue in 2025. And you see a 2x increase this year versus prior year, and that's pretty much part of the plan. Operator : We'll take our next question from Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank. Emmanuel Rosner : I was hoping you could give us a little bit more color around the year-over-year walk and puts and takes in terms of your margin outlook. And as you mentioned yourself, the at midpoint, it's basically just slightly better than flat sort of like operating margin despite what seems to be incredibly strong organic growth and I guess growth overall. I understand the R&D, so that going up a bit, but anything else going on? And then can you just maybe talk about R&D overall? Like are you offsetting some of that R&D increase by cutting back on R&D? Or is that sort of like how much the full R&D will be going up by? Kevin Nowlan : Yes. The walk going from 2022 to 2023 is fairly simple. It's really -- as we look at that organic net sales change, we're converting on that effectively in the mid-teens, call it in that 15%, 16% range. But then we're also investing incrementally in eProducts-related R&D of about $60 million to $70 million on a year-over-year basis, which is what brings the overall conversion down and shows only then a slight improvement in our margin profile on a year-over-year basis. But we're pretty pleased with that mid-teens conversion given that the bulk of the revenue growth we're seeing in 2023 is really related to product launches and ramp up, not recovery in end markets. And so with some of the start-up costs you see there, we're pretty pleased with that performance. Fred, do you want to comment on the R&D? Frederic Lissalde : R&D side, as Kevin mentioned, we expect to be up again this year year-over-year. We're also looking at a lot of R&D efficiency on the combustion side. And I think we expect that long -- midterm the R&D is going to stay between 5% and 5.5% of revenue, working in not constraining the growth but also making sure that we're doing the right thing on the foundation and products. Emmanuel Rosner : Okay. And then following up on this then. So is this year within this range as well the total R&D 5% to 5.5%. And I guess in the past, you've sort of spoken about the tail end of 2023 is sort of like being this turning point where sort of like your EV business is essentially breakeven or getting profitable is fully loaded as you have enough revenue scale to sort of like match the size of this R&D. Is that still the case? Or will these additional investment, does that push out the time line a bit? Kevin Nowlan : A couple of things on the on the question about R&D, they were really only guiding at the moment to the eProducts-elated R&D, which we are seeing an increase in investment that we're choosing to make of $60 million to $70 million. the overall R&D budget, I'll say, the foundational R&D is just being managed in totality with the way that we manage the profitability of those foundational businesses. As it relates to EV, the trajectory of profitability. As you see the growth that we're generating this year and the incremental margin that we're generating on that revenue growth this year, 2/3 of which comes from our eProduct portfolio you can see that the growth in contribution margin is effectively outpacing the growth in the eProducts related to R&D, which means that 2023, we are seeing improving profitability coming from that portfolio in totality, and continue to believe that we're on track that as we exit 23 and added to the beginning of '24, that portfolio is approaching breakeven. Operator : And our next question will come from James Picariello with BNP Paribas. James Picariello : Good morning, everyone. Just back to the growth over market, I thought in 2022, there was almost like a 4-point benefit from commodity recovery bedded within your revenue growth. So I do just want to clarify that the 2023 high single-digit 8 points of outgrowth, that, that does not include any ongoing commodity recovery, cost recovery type benefit? Kevin Nowlan : That's correct. I mean pricing is not a net tailwind in that -- effectively that organic growth number as you look at the 2023 guide. James Picariello : Okay. Understood. And then just back to the EV profitability time frame. Any -- given the $60 million to $70 million R&D step-up, I think previously, you guys have talked about maybe late '23, early '24 in terms of achieving breakeven for the business. What does that time frame look like now given better visibility on the R&D commitments you have? Kevin Nowlan : I think as I was just mentioning to Emmanuel, it's essentially unchanged. I mean we think last year and heading into the beginning of this year was really the inflection point of the business from an electrification standpoint. We leaned forward pretty significantly last year with a $150-plus million step-up in eProducts related to R&D. And now as we head into 2023 and you're seeing all that EV-related revenue growth coming through and the contribution coming on that revenue growth that contribution margin growth this year is outpacing the growth in eProducts R&D and continues to put us on pace, as I mentioned, to Emmanuel for us to be approaching breakeven as we exit '23 and enter the beginning of 2024. James Picariello : Got it. And just any clarity on what the SpinCo's targeted net leverage could be? I know you've previously communicated a lot have a healthy cap structure. Just curious if there's a finer point on that. Kevin Nowlan : I'm not going to provide any more color on that at this point. And we're still on target to execute the spin in late 2023. And as we approach the spin-off date, get closer to that, you should expect that both companies are going to hold investor days, at which point in time we'll provide more clarity around the financial outlook and capital structures of both businesses.  But the overall concept is as it relates to both NewCo and BorgWarner on a go-forward basis that we're going to continue to maintain moderate levels of leverage in a way that supports the ability of both companies to execute their respective strategies. Operator : And your next question comes from Rod Lache with Wolfe Research. Rod Lache : Good morning, everybody. Fred, you feel better. Kevin, I think I have a few questions for you. First of all, is it correct that already a significant amount of additional inflation 2023, but you are not assuming any real recovery in terms of incremental pricing on that? And that if you do achieve incremental recovery, that would actually be accretive to your revenue forecast and your earnings forecast. Am I understanding that right? Kevin Nowlan : I think -- I mean, the way to think about it, we exited 2022 at a level of pricing from the supply base and pricing with the customers that we think is likely going to continue at or around that level heading into 2023. And that's effectively what's underlying the guide. Rod Lache : Okay. So in other words, you already had this from the beginning of the year. There's no like spillover effect from negotiations that you had benefited from over the course of the year or in the middle of the year last year? Kevin Nowlan : I think the spillover effect is what I mentioned with respect to my comments about the potential volatility in margins in Q1, as we exited -- as we negotiated with our customers in 2022, the focus was really on how we make sure that we're recovering a fair share of the inflationary impacts we were seeing in 2022. And as we head into 2023, we would discuss with our customers and our suppliers, the extent to which some of those pricing increases need to continue to offset the inflationary environment. And so we could see a little bit of choppiness in Q1 as we go through some of those discussions. But overall, our outlook for the full year is that we don't expect to see a material impact from the net pricing environment on a year-over-year basis relative to '22. Rod Lache : Understood. Can you maybe clarify what the magnitude of the inflationary burden is for you that is already embedded in your numbers and you're seemingly offsetting in part through additional productivity. Is it correct that the scope of that inflationary burden is beyond parts and materials like it's extending to things like energy, labor and other factors at this point? Kevin Nowlan : Yes. That's fair to say, Rod. I mean, what we've disclosed to date is that the biggest impact we see is really on the material cost inflation side and the net impact on our P&L on material costs from last year, the cost net of recoveries from customers was about $90 million of headwind. But obviously, we have other productivity issues that we're managing through from a labor, freight and other things. Operator : And our next question comes from John Murphy with Bank of America. John Murphy : I just wanted to follow up on something you had in your other investment banks outside of the response you showed here. I mean, it shows like the content per vehicle opportunity all on EVs through 2025 and what you've developed through your acquisitions. But I'm just curious, as we're looking at a big chunk of the business still being ICE. Just curious if you had a view of how you think about the content provision on an ICE vehicle developing through 2025 and 2030 in million similar ways as you showed the EV content per vehicle? Frederic Lissalde : Yes. I would say if you look at 23, the ICE products, whether in pure combustion powertrain or in hybrid powertrain or our positive contributor to the outgrowth. So we see still a lot of pull from the market for our energy-efficient ICE types of products. John Murphy : Okay. And also, I mean it looks like in the slides, you're kind of indicating the breakeven on an operating basis and EV's occurring sometime between '23 and '24, roughly just in the slide that you showed. When do you think that the returns on that business start to become -- return on invested capital starts to become sort of adequate? is it looks like it's '24, '25, '26 that you kind of highlighting the margins might get closer to \"normal\". I mean when do you think the return on invested capital is sort of an adequate level for you? Frederic Lissalde : So John, maybe I start and turn it over to Kevin. The EV products that we are booking announcing are going through the same ROIC threshold at appropriation request processes than any other products. And so the ROIC program by program use there. There's no doubt about that. Not from a timing standpoint, I'd turn it over to Kevin\u2026 Kevin Nowlan : No. I think that's the key point. We price all of these programs so that on a stand-alone basis, they're profitable, as we've mentioned in the past, that what makes the e-business a little bit different than some of our other businesses, our foundational businesses today is that to drive the revenue growth in these product categories, we have to invest a lot in upfront, eProducts-related R&D. And so that provides an overhang to the in-year margins any given year. And you see that this year, even in our '23 guide. We have good levels of conversion that we're pretty happy with. But we're continuing to invest another $60 million to $70 million to support new business wins 3, 4 and 5 years out. And so as long as we continue to see the prospects for growth in this business, we're going to continue to invest in the eProducts related to R&D to make sure that we have long-term viable business here. And again, as long as those programs are all individually meeting our ROIC targets on a stand-alone basis, we're very happy to continue to invest in that R&D. John Murphy : And maybe just lastly, I mean to kind of put this all together, I mean, it looks like the margins on the ICE business in '23 will be 12% to 13%, maybe even there as we think about the aggregate margins being in the 10% range, do you think we're at a point where those ICE margins may improve even a bit over time and that this transition is kind of hitting sort of a low point on margins and returns in '23? Or do you think that's still in front of us?  Because I mean, you match part that we show on the EV business getting a breakeven sometime between '23 and '24 roughly, kind of indicates that we may be hitting the low point and that as we get through '24, things may actually sort of on an average basis far to improve. I know we're kind of looking far out, but people are just trying to really understand what this transition between EV to return? Frederic Lissalde : John, our product leadership and scale in the foundational product is very, very strong. And I would say the margin will remain top quartile and strong as you've seen in the past. Also, don't forget that the foundational products that we have an impact on our EV growth and one of the announcements that we made this morning around the battery cooling plates is a great example of that. We're leveraging product foundational know-how with cooler applications in the world of combustion. We are leveraging processes, know-how around brazing around leakage control from our proving technology into the battery cooling plate. So this is a great example of losing foundational know-how to create a new organically developed product for the EV world. John Murphy : Okay. But, is it fair to say, I mean, given the volatility that's going into the markets right now and this transition and just kind of being the last year where you might be using money based on what you're showing on an operating basis that we may be looking at a sort of a point in time or '23. I know it's hard to say, but just in the transition conceptually may mark one of the -- it may mark a low water mark in margins that's going through this transition all else equal? Frederic Lissalde : John, we are approaching breakeven. Is it end of '23? Is it beginning '24? I mean it's tough to say. But it is absolutely clear that now the turning point both from a revenue and a path to breakeven, that's absolutely pretty visible. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our next question from Luke Junk with Baird. Luke Junk : Fred or Kevin, it'd be great to just get your perspective on what you're seeing industry-wide in terms of the push and pull between 400-volt and 800-volt architectures. Do you think the consensus, if you will, is moving more towards 800-volt? And just curious with what happened with the customer award that you mentioned today? Does that animate this industry-wide dynamic at all? Frederic Lissalde : Look, the two voltages will leave and have a space in the market. 800 volts leads to a few efficiency improvements, but also comes with additional features and cost and we believe that depending on the end application, the vehicle type and the price point that OE wants to set the vehicle and both technologies will remain active. And what we're doing at BorgWarner is really focusing on the module design of those inverters so that we have building blocks depending on level of voltages or silicon, silicon carbide level of output necessary so that we are using a modular approach that will be pretty agnostic to the voltages. Luke Junk : Good. Appreciate that. And then for my follow-up, I was just hoping you could comment on the Wolfspeed partnership that you announced in November, specifically around your ability compete incrementally and ensure supply for and after that partnership? And most importantly, to what extent you think your supply chain position now could be advantaged versus peers in silicon carbide? Frederic Lissalde : So very, I think with the fact that we've secured a corridor of supply that is pretty significant and can meet our expectations going forward and our fast growth, 2 points. One, this supply agreement is not exclusive meaning we can work with other silicon carbide supplier should we want, but also if our OEM want us to work with other silicon carbide suppliers, the door is absolutely open, too. So I think we secured a significant capacity corridor, but we also have the ability to be flexible to decide who we work with down the road. Operator : And our next question will come from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Adam Jonas : Fred, I hope you're feeling better. Buddy, I hope you feel better. I noticed on Slide 8, the cooling plates is kind of so beautifully nesting that 4680 cylindrical cell. I'm curious what you're thinking about pouch and prismatic versus cylindrical because it seems like given some reports around GM, maybe not doing their fourth plan or possibly changing form factor and Tesla ramping up 4680 and getting others to make it that, that might be -- become more of an industry standard, even though there's still a lot of form factors? I was curious whether you're witnessing a bit of a gravitational shift or momentum, not just from Tesla to 4680, but others as well. Is that possibly what's going on? Because I thought that the argument was pouch and prismatic was more energy dense but are some of your products like your cooling plate able to get around that with the cylinders and get the better energy density with the cylinder and versus pouch? Frederic Lissalde : Yes. So first, what I would say that, first, in the commercial vehicle side, where we are really active from a battery pack manufacturer standpoint, we see cylindrical as the mainstream. In pass car, where we won that business with a major German OEM, we have different technologies that will be in the marketplace. What we've created here is focused on cylindrical. I've got to comment on the applicability to other technologies. But to answer your question simply on CV, which is cylindrical cooling mainstream and on the different views. Again, different technologies will be hitting the market, and they all have their pros and cons. Adam Jonas : Okay. Fred, appreciate that. And just... Frederic Lissalde : The only thing that I would add, I mean, those battery cooling plates for those types of battery architecture, are generating a pretty significant market opportunity, and we estimate that market opportunity to be around $3.5 billion in 2028 already. So it's not as significant. Adam Jonas : Got it, Fred. Just a follow-up. The world really changed, continues to change in terms of cost of capital, interest rates consumer slowing Tesla's dramatic price cuts, et cetera. And your electrification portfolio gives you a really long-dated view into the forward. Are you seeing any hesitation or maybe pushing out of the commitment from OEMs on EV investment at the margin. I know they're still committed, but I didn't know if there was a rate of change that might have -- you might have picked up on in your forward over the last quarter or so. Frederic Lissalde : No. I would say to the contrary, I see accelerate program, a tremendous focus on management, both sides, OE and Tier 1 to launch. And also, as I mentioned in prior calls, when we book a program a few months after, we're talking about capacity increase. What we see, though, is that also from the customer side, what we see is that they want partner with someone who can be impactful on the east side but also on the foundational side so that we pivot together. Operator : Our next question comes from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Noah Kaye : I'll stick with the battery theme for a minute here. So just given BEV is driving the majority of the organic growth outlook for this year, you mentioned battery is a significant contributor this quarter. And then you also called out higher growth expectations at Akasol, I guess, over the medium term? And just help us understand what's driving your increased expectations for your own battery business? Is it just higher sell-through on the commercial EV side? Or are you picking up share gains in new platforms? Frederic Lissalde : No. It's simple. We have multiple customer awards for us higher volume from our core customers, and that's leading to Akasol moving slightly -- from under slightly $300 million last year to about $1 billion in 2025. And the impact that you see this year is part of that glide path. And we're very pleased with our inverted role too and also very pleased on our motor or other wins across the portfolio. But on cases, about $1 billion already in 2025. Noah Kaye : Okay. And then just a follow-up. I'm curious how much of your 2023 CapEx might be allocated to battery manufacturing in the U.S. And how the 45x production tax price that might benefit you if you're making any investments. Kevin Nowlan : Yes, because of the acceleration we're seeing in the revenue in Akasol, as Fred mentioned, even up through '25, we are accelerating some of the investments that we're making both in Europe and North America related to that business. And then we're also seeing part of the increase in capital expenditure on a year-over-year basis related to our other electrification businesses on the light vehicle side. So definitely a contributor. And as it relates to North America, we're looking at the tax credits and how those might apply to us from a production standpoint as we go through '23 and beyond. Noah Kaye : Just waiting for treasury guidance to get full clarification? Kevin Nowlan : I mean there's some of that, making sure that we understand any clarifications that need to be had, but we're pursuing the credits that we think were -- that are available to us based on the production that we are executing here in the United States. Operator : We have time for one final question, and that question comes from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Mark Delaney : When you speak to your auto OEM customers, what do you think the gating factor is to light vehicle production volumes in 2023? And to what extent is volume gated by supply as opposed to demand? Frederic Lissalde : The semiconductor availability is still alive, unfortunately. And I would say, to answer your question, it's more capped from a supply availability standpoint and from a demand standpoint in 2023. Mark Delaney : And second question was just in terms of how customers have responded to the announced separation of the business. You spoke about all the great momentum Werner is having on the product side. I'm wondering though, have you seen any change in customer engagement to design in NewCo products with the announced separation? Frederic Lissalde : No, we've obviously talk to almost all our customers, and they understand. And we're actually happy to see those two strong companies being able to execute their own respective strategy and be happy with all with the announced spin-off. There's no noise from that are nil. Patrick Nolan : Now I'd like to thank you all for your questions today. Again, we apologize for the technical difficulties earlier in the call. If you have additional follow-ups, if few reach out directly to me and my team. With that, operator, you can conclude today's call. Operator : That does conclude the BorgWarner 2022 fourth quarter results conference call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Britney, and I will be your conference facilitator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BorgWarner 2023 First Quarter Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Patrick Nolan, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Nolan, you may begin your conference. Patrick Nolan : Thank you, Britney. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We issued our earnings release earlier this morning. It\u2019s posted on our website, borgwarner.com, on our homepage and on our Investor Relations homepage. With regard to our Investor Relations calendar, we will be attending multiple conferences beginning now and our next earnings release. Please see the Events section of our IR home page for a full list. Before we begin, I need to inform you that during this call, we may make forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties as detailed in our 10-K. Our actual results may differ significantly from the matters discussed today. During today\u2019s presentation, we\u2019ll highlight certain non-GAAP measures in order to provide a clearer picture of how the core business performed and for comparison purposes of prior periods. When you hear us say on a comparable basis, that means excluding the impact of FX, net M&A and other non-comparable items. When you hear us say adjusted, that means excluding non-comparable items. When you hear us say organic, that means excluding the impact of FX and net M&A. We will also refer to our growth compared to our market. When you hear us say market, that means the change in light and commercial vehicle Production weighted for our geographic exposure. Please note that we\u2019ve posted today\u2019s earnings press release and earnings call presentation to the IR page of our website. We encourage you to follow along with these slides during our discussion. With that, I\u2019m happy to turn the call over to Fred. Fred Lissalde : Thank you, Pat, and good day, everyone. We\u2019re very pleased to share our results for the first quarter 2023 and provide an overall company update, starting on slide 5. With approximately $4.2 billion in sales, we delivered double-digit organic growth in the quarter, and we outperformed the market in both Europe and North America. As we expected going into the quarter, our margin performance was negatively impacted by our planned eR&D investment, net inflationary costs and the impact of lower production in China. Our free cash flow usage in the quarter reflected our planned capital spending to support our eProduct growth as well as working capital usage and our normal annual payout of incentive compensation. Importantly, our challenging forward progress continued on multiple fronts. We secured multiple new eProduct awards since our last earnings report. We also announced multiple new eProduct capacity investments during the quarter. And as I will highlight, our battery pack expansion in Seneca, South Carolina shows our ability to utilize our foundational assets and people. Lastly, we continued to work towards the intended separation of PHINIA. Since our last call, we announced PHINIA\u2019s name as well as the key leadership roles. Brady Ericson will serve as President and CEO, whilst Chris Gropp will serve as the CFO of PHINIA. Both Brady and Chris have been at BorgWarner for more than 20 years, and have served in numerous important roles across a variety of BorgWarner business units. Teams are progressing well through the various work streams. We now expect to complete the separation of PHINIA by the end of the third quarter. Now let\u2019s look at some new eProduct awards on slide 6. First, BorgWarner has been selected to provide eMotors to a leading automotive manufacturer in China. The eMotors will be used in the Chinese automakers dedicated hybrid transmissions and range-extended electric vehicles with mass production expected to start in August 2023. We\u2019re excited to supply this leading Chinese OEM with a new motor application, strengthening our partnership by providing them with the support needed to meet the growing challenges in new energy vehicles. Next, BorgWarner has partnered with the Pontiac, Michigan School District to provide direct current fast charges to support the district\u2019s electric school buses. This program will utilize BorgWarner sequential charging technology that allows up to five dispensers to charge from a single power control system. This greatly reduces the initial investment and lowers installation costs while providing the ability to charge at DC fast charging levels. Next, BorgWarner has been selected by a global commercial vehicle manufacturer to provide eFans for battery electric trucks in both the North American and the European market with production expected to begin in 2025. For this project, BorgWarner will supply its complete eFan R10 system, which includes a fan, an eMotor and an integrated high-voltage inverter. Notably, the high-voltage inverter utilizes the expertise and capabilities of Drivetek, the company acquired in December of last year. Now, let\u2019s look at the growth and expansion of our battery pack business on slide 7. BorgWarner has been selected by a global power technology company to supply battery packs for a series of electric buses with production beginning earlier this year. This battery pack contains state-of-the-art safety features including current overcharge protection, cell-level passive propagation resistance and electrical disconnect at the individual sale wire bonds that satisfy the industry\u2019s strict electric vehicle battery safety standards. During the quarter, BorgWarner announced plan to expand its Seneca, South Carolina production facility by adding battery module Production to the facility. After this expansion, BorgWarner is expected to have annual U.S. battery module capacity of approximately 3 gigawatt hour. This investment will contribute to the growth of the Company\u2019s battery module and pack production in the United States, focused on commercial vehicles, trucks and buses. Our battery pack business is exceeding our initial expectations. Last quarter, we increased our 2025 revenue outlook for this business to approximately $1 billion, five years ahead of our 2030 business case when we announced the AKASOL acquisition. We expect volume demand from our largest battery pack customers to continue to grow, and we have secured multiple new product awards for our battery pack business over the past two years. We\u2019re also making the organic investments to support this growth. This year, we expect to invest approximately $100 million of CapEx to support this business growth, which is a big driver of the step-up in our CapEx outlook for 2023 versus last year. So in our opinion, the AKASOL acquisition from two years ago is poised to deliver well above our initial expectations. But now I\u2019d like to turn our attention to how last year\u2019s Santroll\u2019s acquisition is performing on slide 8. Similar to our battery pack business, the revenue related to Santroll\u2019s eMotor business has tracked ahead of the expectation we had at the time we announced the transaction. In 2024, we expect this business to generate approximately $250 million of eProduct revenue, about 40% higher than our original acquisition planning. If you recall, a key pillar of the transaction was for Santroll to improve our cost competitiveness through improved eMotor design and manufacturing capabilities. As a result of improvements that we are achieving, we expect this business to already approach BorgWarner\u2019s average profitability levels by 2024. We expected this business to increase our speed to market and increase our scale in eMotors, and we are seeing just that in our bookings, which are shown on the right side of the slide. The takeaways from today are this : BorgWarner\u2019s first quarter results were broadly in line with the directional guidance that we provided on our earnings call last quarter. Importantly, our sales growth once again outperformed the industry, and we continue to make investment to support our growth. As Kevin will detail, we expect another year of strong top line growth in 2023, especially driven by strong demand of our eProducts. Our guidance is also increasing based on FX tailwinds. We continue to expect our eProduct portfolio to approach breakeven in late 2023, early 2024 and our new segment disclosure will help provide evidence of this. Looking beyond the near term, we believe we are successfully executing on our long-term strategy, Charging Forward, which we expect will deliver value to our shareholders long into the future. Before I turn the call over to Kevin, I would like to again share a thank you to the BorgWarner team. Proud to see both our eProduct and our foundational businesses supporting our profitable growth in 2023. The progress made in just over two years since announcing Charging Forward is truly remarkable. It is the entire BorgWarner team and our culture of execution that continue to be the drivers of our ongoing success. With that, let me turn the call over to you, Kevin. Kevin Nowlan : Thank you, Fred, and good morning, everyone. Before I dive into the financials, I\u2019d like to provide a brief overview of our first quarter results. First, we reported double-digit organic revenue growth driven by outgrowth in Europe and North America and higher industry production despite weaker production in China during the quarter. Second, our margin performance reflected a planned increase in eProduct related R&D investment and net inflation headwinds, both of which we had indicated would be margin headwinds during last quarter\u2019s earnings call. Despite this, we believe we remain on track for our expected full year performance. Let\u2019s turn to slide 9 for a look at our year-over-year revenue walk for Q1. Last year\u2019s Q1 revenue was just under $3.9 billion. You can see that the strengthening U.S. dollar drove a year-over-year decrease in revenue of over 4% or approximately $162 million. Then, you can see the increase in our organic revenue, about 12% year-over-year. That compares to an approximately 7% increase in weighted average market production. Finally, the acquisitions of Santroll and Rhombus added $22 million to revenue year-over-year. The sum of all this was just under $4.2 billion of revenue in Q1. Turning to slide 10. You can see our earnings and cash flow performance for the quarter. Our first quarter adjusted operating income was $396 million, equating to a 9.5% margin. That compares to adjusted operating income of $389 million or 10.0% from a year ago. On a comparable basis, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and the impact of M&A, adjusted operating income increased $32 million on $446 million of higher sales. This performance includes a planned eProduct R&D increase of $26 million and about $28 million of net commodity and other material cost inflation headwinds. As we mentioned on last quarter\u2019s call, we anticipated Q1 to have a higher level of material inflation headwinds as we\u2019re still in the process of negotiating with our customers the extent to which cost recovery mechanisms from 2022 carry into 2023. We expect to largely complete these discussions over the next couple of quarters, which is one of the reasons we thought we would have a lower margin in Q1 relative to the remaining quarters of 2023. Excluding these higher costs, both eR&D and net material inflation, we converted at approximately 19% on our additional sales. Our adjusted EPS improved by $0.04 in the first quarter compared to a year ago, driven by the increase in our adjusted operating income and a lower year-over-year share count resulting from the $240 million of share repurchases we executed last year. And finally, free cash flow. Our free cash flow was a $290 million usage during the first quarter due to higher capital spending to support our growth in eProducts, increased working capital during the quarter, and the annual payout of the Company\u2019s incentive compensation for the prior year\u2019s performance, which we normally make in Q1. You\u2019ll note that the rate of capital spending during the first quarter was ahead of the pace implied by our full year guidance. However, this was in line with our internal planning as we\u2019re putting in place the capital that we believe is necessary to support the ramp-up in our eProduct revenue. Let\u2019s now turn to slide 11, where you can see our perspective on global industry production for 2023. We expect our global weighted light and commercial vehicle markets to be flat to up 3% this year, which is unchanged compared to our prior guidance. However, within this overall outlook, our regional expectations are mixed. Specifically, in North America, we\u2019re planning our weighted markets to be up about 1% to 5%. In Europe, we expect our blended markets to be roughly flat to up 2%, which is a bit higher than our previous forecast based on the stronger start of the year. And in China, we expect the overall market to be down approximately 3% to up 2%, which is slightly worse than our previous expectation due in large part to the weaker-than-anticipated production we saw during the first quarter. Now, let\u2019s take a look at our full year outlook on slide 12. First, it\u2019s important to note that our guidance now assumes an expected full year tailwind from stronger foreign currencies of $55 million. This is an improvement of $340 million in revenue versus our prior guidance. Second, as I previously mentioned, we expect our end markets to be flat to up 3% for the year, which contributes to the organic net sales change you see on the slide. But more important than the modest growth in end markets, we expect our revenue to continue to grow in excess of industry production, driven by our expectations for a modest increase in inflationary cost recovery from our customers and various expected new business launches, especially in our eProduct portfolio. As it relates to eProduct revenue, we are expecting to deliver between $2.3 billion and $2.6 billion in 2023, which is up significantly from the approximately $1.5 billion we generated in 2022. Finally, the Santroll, Rhombus and SSE acquisitions are expected to add $70 million to 2023 revenue. Based on these expectations, we\u2019re projecting total 2023 revenue in the range of $17.1 billion to $17.9 billion, which equates to organic growth of approximately 7.5% to 12.5%. This is higher than our previous revenue guidance of $16.7 billion to $17.5 billion due to foreign currencies, the impact of the recently completed acquisition of SSE and our slightly higher customer recovery expectations. Switching to margin. We continue to expect our full year adjusted operating margin to be in the range of 10.0% to 10.4% compared to our 2022 margin of 10.1%. As it relates to R&D, our full year 2023 guidance continues to anticipate a $60 million to $70 million increase in eProduct-related R&D investment. With our ongoing success securing new electrified business wins, we\u2019re continuing to lean forward by investing more in R&D to support our eProduct portfolio. Excluding the impact of this increase in eProduct related in R&D, our 2023 margin outlook contemplates the business delivering full year incrementals in the mid-teens, inclusive of net inflationary headwinds of around $65 million. Based on this revenue and margin outlook, we\u2019re expecting full year adjusted EPS in the range of $4.60 to $5.15 per diluted share. Turning to free cash flow. We continue to expect that we\u2019ll deliver free cash flow in the range of $550 million to $650 million for the full year. As a reminder, this cash flow outlook includes onetime cash cost of approximately $150 million related to the planned spinoff of our Fuel Systems and Aftermarket businesses. Excluding this onetime cost, our free cash flow guidance would be $700 million to $800 million which is only slightly lower than the record free cash flow of $846 million we generated in 2022. That\u2019s our 2023 outlook. Turning to slide 13, you can see our new segment disclosure for ePropulsion. In an effort to increase transparency into our eProduct profitability, we\u2019ve made the decision, starting with the first quarter to break our previous ePropulsion & Drivetrain segment into two separate external reporting segments : ePropulsion and Drivetrain & Battery Systems. Our ePropulsion segment includes multiple eProducts, including inverters, eMotors, eGearDrives, IDMs and other power electronics, such as onboard chargers. We expect these eProducts to account for roughly two-thirds of the segment\u2019s revenue in 2023. In addition, the ePropulsion segment is expected to account for approximately two-thirds of BorgWarner\u2019s total eProduct revenue in 2023. As you can see, the business reported a negative operating margin in the first quarter, but it\u2019s expected to have a slightly positive margin by the fourth quarter. We believe a significant driver of this improved margin outlook will be the conversion on the growth in eProduct revenue as quarterly segment revenue is expected to grow to $750 million to $850 million by the fourth quarter compared to $487 million of revenue in Q1. And as you can see, the expected growth in eProduct R&D isn\u2019t expected to keep pace with the growth in revenue and gross profit in the coming quarters. The result is an increasing operating margin for the ePropulsion segment. Importantly, we expect profitability to continue to improve as we look forward beyond 2023. We believe this is a very good illustration of the profitability trajectory of our eProducts more generally. That\u2019s because we expect that as each eProduct starts to see acceleration in revenue growth, the conversion on that growth starts to overcome the upfront cost of R&D and other investments, thereby leading to profitability. So, let me summarize my financial remarks. Overall, our first quarter results were broadly in line with our prior outlook. We outgrew the market with growth driven by various eProducts and foundational products, and our incremental margin performance, excluding planned eR&D investment and net inflation was strong. In addition, we continue to take steps to increase the financial transparency of our eProduct businesses. As we look ahead in 2023, we continue to expect to deliver strong revenue outperformance compared to industry production, to complete the work to successfully spin-off PHINIA, which we now expect to happen by the end of the third quarter and to continue to make the necessary investments to support the profitable growth of our eProduct portfolio. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Pat. Patrick Nolan : Britney, we\u2019re ready to open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Morgan Langan [ph] with Wells Fargo. Colin Langan : It\u2019s Colin. I just want to follow up on the comments. I\u2019m not sure if I misheard. Did you say there\u2019s -- you\u2019re expecting $65 million of inflationary costs for the year. I thought the initial guidance was reflecting something that it would be not material for the year? Kevin Nowlan : That\u2019s correct. We\u2019ve effectively increased the expectation of the net inflation cost to $65 million. It was relatively small in our previous guidance, but the increase as we\u2019ve seen the continued escalation of supplier costs, predominantly non-commodity-related costs. But despite that, we\u2019re continuing to expect to hold our margin guide, 10.0% to 10.4% for the full year. Colin Langan : Got it. Okay. And it\u2019s actually -- it\u2019s not related to the steel price, its\u2019 actually related to your supplier cost pressure coming through? Kevin Nowlan : It really is. I mean, if you look at indices, commodity indices are a little bit all over the place. You have certain indices -- certain steel indices, aluminum are down on a year-over-year basis. You have copper, which is actually up relative to the second half of the year. And you have nickel and stainless steel that are actually up on a year-over-year basis. So, commodities are a little bit of a mixed story, but the bulk of what we\u2019re seeing come through is really non-commodity-related, the other inflationary costs coming through the supply base. Colin Langan : And what helps you keep your guidance, I guess, actually slightly up related to sales. But with the $65 million incremental headwind, what\u2019s offsetting that? Kevin Nowlan : Yes, the continued performance of the business and conversion on incremental revenue. So, we continue to have confidence in our ability to deliver on that conversion, which mitigates the impact of that $65 million. Colin Langan : And just lastly, Fuel Systems looked pretty weak in the quarter. Anything unusual going on in Q1? And should that sort of bounce back, or is that kind of stay at these kind of levels? Kevin Nowlan : Yes. Fuel Systems was one of the segments most impacted by some of the China mix issues we saw, particularly China CD. So that had an impact on margin. In addition, the segment also saw some impacts from higher supplier related costs and higher R&D costs. But as we look at the business on a full year basis, we do expect much like the rest of BorgWarner, to see sequential improvement over the balance of the year and fully expect that business will continue to perform in line with where it\u2019s been performing the last couple of years. Operator : Your next question comes from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Noah Kaye : Thank you for breaking out ePropulsion. Very helpful to get that visibility. I guess, would it be fair to say that getting to the high end of the revenue guide for ePropulsion really depends on production cadence and supply chain? And would that primarily be a function of your own supply chain for electronics and other components, or is that more gated by the OEMs? Fred Lissalde : No, I would say that -- yes, it\u2019s not demand related. It\u2019s -- if we get the chips, we\u2019ll be at 1.8. If we don\u2019t get enough chips, we\u2019ll be at 1.5. So, it\u2019s essentially linked to the ability to get what we need in order to deliver the demand. Noah Kaye : And your thoughts on line of sight to getting the chips thus far in the year? Fred Lissalde : Well, that\u2019s what -- I mean, we have teams of people working really hard with our suppliers. And so far, so good, I would say. But we still have volatility. And as you know, the supply chain is -- has no buffer whatsoever. So, if you have a little blip somewhere, then it impacts us in our ability to ship. So, that\u2019s why you have that band of revenue that is still open from 1.5 to 1.8. Noah Kaye : And then just the last one. I mean the margin trajectory in ePropulsion, should we potentially extrapolate similar incrementals moving into 2024? And I think the dynamics here of the gross profit contributions more than offsetting the R&D increases, is what we\u2019re seeing here from 1Q to 4Q kind of a fair trend line to continue? Kevin Nowlan : I think it\u2019s a fair way to think about it. I mean, it\u2019s what we\u2019ve been suggesting all along is that as we start to get the scale and start to see the revenue ramp up, that revenue ramp up drives gross margin and the pace of that growth is outpacing the growth in R&D. You can see the R&D starting to flatten a little bit more relative to that growth. So, as we get beyond \u201823 and into \u201824 and beyond, we do expect to see that continued improvement in the margin trajectory linked to the continued growth in the eProduct-related revenue. Operator : Your next question comes from James Picariello with BNP Paribas. James Picariello : So, the PHINIA spin is now targeted by -- to be completed by the end of the third quarter. Any thoughts or color on the timing of the CMD and the capital structure potentially for PHINIA? Fred Lissalde : Yes. I think nothing has changed really. We\u2019re getting more precise. The teams are doing a great job, and we\u2019ll come back to you when we have even more precision on those dates. But we\u2019re marching towards end of the third -- by the third quarter. And it\u2019s a lot of work, but people are working really diligently, and just wanted to give you a bit more precision. Kevin Nowlan : And so, as we get more honed in on a particular date, then we\u2019ll be in a position to talk about when those investor days might be for both companies. And at that time, we\u2019ll also talk about the capital structure of both businesses. James Picariello : Got it. And then, on the commodities front, so the net impact now for the year at $65 million headwind. As you think about the topline recovery component of this, last year, I believe it was roughly $580 million flowing through your revenue in terms of commodity recovery. What does that number now look like within your revenue guidance? Kevin Nowlan : On a year-over-year basis, it contributes about a point to our revenue. So that -- and net of that recovery, we end up with $65 million of headwind. Operator : Your next question comes from Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank. Emmanuel Rosner : So just to clarify again the inflation headwind. So, are you expecting $65 million on a full year basis as a net number? And then, $28 million of that happened in the first quarter. Is that correct? Kevin Nowlan : That\u2019s correct. Emmanuel Rosner : And I guess the general drivers of sort of improvement in sort of like total incremental margins from the first quarter to the rest of the year. So, you would have a higher proportion of recoveries, I guess, on that growth headwind -- inflation headwind, or what other drivers would you point to? Kevin Nowlan : Yes. I mean, fundamentally, the two things that really drive the performance over the balance of the year. One is, we do expect to start to generate some of the customer recoveries linked to the inflationary headwinds. So the biggest headwind is really in the first quarter. But second, we do see sequential improvements in revenues and converting on that over time. I mean, if you look at -- our Q1 revenue is $4,180 million. If you look at the midpoint of our guide, it suggests that the average quarter for the last three quarters is higher by $260 million of revenue. So, there\u2019s still revenue growth coming over the balance of the year, particularly driven by the growth in our eProduct portfolio. So converting on that as well as mitigating some of these inflation impacts over the balance of the year are really what drives the conversion and gets us to that 10.0% to 10.4% margin for the full year. Emmanuel Rosner : And this is tied to the timing of your launches? Kevin Nowlan : Correct. It\u2019s really the ramp-up of our eProduct revenue over the balance of the year. And you can really see it in that ePropulsion segment disclosure that we had in the deck that the primary driver of that growth growing from $487 million of revenue in Q1 to $750 million to $850 million in Q4 is eProducts. And so, really capitalizing on that growth is what we\u2019re looking for over the balance of the year. Emmanuel Rosner : And then, following up just on that disclosure. So eProducts expected to be about two-thirds of the net segment sales. I guess, what else is in ePropulsion? Kevin Nowlan : Predominantly electronics. Operator : Your next question comes from John Murphy with Bank of America. John Murphy : I just wanted to focus on slide 13. Kevin, you kind of alluded to that two-thirds of actual electric product will be in this ePropulsion segment. And that kind of sort of indicated there\u2019s about $1.3 billion in 2023 that\u2019s outside of this segment, and I\u2019m presuming that\u2019s all in Drivetrain & Battery. If that\u2019s correct, are we looking at a similar progression in the profitability in that other $1.3 billion? [Indiscernible] right now, and they\u2019ll get to breakeven or better by the end of the year? Kevin Nowlan : Yes. I mean, I think your $1.3 billion is a little bit high when you\u2019re doing the math on that because we\u2019re guiding to overall the $2.5 billion to $2.8 billion of eProduct revenue. So, when you do a third of that, it\u2019s going to be a little bit less than that number. But where you see the other pockets of eProducts related revenue are really the battery pack business, which is in the Drivetrain & Battery Systems segment. You have a lot of our thermal products, which is in the Air Management segment as well as the charging stations, which are in the Air Management segment as well. So, that\u2019s really where you see the other components of the eProduct related portfolio. In terms of the trajectory, I think it\u2019s right to think that what you see on slide 13 is the right template or a way to think about the progression of margin in any one of those eProduct businesses. They start off by generating losses when they don\u2019t have much revenue scale because we\u2019re making a lot of upfront investment, particularly in R&D and other start-up costs. And as we start to get the scale and we start to grow revenue to the point where the revenue growth outpaces the growth in R&D, we start to drive profitability. So when you look at the eProduct portfolio within ePropulsion, we\u2019re already starting to get to that scale point. Some of the other businesses are simply at different points of maturity along the way. But as they get to the same levels of maturity as what we see in the ePropulsion, we expect the exact same type of trajectory. John Murphy : Okay. And then just to follow up on that. I mean, the midpoint is 2.6, so that\u2019s two-third of your total eProducts that would indicate there\u2019s another $1.3 billion outside. That\u2019s the math. I mean, is there something else -- am I just misunderstanding something? Kevin Nowlan : I mean, 2.6 divided by 3 gets you about $850 million to $900 million. So it\u2019s... John Murphy : Oh, you\u2019re saying that\u2019s the total? Okay. That\u2019s -- okay, because the way this is shown is if that\u2019s what\u2019s in the ePropulsion segment, you\u2019re saying that -- so you\u2019re saying that\u2019s the full number? Kevin Nowlan : The expected net -- so the $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion, that\u2019s the ePropulsion segment revenue, two-thirds of which is eProduct related. It also happens to correspond to being two-thirds of BorgWarner\u2019s total eProduct revenue is also in this segment. John Murphy : So basically, we should be thinking about $866 million outside of this segment. Is that correct? Kevin Nowlan : Ballpark. John Murphy : Okay, got it. Okay. I just wanted to make sure we got that right. Then just a second question. We think about PHINIA, and it sounds like this is going faster than expected, so it sounds like there\u2019s good progress. How should we think about post separation potentially stranded costs and opportunities to work those down? Kevin Nowlan : I mean, from a cost perspective, we\u2019ll talk about that more when we get to the investor days that we expect to have closer to the date of the spin. And when you think of the potential dissynergies we see from the transaction, one of them is just, as you\u2019re alluding to, some of the incremental costs associated with establishing a corporate cost structure for a new public company, PHINIA. So we\u2019ll give more details on that and the impact overall of that dissynergy, but as we look at it, the value creation opportunity of creating two separate companies, both focused on pursuing their independent strategies more than offsets the potential dissynergy associated with setting up the corporate cost structure for PHINIA. Fred Lissalde : John, the -- PHINIA is made of two reporting segments that we run under the board -- a decentralized operating model. So besides the creation of a top co, there is not much stranded costs. Operator : Your next question comes from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Adam Jonas : So for your internal combustion businesses, across Air Management and within Drivetrain, given they\u2019re in some, let\u2019s say, early stage of a runoff phase, I would imagine that the capital requirements for these businesses in a runoff over the next 10 or 20 years, maybe very different versus the past 10 or 20 years. Can you confirm the CapEx and R&D spends, for example, as a percentage of sales for the ICE focused products can decline versus history? And can you quantify that? Fred Lissalde : First, I would say that what we\u2019re doing with the plant in Seneca, which is our biggest plant in North America is a good proxy of what we\u2019re doing to utilize the capital and the human capital that we have in our foundational products, putting berry back in there. If you look at e-heaters -- we announced more than 4 million e-heaters in 2025, we are using plant in Michigan and Portugal and China. For motors, IDMs, we\u2019re using Wuhan and Tianjin and Korea and North America. Also in Mexico, we have a power [indiscernible] program where already about 300 engineers have gone through and they are, I would say, now very up to their task in the world of it. So we are focusing on utilizing both capital and human capital when we also make the transition from C to E. From a capital standpoint, R&D standpoint, we think that -- and Q1 is a good proxy, too. eR&D goes up, cR&D goes down, pretty much equally or proportionally. Capital is very, very limited. And what we do when -- and since quite some years, combustion businesses are quoted with the amortization of the full capital in the length of the program with volume closes. So I think we\u2019re doing everything that is possible to limit debt risk. Adam Jonas : That\u2019s great, Fred. Just as a follow-up on your EV backlog, I would be very interested in your comments on how you see the Chinese-based domestic China EV players growing in your book vis-\u00e0-vis the legacy European, Asian and U.S. EV products. How is that backlog tilting? Fred Lissalde : Yes. Just to give you a high-level set of numbers. So this year, we\u2019re guiding $2.3 billion to $2.6 billion of eProducts and in 2025, about $5.6 billion. And that\u2019s 50% CAGR, just to give you a perspective on how fast we\u2019re growing in this field. In China, our business is 70% with the local Chinese. It was actually the other way around 5, 6 years ago. But the vast majority of our business is with the Chinese OEMs. And out of that 70%, 50% of those are with the big guys, the top Chinese OEMs. I hope that helps. Operator : Your next question will come from Dan Levy with Barclays. Dan Levy : I wanted to just start [Technical Difficulty] on incremental margins. So I appreciate the disclosure about ex the inflation in R&D would have been 19%. But just in light of an environment where some of the supply constraints seem to be dissipating and you\u2019re coming off of relatively, I\u2019d say, easier comps -- or more difficult situation a year ago. Is it possible that as the year progresses, ex-R&D, ex-inflation that that incremental margin goes higher? Kevin Nowlan : Yes. I think we\u2019re pretty comfortable with where the guide is right now. I mean, when you cut through the math and you look at the full year guide, excluding the eProduct-related R&D, we\u2019re expecting to be converting at about 16-plus percent year-over-year, and that\u2019s inclusive of the $65 million net material inflation headwind. So, it suggests without that headwind we\u2019d be converting even higher. So we\u2019re pretty pleased with that level of conversion, in spite of the fact that we\u2019re seeing material inflation pressures in the year. Dan Levy : Okay, understood. Thank you. And then as a follow-up, I wanted to just ask about silicon carbide. A, could you just remind us of your inverter backlog, how much of that is silicon carbide versus IGBT? And then, B, we heard a comment from Tesla at its investor day, plans to reduce silicon carbide content by three quarters. I\u2019m just wondering, in the future, how you\u2019re looking at the design of your inverters, whether you think that you can reduce silicon carbide content -- in general, what the direction is on silicon carbide? Fred Lissalde : I\u2019ll start with the second half of your question. The way we use silicon carbide and if you do teardowns and analysis, we use silicon carbide with a cooling on both sides. And the more power you can get through silicon carbide is related to how smart you cool those chips. And we think we\u2019re actually more competitive from a power density standpoint, thanks to our thermal management and the cooling on both sides than some of the competitions. That\u2019s item one. Item two, some people are talking about reduction of usage of silicon carbide and we do exactly the same. This is something that we all do and all those things are part of our product roadmap. It doesn\u2019t mean that the need for silicon carbide is reducing. It is still increasing, and we\u2019re very happy to have secured the capacity corridor with Wolfspeed in order to deliver on our long-range plan. The first part of your question was around what\u2019s the share of silicon carbide versus silicon on our inverter business. I would say that, if you look at the announcement that we\u2019ve seen, we\u2019re more tilted towards high-end, high-voltage silicon carbide than lower voltage silicon type of products with an average price around $700 atop. So that\u2019s why I would say we\u2019re tilted towards the most advanced inverters in the marketplace. Dan Levy : And within the context of automakers trying to drive cost down to make EVs more affordable, is there -- are you seeing a push from automakers to sort of reduce the silicon carbide content to make the inverters more affordable? Fred Lissalde : The puts and takes are a little bit more complex than this, and you need to put -- take into consideration the power output, the level of battery pack, the range, et cetera. And it all depends about -- I think it all depends upon the -- what the carmaker wants to do, what car type, what end products they want to put in the marketplace. The push for efficiency is such that we don\u2019t see a slowdown in the usage of silicon carbide. And most of the things that we see in the marketplace is pushing for more efficiency. And more efficiency, more range or smaller batteries is sometimes linked to usage of silicon carbide. But overall, you should ask the OEMs that question because the strategy that we have -- that they have is more linked to their system and how they want to put their differentiation into the marketplace. Operator : Your next question comes from Luke Junk with Baird. Luke Junk : For starters, I was hoping we could just unpack what\u2019s currently reflected in your ePropulsion gross margins there about 15.5% this quarter, not far off from Borg overall? And what\u2019s inherent in the incremental gross profit in terms of a margin assumption as you look through the rest of \u201823, especially what you\u2019d anticipate gross margins to look like as you ramp volumes and launch new product -- eProduct business, should we expect that margin percentage to move higher as well in addition to just the higher GP dollars? Kevin Nowlan : Yes. I mean, you should expect the gross margin percentage to be improving. If you cut through the math of what\u2019s on that slide 13, it implies that there\u2019s improvement in gross margin. And one of the main reasons you see that is we\u2019re growing into the fixed assets as well because there\u2019s depreciation in the gross margin that\u2019s not fully up to scale yet. So, by the time you get to Q4, you would expect to see an improvement from that 15% level you\u2019re calculating. Luke Junk : And then, a follow-up question. Just quickly, did you say you\u2019re expecting now slightly higher recoveries if you just speak to what\u2019s driving that? And how that aligns with the remaining price execution this year versus what you\u2019ve already achieved? Thank you. Fred Lissalde : Yes. Luke, it is obvious that those negotiations take some time, like it did last year. We expect that it\u2019s not going to take as much time as last year since we have a pretty robust framework that was used last year to negotiate the inflationary headwinds. And the negotiations are happening. We\u2019re pretty pleased with the pace that it\u2019s going. It\u2019s just not happening in Q1. It\u2019s going to take Q2, maybe early Q3 to get to where we want to be. Operator : We have time for one final question. Your last question comes from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Mark Delaney : First one, sticking on the semiconductor side. I was hoping to better understand the flexibility that BorgWarner has as you think about procurement and supporting your customers, either in terms of having multiple silicon carbide supply sources or being able to perhaps flex between IGBTs and silicon carbide? I ask in part because you guys have made public your announcement and Wolfspeed, I think a few weeks ago, they talked about a slower ramp-up of their the Mohawk Valley fab. So anything you can help us understand around your ability to perhaps derisk from one supplier? Fred Lissalde : Yes. So, the -- we have full flexibility from a design standpoint, 400-volts, 800-volts silicon, silicon carbide, very modular, that is clear and we are pretty relevant in all those inverter types, full flexibility from a manufacturing standpoint also. Regarding the agreement with Wolfspeed, this is not an exclusive agreement. So, we can get silicon carbide from other sources, and we can also work with direct and source if the OEM wants us to work with a particular silicon carbide maker. So, we feel pretty comfortable about the different level of support and optionalities that we have related to our growth in inverters. Mark Delaney : Very helpful context. And another was just on the design-in environment. And you guys have had for a number of quarters some good traction designing in your EV powertrain products. Given how competitive the EV market is for OEMs in terms of the prices in the market, I\u2019m curious, are you seeing any incremental interest from OEMs turning to BorgWarner for some of your powertrain products perhaps as a way for them to be more efficient in the near term using BorgWarner as opposed to maybe trying to do some of their own work in-house? Thanks. Fred Lissalde : We\u2019re very happy with the cadence of discussions that we have, development -- advanced development and bookings that we have with a lot of customers around the world. And the drumbeat is only increasing. It is absolutely clear that when we produce north of 3 million inverters in 2025 and 2 million to 3 million motors, scale matters, and scale brings competitiveness and scale brings the ability to design and manufacture in a very modular and flexible way. So, we\u2019re happy with the scale that we\u2019ve gained pretty rapidly. And what we hear from our customers is that, as usual, with BorgWarner, our products are at the forefront of efficiency. Not talking about fuel efficiency, but we\u2019re talking about electrons efficiency and low power losses. And I think we\u2019re doing a pretty good job here. Patrick Nolan : With that, I\u2019d like to thank you all for your great questions today. Britney, go ahead and conclude today\u2019s call. Operator : This does conclude the BorgWarner 2023 first quarter results conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BorgWarner 2023 Second Quarter Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]  I would now like to turn the call over to Patrick Nolan, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Nolan, you may begin your conference. Patrick Nolan : Thank you, Chelsea. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. We issued our earnings release earlier this morning. It's posted on our website, borgwarner.com, on our homepage and on our Investor Relations home page. With regard to our Investor Relations calendar, we will be attending multiple conferences between now and our next earnings release. Please see the Events section of our IR page for a full list.  Before we begin to inform you that during this call, we may make forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties as detailed in our 10-K. Our actual results may differ significantly from the matters discussed today. During today's presentation, we'll highlight certain non-GAAP measures in order to provide a clearer picture of how the core business performed and for comparison purposes with prior periods. When you hear us say on a comparable basis, that means excluding the impact of FX, net M&A and other non-comparable items. When you hear us say adjusted, that means excluding non-comparable items. When you hear us say organic, that means excluding the impact of FX and net M&A.  We will also refer to our growth compared to our market. When you hear us say market, that means the change in light and commercial vehicle production weighted for our geographic exposure. Lastly, starting in the third quarter of 2023, BorgWarner will no longer consolidate its Fuel Systems and Aftermarket segments. Results of those segments for all periods prior to the PHINIA's spin-off reflected as discontinued operations. Our guidance relates to our continuing operations and our commentary on today's call will focus on those continuing operations, which includes looking at some results on a pro forma basis to reflect the spin-off. We will not answer questions related to the performance of the Fuel Systems and Aftermarket segments. Please direct them to PHINIA who will conduct their earnings call on Monday, August 7. Please note that we've posted today's earnings call presentation to the IR page of our website. We encourage you to follow along with these slides during the discussion.  With that, I'm happy to turn the call over to Fr\u00e9d. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : Thank you, Pat, and good day, everyone. We're very pleased to share our results for the second quarter 2023 and provide an overall company update, starting on Slide 5. With approximately $3.7 billion in sales, we delivered 22% organic growth in the quarter. Our margin performance was strong and positively impacted by the growth and by customer pricing. Our free cash flow usage in the quarter reflected our planned capital spending to support our eProduct growth as well as the working capital usage. Importantly, our Charging Forward progress continued on multiple fronts. We received several new product awards since our last earnings report as well as securing an additional long-term component supply agreement.  In June, we unveiled Charging Forward 2027, which summarize the next steps in our accelerating eProducts portfolio. We also released our 2023 Sustainability Report, which highlighted the progress we have made towards meeting our environmental stewardship, social responsibility and governance objectives and outlined additional goals for 2023 and beyond. We announced the planned acquisition of the electric and hybrid segments of Eldor Corporation. And lastly, on July 3, we completed the spin-off of PHINIA. I would like to wish the PHINIA team good luck as they move forward as an independent company.  Now let's turn to Slide 6. Summarizing Charging Forward 2027, which we unveiled at our Investor Day back in June. Charging Forward 2027 builds on the success that we've had with our initial Charging Forward strategy that we announced back in March 2021. Charging Forward 2027 has three pillars. The first pillar is to continue our eProducts growth. We're expecting more than $10 billion of eProduct revenue in 2027 compared to an estimated $2.3 billion to $2.4 billion in 2023, and an estimated $5.6 billion in 2025. This $10 billion target for eProduct was the sales of the overall company in 2019. So this gives you an idea of how purposefully we're moving.  The second pillar is eProducts profitability. We continue to move towards breaking even on those products by the end of this year. On the Charging Forward 2027, we set a target of 7% adjusted operating margin in 2027 on our way to double-digit margin later in the decade. The third pillar relates to our foundational products that remain after the spin-off of PHINIA. Here, we want to maintain our strong top quartile margins and really maximize the value of those foundational products. These three pillars are simple, they are clear and measurable. As in the past, we will update you on our progress over time.  On Slide 7, I would like to discuss the planned acquisition of the electric and hybrid segment of Eldor Corporation, which was announced in late June. We believe Eldor's portfolio of high-voltage boxes, DC/DC converters and onboard chargers will be a great complement to BorgWarner's ePropulsion portfolio, particularly as it relates to expanding in high-voltage power electronics beyond the inverters.  Relative to our Charging Forward 2027 targets, we expect the acquisition to generate about EUR 250 million in additional 2027 sales, after synergies. The acquisition is as much about the portfolio and engineering capabilities as it is about short-term projected sales. We expect the Eldor acquisition to augment our existing resources with additional scale, capacity and capabilities with more than 100 engineers, two facilities and more than EUR 125 million of R&D investments that have been deployed by Eldor over the last five years.  We estimate that power electronics outside of inverters is a $31 billion addressable market by 2030. The onboard charger market is more fragmented and is trending towards high voltage and combination boxes. Until this point, BorgWarner success in inverters has largely consumed our power electronics engineering resources. Eldor's experienced engineering team will now provide the base for BorgWarner to grow even faster in onboard chargers and other power electronics. We will build upon this strong base to accelerate our program pursuits.  Next, on Slide 8. Let's look at the long-term agreement that we announced with onsemi during the quarter. The resiliency and flexibility of our supply base will become even more important as we rapidly grow our eProduct portfolio. Based on the growth of our power electronics products, we expect to purchase close to 200 million semiconductor dies annually by 2027. By the same year, our inverter business is expected to be 70% silicon carbide based with almost 50% of our inverters being 800 volts. This really highlights the need to partner with quality semiconductor suppliers.  Over the last quarters, we've taken several steps to secure the long-term supply agreements necessary to support our growth. In late 2022, we announced a significant capacity corridor for silicon carbide supply with Wolfspeed. We're now expanding our strategic collaboration for silicon carbide with onsemi. As a result, with agreements to date, you can see the strong mix of semiconductor suppliers we now have in place to support our strong growth.  Now let's look at some new product awards on Slide 9. First, BorgWarner has been selected by a leading Chinese OEM to supply its IDM for hybrid vehicles expected to start production in 2024. The provided IDM comprises dual inverter units dual eMotors and then eGear ensuring reliable durability. We're pleased to continue our collaboration with this leading Chinese OEM, further strengthening the partnership through supplying our IDM product. Next, BorgWarner has been selected by a major East Asian OEM to supply eMotor and inverter for the automaker's new electric vehicle platform. We're very pleased to continue our longstanding relationship with this major East Asian OEM. And finally, BorgWarner has secured a contract with a thermal and energy management solution supplier to deliver high-voltage coolant and heaters for use on a series of three electric vehicle platforms for a major OEM. Our heaters will be added to the suppliers' heating and cooling module and will be used to provide heat to the battery pack and cabin in BEV.  The takeaways from today are this : BorgWarner's second quarter results were strong. We delivered strong organic growth and margin performance. We expect another year of strong top line growth in 2023. Our top line guidance is also increasing modestly based on our industry outlook and customer pricing actions. Looking beyond the near term, we believe we are successfully executing on our long-term strategy, Charging Forward 2027 has now laid out the path forward for BorgWarner for the next four years, and we plan to continue to share our successes along this journey.  And with that, let me turn the call over to Kevin. Kevin Nowlan : Thank you, Fr\u00e9d, and good morning, everyone. Here are the two key takeaways from our second quarter financial results. First, we reported double-digit organic revenue growth driven by higher industry production and outgrowth in Europe and China. Second, our margin performance was strong, driven by solid conversion on higher revenue and customer recoveries of material cost inflation more than offsetting higher input costs coming from our suppliers.  Let's turn to Slide 10 for a look at our year-over-year revenue walk for Q2. Pro forma for the spin-off of PHINIA last year's Q2 revenue was just over $3 billion. You can see that the strengthening U.S. dollar drove a year-over-year decrease in revenue of approximately 1% or $33 million. Then you can see the increase in our organic revenue about 22% year-over-year. That compares to an approximately 15% increase in weighted average market production. Finally, the acquisitions of Santroll, Rhombus and SSE added $18 million to revenue year-over-year. The sum of all this was just under $3.7 billion of revenue in Q2.  Turning to Slide 11. You can see our earnings and cash flow performance for the quarter. Our pro forma second quarter adjusted operating income was $369 million equating to a 10.1% margin. That compares to pro forma adjusted operating income of $258 million or 8.5% from a year ago. On a comparable basis, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and the impact of M&A, adjusted operating income increased $126 million on $667 million of higher sales.  The biggest positive driver of this performance was that we converted approximately 18% on our additional sales. In addition, our customer recoveries in the second quarter, net of material cost inflation from our suppliers were an $11 million tailwind year-over-year. You'll recall that last quarter, we were incurring supplier cost inflation was very little in the way of customer recoveries to offset that headwind. In Q2, we negotiated a number of settlements with our customers that contemplated recoveries of material cost inflation for both Q2 and Q1. Because we essentially under-recovered inflation in Q1 and over recovered in Q2, when you think about the jump-off for our go-forward margin performance, you should really be looking at the total first half performance, not any individual quarter. Pro forma for the spin-off of PHINIA, our adjusted EPS improved by $0.31 compared to a year ago, driven almost entirely by the increase in our adjusted operating income.  Turning to free cash flow. Excluding onetime costs, our free cash flow was a $42 million usage during the second quarter due to higher capital spending to support our growth in eProducts, and increased working capital related to our sequentially increasing revenue and the customer recoveries that we booked late in the quarter, but have not yet collected. Now let's take a look at our full year outlook on Slide 12. First, as Pat mentioned, our full year guidance now reflects the spin-off of PHINIA and treats the prior period results of those particular segments as discontinued operations, which importantly is not reflected in many of the external estimates within the Street consensus.  Starting with foreign currencies. Our guidance now assumes an expected full year headwind from weaker currencies of $35 million. This is a headwind of $111 million in revenue versus our prior guidance with the Chinese yuan being the largest driver of the change in our outlook. Second, we expect organic growth of approximately 13% to 16% year-over-year compared to our prior guidance of 10% to 15%. The increase is driven predominantly by our higher production outlook, reflecting the stronger first half volumes. However, our assumption for inflation cost recoveries from our customers has also increased modestly.  As it relates to eProduct revenue, we're expecting to deliver between $2.3 billion and $2.4 billion in 2023, which is up from the approximately $1.5 billion we generated in 2022. As you can see, we've adjusted the high end of this outlook versus our prior guidance primarily related to two things. First, we're experiencing a slower-than-anticipated ramp-up in our battery pack production. Demand for our commercial vehicle battery packs is increasing rapidly. However, our capacity installation to support that demand has progressed a little more slowly in 2023 than we planned. Second, we're currently seeing lower customer volumes on a North American EV program that is already in production.  Finally, the Santroll, Rhombus and SSE acquisitions are expected to add approximately $75 million to 2023 revenue. Based on these expectations, we're projecting total 2023 revenue in the range of $14.2 billion to $14.6 billion, which compares to our prior guidance of $14.0 billion to $14.6 billion.  Let's switch to margin. We continue to expect our full year adjusted operating margin to be in the range of 9.2% to 9.6%, which compares to our 2022 margin of 9.4%. Looking at the net impact of inflationary cost versus customer recoveries, our current expectations are that the net year-over-year impact of material cost inflation on full year margin is likely to be a 10 basis point to 20 basis point headwind. As it relates to R&D, our full year 2023 guidance continues to anticipate a $60 million to $70 million increase in eProduct-related R&D. With our ongoing success securing new electrified business wins, we're continuing to lean forward by investing more in R&D to support our eProduct portfolio. Excluding the impact of this planned increase in eProduct related R&D, our 2023 margin outlook contemplates the business delivering full year incrementals in the mid-teens. Based on this revenue and margin outlook, we're expecting full year adjusted EPS from continuing operations in the range of $3.50 to $3.85 per diluted share.  Turning to free cash flow. We continue to expect that we'll deliver free cash flow from continuing operations in the range of $400 million to $500 million for the full year, excluding approximately $150 million in onetime cash costs related to the spin-off of PHINIA. That's our 2023 outlook.  Turning to Slide 13. You can see an update for our ePropulsion segment. We were pleased with the sequential improvement in second quarter revenue as compared to the first quarter. The improved margins you see on the slide benefited from that higher revenue, roughly flat eR&D sequentially and second quarter customer recovery of first half material cost inflation from suppliers. Despite a modestly lower full year revenue outlook for our ePropulsion segment, we continue to expect a slightly positive segment margin in Q4.  ePropulsion second half revenue growth is heavily weighted towards program launches and volume ramp up in the Chinese NEV market. As you can see on the right side of the slide, our Chinese NEV customer base is quite diverse as we supply many of the leading NEV manufacturers in the country. This customer diversity is a critical element of why we believe will ultimately be successful in the world of electrification and it doesn't apply only to China. At BorgWarner, we currently have eProduct business with seven of the 10 largest global light vehicle manufacturers of electric vehicles and high-voltage plug-in hybrids. So let me summarize my financial remarks. Overall, our second quarter financial results were strong. We achieved organic growth of approximately 22% year-over-year. We generated 10.1% adjusted operating margin based on a 19% all-in conversion on incremental revenue, and we delivered strong revenue growth year-over-year and bottom line adjusted EPS. As we look ahead to the second half of 2023 and beyond, we continue to expect to deliver strong organic growth to drive improved profitability in our eProducts as we leverage our top line growth, and to continue to make the necessary investments to support the long-term profitable growth of our eProduct portfolio. With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Pat. Patrick Nolan : Chelsea, we're ready to open up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Colin Langan with Wells Fargo. Colin Langan : Any color how should we think -- what does the second half seems to imply based on guidance a bit of moderation in margin? I think you're sort of running at 9.6% in the first half. And think to get to the midpoint of guidance should be more like 9.2% in the second half on which should be slightly higher sales. Any factors that are driving that weakness? Are you including some risk from the UAW strike in second half? Any color there? Kevin Nowlan : Yes. I think you have the numbers right there, Colin. It's 9.6% in the first half and the midpoint of the guide is about 9.2% in the second half of the year. The biggest things that are happening, if you're really looking sequentially, like on a first half to second half basis, one is you have to look at the mix of our revenue as we go to this half of the year. Our eProducts revenue is ramping up in our guide about $450 million to $550 million first half to second half. And so we're converting on that nicely, about 15% on an all-in basis, which is good for a business that's really ramping up and incurring the costs that you normally expect for a start-up of production.  At the same time, when you look at our revenue, keep in mind, our sequential outlook is that markets are effectively down first half to second half, about 6% and that's not unusual. It's just the way that our market assumptions work, which means that underlying that, the rest of our revenue, our foundational revenue is seeing a decline first half to second half, and that tends to come with higher decrementals. So when you look at that revenue mix going first half to second half, that's a bit of a drag on the margin that takes it down a bit. There's also a little bit of incremental inflation first half to second half, a little bit of incremental R&D, but that's really the overall picture. The bottom line from our perspective, we're pretty pleased with the fact that we're driving 13% to 16% full year organic growth year-over-year and sustaining that 9.2% to 9.6% margin outlook. Colin Langan : Got it. And any UAW in the second half risk there? Or is that sort of not in the guidance? Kevin Nowlan : We haven't put anything in the guidance. I mean it's hard for us to sit here and guess with a crystal ball what that might look like, what I can tell you is just so you can dimension maybe your assessment of the exposure that we have. If we look at our North American exposure to Ford, Stellantis, and GM, across Mexico and U.S. as we supply them. Our production runs about a little less than $250 million a month. So you can look at that, however you want in terms of assessing what you think some scenarios might be, but we haven't embedded anything in our guidance as it relates to potential strikes. Colin Langan : Got it. And just lastly, you highlighted some slowing demand for at least one of your products in -- to one of your eProducts Obviously, there's some concerns from automakers about EV adoption slowing. And I think at your Investor Day, you talked sort of longer term sort of being derisked on the sort of sales versus margin. But how should we think about that near term? If EV starts to slow into already, didn't see the high adoption into next year, does that but pressure on your overall profitability? How should we think about the puts and takes on sort of potential for EV to slow and impact you? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : Hey, Colin. So we've adjusted the topline. Two main reasons. First is we have issues keeping up with the demand on battery pack and despite a 350% year-over-year increase on our Gen 3 pack, we need more output. So we have all hands on deck, especially from a manufacturing engineering perspective. And remember, 1,000 buses or trucks is a $100 million revenue for BorgWarner. Also, we see the production of the current North American EV output, not as high as expected. Those are the two main factors. If your question is around the change our long-term outlook are clear answers, absolutely not. It's not going to be a steady up line, right? It is going to be with years or quarters going higher, some going not as high and still good growth, but don't expect a straight line from a or high-voltage plug-in a bit growth. Operator : Your next question will come from John Murphy with Bank of America. John Murphy : I just wanted to follow up on that question, Colin was asking. I mean, Fr\u00e9d, as you think about this in the short run, EVs are ramping a little bit slower than folks were expecting, they're still ramping. So like the long-term strategy still makes -- obviously makes sense. But I mean, could this benefit margins here in the short run as those EVs aren't produced in more ICE vehicles are produced and you're getting better margins there. Just curious, in the next one, two years, if that might drive better cash flow and help reinvest into that transition into the future? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : What -- John, what I can tell you is that we see strong customer pool. We see a very steady drumbeat on product wins globally. And remember we both are on there and on hybrids and especially high-voltage plug-in hybrids, but I would agree with you. This emphases the importance of maintaining strong margin on our foundational business and that's the third pillar of Charging Forward 2027. So that's what I would tell you. John Murphy : Okay. And then just a follow-up on the onsemi announcement. I'm just curious what this means for the Wolfspeed deal? Or is this really just dual sourcing that might even go to triple sourcing over time? Is this sort of just sand or course? Or is there something specifically you're getting out of onsemi, you wouldn't get it with Wolfspeed or does it put the Wolfspeed deal at risk? And how should we interpret all of this? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : It's all about supply chain resiliency. We're happy with the Wolfspeed capacity corridor. Wolfspeed is our largest silicon carbide supplier and we are putting in place additional agreements. It's all about security and supply chain resiliency. Operator : Your next question will come from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Noah Kaye : I appreciate all the reconciliation details for the PHINIA spin. Can you just update us on where net leverage actually sits post-spin and how much dry powder you have in your view for M&A? Kevin Nowlan : Yes. I mean what I'd say is you can see some of the metrics we have as of quarter end. But the one thing that doesn't get reflected in the quarter end numbers is that when we executed the spin-off there was an inflow of cash to BorgWarner, so effectively on July 3 of about $450 million. And that was because PHINIA issued $800 million of debt and then retained about $350 million for its cash balances and remitted to the rest back to BorgWarner.  So when you look at our balance sheet, you can see what the balance sheet looks like, and you have to think there's another $450 million out there. From our perspective, the way we think about our leverage profile is we'll continue to manage that in a way that we drive toward keeping below 2x on a gross debt-to-EBITDA basis. And we'll look at whatever actions we might need to take over the coming quarters to get there. But I think overall, what it means is it doesn't slow down our ability to execute from an M&A perspective opportunistically as we think see the opportunities that might be able to help strengthen our product leadership position in electrification. Noah Kaye : And a follow-up to that, I mean, good commentary on Eldor and you've done quite a lot of M&A over the last new year change. But just give us a view of the pipeline now. And there have been some comments on this call and others around what the puts and takes of a slower-than-expected EV adoption rate might mean for industry. Curious to know how that might be impacting the pipeline in terms of potential candidates for acquisition? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : No. We continue to look at opportunities in a very disciplined way as we've done in the past. We're happy with the portfolio that we have. If those opportunities can strengthen our electrification capabilities and accelerate the EV transition we look at them again in a very disciplined way. Noah Kaye : Okay. Maybe just one more. You mentioned the pace of battery production ramp. I mean again, very high growth. So not necessarily getting to the full level you expected. But can you help us characterize that? I don't believe Seneca expansion was factored in that, right? I mean that's not until next year. So what are the gating factors? Is it labor? Is it process equipment? Is it cathode or other materials? Just trying to understand the gating factors on production. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : It is equipment that is related to manufacturing equipment. It's going to take us about 18 to 24 months to get to the 2027 capacity that is required. We've announced about $1.3 billion of revenue in battery packs in 2027. And we're working on ramping that up as fast as we can for all our customers, especially in the Western world. Operator : Your next question will come from Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank. Emmanuel Rosner : My first question is on the ePropulsion margin progression. It's good to see the sequential improvement as well as you've got confidence in getting to slight positive margins in the first quarter. But will that benefit either from timing or recovery in the fourth quarter? Or can we think about it as sort of like solid exit rate on which to build further progress in 2024. Kevin Nowlan : Yes. I mean the way we're looking at it is achieving that breakeven actually positive margin at the end of the fourth quarter is a solid jump off into 2024. I mean you might remember, we talked about it before. If you look at our quarter end Q4 2022, ePropulsion was actually slightly positive. But we know it was on the back largely of increased recoveries from an R&D perspective. And so at that moment, it wasn't really a sustained positive margin profile. As we get to the end of this year, and achieve that positive margin profile, it's more because of the scale that we're generating in the business and the conversion on that incremental revenue. So I think it positions us to have a 2024 that's also positive and growing from there. Emmanuel Rosner : That's very clear. And then 1 follow-up on the small change in the full year guidance. So the organic growth as outlook is somewhat better, thanks to better production. But then you left your operating margin range essentially unchanged. What are sort of like some of the puts and takes in that? Kevin Nowlan : Yes. I mean we didn't move the upper end of the range. Obviously, we kept the $14.6 billion of revenue. So we didn't really move much there. We do have a little bit of incremental conversion coming on the increase at the bottom end of the range. But there's not a significant amount of movement to really comment on. So our 9.2% margin at the bottom end of the range held. I mean if you're looking at it from a pure operating income perspective, you got a little bit of incremental conversion and then you have a little bit of FX headwind that's impacting us as well. Operator : Your next question will come from Luke Junk with Baird. Luke Junk : Fr\u00e9d, for starters, just be great to get your perspective on the competitive landscape power electronics outside of inverters. If you could just talk about the fragmentation you see right now and the level of synergy that you would expect or even that customers have told you with the fact that you're already a major player in inverter in bringing that to things like onboard charger and other related products. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : Look, we're all -- what we're doing with inverters, with onboard chargers with DC convert, DC/DC converters and also from a charging perspective is power conversion. You can convert DC to AC, AC to DC, DC to DC, but at the end of the day, the core is power conversion. So the synergies from an engineering perspective, a purchasing perspective and a product similarity perspective is fairly high. Luke Junk : Okay. And then for my follow-up, just wondering if you've commented or could comment on what the geographic mix of eProduct revenue looks like sitting here in 2023, I guess, I'm thinking of the downside risk, say, customer delays in North America, which showed up in the revision numbers this morning relative to China pushing higher in the back half of the year? How should we just think about that mix between, I guess, broadly North America, Europe and China in eProduct? Kevin Nowlan : Yes. I would say what we're really seeing is, particularly as you look at that $450 million to $550 million of ramp-up going first half to second half in eProducts, an important piece of that ramp-up is really coming in the ePropulsion segment, which is really being driven by product launches and ramp up in China. So we have a healthy mix of product revenue across the globe. But as we ramp up here in the back half of 2023, China is a big piece of that ramp-up. Operator : Your next question will come from Dan Levy with Barclays. Dan Levy : Wanted to first just start with a question on your growth dynamics. And I know you have walked away from providing an explicit growth over market target, but the implied number for the year is 9% to 12%. You just did 7% in the second quarter. So if you could maybe just give us a sense of what's driving acceleration into the back half of the year? It sounds like part of it is eProducts. But to what extent is it also that you're seeing further traction on the foundational business? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : Dan, you're right. At the midpoint, outgrowth is 1,000 basis points or 1,050 basis points. It's driven by eProduct, it's a significant driver for this outgrowth and actually, second half is even higher than the first half. 2021 was also above 1,000 basis points outgrowth and it's difficult to time it. Customer pricing plays also overall on a full year basis with 170 basis points. So this is what I would tell you, and eProducts plays a significant role in this, and you see that also first half to second half. Dan Levy : And the foundational business, is that playing any role here? Or this is purely driven by eProduct? Kevin Nowlan : I mean the foundational business is continuing to outperform overall as well. But the biggest driver of why the second half is so much stronger than the first half, if you do the math of what's underlying outgrowth, it's that $450 million to $550 million increase sequentially first half to second half and eProducts revenue. I mean keep in mind, we're making that -- that's what we're expecting when sequentially, if you're looking at it that way, markets are actually down globally during that period, but revenue in eProducts is up $450 million to $550 million. So it's a big driver of outgrowth. Dan Levy : Okay. Great. And then as a follow-up relatedly, I was wondering if you could just talk about your hybrid business within the foundational piece. We heard last week from one of your large customers that they're taking efforts to accelerate hybrids outside of the plug-in hybrid. So maybe you can give us a sense for the latest that you're hearing on hybrids within the foundational piece, how accretive that is to CPV, how accretive it\u2019s to margin? But maybe if you could just frame within foundational, how large it is today? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : I don't think we've disclosed that. But what we've disclosed is $1.3 billion of hybrid in 2025 on the e-side. And on the foundational side that would come on top. Most of the next-generation or current generation high-voltage plug-in hybrids that make a difference from meeting the regulatory environment especially in Europe and in China do carry turbos, do carry EGR and other products that we're making. So it is an important part, and we've always told you that the products that we retain play a key role into the growth of hybrids, especially high-voltage plug-in hybrids, which are part of the NEV environment in China also. Dan Levy : Is the extended range EVs? Is that somewhere where you play, meaning the non-plug-in? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : We play in all kinds of hybrids. We play more in high-voltage plug-in hybrids, which are making a bigger difference from should efficiency over a fuel efficiency standpoint. But we do play into what we can call range extenders, whatever you call those types of powertrain. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your next question will come from Rod Lache with Wolfe Research. Rod Lache : Wanted to ask maybe just two strategic questions. One is, a week ago, we saw a platform sharing agreement between Volkswagen and XPENG. I know that XPENG is a significant customer of yours. Stellantis on their earnings call also talked about countering the Chinese invasion of Europe with better utilization of low-cost country sourcing. And I was hoping you might just if it's relevant, just talk about whether this is significant for BorgWarner, whether you see this as a global or a local phenomenon, just the utilization of these Chinese -- lower-cost Chinese platforms and whether that actually has implications for you? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : Rod, one of the key element of the strategy was to scale it fast. And I think we've done a pretty good job there. And we've done a pretty good job in China. You see we're producing eProducts for the BYD, Changan, Chery, XPENG, the Li Auto, the Great Wall, et cetera, in this world. And this -- we're also big in North America and Europe, and I'm not going to comment more. But this thing is going to be, I think, beneficial for suppliers that have technology and scale, which I believe we are part of. Rod Lache : So just to clarify that, Fr\u00e9d, these kinds of platform sharing agreements, does that represent an expansion of your existing business? Or is it does it have no effect on you? And is it kind of a global thing? Or is this more of a China local thing? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : I think is in the detail on your question, Rod, it depends on the platform and I don't think we have the granularity of what will happen across those different OEMs from the platform sharing standpoint. And we'll let you know if we can and when we can. Rod Lache : Okay. And then just maybe at a high level, just given all the focus on UAW discussions now. Just taking a step back, how are you thinking about the implications of higher labor costs for these OEMs? Do you see that as a net positive from an outsourcing perspective over time? Or is it kind of unclear because OEMs ultimately have to commit to greater union labor utilization. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : Rod, I'm not going to comment on this stuff. Operator : Our last question will come from James Picariello with BNP Paribas. James Picariello : Can you just confirm what the net commodities impact was in the quarter and what you're now baking in for the full year? And then also with respect to the new slate of restructuring efforts that you outlined at the Analyst Day targeting $60 million to $70 million in savings by 2025, tied to your ICE operations. Is there anything hitting in the second half here? Kevin Nowlan : Yes. With respect to the commodities impact in Q2, net when you take pricing, minus the net material inflation costs coming from the suppliers, it was a net positive of about $11 million in the quarter. And remember, that's because in Q2, we were recovering for Q1 as well because we had very little in the way of recoveries in Q1. So that's why it was a net positive number in Q2. And overall, the pricing element of that in Q2 was a little bit north of 2.5% of our revenues. So obviously had a meaningful impact on the quarter and contributed about 10 basis points to margin when you cut through that math. When you look on a full year basis, we expect pricing -- the pricing side of the equation to be somewhere between 1.5 points to 2 points of pricing all in year-over-year. And we expect the net impact on our P&L to be a 10 basis point to 20 basis point headwind in all in year-over-year.  So that's the way to think about net material inflation cost impacts for us. In terms of the restructuring, there's nothing unusual as you look in the back half of the year. We're progressing along the trajectory of what we laid out in the June Investor Day and generating some of the savings each quarter this year associated with what we laid out on that slide James Picariello : Got it. And then just a high-level question. If automakers begin to slow down their EV ambitions in some fashion over the coming years, whether it's demand related or production constrained. I don't imagine BorgWarner seeing any change in OEM intentions as of now. But if this does play out, would the simple response be for the company to flex R&D spend? Could this entail complexities and inefficiencies down the road for BorgWarner? Just curious on your high-level thoughts here on a topic that's gaining some traction. That's all. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : James. The first thing I would tell you is that we play as a global player. You've seen the impact that we have in China, in Europe, in North America. So we looked at the acceleration of EV and electrification overall on the global scale and on a global scale, we see momentum. Again, if you think this is going to be a straight line, I think it's a wrong assumption. And we're ready to flex. We are also ready to maintain strong margin on our foundational business, which is absolutely part of one of the 3 simple pillars of Charging Forward, and this is going to be important no matter what. Kevin Nowlan : And maybe the last thing I would add to that, James, it's why we laid out the scenarios at Investor Day like we did is because while we have our expectations on how the market is going to evolve over the coming years and we're marching toward that, we recognize that there could be some additional upside to the e-markets growing and additional downside to that. And that's why as you look at the portfolio and the way we've constructed it, it's resilience on any of these scenarios and drives operating income performance that we think is relatively comparable under lots of different outcomes like that. So that's why the portfolio is constructed the way it is. Patrick Nolan : With that, I'd like to thank you all for your great questions today. If you have any follow-ups, feel free to reach out to me or my team. With that, Chelsea, you can go ahead and conclude today's call. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude the BorgWarner 2023 Second Quarter Results Conference Call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Leo, and I'll be your conference facilitator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BorgWarner 2023 Third Quarter Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to Patrick Nolan, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Nolan, you may begin your conference. Patrick Nolan : Thank you, Leo. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We issued our earnings release earlier this morning. It's posted on our website, borgwarner.com, both on our home page and on our Investor Relations home page. With regard to our Investor Relations calendar, we will be attending multiple conferences between now and our next earnings release. Please see the Events section of our Investor Relations home page for a full list. Before we begin, I need to inform you that during this call, we may make forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties as detailed in our 10-K. Our actual results may differ significantly from the matters discussed today. During today's presentation, we will highlight certain non-GAAP measures in order to provide a clearer picture of how the core business performed and for comparison purposes with prior periods. When you hear us say on a comparable basis, that means excluding the impact of FX, net M&A and other noncomparable items. When you hear us say adjusted, that means excluding noncomparable items. When you hear us say organic, that means excluding the impact of FX and net M&A. We will also refer to our growth compared to our market. When you hear us say market, that means the change in light and commercial vehicle production weighted for our geographic exposure. Please note that we have posted today's earnings call presentation to the IR page of our website. We encourage you to follow along with these slides during our discussion.  With that, I'm happy to turn the call over to Fred. Frederic Lissalde : Thank you, Pat, and good day, everyone. We're pleased to share our results for the third quarter 2023 and provide an overall company update, starting on Slide 5. With approximately $3.6 billion in sales, we delivered double-digit organic growth in the quarter. Our margin performance was strong. Our free cash flow was modestly positive in the quarter, which we believe sets us up nicely to deliver on our full year cash flow outlook. Our Charging Forward progress continued on multiple fronts. As I will discuss in a moment, our long-term Scope 1, 2 and 3 emission targets were validated by the Science Based Target Initiative, the SBTi. We secured multiple new eProduct awards during the quarter. I'm encouraged to see these awards across several parts of our portfolio both for BEVs and for several types of hybrid architectures. I continue to be impressed by the sourcing pool for our products and the strength of our EV and hybrid portfolio globally. BorgWarner continues to focus on the long-term growth opportunities in our eProduct encouraged by the high intensity of the new business quoting activities in spite of the fact that we're seeing some near-term pressures on the industry production ramp-up of electrified vehicles. Gaining scale now on EV and hybrid architectures globally is our strategy, and this remains unchanged. We're proud to be in production or launching eProducts for 7 out of the 10 leading OEMs in the electrification area as well as several other OEMs outside this top 10. Now let's turn to Slide 6, which summarizes our commitments to reduce emissions through the end of the decade. Building on our previous commitments to achieve carbon neutrality by 2035, late last year, we submitted Scope 1, 2 and 3 targets to the SBTi. In August, SBTi validated those targets in which we have committed to reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions 85% by 2030 and Scope 3 25% also by 2030. BorgWarner's Charging Forward strategy is expected to play a pivotal role in reducing Scope 3 emissions as the portfolio shifts towards our e-mobility products. We will also focus on how we design and purchase those products and components. From a design perspective, we're expanding our circularity efforts and placing a greater emphasis on lightweighting. Within the supply chain, BorgWarner is working to enhance our green material sourcing and supplier contribution to our goals. We're proud to have our targets validated by the SBTi as it affirms the direction we are headed and the positive impact we're making in furthering our vision of a clean, energy-efficient world. Now let's look at some new eProduct awards on Slide 7. First, BorgWarner will supply a bidirectional 800-volt onboard charger to a major North American OEM. This onboard charger will be on premium passenger car BEV platforms with an expected SOP in early 2027. The technology leverages BorgWarner's silicon carbide power switches for improved efficiency and delivers superior power density and safety compliance. This is a big accomplishment for the BorgWarner team, highlighting our first major eProduct win with this OEM and also our first onboard charger win in North America. Second, at the IAA in September, we disclosed that BorgWarner will supply silicon carbide inverters for Volvo cars next-generation electric vehicles. Next, BorgWarner entered into an agreement with a major global OEM to supply its 400-volt high-voltage cooling meters for the automakers' European light vehicle program. We anticipate the start of production in 2026. This business win marks the second recent contract secured with this global OEM over the course of just a few months with wins spanning different regions. Finally, a premium European OEM has awarded BorgWarner a program to supply combined inverter and DC/DC converter for use in the customers' always drive B and C segment hybrid applications. Production of this program is expected to start in 2025. By combining the inverter and converter elements, we can manage both the electric drive and the accessory systems of an electrified vehicle, in this case a hybrid, in a lighter, smaller and more cost-effective package. Our knowledge, scale and production experience on inverters, DC/DC converters and onboard chargers or what I would call power conversion technology is a key enabler for BorgWarner to be adding value to our customers by combining these technologies into efficient system packages. Now let's touch on our eProduct sales outlook on Slide 8. Today, we're reducing our 2023 eProduct sales outlook by about $300 million. The 2 largest drivers of the adjustments are launch delays and forecasted slower volume ramp-ups from customers. We now expect eProduct sales to increase about 40% year-over-year. As we have seen these continuing near-term pressures on electrified vehicle production in the marketplace, we have taken the opportunity to reassess what that might mean looking out over the next few years. Looking through that lens, we do believe this has the potential to impact industry-wide new energy vehicle production over the next couple of years. As such, we now expect our eProduct sales to be in the range of $4.5 billion to $5 billion in 2025. As we have looked at the situation program by program, it is our view that the headwinds we are seeing are likely to be short to midterm in nature. As we look further out, we continue to believe that the long-term trends towards electrification remains strong. That is why our view of overall industry penetration of electrified propulsion is unchanged looking out to 2027. I would make the following 3 additional observations. First, we have seen no meaningful changes in the world of quoting activity from our customers. We continue to secure new business awards that are very much supportive of our long-term revenue objective. The pace of new business development has not slowed. Second, our estimated midterm exposure to eProduct customers and regions is well diversified. As we are in the early stages of eProduct revenue growth in 2023, BorgWarner does tend to be currently more exposed to a handful of important launches and ramp-ups of customer products, particularly in China. As we look further out and announce many additional programs over the next 2 years, we expect to benefit from more diversity in the portfolio. Our 2027 eProduct revenue expectations are fairly balanced across customers, across regions as well as across vehicle sizes. Third, we believe our long-term profitability objectives are still intact. As we've told you previously, the biggest driver of our improving eProduct profitability is our ability to leverage the rapidly increasing scale of the business. Since that ramp-up is not happening as quickly as we previously anticipated, it means the path to our ePropulsion segment achieving break-even margin is slightly delayed. As we look ahead to next year, we will assess what, if any, actions are necessary to appropriately balance near-term margins relative to our long-term objectives. Regardless, break-even margins remain in sight and our 2027 outlook remains unchanged, both from a revenue perspective and a profitability perspective. The takeaways from today are these : BorgWarner's third quarter results were strong. We delivered strong organic growth and margin performance. As we wrap up 2023, we expect to finish with another year of strong top line growth, top-quartile margins and solid free cash flow generation. As we look at our Charging Forward strategy, which is focused on aggressively positioning the company to win in the world of electrification, we do see some near-term, industry-wide challenges that we will manage through. We remain convinced in the long-term prospects for electrification and believe we are successfully executing on our strategy in that regard. I have stated on multiple occasions that the industry growth in BEV and hybrid will not be a straight line. The near-term volatility, while frustrating, is not entirely surprising given the magnitude of the industry shift. As we highlighted in our Investor Day in June and as you can see evidenced in our Q3 results and full year guidance, we believe that we have structured our portfolio to be resilient and to deliver strong earnings under wide range of BEV and hybrid penetration scenarios. That is true today, and we fully expect that this will also be true going forward. With that, I will turn the call over to Kevin. Kevin Nowlan : Thank you, Fred, and good morning, everyone. Let's dive right into the third quarter results by turning to Slide 9, where you can see our year-over-year revenue walk. Last year's Q3 revenue from continuing operations was just over $3.2 billion. You can see that the weakening U.S. dollar drove a year-over-year increase in revenue of approximately 1% or $44 million. Then you can see the increase in our organic revenue close to 11% year-over-year. We're particularly pleased that as we look at this growth, it's being driven by eProduct-related growth across all major geographies in which we operate. Finally, the acquisitions of Rhombus and SSE added $8 million to revenue year-over-year. The sum of all this was just over $3.6 billion of revenue in Q3. Turning to Slide 10, you can see our earnings and cash flow performance for the quarter. Our third quarter adjusted operating income was $349 million, equating to a 9.6% margin. That compares to adjusted operating income for continuing operations of $305 million or 9.5% from a year ago. On a comparable basis, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and the impact of M&A, adjusted operating income increased $46 million on $344 million of higher sales. This performance includes a planned eProduct-related R&D increase of $13 million. Excluding this higher ER&D investment, we converted at approximately 17% on our additional sales. As it relates to customer recoveries of inflationary cost impacts, we were able to finalize full year agreements during the third quarter with nearly all of our major customers. Those third quarter customer recoveries, net of material cost inflation from our suppliers, did not have a significant year-over-year impact on our adjusted earnings. Our adjusted EPS from continuing operations improved by $0.18 compared to a year ago by the increase in our adjusted operating income and lower effective tax rate. Finally, free cash flow generation from continuing operations was $36 million during the third quarter. Now let's take a look at our full year outlook on Slide 11. Our guidance now assumes that weaker foreign currencies will reduce revenue by $110 million in 2023. This is a headwind of $75 million in revenue versus our prior guidance with the Chinese yuan and the euro being the largest drivers of the change in our outlook. Second, we expect organic growth of approximately 12% to 14% year-over-year compared to our prior guidance of 12% to 15%. The narrowing of this outlook incorporates both an increasing industry production outlook as well as our updated outlook for eProduct revenue. As Fred mentioned earlier, we're now expecting eProduct revenue of between $2.0 billion and $2.1 billion in 2023, which is up from the approximately $1.5 billion we generated in 2022, but that's down from our prior guidance of $2.3 billion to $2.4 billion. That decline is due to a number of customer programs that include our ePropulsion products experiencing launch delays or ramping up more slowly. Finally, the Santroll, Rhombus and SSE acquisitions are expected to add approximately $63 million to 2023 revenue. Based on these expectations, we're projecting total 2023 revenue in the range of $14.1 billion to $14.3 billion, which compares to our prior guidance of $14.2 billion to $14.6 billion. Let's switch to margin. We expect our full year adjusted operating margin to be in the range of 9.4% to 9.6%, which compares to our prior guidance of 9.2% to 9.6% and our 2022 margin of 9.3%. As it relates to R&D, our full year 2023 guidance continues to anticipate a $60 million to $70 million increase in eProduct-related R&D. Despite the near-term eProduct revenue headwinds, we continue to see significant new award and quote activity. Therefore, we're investing in eProduct-related R&D to support those growth opportunities consistent with the plan we outlined at the beginning of the year. Excluding the impact of this planned increase in eProduct-related R&D, our 2023 margin outlook contemplates the business delivering full year incrementals in the high teens. Based on this revenue and margin outlook, we're expecting full year adjusted EPS from continuing operations in the range of $3.60 to $3.80 per diluted share. Turning to free cash flow. We expect that we'll deliver free cash flow from continuing operations in the range of $400 million to $450 million for the full year. This compares to our prior guidance of $400 million to $500 million as we expect capital spending to come in at around $800 million, in line with the high end of our prior CapEx guidance range. Our cash flow guidance contemplates a strong Q4, which is normal for us due to seasonality and traditionally strong working capital performance. But in addition to those typical trends and similar to last year, we expect to collect in Q4 a significant portion of the full year customer inflation recoveries that we've negotiated to date but have not yet collected. That's our 2023 outlook. Turning to Slide 12. I wanted to provide an update on the company's overall leverage and liquidity profile. As you know, we've traditionally operated with a gross debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio below 2.0x, which is where we think the business should operate and it's where we were operating leading up to the spin-off of PHINIA. However, when we executed the spin-off of PHINIA in early July, we lost their adjusted EBITDA to support our debt going forward. That effectively increased our gross leverage ratio to 2.3x on a pro forma basis excluding PHINIA. With that in mind, during the third quarter, we used the PHINIA spin-off proceeds to execute a tender offer for $438 million of our 2025 notes. By executing the tender offer, we were able to reduce the company's gross debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio back down to 2x. With respect to liquidity, during the third quarter, we extended the maturity of our undrawn $2 billion revolving credit facility by 5 years to September 2028. We're not only pleased with the fact that we were able to renew the facility but that we were able to do so with pricing spreads unchanged versus the prior facility. That speaks to BorgWarner's financial strength. Both of these transactions were important steps in maintaining the company's strong balance sheet and liquidity position, which gives us confidence in continuing to make the necessary organic and inorganic investments that support our expected future profitable growth. So let me summarize my financial remarks. Overall, our third quarter financial results were strong. We achieved organic growth of close to 11% year-over-year. We generated 9.6% adjusted operating margin based on a 17% conversion on incremental revenue excluding higher ER&D. And we delivered strong year-over-year growth in bottom line adjusted EPS. As we look beyond 2023, we continue to expect to deliver strong organic growth despite near-term volatility in the global NEV markets, to drive improved profitability in our eProducts businesses as we leverage our top line growth and prudently manage costs, and to continue to leverage the resiliency in our financial performance and our balance sheet to make the necessary investments to grow long-term earnings under a wide range of BEV market scenarios. With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Pat. Patrick Nolan : Thank you, Kevin. Leo, we're ready to open up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Colin Langan with Wells Fargo. Colin Langan : If I look at the full year guidance, it implies a pretty low margin or a step down in margins into Q4 of around 9.2%. Anything unusual going on in Q4 driving that weaker margin? Should we be thinking about that sort of run rate into next year? Or is this something more one-off going on in Q4? Kevin Nowlan : No. I mean as we look at it overall, we're pleased with the fact that our margin percentage on a full year basis we took the bottom end of the guide up and held the top end of the guide despite some of the eProduct revenue pressure. As you look at it, what it implies at the high end of the range is Q4 is right in line with where we've been on a year-to-date basis at 9.6%. And at the bottom end of the range, we're seeing effectively a sequential decline in revenue, and we're just generating negative conversion on that. So I don't think there's anything out of the ordinary on that. Colin Langan : Got it. And there's obviously a lot of focus the last couple of weeks off of the EV delays. And I do remember from your Investor Day, you highlighted, and I think it was more in the 2030 time frame, that you're somewhat derisked because if EV penetration was a bit higher, you'd have higher sales but lower margin. And if it was lower, you'd have lower sales but higher margin. And dollar-wise, that might be similar. How should we think about that more near term? I mean, are you -- can you -- is there a good hedge offset? Or with all the engineering that's required ahead of these EV launches, that's going to be a bit of a burden if the EV volumes are pulled back a bit in the near term? Frederic Lissalde : Colin, I think you're right. The portfolio is resilient, and that's exactly why we've structured it that way. And that's what we presented in the Capital Market Day. And it's resilient under a wide range of scenario. And I think what you see also this year is an example of what happens, E going down and and actually margin is slightly going up. And you see that the top line is somehow resilient too. So this is absolutely the purpose of the portfolio the way it's laid out. We have a great portfolio to enable growth in E. But if you see a slowdown, the products that we have in combustions are going to generate proceeds, cash and earnings. Operator : Your next question comes from John Murphy with Bank of America. John Murphy : Maybe I can follow up on Tom's question in 3 kind of distinct ways. If we look at Slide 8, just curious why you've taken down '23 and '25 and maybe not reconsider '27. And then also, as we look at this, Fred, to your point, I mean, you guys have set yourself up well to deal with the volatility here. So kudos to you for doing that. But is there an opportunity potentially on the ICE side of the business to maybe get better economics because the automakers are meeting you in this direction of investing in EV products? Then also on the EV product side, is there -- can you just talk about sort of the structure of those contracts, their buying guarantees? If they're widely missing or pushing programs out, are you protected in some way, shape or form on those contracts? Frederic Lissalde : A lot of questions, John, in one question. Let me take it in pieces. So first, '23, '25, '27, right? That's a bit of your question. So '23, when you look at the reduction, it's mostly in our ePropulsion segment. It's coming from, as you mentioned, timing of launches and volume reduction, volume reduction in ramp-up. And since we're launching a lot of new products, a delay has a big impact in the quarter and a delay -- and a ramp-up change has a big impact in the quarter. We continue to see volume pressures. But if you take a step back, in fact, it was still growing 40% year-over-year. So that allows us to. When you look at beyond 2023, we've looked at program by program looking at '25. And from what I remember, we announced 29 programs in June, and we booked more programs. seeing a lot of programs. What we see potential delays and downsides enjoy '22 to '23. In '27, we have a strong new business that will be very comfortable with p '25, the launching '25, '26, '27. And so we see a path to $10 billion. But also we've structured the portfolio to be resilient under a wide range of scenario. Again, when you look at the CAGR, '25 to '27, if you take out $1.7 billion of acquisition that we've also taken into account in the $10 billion, CAGR is about 35%, which is a little lower than '22 to '23. That's why we feel comfortable about the fact that the long-term prospect is unchanged. Yes, I think you had a question... Kevin Nowlan : I can talk about the others. I think you had a question about -- on the foundational and if there's a longer tail on that, are there opportunities there. I think you were maybe alluding to pricing. I mean, overall, our objective as part of Charging Forward 2027 is to sustain that strong margin profile we've had in the business. And that means we look at all aspects of the P&L, whether it's on the cost side or the pricing side to make sure that we're driving towards that. And so we'll continue to work with our suppliers, we'll work with our customers to make sure that we're executing successfully on that. And then the last thing I think you asked about was on EV contracts and how they're structured, particularly in light of some of these volume shortfalls. As we've talked about in the past, one of the things that we've made at a particular area of focus when we book new business on E because of a lot of the uncertainty around the ramp-up of E programs is to make sure that we put volume clauses in those agreements. And those volume clauses traditionally work like they've worked historically for us in a way where if volumes are outside a certain band, then there is a discussion that happens between us and our customer about how we ensure that we recoup investment or pricing or some other adjustment to make sure that we're not out for the fact that the revenue came in significantly short. So as we head into 2024, we're going through our planning process right now. You can imagine that's something we're thinking about. Operator : Your next question comes from Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank. Emmanuel Rosner : One follow-up on the ramp-up in eProduct revenue -- maybe actually a couple of follow-ups, if I may. First of all, how did you go about the assumptions that are now underpinning your new revenue walk? I assume, obviously, for 2023, you have direct production schedules and commentary from the automakers. But as you move into sort of like mid-decade, is this sort of like a top-down approach or like EV adoption or penetration curve or assumptions that you could share with us? Or how do you compare with previous one? Frederic Lissalde : Emmanuel, so for 2023, it's obviously linked to EDIs and schedules and detailed discussions that we have with our customers. It's the same for '25. '25 is a bottom-up line-by-line analysis of programs by programs and launch timing accuracy and discussion with our customers. '25 revenue is just around the corner. So we know pretty well, and we see pretty well through when the customers are going to actually launch those programs and the impact that this has on 2025. Emmanuel Rosner : I guess, if I could follow up on this, and I do have another question after that, but just following on this one. I'm struck by the fact that some of the large North American OEM, for example, have obviously pushed out meaningfully some volumes in the near term and certainly next year as well being pushed out. But at the same time, in some cases, sort of like pretty forcefully sort of left unchanged like for a some of the midterm or mid-decade targets. And so I'm sort of like wondering, how could you give investors confidence around the amount of derisking that you have now embedded in your sort of like mid-decade revised outlook? Frederic Lissalde : Emmanuel, we're launching globally. It's just not the North American OEMs. As we mentioned before, we're launching programs -- around 35 new programs that we've announced over the past quarters with 7 out of the 10 largest OEMs in the electrification area and a few others outside of the top 10. So the view that we have is a real global view. As you remember, we were pretty relevant in China and still are. We're launching a lot of new products in Europe, and we're launching in North America. But our view is very global. Emmanuel Rosner : Understood. My follow-up is on hybrid. Can you just remind us, as part of this new product, how much is hybrid in terms of revenue contribution? And importantly, are you seeing any movements from important customers and automakers towards essentially maybe growing hybrids faster than previously expected as a way to better respond to market demand right now with the EV slowdown? Frederic Lissalde : We've always been a player in hybrid powertrain, in essentially high-voltage plug-in hybrids, a few range extender programs in China. This product portfolio is absolutely relevant for BEVs and hybrids. And in hybrids, most of the combustion products that we had also see a path because there is no hybrid without an efficient combustion engine. Our content per vehicle on hybrid is pretty similar than the ones that you have on BEV. So electrification accelerates our growth, whether it's BEV or hybrids. We've always seen a traction on hybrids, and we're happy to be on some key platforms globally on hybrid powertrains. Operator : Your next question comes from Luke Junk with Baird. Luke Junk : A couple of bottom line really questions around eProduct. First one for me would just be how we should think about the trajectory of eProduct RD&E going forward. I'm thinking over the next couple of years, maybe. And how you might be able to manage that relative to the lower forecast volumes that you're looking at as well as, I guess, the offsetting pressure from the continued high level of RFQ activity that you're seeing in the market? Kevin Nowlan : Yes. A couple of things on that. I mean one of the things that we showed in Investor Day, and it continues to be our plan, is that the pace at which the investments are growing is slowing for us which is why we expect to get the scale benefit flowing through the P&L as eProduct revenue ramps up. And you can actually see that happening this year, even while we're seeing a year-over-year increase in eProduct-related R&D as we've talked about in that range of $60 million to $70 million. As you look at it sequentially each of the last couple of quarters, it's actually been only growing about 2% to 4% the last couple of quarters. And it will be relatively flat to slightly up in the fourth quarter on a sequential basis, point being the pace at which we're seeing the growth in the investments isn't growing as quickly as the pace we expect revenue to grow. And that's the path to profitability. Now in terms of what we might do going forward, just -- it's important to keep in mind, we're in the midst of our annual budgeting and long-range planning process right now. And as we're going through that process, we will continue to look at what, if any, adjustments we need to make to manage the profitability of the business over the near term and the medium term, but importantly, balancing it to the point you made : making sure that we're balancing it with the need to ensure we're executing on the long term. Because we continue to believe that the long-term outlook and trajectory for electrification looking out through 2017 and beyond remains intact. So we'll go through that process, and we'll provide you more insight on how we're seeing that when we get on the Q4 call in February. Frederic Lissalde : One thing I would add is, as we presented in our Capital Market Day, with the scale that we have and the number of programs that we're launching and developing globally, that allows us to really implement a very modular design approach that builds from from previous developments and also very flexible and modular production strategies. And that's very important when we grow and scale up. Luke Junk : And then for my follow-up question, just hoping you could speak to the flexibility in your manufacturing footprint protect margins given variable outcomes around eProduct. And I'm thinking specifically as you flex between foundation and EV products in shared facilities, just how much that can help to protect any leakage amid what looks like lower EV volumes from here, both maybe what we saw in the quarter and how that might look over the next couple of years. Frederic Lissalde : Yes. And we are leveraging the existing footprint that we have. As we discussed before, so far, we are leveraging 25% of our existing facilities around the globe to launch eProducts. And that gives us some flexibility from a facility, from a four-wall perspective. But we also are focusing a lot on flexible manufacturing, where we're not investing production equipment for a particular program, a particular customer but having several types of products flowing through production lines, whether it is power electronics-related, motor-related or, I would say, transmission- or iDMs-related. So we are pretty pleased with what we are doing as far as leveraging the existing capacities and capabilities, including human capabilities. Operator : Your next question comes from Dan Levy with Barclays. Dan Levy : One, just wondering on the ICE business itself. To the extent that that EV uptake is a little lighter in the near term than what some have anticipated and ICE is a little heavier, should we just think of the benefit to you as purely incremental sales flowing through at normal incremental margin? Is there any offset we should be thinking about that? Kevin Nowlan : Yes. I mean, I think it's fair to think about it in the short term much the same way we characterize it in the long term at Investor Day. I think we -- with the content opportunity per vehicle that we have on electrification, as the pace of electrification accelerates, it provides us an opportunity to grow our revenue more quickly, but it probably puts a little bit more pressure on the absolute margin percentage that we're delivering. But if electrification across the industry slows down a little bit, it probably slows the revenue growth, but it probably improves our margin profile. You saw that a little bit maybe here in the full year 2023 guidance that we have, but that's consistent with our long-term view as well. I think overall, taking a big step back, we feel like -- that's why we think our portfolio is really resilient from a financial perspective. Because whether EV adoption is accelerating or decelerating, the portfolio is positioned to deliver comparable levels of adjusted operating income over the long term under any of those outcomes. Dan Levy : Got it. And then as a follow-up, I wanted to just go to the question on sourcing that's been asked in the past. And I think one of the commentary that we heard from some of your OEM customers is that with a lighter EV outlook, this may change the way they are thinking about vertical integration within EVs, EV components, et cetera. Are you seeing any impact in your discussions on the automakers that previously may have been a bit more keen on vertical integration that are now realizing maybe they don't have a scale at this level of volumes that are more willing to engage with you as a partner on the EV powertrain components that they need? Frederic Lissalde : Dan, we're starting seeing that. And as you mentioned, I think this makes sense. We have a very solid and recognized portfolio. We're already incumbent at many customers, and we have the financial strength to support them. So I would not call it a trend, but I would say that we're seeing beginnings of discussion along those lines. And I would say that the major onboard charger business that we have announced today that we booked with a global North American OEM is a sign of that. Operator : Your next question comes from James Picariello with BNP Paribas. James Picariello : Can you just put a finer point on what the potential range in margin benefit could be associated with the lower eProduct revenue now slated for 2025? Because they should lead to additional ICE and hybrid business, assuming there's a decent overlap in your customer bases on both sides of the propulsion mix? Kevin Nowlan : We're not prepared to address a specific margin in 2025. I think we showed you, though, the long-term trajectory of what it could look like as you head out to 2030. We tend to think that we're going to operate into the mid-9s trending towards 10% margin as we look through our planning horizon and then being plus or minus that depending on where the ePropulsion markets actually go. But not prepared at this point to comment on '25. James Picariello : Okay. And then just on this year's guidance, we could, of course, quantify the impact to lower eProducts for you. But just high level, what else is driving the lower growth of the market because it cuts about 4 points? Like what element of this could be attributed to lower recoveries due to lower inflation versus customer and regional mix factors? Kevin Nowlan : Yes. I mean, overall, as we've talked about in the past, we're really focused on the organic growth. And before, we were guiding to 12% to 15% effectively, and now we're at 12% to 14%. So we feel pretty good about that. The biggest driver of the drop in revenue and any of outgrowth math that you would do is really that $300 million drop in the eProducts revenue outlook. We have also factored in some element of the impact of the UAW strike that we've incurred to date and assume that, that doesn't recover through the end of the year. It's less than $100 million, but it's still an impact on the company and embedded in the numbers as well. Operator : Your next question comes from Joseph Spak with UBS. Joseph Spak : Kevin, maybe just to follow up on that. That $100 million, that's a fourth quarter impact on the strike or a full year impact? Kevin Nowlan : Both. It's less than $100 million, but it's still an impact on the guide. But it's in the fourth quarter. We didn't really have any impact -- any material impact in Q3. Joseph Spak : Okay. And then I just want to circle back to sort of this whole slower eProducts ramp and the path to profitability. Like it seems like -- and you've communicated that a lot of your launches are in China, a lot of new business in China, where we really aren't seeing some of that slower growth. Obviously, there's some lower volume with some North American products. But I guess, I'm wondering why there would be such a meaningful impact to the profitability ramp, if that is the case. Or are you also sort of taking a more cautious view on some of the the pace of those Chinese and Asian ramps or -- and maybe some challenges given the quantity of the ramps and making sure you execute all those flawlessly? Frederic Lissalde : Joe, I think there is a difference between what we see in fine-tuning the timing of launches and ramp-up and overall, what you see in the Chinese market -- what you can read in the Chinese market. And so the impact of a quarter delay in a launch is 100% of impact in the quarter. And so that's why it's a little volatile. That's what I would tell you. This is what we see on the ground with slightly slower ramp-up and a few programs that are delayed by a few months. Kevin Nowlan : Joe, just to add to that. I mean, yes, as you look at -- we're still in the early days of growth from an electrification perspective at BorgWarner. And so those quarterly moves right now, until we get to more scale, have a significant impact. And as you look at right now through really 2025, maybe even into 2026, it's a big ramp-up phase for BorgWarner while we're still at a relatively modest level of revenue. And so some of those movements in launches and ramp-up timing can have a meaningful impact on the numbers in a quarter or for a particular year. Joseph Spak : And maybe just to follow up then, like of the reduction to the '25 eProducts, can you give us a sense regionally of where that's coming from? Is it predominantly North America and maybe a little bit of Europe? Or is it broad strokes across all the launches? Kevin Nowlan : In terms of the $300 million, you're saying? Joseph Spak : Yes, exactly -- no, in the '25 -- reductions in the '25. Kevin Nowlan : It's really across regions. I mean, we've gone back and, as Fred mentioned, taken a look program by program and looked at what we think the cadence is likely to be for some of those launches in light of some of the things that we're seeing in terms of near-term headwinds. And as we look at that and assess what we think the likely ramp up is, we think it probably puts us more on track towards that $5 billion level. But as Fred also indicated, the reason we're giving a range now as we've layered on an incremental risk to say what if there are further delays, particularly on the ePropulsion portfolio in terms of those launches getting delayed another X number of months. And that's what we've layered on to get to the $4.5 billion as a downside to that range. Operator : We have time for one final question, and that question comes from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Noah Kaye : Just first, wondering to follow up on that one, if we can get color. Just on the product mix in terms of programs being delayed or pushed out, if we think about the product mix for '25 in the adjusted revenue number, does this still skew heavily towards power electronics -- does it skew even more so? Is power electronics less represented versus some of the other programs? I'm just trying to understand where in the portfolio you're expecting relatively strong sell-through. Kevin Nowlan : Yes. I mean, I think as we look at where we think the biggest pressure is, most of it is really hitting in the ePropulsion segment. As we look at the battery pack business, for instance, we actually think -- continue to see really strong demand there relative to our prior planning assumptions. And it's really more of a supply-constrained situation there than a demand-constrained situation at the moment. So it does tend to be more in the ePropulsion segment where we're seeing some of the headwinds. Noah Kaye : Okay. That's very helpful. And second, just to touch on your M&A outlook. How does the dynamic that you're describing today impact your appetite to do further M&A? What is sort of the assumed M&A contribution now to the '25 outlook? I think at Investor Day, you had indicated there would be some additional M&A to be completed to support the outlook. Do you take a pause there? Do you assess what you have in the current portfolio? Just trying to understand. Frederic Lissalde : So we will always assess M&A from a technology standpoint. I would say that we are at the verge of closing a transaction that we've already announced that will give us even more strength on accessory power electronics. I would say that the current market does not change our appetite on M&A towards E. And I would say the current environment might also help us from a valuation perspective. And we're always going to stay very opportunistic along those lines but also very, very disciplined as we've always been. Patrick Nolan : Thank you all for your questions today. If you have any additional follow-ups, feel free to reach out to me or any member of my team. With that, Leo, you can conclude today's call. Operator : That does conclude the BorgWarner 2023 Third Quarter Results Conference Call. You may now disconnect.",

Patrick Nolan : Thank you, Savannah. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We issued our earnings release earlier this morning. It's posted on our website, borgwarner.com, both on our home page and our Investor Relations home page. With regard to our Investor Relations calendar, we will be attending multiple conferences between now and our next earnings release. Please see the Events section of our IR page for a full list. Before we begin I need to inform you that during this call, we may make forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties and details in our 10-K. Our actual results may differ significantly from the matters discussed today. During today's presentation, we will highlight certain non-GAAP measures in order to provide a clearer picture of how the core business performed and for comparison purposes with prior periods. When you hear us say on a comparable basis, that means excluding the impact of FX, net M&A and other non-comparable items. When you hear us say adjusted that means excluding non-comparable items. And finally, when you hear us say organic, that means excluding the impact of FX and net M&A. We will also refer to our growth compared to our market. When you hear us say market that means the change in light and commercial vehicle production weighted for our geographic exposure. Please note that we've posted today's earnings call presentation to the IR page of our website. We encourage you to follow along with these slides during our discussion. With that, I'm happy to turn the call over to Fred. Fred Lissalde : Thank you, Pat, and good day, everyone. We're pleased to share our results for 2023 and provide an overall company update, starting on Slide 5. With approximately $14 billion in sales, we delivered more than 12% organic growth in 2023. Our margin performance was strong, coming at the high end of our guide. During the course of '23, we adjusted our eProducts top line to reflect what we saw in the marketplace. It resulted in a slightly lower top line for the Company but higher margins. This is a good example of the product portfolio resilience that exists at BorgWarner. We delivered $565 million of free cash flow in 2023. This free cash flow supported the $177 million of share repurchases that we executed during the fourth quarter as well as the closing of the Eldor acquisition. Our challenging forward progress continues on multiple fronts. We secured multiple new eProduct awards during the fourth quarter, adding to the already announced over the course of the year. These awards were across our portfolio for both BEV and hybrid architectures. We continue to see a strong sourcing pool for our products based on the strength of our portfolio globally. Lastly, we took steps to enable new business awards by executing several strategic actions to further strengthen our eProduct portfolio, like the acquisition of Eldor Electronics business as well as the strategic agreement with BYD, FinDreams Battery for LFP packs outside of China. Now let's look at some new eProduct awards on Slide 6. First, BorgWarner has been selected by XPeng to supply its eMotor rotor and stator for the X9 MPV as well as for their next electric B-class sedan. Production began in January 2024 for the X9 and we're planning to start producing for the B-class sedan in Q3 '24. Our high-voltage hairpin 220E motor offers high power and torque density and higher efficiency at a competitive cost. We're excited to supply XPeng with our proven stator on rotor as we believe it continues to position us for long-term success in China, where NEV penetration is already more than 35% of the market. Second, BorgWarner has secured in the world with a major global OEM to extend its existing business, supplying 400-volt high-voltage coolant heaters for some of the automakers light vehicle based platforms, specifically for its passenger truck and SUV programs. This business win is one of the three awards with North American OEMs incorporating BorgWarner's high-voltage cooler and heaters into their vehicles. Third, BorgWarner has secured in the world with a major Chinese OEM to supply its 90-kilowatt dual inverter on a series of the automaker\u2019s plug-in hybrids and range extended electric vehicles. Production is expected to begin in September this year. The dual inverter is developed for hybrid vehicles as an integrated solution. The product utilizes BorgWarner's Viper power module platform and leverages our inverter product leadership and scale. Next, on Slide 7. In addition to securing new business, we took multiple steps to build additional capabilities within our eProduct portfolio, driving product leadership and differentiation. I would like to highlight three of them today. First, BorgWarner completed its acquisition of the electric hybrid systems segment of Eldor. This provides us with additional capabilities in onboard chargers, DC/DC converters and integrated high-voltage boxes, all of which are expected to complement BorgWarner's existing product portfolio in hybrids and BEV. Next, BorgWarner is continuing to expand its product portfolio for battery electric and hybrid commercial vehicles through our agreement to form a joint venture with Shaanxi Fast Auto Drive Group, a Weichai subsidiary. We're working together to accelerate the product efficiency and growth in the Chinese CV market with the largest CV powertrain supplier in China. BorgWarner will then be able to use these products and technologies for the rest of the world. Finally, BorgWarner signed an international strategic relationship agreement with BYD subsidiary, FinDreams Battery for LFP sales and tax. Under this agreement, BorgWarner will be the only non-OEM localized manufacturer unaffiliated with FinDreams Battery with rights to localize LFP battery packs for commercial vehicles, utilizing FinDreams Battery blade cells. These packs are expected to be sold in the CV market in Europe, the Americas and select Asia Pacific regions. The LFP battery chemistry is an exciting technology that is cost competitive in comparison with some other cell chemistries. We're seeing increased demand from our customers for tax with LFP sales. FinDreams Battery is right for BorgWarner in this area with over 20 years of experience in batteries with numerous successful product launches. Next, on Slide 8, I would like to summarize the growth we expect in our eProduct sales in 2024. We expect 2024 eProduct sales of $2.5 billion to $2.8 billion, representing a year-over-year growth of 25% to 40%. One important driver of our 2024 growth is expected to be our battery system product line. Battery Systems demand from our commercial vehicle customers, trucks and buses continues to outpace our ability to produce. However, we are continuing to increase our capacity to meet this strong customer demand, both in Seneca, North Carolina; and in Europe. We expect this capacity expansion to help drive a $250 million to $350 million increase in battery systems sales in 2024, which equates to 55% to 75% year-over-year growth with more to come. Then looking at the other parts of our eProduct portfolio, our guidance assumes 14% to 27% year-over-year growth, with the mid-point roughly in line with our expected BEV hybrid market growth. Overall, we expect 2024 to be a heavy year related to the number of launches across our light vehicle portfolio from iDM to motors from power electronics to thermal management globally for both BEVs and hybrids. While we expect another year of volatility in BEV and hybrids volume for the industry, we believe our capacity expansions and intense launch activities will support our outlook. Finally, on Slide 10. I want to take the opportunity to remind you of the intent of Charging Forward 2027. Charging Forward 2027 has three pillars; one, eProducts growth; two, eProduct profitability; and three, maximize the foundational value. The first two pillars centered around supporting BorgWarner's long-term profitable growth. We continue to believe that despite near-term volatility, the mid- to long-term trends towards electrification, BEV and hybrids remain strong. We believe that BorgWarner clearly positioning itself to be among the leaders in terms of eProduct business awards and to do so profitably. The third pillar of Charging Forward is an enabler of this long-term growth. Our foundational business brings customer relationship, technology capabilities and the ability to internally fund our investments. As importantly, with this leading market positions and strong margin profile, we believe our foundational business provides near-term earnings resiliency during times of BEV and hybrid market volatility just as we highlighted at our Investor Day back in June. As Kevin will review, that is evident both in our 2023 results and our 2024 outlook. The key takeaway is that both our eProducts and our foundational business lines play important role in Charging Forward 2027. This was true when we unveiled our plan in June and it remains true today. As I look back on 2023, my take is this : BorgWarner successfully managed another challenging environment during 2023. We delivered solid margins and strong free cash flow which is a sign of the product resiliency that we built. We successfully completed the spin-off of PHINIA. We secured new business awards that are supportive of our long-term revenue objectives in all types of electrification, powertrain architectures. We also secured some critical alliances, especially on the CV side with subsidiaries of Weichai for inverters and BYD for battery packs. We also continued to return capital to shareholders. BorgWarner has repurchased about 600 million of stock since completing the Delphi acquisition in 2020. And over the last four years, we have also returned about 600 million to shareholders in dividends. So BorgWarner has returned about $1.2 billion to shareholders since 2020 and that's before considering the tax-free spin-off PHINIA. Moving into 2024 and beyond. We are balancing near-term margins relative to our long-term objectives. We expect to manage our incremental margin holistically, while continuing to invest in our future growth. As we've always said, the industry growth in BEV and hybrids will not be a straight line. The near-term volatility is a long-term opportunity for the companies with the final strength, earnings resiliency, and the great product leadership focus, that BorgWarner processes. Our product portfolio is built for resiliency such that a longer combustion tail will help margin and cash generation. As a company, we are executing our Charging Forward 2027, which we expect will deliver value to our shareholders here and now and long into the future. This is Kevin's last earnings call with the Company, and I wanted to take a moment to personally thank him for his tremendous contribution to our company over the past years. Kevin has played an instrumental role in all of BorgWarner's recent major strategic initiatives ranging from the acquisition of Delphi to the creation and execution of Charging Forward as well as the spin-off of PHINIA. On behalf of the entire Board of Directors and the management team, I thank him for his contribution to our company, for his friendship and wish him a fantastic retirement. I look forward to Craig Aaron\u2019s stepping into the CFO role next month. I am confident Craig has the right skills, the deep knowledge of BorgWarner and our industry to execute our next chapter of profitable growth. With that, let me turn the call over to Kevin. Kevin Nowlan : Thank you, Fred, and good morning, everyone. Before I dive into the financials, I'd like to provide a quick overview of our fourth quarter results. First, revenue was at the midpoint of our guidance, supported by stronger-than-expected industry production in the quarter. Second, our margin performance was at the high end of our guidance, driven by strong conversion on higher revenue. And finally, we delivered strong free cash flow performance to finish out the year. Let's turn to Slide 10 for a look at our year-over-year revenue walk for Q4. Last year's Q4 revenue from continuing operations was just over $3.3 billion. You can see that the weakening U.S. dollar drove a year-over-year increase in revenue of almost 2% or $55 million. Then you can see the increase in our organic revenue, which was roughly 4.5% year-over-year. The reason why our growth wasn't stronger is that we were negatively impacted in the quarter by customer launch and ramp up the BEVs key eProduct programs in China, lower customer volumes on a North American EV program and lost sales due to the UAW strike in North America. Finally, the acquisitions of Eldor and SSE added $5 million to revenue year-over-year. The sum of all this was just over $3.5 billion of revenue in Q4. Turning to Slide 11. You can see our earnings and cash flow performance for the quarter. Our fourth quarter adjusted operating income was $332 million, equating to a 9.4% margin. That compares to adjusted operating income from continuing operations of $321 million or 9.7% from a year ago. On a comparable basis, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and the impact of M&A, adjusted operating income increased $16 million on $145 million of higher sales. This performance includes a planned eProduct-related R&D increase of $15 million. Excluding this higher R&D investment, we converted an approximately 21% on the organic sales increase. Our adjusted EPS from continuing operations was down $0.04 compared to a year ago as higher adjusted operating income was offset by a higher effective tax rate. Recall that our adjusted effective tax rate in Q4 of 2022 was only 18% lower than our typical tax rate. And finally, free cash flow from continuing operations was $679 million during the fourth quarter, which allowed us to deliver full year free cash flow of $565 million. On Slide 12, I'd like to take a moment to look at our 2023 results compared to the post-PHINIA spin-off guidance that we provided in June, because I think it provides a helpful look at the resilience we believe underlies our current product portfolio. You'll see that overall sales came in modestly below the midpoint of that guidance. While product sales fell short by about $400 million relative to the midpoint of our $2.3 billion to $2.6 billion guide, foundational sales largely offset this coming in about $300 million higher than the June guidance. However, the real evidence of our earnings resilience is in our adjusted operating margin performance. Despite the shortfall in sales relative to the midpoint of our June guidance, adjusted operating margin and adjusted operating income dollars came in above the midpoint of that June guidance. This demonstrates precisely the resiliency we've been speaking about since our Investor Day. If the products are weaker, then our revenue isn't going to grow as quickly, but our margin is likely going to be stronger, and that's what happened in the second half of 2023. Let's now turn to Slide 13. You can see our perspective on global industry production for 2024. We expect our global weighted light and commercial vehicle markets to be flat to down 2.5% this year. Looking at this by region, we're planning for our weighted North American markets to be down 1% to up 1%. In Europe, we expect our blended market to be down 2% to 4% year-over-year. And in China, we expect the overall market to be down 1% to up 1%. Now let's take a look at our full year outlook on Slide 14. First, it's important to note that our guidance assumes minimal impact from foreign currencies on full year sales. Second, as I previously mentioned, we expect our markets to be flat to down 2.5% for the year. Despite that, we expect to continue to deliver year-over-year organic sales growth, driven by growth in our product sales. Specifically, in 2024, we're expecting to deliver between $2.5 billion and $2.8 billion in eProduct sales, which is up significantly from the approximately $2 billion we generated in 2023. Finally, the Eldor acquisition is expected to add approximately $40 million to 2024 revenue. Based on these expectations, we're projecting total 2024 revenue in the range of $14.4 billion to $14.9 billion, which equates to organic growth of approximately 1% to 5%. Let's switch to margin. We expect our full year adjusted operating margin to be in the range of 9.2% to 9.6%. It's important to note that this guidance includes a negative operating income impact due to the Eldor acquisition. With Eldor, we purchased strong engineering capabilities that we believe more clearly puts us on the path to achieving product leadership in an addressable market that we expect will approach $30 billion by 2030. However, that business has very little revenue today, which means we'll be generating operating losses for the next few years. Excluding the impact of those Eldor related losses in 2024, we expect adjusted operating margin to be in the range of 9.6% to 9.9%, which compares to our 2023 margin of 9.6%. That implies the rest of the business delivering full year incremental to the mid- to high-teens, including our planned growth in ER&D. We believe this margin performance is a reflection of the underlying earnings power of the Company with the ability to manage costs and drive conversion even in the face of volatile beds and hybrid markets. Based on this revenue and margin outlook, we're expecting full year adjusted EPS from continuing operations in the range of $3.65 to $4 per diluted share. Turning to free cash flow, we expect we'll deliver free cash flow of $475 million to $575 million for the full year. The midpoint of this outlook is slightly lower than the $565 million we generated in 2023 due to a modest build in working capital that supports our revenue growth. That's our 2024 outlook. So let me summarize my financial remarks. Overall, we delivered a solid 2023 result despite volatility in EV markets and our associated product revenue. Our adjusted operating income and free cash flow performance shows the resilience of our portfolio. Specifically, when a product growth is under pressure, it's likely to be offset by stronger performance in the rest of the portfolio. Now as we look ahead to 2024, the Company will be keenly focused on delivering organic growth despite near-term volatility in the global BEV and hybrid markets and the expected softening of industry production, delivering strong incremental margin performance on an all-in basis, including our spending to support growth and continuing to make the prudent investments, both organic and inorganic, that we believe will help secure our growth and financial strength long into the future. This will be my last earnings call after five years working with Fred and the team to drive the transformation of BorgWarner. I'm proud that I can leave the Company in a moment, but I truly believe it's positioned to be a winner in the world of electrification across a variety of eProducts, which is probably not the case when I joined in 2019. With a resilient portfolio, I believe the Company is poised for long-term success no matter how the progression toward electrification plays out in the coming years. And as a result, I expect that will translate into value creation for our shareholders. I'd like to thank Fred and the team for the opportunity to be part of this journey, and I know I'm leaving the finance function in good hands with Craig. Finally, thanks to all of you in the investment community for our engagement over my last 11 years as a public company CFO. It's been a fun ride, and I've enjoyed the relationships I've had the chance to build with many of you over the years. With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Pat. Patrick Nolan : Thank you, Kevin. With that, we're ready to open up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from John Murphy with Bank of America. Please go ahead. John Murphy : Just a first question here. I understand you have to run a business and sometimes it makes sense in the volatile wall that we live in to take a slightly conservative tack. But if I were to tell you, instead of your volumes being flat to down 2.5%, they might be flat to up 2.5%. At the midpoint of the range, that would add about $355 million in revenue to your outlook. Would it be reasonable to sort of assume that those could convert about 15% to 20% incremental margin, and that would kind of really translate into about 5% upside to earnings and potentially cash flow. Is that a reasonable way to think about it, if that were to happen? Kevin Nowlan : It's a reasonable way to think about it. Yes, I mean our guide is promised on our expectation that our markets are flat to down 2.5%. But if markets come in stronger, we fully expect that we would execute on that, deliver the revenue and convert on it. And you can see the conversion on an all-in basis implied in our guide is a mid-teens conversion. And so, if we see upside revenue, you should expect to see us converting on that incremental revenue. John Murphy : And then just a quick follow-up. I mean the market is shifting all over the place, although it's not moving as quickly as it's kind of some of the commentary would lead you to believe. If we saw a greater hybrid penetration not just in 2024, but maybe in 2025 and beyond, Fred, is there potentially a shift in cap allocation and slightly in strategy that you could execute and not leave capital stranded? I mean, how sensitive are you to shifts between EVs and hybrids? And how much would you have to ship the strategy and cap allocation? Fred Lissalde : The products for the each side of hybrids are similar than the products on BEV. They are the same motors, the same power electronics, they are the same transmission cases, they are the same high-voltage coolant heaters. So, it's from an R&D perspective, it's extremely fungible, they're the same engineers, and from a capital standpoint, it's pretty fungible too. So, we've developed an eProduct portfolio that is, I would say, very fungible across hybrids and BEV very much so. Operator : Question will come from [Technical Difficulty] Unidentified Analyst : Just talking on contribution margins, it does come out to something like a 16% if you exclude Eldor. Any other puts and takes you mentioned R&D, how much of a headwind is there, any commodity or labor issues that we should be thinking about? And then when we think about Eldor, when does this drag start to go away? Or is that sort of going to be here for several years? Kevin Nowlan : With respect to the year-over-year conversion in '24, there's nothing unusual to really think about. I mean you're right, we're looking at the mid-teens and that is on an all-in basis. If you look at -- we are investing a little bit more in eProduct R&D again in 2024. It will be up organically about $40 million to $50 million, but that's embedded within that conversion. So we're looking at our conversion now given the scale of the business from an eProduct perspective on an all-in basis, and we expect to contribute in the mid-teens with that in mind. Unidentified Analyst : And Eldor, any thoughts on when that moderate? Fred Lissalde : So let me take a step back here. I think Borg is very good at taking great technologies and commercializing them and globalizing them. Look at what we've done with Delphi, look at what we've done with Akasol, which was -- which literally had lower revenue. This year, we had about $750 million at the midpoint. The plan with Eldor on DC/DC converters on both charges is exactly that. And so, I'm very optimistic about the drive that we can generate and profitable growth that we can generate from the engineering base that we acquired with Eldor. Kevin Nowlan : And maybe I'd just add to that, [Colin], this is something we anticipated when we gave guidance back at our Investor Day as well because Eldor was well in flight and we knew that would have an impact on our margin in the short term, position us for long-term success in a $30 billion addressable market in 2030, so it is impacting the near term. But over time, as we start to have some success in that business looking to the next few years out, it will start to be a positive for us, but that's still several years away. We expect to have operating losses in that business for the next couple of years as we were support the R&D necessary to support our capitalizing on that business. Unidentified Analyst : And just you touched today on this year's guidance being sort of flexible between EV and ICE profitability. And at your Investor Day, you talked about '27 same dynamics of it, EV mix is higher to sort of offset higher or lower, you'd add a dollar basis to be similar in '27. But you're still forecasting like a fivefold increase in your EV powertrain sales through I mean that would imply probably a lot of ER&D as you try to prepare for those launches. So is that flexibility going to be consistent over the midterm? Or is there going to be some puts and takes because you have some pretty chunky R&D needs to get ready for that $10 billion that you talked about in '27? Kevin Nowlan : Yes. When you look at the eProduct related R&D, as we've mentioned in the past, we thought the real peak in that was going to be in 2022 in terms of the growth in the eProduct R&D. You might remember, it stepped up $150 million that year. But then we said we expect the pace of the growth in the R&D to step down year-over-year. And you can see that happening. Last year, it stepped up about $60 million so not as big an increase as what we saw in 2022. And as we look ahead to '24, it's going to step up about $40 million to $50 million organically. So the pace of the growth in that ER&D is definitely slowing but still growing because it's supporting our ability to successfully launch and ramp up programs as well as to capitalize on continued profitable opportunity down to the future. So, we think the pace of what we're seeing right now is supportive of our long-term outlook for electrification. Operator : Our next question will come from Joe Spak with UBS. Joe Spak : I guess I wanted to sort of touch on a couple of the midterm factors here in light of what's going on in your strategy. So first, if I look at Slide 13 and I look at combustion plus hybrid of the industry, you're showing about a 4% decline roughly at the industry level. Your implied foundational revenue growth is like minus 1.5%. So that's like 2% to 3% at growth. Is that like a reasonable level of outperformance on the foundational stuff as ICE continues to decline over the coming years? And can you still hit that 13% foundational margin target that you laid out if ICE continues to decline? Fred Lissalde : So I would say, Joe, that we're outgrowing the inflational side by about 300 basis points. I would tell you that on the side, I see more upside than downside at this point in time. And we are constantly as we presented a few months ago and as we review the team regularly, we're constantly restructuring in a position of strength. And that, I believe, will allow us to maintain the foundation of margins as it is called by our third pillar of Charging Forward. Joe Spak : And then I guess a second question maybe to build off of [Colin's] [ph] question a little bit. Let's call it, $2.5 billion eProducts guidance for this year. Your prior '25 was $4.5 billion to $5 billion. So that looks like a big jump. So maybe a couple of things there like it seems like maybe some of that product launches through the year. So maybe the '24 exit rate is a better sense. And I don't know if you would agree with that. And I guess just secondly, is that sort of '25 level for your products still attainable? I mean, it doesn't seem like the market really believes it is, but I'd be curious to understand how year-over-year. Fred Lissalde : So if you take the CV packs, growing 65% CAGR year-over-year. And we are ramping up in U.S. significantly in Q2 and in Europe at the end of the year and more to come. So I would say that the end of 2024 jump-off point on CV is much higher than the current year. On light-vehicle, roughly 60% of the programs that we've disclosed so far, we're launching this year or we've launched at the tail end of last year. So even if there is some variability possible, I think you're right, the jump-off point at the end of this year is going to be from a much bigger base on a light-vehicle standpoint, as it is, I just alluded to on the CV side. So I would say that if the customer volumes are holding as our country forecasting, we would expect to be within that range in 2025. Joe Spak : Obviously, in volatile market we need to monitor but based on what you see now and sort of the growth through the year on what you just sort of talked about, it still seems achievable? Fred Lissalde : For now, we're focusing on '24. We're launching so many products. We're focusing on '24, and we'll let you know what we think finally on '25 in due course. '24 is our focus, but I just wanted to give you the color of the different building blocks between CV and light vehicles. Operator : Our next question will come from Rod Lache with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Rod Lache : I just want to, first of all, confirm on the question that Joe just asked is based on the growth in eProducts and in a flat market, it would appear that there's some moderation in the foundational business, but you are maintaining that 13% margin. So you're not delevering? And secondly, can you remind us what's embedded for M&A within the eProducts revenue target for 2025? I'm referring to the $4.5 billion to $5 billion. Fred Lissalde : So I'll take the second part of the question. There is no M&A in the $4.5 billion to $5 billion. It is booked business. There is a significant portion of about $2 billion of M&A in 2027. Kevin Nowlan : And then on the foundational margin, one of our key strategies is that we know over time, as electrification continues to grow at the expense of underlying combustion-based technology that will put pressure over time on our revenue outlook. And our challenge is to make sure we're managing the cost structure of that business I should even say the overall P&L of that business, whether that's on the price side or the cost side to make sure we're delivering and sustaining our margin profile, we fully expect that to be the case as we go through 2024 and well beyond that. Rod Lache : And maybe just bigger picture, when we take a step back and you kind of analyze the regulatory requirements for your light vehicle customers, I'm curious if you have any thoughts on how much flexibility the OEMs really have to defer electric vehicles? Do you think that they would be able to shift to plug-ins or hybrids to a much greater extent? And are you seeing any benefit from the fact that you have a lot of kind of off-the-shelf hybrid technology? Which if these are sort of late decisions, I would imagine they might accelerate. Fred Lissalde : Yes. So for customers, I think most probably you need to ask them. I think there is some flexibility. We are hearing commentaries as you do that in the U.S., there is some intention to report hybrids outside of the U.S., hybrid is a big portion of the new energy vehicles. In China, it\u2019s 30% to 40%. In Europe, it's a big percentage, too. What's important to me is that we've built a product portfolio that is totally fungible across hybrid and BEV. R&D is the same engineers, power electronics, motors, transmission, thermal, it's the same thing. For us, it does not matter. We can support our customers to wherever they want to go. Rod Lache : So Fred, just to clarify, are you actually seeing that? We're reading about it. We're hearing about this increased interest in the U.S? Are your customers now sort of accelerating activity with you in that area? Fred Lissalde : Rod, I think it's a little too early to see the communication and the RFQ materializing on the hybrid side. But I would say that with the scale that we have in our eProducts that cuts the grass hybrid, different types of hybrids and BEV, we can be one of the enablers of a rapid launch of hybrid powertrain for those customers. Operator : Your next question will come from Dan Levy with Barclays. Dan Levy : And maybe we could just start with Eldor, the broader M&A strategy, specifically, how are you managing, I guess, we could say the integration deals because you have done a lot in the way of M&A. What is the process for integration? How do you manage any integration risks? And then maybe you could just remind us on Eldor, are these losses in line with what you originally anticipated? Or is this a function of maybe a weaker EV environment than when you originally did the deal? Fred Lissalde : So first of all, the financial profile of Eldor was fully comprehended when we did the due diligence and it was fully comprehended into the views of our financials. Integrating companies becoming, I think, a real strength of BorgWarner. And we do that in a very disciplined way, and we're doing it with a very disciplined way with Eldor too. We are locating BorgWarner people on location. And we are managing the business starting Day one where we've owned Eldor for a couple of months now. But we are going to just manage the Eldor business as we manage the BorgWarner business with financial discipline. There are attractive businesses in onboard chargers, DC/DC converter and one-box, which again is totally the same products, either it's hybrid or BEV. And we see a lot of pools and a large event from our customers in those electronics technologies too. Dan Levy : And maybe I'll just piggyback on that, Dan, back to the losses being in line. Keep in mind, if you look at what's implied in our guidance this year, we're at 9.6% to 9.9% without Eldor and as we look out the 2027, we thought we were on track to be a 10% margin business. So, we'd already be on the cusp of that without doing Eldor, but Eldor was contemplated that and -- impacting us to the tune of 30 to 40 basis points in the short term because we knew we were investing in a strong engineering shop that doesn't have a lot of revenue today. And so that was contemplated in our original guidance. Dan Levy : And then maybe just as a follow-up on that. Given we've seen some shifts in product plans, maybe you could just give us a sense of what the go-forward capital allocation? I mean, Fred, you mentioned a moment ago that there's $2 billion of M&A assumed in the 2027 targets. I know we're not going to get an update on that today. But maybe you can give us a sense of how this environment shifts what your appetite is for perhaps, how does the capital allocation change? And what else is remaining that still isn't in your portfolio from a capability or product or customer exposure standpoint that still would require some M&A? Fred Lissalde : I would say that the capital allocation strategy is pretty much unchanged. We are looking at M&A as an important part of strengthening electrification capabilities. We are very disciplined in the way we look at M&A. We are looking at way more companies than we're actually putting the trigger on. And we think that the current environment could provide some attractive buying opportunities and be rest assured that we will include and consider the near-term impact in the valuation assessment. We are looking at M&As with discounted cash flows. We're taking those near-term impacts are really importantly, the policy on capital allocation also includes the dividends that we've left unchanged even during covet. We've repurchased stocks and buyback is start of the strategy. I alluded to in my prepared remarks on how much we've given back to our shareholders and the spin-off of PHINIA, which I think was a great success. It is also part of the capital allocation strategy. Kevin, do you want to add anything? Kevin Nowlan : No, I think that's it. Operator : Our next question will come from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Adam Jonas : Just two simple questions. First one, what portion of your 2024 budget of CapEx and R&D is allocated to eSystems? Kevin Nowlan : We don't really break that out, but publicly in terms of what we've been disclosing in terms of an overall R&D or CapEx allocated that way. But what I would tell you is, if you look at R&D first and foremost, we invested about $475 million in eProduct-related R&D in 2023 versus the $700 million or $715 million or so of R&D in total. As we look ahead to '24 organically, we'll add another $40 million to $50 million there from eProduct R&D perspective. And you can expect that the foundational based R&D will probably come down a little bit on a year-over-year basis as it's been doing the last few years. So the R&D will continue to be increasingly weighted towards eProduct, and it is the majority of the investment. From a capital perspective, you can see we stepped up our capital investment last year pretty meaningfully, a couple of hundred million dollars relative to 2022, and that was really focused on investing in some of the eProduct portfolio ramp ups that we needed, particularly within our ePropulsion segment as well as our battery pack business and you'll see a comparable level of investment in capital in 2024 going toward that. I think these will be a couple of the peak years of investment from a CapEx perspective, particularly on that battery pack business. And then you'll probably see it come back down a little bit to more normalized levels as we hit '25 and beyond. Fred Lissalde : And then what's really important is to understand that the RMB CapEx are for EV and hybrids. And again, I'd say it's wonderful times, the products are the same for us in light vehicle, whether it goes in the hybrid or above. It's the same people it's the same R&D, it's the same CapEx. Adam Jonas : And then just going to temp on that point, Fred, that there are many aspects of eSystems that are agnostic between BEV and hybrid, I'll ask you -- I won't hold you to specifics, but what would be your best guess or a range of how much of your 2024 eSystems and foundational business are going into hybrid include plug-in hybrids? If you were to isolate just hybrid specifically before some of your foundational stuff increasingly is going into hybrids as well, as we all know. So I didn't know if you could isolate a guess of how much hybrid would account for the revenue in '24? A range would be great. Kevin Nowlan : Yes. I guess maybe just a couple from me. I think Pat can come back to you on the details. But what I would say is when you look at the $2.5 billion to $2.8 billion guide, the first thing I'd say is off the top the $700 million to $800 million associated with battery is all EV. It's EV in the commercial space in the CV space. So then what you're really looking at is the other $1.8 billion to $2 billion of eProduct revenue, and we'll come back to you with the specific breakdown. I don't want to put a number and have it a little bit off. Operator : Our next question will come from James Picariello with BNP Paribas. James Picariello : Just a clarification question first. So based on the margin guidance, excluding Eldor, the implied loss rate for Eldor this year is roughly $50 million, is that right? And then in addition to that impact, you're stepping up organic products R&D by $40 million to $50 million. So all in at an additional $90 million to $100 million in spend, is that right? Kevin Nowlan : Roughly, yes. The portion of the Eldor loss, that's engineering related it's somewhere around $40 million. So you're right, it's $40 million to $50 million of organic step-up of to the R&D. And then Eldor adds about another $40 million, the overall loss and Eldor is around -- the midpoint is around what you said. James Picariello : And then can you just confirm what the eProduct margin was in 2023? And then based on what we just covered, is it possible eProduct losses are close to flat year-over-year? Just how should we be thinking about that? Or asked another way, part of the impetus behind separating out of the propulsion was to provide that clarity and transparency on the product progression. Is there a segment-specific guidance to share maybe on the ePropulsion? Kevin Nowlan : We're not going to give any segment-specific guidance this year. But what I would say, when you look at the ePropulsion segment, obviously, we were focused on driving toward breakeven in the fourth quarter of last year. That was the guidance as we started out the year last year, and that was truly premised on our ability to successfully convert on the incremental revenue and we were disappointed that we had to pull back on that when we saw some of the volatility in the eMarkets and how that was impacting our revenue. So as we ended the year, you can see when you look at the ePropulsion segment, we ended up coming in at about $540 million of revenue in the fourth quarter, which is about $200 million to $300 million short of our original guidance when we were expecting to get to break even. So that business ended up losing about I think $16 million or so in the fourth quarter. I think what gives us some comfort in the way we're managing the profitability of that business is the fact that we were down $200 million to $300 million in revenue versus our original guidance. If we had simply let contribution margin flow through on that lower revenue, we probably would have had a bigger loss than $16 million in the quarter. So I think we feel good about the fact that we're managing the profitability of that business in light of some of the near-term volatility. But ultimately, the path to breakeven into long-term profitability of that business comes from successfully converting on the incremental revenue. And what we take a lot of comfort in is that we see the contribution margin really flowing through the business. I mean you can see it in the 2024 guide right? We're converting on an all-in basis at mid-teens. And all of the growth in 2024 is coming from the eBusinesses. So, we see the underlying fundamentals of the profitability coming through it. So as we scale that business, we see the path towards the profitability objectives of the Company intact for that portfolio. Operator : Our next question will come from Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank. Emmanuel Rosner : I was hoping to follow up on the incremental margins. And just trying to understand a little bit how the math would work for the foundational side of your business. So, we've basically reached a point that where within your 2024 guidance, foundation revenues are already down, I guess, even with the growth of the market. And so I guess, how should we think about contribution margin within foundational? Like does it become sort of like the decremental margin? Do you need sort of like restructuring to sort of like offset this? And if I think about some of our [indiscernible] basically cash-in decisions in the future? Like how quickly can you go from having sort of incremental, if the volume plays out better versus having to sort of like restructure to offset any potential downside? Kevin Nowlan : I mean with respect to the foundational business, implicitly, you're right. The revenue is down a little bit. Year-over-year, somewhere in our guidance implicitly around $60 million to $260 million, which means we're down about 0.5 point to 2 points in that portfolio year-over-year. If you look at the underlying markets that those products support being the combustion and hybrid markets, those are down anywhere from 3% to 6% on a year-over-year basis. So we are outperforming those markets as those are going down a little bit year-over-year, but we are seeing a revenue line. And as you know, at our Investor Day, we talked about our expectation that overtime, we're going to see revenue in the foundational portfolio is coming under some pressure. And what we needed to do is make sure we're managing that P&L holistically, pricing cost restructuring to make sure that we would sustain that margin profile over time. And we fully expect to do that and we expect to execute that in '24 as well as all the way through the end of the Charging Forward plan. Fred Lissalde : I would add one thing is that on the combustion side. We don't really see no new -- we don't really see new engines or new transmissions being developed. It is more a longer life or slightly higher volume on the current product. So even if combustion, as you mentioned, may go back up or longer tail that doesn't prevent us to adjust the [SA] and the engineering as I mentioned, of the foundational P&L. Emmanuel Rosner : Just to make sure I understand, so 2024 could help us really understand also the mid- or longer-term picture because you have a guidance obviously about it, but so you mentioned this mid-teens incremental margins all in for this year. Any way to directionally think about it on what does that does look like on a foundational versus new eProduct because, obviously, as I mentioned, foundational is actually down revenues and then eProduct is up a lot. So what does that look like? And I think you could help us a little bit better understand how you manage this going forward. Kevin Nowlan : I mean, fundamentally, we're not going to break out the details in terms of our guide, but fundamentally, in order for us to execute on our foundational margin profile over the coming years in line with Charging Forward. It means we need to decrement on an all-in basis in that mid-teens. And for our eProduct portfolio to deliver on its margin expectations we need to convert in the mid-teens. And I think you see the blend of that actually coming through the financials and the P&L in our '24 guidance. Operator : And we have time for one final question, and that question will come from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Noah Kaye : First, just a clarification, what was said earlier. You talked about really this year in [indiscernible] kind of the peak for CapEx, is that meant to be CapEx in absolute dollars? Should we think about sort of reversion to more like 5% of sales on a go-forward basis, that being the '26, '27? I'm just trying to understand the intent of your comments. Kevin Nowlan : Yes. Fair question, I mean, typically, we've run in the past at 5%. We've had years where we've dipped below, and we've been in the 4.5% to 5% range. But then you see the last couple of years, we've been elevated running closer to 6% than 5%. My expectation over time is that as we get to more of a normalized run rate environment, we're probably coming back down toward that 5% range. Noah Kaye : And then, Fred, there was good color earlier on the battery pack expectations for this year. But I'd honestly love to delve a little bit more into where you're at in terms of tooling and automation, staffing up cell supply to just help us understand your true visibility into the production ramp as you go throughout the year? Fred Lissalde : Yes, we are ramping up a second production line in Seneca, North Carolina. We have our first production line in the Michigan area. This is ramping up in Q2. And the same line is being commissioned for Europe, and this will ramp up data in the year. And that is the 65% year-over-year growth at the midpoint for those daypacks. The demand is much higher than what we can produce. And we don't see in the commercial vehicle, any noise of any slowdown whatsoever to the contrary. So that's pretty much what we're doing on the very back. We don't see any issues on sales of the play. And all that is reviewed and monitored very in a very focused way and a very precise way. Noah Kaye : Maybe I can ask one more. It's more generally to help our understanding of your insights into customer behavior given the shifting dynamics around powertrain of choice versus increase in labor costs for some of the OEMs well publicized in North America, but more broadly, how has this translated to the customer expectations around pricing versus value proposition. Do you still feel comfortable in being able to hit the ROIC target, but you've always quoted for this program. Is there anything that you'd call out in terms of kind of customer expectations and there you're in right now? Fred Lissalde : Noah, I think we're always quoting businesses with 15% return on invested capital. We have volume based closes and everything that I see is tending towards meeting those 15% return on invested capital, and we very experienced on how to do that. For us, it doesn't change whether it is a new product or eProduct, the rules are all the same. Patrick Nolan : Thank you all for your great questions today. If you have any follow ups, feel free to reach out to me or my team. With that, Savannah, you can go ahead and close today's call. Operator : And that does conclude the BorgWarner 2023 Fourth Quarter and Full Year Results Conference Call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Britney, and I will be your conference facilitator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BorgWarner 2024 First Quarter Results Conference Call.  [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Patrick Nolan, Vice President of Relations. Mr. Nolan, you may begin your conference. Patrick Nolan : Thank you, Britney. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We issued our earnings release earlier this morning. It's posted on our website, borgwarner.com, both on our home page and on our Investor Relations homepage. With regard to our Investor Relations calendar, we will be attending multiple conferences between now and our next earnings release. Please see the Events section of our Investor Relations homepage for a full list.  Before we begin, I need to inform you that during this call, we may make forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties as detailed in our 10-K. Our actual results may differ significantly from the matters discussed today.  During today's presentation, we'll highlight certain non-GAAP measures in order to provide a clearer picture of how the core business performed and for comparison purposes with prior periods. When you hear us say on a comparable basis, that means excluding the impact of FX, net M&A and other noncomparable items. When you hear us say adjusted, that means excluding noncomparable items. When you hear us say organic, that means excluding the impact of FX and net M&A.  We will also refer to our incremental margin performance. Our incremental margin is defined as the organic change in our adjusted operating income divided by the organic change in our sales. Our all-in incremental includes our planned investment in eR&D, any impact on net inflationary impacts and other cost items.  Lastly, we refer to our growth compared to our market. When you hear us say market, that means the change in light and commercial vehicle production weighted for our geographic exposure. Please note that we posted today's earnings call presentation to the IR page of our website. We encourage you to follow along with these slides during our discussion. With that, I'm happy to turn the call over to Fred. Frederic Lissalde : Thank you, Pat, and good day, everyone. I'm very pleased to share our results for the first quarter of 2024 and provide an overall company update, starting on Slide 5. With approximately $3.6 billion in sales, we delivered close to 7% organic growth in the quarter despite a modest industry decline. We delivered strong incremental performance in the quarter on an all-in basis, which allowed us to achieve a 9.4% margin. This Q1 performance provides a nice start to the year, and we believe it positions us well to deliver on our full year guidance.  Additionally, we continue to take steps in the quarter to create longer value for our shareholders. We secured multiple new eProduct awards. These awards once again demonstrate our focus on taking the leading-edge technology, working closely with our customers to help support them as they transition towards electrification. And as I will discuss, we continued to expand our product offerings for electrified vehicles. We focused on the efficient deployment of our capital by repurchasing $100 million of stock during the first quarter, as Craig will highlight, we received an increased share repurchase authorization of $500 million from our Board of Directors.  Now, let's look at some new eProduct awards on Slide 6. First, BorgWarner secured additional eMotor award with Xpeng. These awards include BorgWarner's 800 volts eMotor systems comprised of stator and rotor components, which are customized for use on 2 upcoming SUV models. Start of production is planned for 2025. BorgWarner's HVH220 eMotor offers high torque density, enhanced efficiency and superior durability. We are thrilled to extend our eMotor business with Xpeng and build upon on our strong partnership with them.  Next, I would like to highlight a new product line for electrified vehicles, which is our electric Torque Vectoring Disconnect or eTVD. BorgWarner secured new business awards with Polestar and an additional major European OEM, supply eTVD for their battery electric vehicles. eTVD is currently in production for the Polestar 3 SUV and production for the major European OEM is expected to begin later in 2024. The eTVD offers a 3-in-1 system, replacing the differential and featuring both torque vectoring and an on-demand disconnect functionality for and BEVs and hybrids. eTVD is part of BorgWarner's electric Torque Management System portfolio which helps improve electrified vehicles' traction and stability. The added weight in hybrids and battery electric vehicles often results in reduced agility and safety performance. BorgWarner Systems helps overcome this by enabling a lighter feel and increasing traction, which improves safety. The eTVD is a great example of applying our foundational expertise and capabilities to develop an innovative solution to address our customers' needs as they transition towards electrification. Now I want to take a few moments to remind you of the strength of our foundational portfolio on Slide 7. First, it's important to highlight BorgWarner's estimated average content opportunity for combustion vehicle, which is approximately $550 on a global basis. You'll note that this content opportunity varies by region. I would point out that our content opportunity in North America is the highest of the 3 major regions we operate in. So to the extent that combustion vehicles have a longer tail in North America, that could provide a positive sales, margin and cash flow tailwind for BorgWarner. We also continue to see potential opportunities for growth across our foundational portfolio, which had a 2023 revenue of about $12 billion. I would like to list just a few. In turbo, we continue to see North American opportunities as penetration in the region is about 44% compared to 92% penetration in Europe and 69% penetration in China. If EV growth slows in North America, the remaining combustion vehicles may need to improve efficiency, and turbocharging is one of the biggest enablers to make this happen.  For our EGR business, we see penetration opportunities on hybrid architectures. The efficiency benefit of EGR on cooling on hybrids is higher than traditional combustion-only vehicles as the internal combustion engine operates in a steadier state. Our timing system business also sees penetration opportunities in plug-in hybrids and range-extended EVs as engine timing chain is the preferred technology in those hybrids due to its superior durability and strength.  And finally, we see our all-wheel drive business benefiting from penetration score on combustion vehicles in Southeast Asia and from a longer tail for North American vehicles. Maximizing the value of our foundational products means capitalizing on these potential growth opportunities, while at the same time, maintaining the strong margin and cash profiles of these businesses.  Now let's turn to Slide 8 and take a step back. Let's discuss how we believe our foundational and eProduct portfolios are positioned for growth under various combustion, hybrid or BEV growth scenarios. Starting with our combustion or foundational portfolio, which are on the top left of the slide, BorgWarner has decades of experience in product leadership in these fields. We have a #1 or #2 market share for these products and can support our customers around the globe. This is critically important as customers potentially consolidate their supply base and look to industry leaders that have the financial strength and long-term technology leadership to support them.  Let's jump to the right side of this page where you see the breadth of our eProduct portfolio. This portfolio has grown organically through M&A over the past several years. We have systematically built a technology-focused portfolio that supports our customers' needs in EVs from grid to wheel. This has allowed us to establish product leadership in multiple areas of our portfolio, including inverters, eMotors, high-voltage coolant heaters and batteries. We expect that our technological differentiation, scale and share leadership will continue to enable us to secure new business.  Quite simply, our foundational and eProduct portfolio support hybrid propulsion since the hybrid vehicle needs both, a downside combustion engine as well as an electric powertrain. We can utilize the expertise of both our portfolios to support our customers which we are already doing successfully in Europe and in China.  Importantly, when we sell products for hybrid applications, we're able to utilize the same engineering resources, modular design, manufacturing footprint and sometimes even actual product lines that are utilized for BEVs and combustion vehicles. We believe BorgWarner is well positioned to be successful under various electrification adoption scenarios, including regional specificities.  Our product has been purposefully built for this type of an environment, we will focus on achieving above-market growth regardless of varying levels of electrified propulsion adoption. Our focus is to convert growth into income at the mid- to high-teens level on an all-in basis. To summarize, the takeaways from today are this : BorgWarner's first quarter results were strong. Our sales growth once again outperformed the industry, and we delivered strong conversion on an all-in basis. We secured multiple new eProduct awards in the quarter, which further demonstrate our product leadership position. We focused on efficient powertrains, and we believe that we have a resilient portfolio of products that allows us to convert mid- to high teens wherever the incremental revenue comes from. And we continue to return capital to our shareholders through our first quarter share repurchases and increased authorization from our Board. As we look forward, we expect to continue to manage our business holistically. We plan to take the necessary steps to manage our costs while continuing to preserve our long-term profitable growth. While we cannot control the near-term volatility in propulsion mix across the globe, we can focus on what BorgWarner does best, driving sales growth above market production through technology-focused product leadership, converting that growth into earnings on an all-in basis and following a balanced capital allocation strategy that creates long-term value for our shareholders.  With that, I will turn the call over to Craig. Craig Aaron : Thank you, Fred, and good morning, everyone. Before I dive into the financials, I'd like to provide a quick overview of our first quarter results. First, we reported close to 7% organic sales growth despite a modest decline in industry volume. Second, we had strong margin performance, which was driven by solid conversion on higher revenue as well as appropriately managing our costs. This led to a year-over-year incremental conversion of over 23% on an all-in basis.  Now, let's turn to Slide 9 for a look at our year-over-year sales walk for Q1. Last year's Q1 sales from continuing operations was just under $3.4 billion. You can see that the strengthening U.S. dollar drove a year-over-year decrease in sales of almost 1% or $32 million. Then you can see the increase in our organic sales which was up roughly 7% year-over-year driven by growth in China and in Europe. Finally, the acquisitions of Eldor and SSE added $11 million to sales year-over-year. The sum of all this was just under $3.6 billion of sales in Q1.  Turning to Slide 10. You can see our earnings and cash flow performance for the quarter. Our first quarter adjusted operating income was $339 million, equating to a 9.4% margin. That compares to adjusted operating income from continuing operations of $305 million or a 9% margin from a year ago. On a comparable basis, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and M&A, adjusted operating income increased $54 million on $233 million of higher sales. That translates to an all-in incremental margin of roughly 23%, driven by our higher year-over-year sales and strong cost controls. The net impact of M&A was a $12 million drag on operating income year-over-year.  Our adjusted EPS from continuing operations was up $0.22 compared to a year ago as a result of higher adjusted operating income, a decline in our effective tax rate and the impact of our recent share repurchases on our share count. And finally, free cash flow from continuing operations was a usage of $308 million during the first quarter, which was a higher usage than a year ago as our working capital performance was impacted by the timing of customer collections due to the Easter holiday as well as the timing of tax payments. Now let's take a look at our full year outlook on Slide 11. Starting with foreign currencies. Our guidance now assumes an expected full year sales headwind from weaker foreign currencies of $100 million compared to 2023. This also is a sales headwind of $100 million versus our prior guidance with the Chinese renminbi and Korean won being the largest drivers of the change in our outlook.  Next, we expect organic growth of approximately 2% to 5% year-over-year compared to our prior guidance of 1% to 5%. This increase is predominantly driven by strong sales growth in the first quarter. Within this guidance, our full year end market assumptions of flat to down 2.5% is unchanged. Additionally, we continue to expect to deliver between $2.5 billion to $2.8 billion eProduct sales, which is up significantly from approximately $2 billion in 2023. Finally, the Eldor and SSE acquisitions are expected to add approximately $30 million to 2024 sales. Based on these expectations, we're projecting total 2024 sales in the range of $14.4 billion to $14.9 billion, which is in line with our prior guidance despite the additional FX headwinds. Now let's switch to margin. We continue to expect our full year adjusted operating margin to be in the range of 9.2% to 9.6%. Excluding the impact of Eldor-related losses in 2024, our outlook contemplates the business delivering full year incrementals in mid- to high teens on an all-in basis. We believe this margin performance reflects the underlying earnings power of our company and our focus on delivering strong conversion on higher sales while also appropriately managing costs.  Based on this sales and margin outlook, we're expecting full year adjusted EPS in the range of $3.80, $4.15 per diluted share. This increase compared to our prior outlook is being driven by the impact of our share repurchases and full year share count and a reduction in our tax rate outlook compared to our prior guidance.  Turning to free cash flow. We continue to expect that we'll deliver free cash flow of $475 million to $575 million for the full year.  Let's turn to Slide 12 and discuss our recently increased share repurchase authorization. As Fred highlighted in his opening remarks, we repurchased approximately $100 million in BorgWarner stock during the first quarter. This brings our share repurchases since 2020 to approximately $733 million. In addition, our Board of Directors approved an increase in our share repurchase authorization of up to $500 million over the next 3 years. When combined with the $267 million remaining under our prior authorization, management has the ability to repurchase up to $767 million of the company's outstanding shares.  In addition to the share repurchases I just highlighted, we have also returned about $623 million to shareholders in dividends since the start of 2020. We also completed the tax-free spin-off PHINIA, which returned roughly $1.7 billion of additional capital to shareholders. Adding this all together, BorgWarner has distributed roughly $3.1 billion of capital to shareholders since 2020, while also investing in the company's future.  A return of capital to shareholders has been a significant area of focus over the past several years. We believe our ability to return capital to shareholders while also investing in the business demonstrates the underlying strength of the company and the importance of a balanced capital allocation approach that is focused on maximizing shareholder value. The $500 million increase in our share repurchase authorization is simply another example of our commitment towards a balanced capital allocation approach.  So let me summarize my financial remarks. Overall, we delivered a solid first quarter. Our revenue growth was ahead of our expectations. And importantly, we delivered strong conversion on this revenue growth on an all-in basis.  As this is my first call as BorgWarner's CFO, I wanted to share how I think about the key financial goals for BorgWarner for the remainder of 2024 and beyond. As we move forward, I expect the company to first, deliver organic growth despite volatility in the global BEV and hybrid markets; second, drive strong incremental margin performance on an all-in basis; and third, generate strong operating cash flow that allows the company to make organic and inorganic investments to support our long-term profitable growth while also returning capital to shareholders through a consistent quarterly dividend and opportunistic share repurchases. Executing towards these goals is how we measure financial success at BorgWarner, and how we hope to create long-term value for our shareholders for years to come.  With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Pat. Patrick Nolan : Thank you, Craig. Britney, we're ready to open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Colin Langan with Wells Fargo. Colin Langan : You started off very strong here, I think, something like 8% growth over market in Q1. Your margins seem to be in the midpoint of your full year guidance. But the guide for the year is -- has implied sort of growth over market, but actually moderate a bit and maybe at the midpoint, margins wouldn't change. Anything sort of onetime in nature we should be thinking about in Q1 that kind of boosted results? And then any reasons we should be thinking about things moderating a bit as we go through the rest of the year? Craig Aaron : Thanks, Colin, for the question. Nothing unique in the quarter. It was just a really strong operational performance for our business units. They did an exceptional job. As you think about our full year guide, it implies a 13% to 16% incremental conversion, 13% on the low end, 16% on the high end. We feel really good about our first quarter performance, sets us up quite well for the remainder of the year. We're just focused on executing towards the near term, and we're going to keep doing that as we into the second quarter. It's just a really good operational performance for -- the company. Colin Langan : Okay. That sounds good. Slide 8 was pretty helpful. Maybe if you could talk a little about your plug-in -- PHEV opportunity. The content there, how much of your sales today are there? And have you seen any change yet, I guess, quite early on interest in that given the EPA rules seem to be more favorable towards PHEV? Frederic Lissalde : Colin, that the PHEV is one architecture where we have our foundational products coming in and also most of our eProducts coming in. I don't think we have given the granularity of our per -- plug-in hybrid content. But on the hybrid overall, full hybrid, plug-in hybrid and range-extended EV, about 40% of our light vehicle eProduct, which is guided at the midpoint at $1.9 billion this year is going into those advanced hybrids. Colin Langan : Got it. And have you seen any interest in PHEV improve? Or is it still just too early? Frederic Lissalde : So globally, the interest of PHEV has always been there. In the U.S., I would say that it's a little bit early to see request for quotes from some of the American OEMs. But outside of the U.S., plug-in hybrids and advanced hybrids are an important part of new energy vehicles and we have our fair share of those. Operator : Your next question comes from John Murphy with Bank of America. John Murphy : I just wanted to follow up on that question that Colin asked on hybrids. Is there any increase in schedules that you're seeing for hybrids at the moment? I know you said -- you mentioned 40% of the eProducts is -- the $1.9 billion is on the hybrid side, and you're not seeing any new activity necessarily, but is there any step-up in schedules for hybrids at the moment that you're seeing that might provide some upside there? Frederic Lissalde : Yes. In China and in Europe, we see upticks in hybrids. Actually, if you look at the share of growth of new energy vehicle in China, actually, hybrids are growing faster than BEV over the past few months. So -- and we're part of those. So the answer to your question is, on a global basis, yes. And in North America, it's too early to say. John Murphy : Okay. And then a second question. There's a -- I mean you debate whether it's stalling, whether it's short term, whether it's long term on EVs. But the reality is some of your customers, particularly in China and Europe are heading in that direction, maybe less so in the U.S. than we may have thought. I'm just curious, as you think about your investment, whether it be on the R&D side or the capital invested side, do you have the ability to pull back and maybe spend at a slightly more measured pace, or is it just because there's such a push in China and Europe that you can't pull back and there's nothing you can really -- you do here other than service your clients as best you can and try to cut costs to keep it down as much as possible.  And maybe you could comment on really what you might think about doing on the R&D side and then also sort of on the CapEx or capacity add side? Frederic Lissalde : Yes. We are managing our costs holistically in line with the current sales outlook. As Craig and I mentioned in our prepared remarks, we are setting up the company to convert mid- to high teens, no matter where the incremental revenue comes from. What I would say is try not to box BorgWarner into BorgWarner is a BEV player or a hybrid player or combustion player. We are focused on efficient powertrain. And we are now having scale in all those architectures in order to convert mid- to high teens no matter what. John Murphy : And on the capacity side, is there any way to potentially be a little bit more capital efficient? Or is that possible? And I would certainly box you into a powertrain tech company across the board. That's where I'd box you, Fred. Didn't mean to put you in one direction or the other. Frederic Lissalde : I think from a facility standpoint, we're flexible for some of the products that I alluded to in the prepared remarks. We have the same engineering, the same -- sometimes the same production equipment, sometimes actually the same product.  Let me give you an example. We've talked about the past few years of dual inverters for hybrids. And we've talked about inverters for BEVs. All those are the same animals. They might not look exactly the same from a space and form perspective, but all the inside of the guts of those things are similar. So it's difficult to answer without a specific program. But overall, we're quite flexible across all different elements that both go in BEVs and hybrids. Operator : Your next question comes from Dan Levy with Barclays. Dan Levy : Maybe in the quarter, you could just break out what was the split of revenue between eProducts and foundational? And then foundational, I assume, is still putting up pretty solid growth of the market. Maybe you could just talk about some of the dynamics driving that, please? Craig Aaron : Yes. So Dan, the breakout of eProducts and foundational in the quarter was about $500 million, a little over $500 million eProducts. The rest was foundational. And I'm sorry, your other question just was growth in the quarter? Dan Levy : Yes. Within the growth over market, do you have a sense of what the growth of the market was for foundational and what regions or products were driving that? Craig Aaron : Yes. So I would say overall, the growth was both in China and in Europe. And that includes both the growth that you saw on the foundational side of the business as well as the eProduct side of the business. Dan Levy : And the outgrowth within foundational was -- any sense on where that was? Craig Aaron : You can see a lot of it in the drivetrain side of our business. Dan Levy : Great. Okay, and then a second question on margins. And I know you've noted that you're aiming for mid- to high teens incrementals across the business. But maybe if you could just give us a sense of within some of the foundational product, is it possible that we actually are seeing higher incremental margin simply because there's less R&D that you've incurred, less application engineering, more that you are leveraging, getting a sense whether there is some split in that contribution margin between eProduct versus foundational. Frederic Lissalde : I would say that we are balancing all those costs in order to get to the mid- to high teens. And we're taking that business holistically and taking cost actions so that all product lines are being able over time to deliver those incrementals. Operator : Next question comes from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Noah Kaye : Craig, after the dividend and the repurchases you've done year-to-date, kind of leads me around $250 million, $300 million in deployable free cash flow based off of the guide for the year. And I think we would certainly say that shares are trading below intrinsic value. So how are you thinking about the pace of buybacks for the rest of the year? Is this going to be more ratable? Or are you remaining opportunistic? Craig Aaron : Yes. Thanks for the question, Noah. So I just want to take a step back. We repurchased $277 million of the company's shares over the last 2 quarters. So $177 million in the fourth quarter of last year. $100 million in the first quarter of this year. Obviously, pleased with our Board of Directors, we got that additional authorization, takes our total authorization up to -- a little over $760 million. We're going to continue to repurchase opportunistically, just like we did in Q4 and just like we did in Q1.  I'd say as we think about capital allocation, we take a holistic approach to it. So we look at liquidity, we look at leverage, we look at is there any short-term funding for M&A that's needed. Obviously, as you mentioned, we have a dividend that's a fixed obligation. We don't want to turn that on and turn that off. And we look at stock buybacks as a lever as well. So I think as we move forward, continue to think about it, that we'll do it opportunistically. That's how should think about it. Noah Kaye : Okay. Helpful. And then good to get the housekeeping on eProduct sales in the first quarter. Just can you give us some guideposts, even getting to the midpoint of guide for the year around how you're thinking about the cadence of ramp? I know you have some capacity coming online for battery. But is this a fairly ratable ramp? Is it really heavily weighted to 3Q or 4Q, any particular quarter? Can you just help us think through how the ramp should proceed over the course of the year? Frederic Lissalde : Yes. Noah, so in Q1, our eProducts revenue went up 25%, and this is in line with our full year outlook of 25% to 40% for the year. And you're right, in the next quarter, in our ePropulsion segment, we're launching numerous programs with VW Group, with Daimler, HMC, BYD and others. We're ramping up our battery pack capacity in Seneca and later in the year in Europe, we're launching in other areas of eProducts. So you're right, it's going to increase over the next quarters. Operator : Your next question comes from Joe Spak with UBS. Joseph Spak : Fred, I know you sort of already touched on plug-ins a little bit in the Q&A. In your comments, you also sort of talked about turbos and other sort of core BorgWarner technology that can help with what's seemingly an increasingly choppy powertrain transition. But presumably, your customers would need to do at least some engineering, and it's going to take time to sort of have a greater adoption. So what are -- what's the conversations like with customers on some of the traditional sort of core foundational products? And how quickly can we really see potentially greater levels of adoption there? Frederic Lissalde : And Joe, I guess you were thinking about North America here in your question, aren't you? Joseph Spak : Yes, yes, yes. Frederic Lissalde : Okay. Yes, because in the rest of the world, as I alluded to before, it's happening, right? I think we have all the building blocks to support our customers here in North America as they also want to have those advanced hybrids. I feel that it's still a little bit early to get into the specific cities or which products they need from BorgWarner. We are in the early phases of discussions about architecture. So I think it's going to take a little bit more time. Joseph Spak : Okay. And Craig, obviously, great job sort of managing to the incrementals. You talked about continuing to manage to that. And I think in the past, you talked about on the foundational side, right, if things continue to go down, you'd look to restructuring or some pricing actions. But I'm curious on the other side, just given not what's a still mid- to long-term sort of trajectory towards electrification, but certainly, a lot of volatility on the programs within that. Is there an opportunity -- not this year because it's probably locked, but is there an opportunity as you think about eR&D for next year to maybe push some of that? Or is there even a pricing opportunity on some of the eProducts stuff if the volumes don't hit certain thresholds? Frederic Lissalde : Joe, you may have seen that our ePropulsion segment is running at about 30% incremental a year, and we're not satisfied with that. So we'll take some steps to improve the margin performance. And again, we have a strategy to adjust costs to wherever the market is going. And we are doing that wherever it is necessary, and this is what we're looking at right now. Joseph Spak : One follow-up on the decrementals, I guess, in -- well, I guess the battery stuff is not in eProducts. So never mind... Operator : Your next question comes from Douglas Dutton with Evercore ISI. Douglas Dutton : Just a quick one here and then one follow-up. Can you maybe tell us the percentage of your orders from those Chinese domestics? And how that compares to the percentage of anticipated recognized revenue from that same group for 2024? Frederic Lissalde : You're talking about eProducts? Douglas Dutton : Correct, yes. Frederic Lissalde : So on eProducts for 2024, about 45% of the $1.9 billion in light vehicle is for China. Within that, 95% is for the Chinese OEMs. Douglas Dutton : Okay. Great. And then just on a more granular note, can you maybe quantify the exposure you have to some of those newer growers in China, the BYDs, Xpengs, Xiaomis of the world? Frederic Lissalde : I unfortunately can't disclose some of those names, and I can't disclose which product we have with those names in particular. So not that I would love to do it, but I just can't. Operator : Your next question comes from Alex Potter with Piper Sandler. Alex Potter : Great. So first, maybe following on that question from China. I'm interested in, I guess, hearing your opinion regarding the degree to which China, that market can serve as maybe foreshadowing or a harbinger of the way the rest of the world will evolve. Obviously, China has been moving much more quickly toward electrification. There's a lot of dynamism regarding the architectures that those new companies are pursuing. Do you think that China represents the way the rest of the world will eventually evolve? Or do you see those markets sort of trending in different directions with China doing its own thing and the rest of the world doing their own thing? Frederic Lissalde : In China, under the umbrella of new energy vehicle, you will see that hybrids, essentially the advanced hybrids are having about 40% shares in China. And actually growing faster within that segment or growing the fastest within that segment. That is also our ratio of eProducts versus -- eProducts within hybrids and BEVs.  For us, I wouldn't say that it doesn't matter, but it kind of doesn't matter. We have the right product portfolio to support customers around the globe. And we don't -- we're not attached to any regional specificities. We are resilient to any propulsion scenarios, fuel combustion, hybrids or BEVs. So I'm not -- I don't have a crystal ball. I won't -- I can't tell you if China is a good proxy for the rest of the world. But we believe that you will see a variety of electrified propulsion architecture, and we're ready to support those on a global basis at Borg. Alex Potter : Okay. Yes. Good. Very clear. Maybe the other question, more of a near-term tactical question, on another call this morning, one of your peers noted particularly over the last couple of weeks or several weeks in the month of April, some real volatility and generally downward adjustments to production schedules at the OEMs. Have you seen anything similar to that? I know that your overall market projections haven't changed versus last quarter, but anything you'd be willing to say regarding near term or back-half production schedules would be helpful. Frederic Lissalde : Yes. I don't have the granularity of what happened over the past 2 weeks, but overall for the full year, our view of the market is already below companies like IHS. So -- but we will adjust to whatever comes to us. Operator : Your next question comes from James Picariello with BNP Paribas. James Picariello : Just back to the eProduct, based on the first quarter's performance and the visibility into the year. Can you just speak to AKASOL's Battery Systems revenue? I believe this business guidance, called for $700 million to $800 million in revenue. Just curious if there are any moving pieces tied to this within the eProduct range? And can you clarify what portion of this year's eProducts sales attributes to hybrid? Frederic Lissalde : So this year's guidance, $2.65 billion for eProducts at the midpoint, out of which $750 million are battery packs for commercial vehicle. So $1.9 billion is for light vehicle, 40% of which is for hybrids on a global basis.  Regarding your first question on battery packs, there is nothing particular in Q1. The ramp up is to plan. And what we see in Seneca and the preparation of increasing capacity in Europe is also in line with our expectations. James Picariello : That's helpful. And then just as we think about foundational profitability versus eProduct the rest of the year, and I think this touches on Colin's question regarding margin cadence given that the first quarter was squarely in line with your full year range. As your eProducts revenue improves sequentially through the remainder of the year, is it safe to assume that the margin loss rate also improves? And so my question, if that's true. My question is, why would the foundational profitability degrade through the year if the full year guidance range is the right number, if that makes sense? Craig Aaron : Yes. I think the way we're looking at it is we're focused on executing at the mid- to high teens on an all-in basis, wherever that growth may come from. So I think that's how you should think about it. We're really pleased with our 23% all in, in the first quarter. We think it sets us up quite well to execute for the full year. So that's how we're looking at it. We're really focused on incrementing on an all-in basis regardless of where the revenue growth comes from. Operator : Your next thing comes from Luke Junk with Baird. Luke Junk : First, looking at the segments. Just hoping you can maybe unpack the top line strength that you saw year-over-year in Drivetrain and Battery Systems? This quarter sounded like that was foundation related in large part, maybe just sustainability of that strength in the margin, they've stepped up nicely sequentially, especially as well. I don't know if there's anything specific to point to. Craig Aaron : Yes. I would say it was just overall good performance from a margin perspective. Again, 23% all-in, great performance by our business units. When you think about growth, it's really China and Europe both on the foundational side of the business and on the battery side of the business, particularly in that DBS segment. But we also had nice growth overall just in general, both in China and in Europe. But again, you can see most of it in the DBS segment. That's where I would point you to. Luke Junk : Got it. And then for my follow-up, maybe a bigger picture question, Fred. And just thinking about eProduct net engineering requirements going forward, both as you think about on a gross basis and ePropulsion margins going forward here now you can improve those margins. But I'm also wondering, just given some increases in uncertainty in the West, if you can push for more engineering recoveries as you book business or building structures to pay for more of that engineering? Frederic Lissalde : Yes. I mean we're looking at all this from an engineering recovery. We're also looking at adjusting costs, especially in those segments for which growth is not happening as fast as we thought in order to improve the margin performance. So in those eProducts segments, we fully expect this business to grow going forward. And with those upcoming cost actions to get to mid- to high-teens incremental when it ramps. Operator : We have time for one final question, and that question comes from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Mark Delaney : I think that a part of BorgWarner's customer value proposition for eProducts has been that utilizing BorgWarner's power electronics products can be a more efficient way for OEMs to do business. I'm curious if you think that played a role in some of the wins you were able to announce today. And given the challenges that a lot of the OEMs are dealing with in BEVs and a lot of the price competition, might that be an opportunity for your bookings to outperform some of the broader market trends if some of these customers do need to find ways to be more efficient? Frederic Lissalde : You're absolutely right. Power electronics is a key strength of the company. Borg has always been focused on efficient systems and efficient mobility. And power electronics is the new frontier of efficiency in BEV and -- or hybrids, fighting against those switching losses and fighting against those mechanical losses, downstream the inverter. So the answer to your question is absolutely yes. We're focused on that and at the system level, at the electronics level, at the power module level. And that's our DNA. That's what we do best. Mark Delaney : And on eProducts, the company reiterated the $2.5 billion to $2.8 billion eProducts revenue outlook for this year. Of course, we've seen a lot of volatility in light vehicle BEV plans. And so as we've seen that, I'm hoping to better understand, do you think that the 2025 outlook that you've previously communicated in eProducts of $4.5 billion to $5 billion. Is that something you still see as achievable? And as you think about the revenue ramp and what -- maybe for 2025, maybe you could also touch on how you're thinking about eProducts profitability not only this year but into 2025? Frederic Lissalde : So you're right. It will absolutely depend upon customer volume, and that will ultimately decide what 2025 will be. We are, as we mentioned, focused on what we can control, which is securing new businesses in eProducts for BEV and hybrids, focusing on strengthening our portfolio for it to remain in a great position and managing our costs in order to overall deliver mid- to high-teens incremental on an all-in basis. That's our focus, and we'll give you more color on '25 closer to '25. Patrick Nolan : Thank you all for your great questions today. If you have any follow-ups, you can follow with me or my team. With that, Britney, you can go ahead and conclude today's call. Operator : That does conclude the BorgWarner 2024 first quarter results conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BorgWarner 2024 Second Quarter Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Patrick Nolan, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Nolan, you may begin your conference. Patrick Nolan : Thank you, Beau. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We issued our earnings release earlier this morning. It's posted on our website, borgwarner.com, both on our home page and Investor Relations homepage. Before we begin, I need to inform you that during this call, we may make forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties as detailed in our 10-K. Our actual results may differ significantly from the matters discussed today. During today's presentation, we'll highlight certain non-GAAP measures in order to provide a clearer picture of how the core business performed and for comparison purposes with prior periods. When you hear us say on a comparable basis, that means excluding the impact of FX, net M&A and other non-comparable items. When you hear us say adjusted, that means excluding non-comparable items. When you hear us say organic, that means excluding the impact of FX and net M&A. We will also refer to our incremental margin performance. Our incremental margin is defined as the organic change in our adjusted operating income divided by the organic change in our sales. Our all-in incremental margin includes our planned investment in R&D any impact from net inflationary items and other cost items. We will also refer to our growth compared to our market. When you hear us say market, that means the change in light and commercial vehicle production weighted for our geographic exposure. Please note that we've posted today's earnings call presentation to the IR page of our website. We encourage you to follow along with these slides during our discussion. With that, I'm happy to turn the call over Fred. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : Thank you, Pat, and good day, everyone. I'm very pleased to share our results for the second quarter of 2024 and provide an overall company update, starting on Slide 5. At approximately $3.6 billion, our Q2 sales were relatively flat year-over-year, outperforming a modest decline in production. For the first half of the year, we outgrew our market by about 350 basis points. Once again, the sales outgrowth shows the resiliency of our efficiency-focused portfolio, which is, I believe, positioned to outgrow the market in any type of propulsion mix scenario. We secured multiple new product awards across combustion, hybrid and electric for both passenger cars and commercial vehicles. Turning to our bottom line for the quarter. We delivered a very strong 10.4% margin, which was up 30 basis points versus prior year. We delivered EPS of $1.19 per share, which was $0.13 increase versus prior year. Our first half 2024 margin and EPS performance has allowed us to increase our full year margin and earnings guidance, as Craig will detail later. We carried on our restructuring actions, now focusing our ePropulsion segment to adjust our cost structure to current market dynamics. We expect that these actions will result in annual run rate cost savings of about $100 million by 2026, with immediate positive impacts. We also introduced a new business unit structure, designed to maximize cost synergies, enhance our go-to-market global strategies and bring further simplicity and clarity to our shareholders. Lastly, we remain focused on efficient deployment of our capital and announce our intention to repurchase $300 million of BorgWarner stock in the second half of 2024. Next, on slide 6, I would like to take a moment to highlight our 2024 sustainability report, which was published earlier this month. BorgWarner's vision is a clean, energy-efficient world. And I'm proud to lead a company where our business goals go hand-in-hand with our sustainability goals. At BorgWarner, sustainability means delivering value to all stakeholders for today and tomorrow. I would like to highlight just a few points of progress described in the report. First, BorgWarner has reduced Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 32% from the 2021 baseline, making progress on our SBTI validated goal to reduce it 85% by 2030. Second, the company engaged our supply chain management and engineering teams to advance the company's goal of reducing Scope 3 emissions, 25% by 2030 compared to a 2021 baseline. And third, we performed above all benchmarks on employee sense of inclusion and belonging on the company's engagement survey. I would like to thank our entire team for their dedication and excellence in innovating products for cleaner mobility, making leaps towards achieving our climate and other sustainability goals, and investing in our people. Now, let's look at some new product awards on slide 7. First, BorgWarner has secured multiple contracts to supply its electric cross differential or exD to three major OEMs. The companies will incorporate BorgWarner exD technology into both rear and front wheel drives of electrified powertrain application. Start of production is expected in 2024 and 2026. Our exD is part of our Electric Torque Management System, which offers a range of products that intelligently controls, wheel torque, to increase stability provide superior dynamic performance and improve traction during launch and acceleration. Next, BorgWarner secured awards to deliver high-voltage eFan systems for use on a major global OEM series of electrical commercial vehicles in North America. This marks the largest eFan business win in North America for us with expected start of production in Q4, 2027. BorgWarner complete eFan system is comprised of three components, including a fan and eMotor and an integrated high-voltage inverter with the capacity to reach up to 10 kilowatts of power and 40-newton meters of torque. Lastly, BorgWarner has secured two EGR Cooler Awards with a prominent North American-based commercial vehicle customer. Start of production is expected to be in Q4, 2027 with implementation across various medium-duty commercial trucks. Our emissions reducing EGR solution offers high robustness against thermal fatigue and optimizes cool and distribution throughout the engine for increased performance. We continue to see strong interest across our EGR product portfolio, which supports the need for highly efficient combustion engine that meets increased fuel economy needs and stringent emission requirements across the world for combustion and hybrids. Now, let's turn to Slide 8, where I would like to discuss our new business unit structure. As we have continued to outgrow the market, and leveraged the leadership, robustness, and scale of our product portfolio, it is now the right time to align our business unit structure to further enhance our ability to execute on our strategy. We believe this will drive cost synergies, higher focus, and clarity for all stakeholders. As such, beginning in the third quarter, BorgWarner will reorganize its four business unit and associated financial reporting segments as follows; our Turbos and Thermal Technology business unit is led by Dr. Volker Weng. This business unit is unchanged. Our Power Drive System, which today is our externally reported ePropulsion segment will continue to be led by Dr. Stefan Demmerle. This business unit is also unchanged. Our Drivetrain and Morse Systems businesses are now combined into one business unit and is led by Isabelle McKenzie. We've combined our Commercial Vehicle Battery and Charging businesses into one business unit, which is led by Henk Vanthournout. To summarize, the takeaways from today are this, BorgWarner's second quarter results were strong. Our sales performance once again outperformed the industry. Our adjusted operating margin was the highest since the PHINIA spin-off, and our cash generation was very strong and support our $300 million of intended share repurchase in the second half of the year. We secured multiple new business awards in the quarter, which we believe further demonstrate our product leadership position in all powertrain architectures. BorgWarner is focused on powertrain efficiency, this includes combustion fuel efficiency and electron efficiency, whether it is for Hybrids or BEVs. I believe BorgWarner can support any powertrain architecture. We are world leader in efficient mobility with a product portfolio that we believe is uniquely positioned to outgrow industry production for years to come. This quarter, we took additional meaningful steps to manage our cost structure in response to the industry mix dynamics, as well as to provide increased clarity and transparency from a global product line organization. As we look forward, we expect to continue to secure global growth opportunities as the world transitions to more efficient mobility, thanks to our product leadership position in combustion, hybrids and BEVs. At the same time, we will continue to appropriately manage our cost structure, as industry volumes and production mix outlook change, while continuing to preserve our long-term profitable growth and technological edge. This will allow BorgWarner to continue to deliver sales performance through organic growth above market production, convert that growth into higher earnings and create long-term value for our shareholders. With that, let me turn the call over to Craig. Craig Aaron : Thank you, Fred, and good morning, everyone. Let's start on Slide 9 with a look at our year-over-year sales walk for Q2. Last year's Q2 sales from continuing operations were just under $3.7 billion. You can see that the strengthening US dollar drove a year-over-year decrease in sales of almost 2% or $62 million. Then, you can see a modest decrease in organic sales, which was a 120 basis points above market production. Finally, the acquisition of Eldor added $6 million of sales year-over-year. The sum of all this was just over $3.6 billion of sales in Q2. Turning to Slide 10. You can see our earnings and cash flow performance for the quarter. Our second quarter adjusted operating income was $376 million, equating to a strong 10.4% margin. That compares to adjusted operating income from continuing operations of $372 million or a 10.1% margin from a year ago. On a comparable basis, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and M&A, adjusted operating income increased $22 million on $12 million of lower sales. This is a great result and reflects our ability to deliver profitability despite a declining production environment. This performance was partially helped by $15 million of favorable items, including the initial benefits from our ePropulsion restructuring, stock forfeiture related to a senior executive retirement and timing of a supplier cost record [ph]. The net impact of Eldor was a $9 million drag on operating income year-over-year. Our adjusted EPS from continuing operations was up $0.13 compared to a year ago as a result of higher adjusted operating income, a decline in our effective tax rate and the impact of recent share repurchases. And finally, free cash flow from continuing operations was $297 million during the second quarter, which was up $267 million from a year ago as a result of strong working capital and capital expenditure performance. Now let's take a look at our full year outlook on Slide 11. We are projecting total 2024 sales in the range of $14.1 billion to $14.4 billion, which is a reduction from our prior guidance of $14.4 billion to $14.9 billion. This reduction is due to weaker foreign currencies, a lower market production outlook and eProducts coming in at the low end of our prior guidance range. Despite this revenue reduction, we expect the company to outgrow market production by 350 to 450 basis points, which once again demonstrates the resiliency of our technology-focused portfolio, that we believe is positioned to outgrow market production during any kind of propulsion mix environment. Starting with foreign currencies. Our guidance now assumes an expected full year sales headwind from weaker foreign currencies of $175 million compared to 2023. This is also a sales headwind of $75 million versus our prior guidance, with the Euro, Chinese RMB and Korean Won being the largest drivers of the change in our outlook. Within this guidance, our full year end market assumption has been reduced to down 2% to 3% versus flat to down 2.5% previously. Finally, the Eldor and SSE acquisitions are expected to add approximately $30 million to 2024 sales. Based on end market and eProduct headwinds, we expect organic growth of approximately 0.5% to 2.5% year-over-year compared to our prior guidance of 2% to 5%. However, our expected overall growth above market production remains strong at 350 to 450 basis points. Now let's switch to margin. We are increasing our full year margin outlook to 9.6% to 9.8% from our prior guidance of 9.2% to 9.6%. This is based on our year-to-date performance and the expected benefit of our ePropulsion restructuring actions, which I'll discuss in a few moments. We believe this margin guidance increase reflects our ability to drive profitability against very volatile end markets. Excluding the impact of Eldor related losses in 2024, and the benefit of our ePropulsion restructuring, the high end of our second half outlook contemplates the business delivering an incremental conversion in the mid-teens, while the low end of our guidance provides a decremental conversion in the low double-digits. We view this as strong underlying performance given the anticipated 3.5% to 5.5% decline in market production during the second half of the year. Based on this sales and margin outlook, we're expecting full year adjusted EPS and in the range of $3.95 to $4.15 per diluted share. This increase compared to our prior outlook is being driven by the impact of our higher margin guidance and $300 million in share repurchases that we expect to execute before the end of the year. With an expected $475 million to $575 million in 2024 free cash flow, we expect to allocate all of our cash flow to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. In summary, this is simply another example of the company utilizing its strong free cash flow to deliver value to shareholders. Let's turn to slide 12, and discuss our planned restructuring actions within our ePropulsion segment. As mentioned earlier, the initial benefits of these actions helped our second quarter results by $5 million. We continue to see short-term sales challenges in this business due to various individual platform shortfalls and other regional market dynamics. Therefore, it was critical to rightsize the ePropulsion cost structure to their current level of sales with restructuring actions that we started in June. We estimate cumulative cash restructuring costs of approximately $75 million that will extend through 2026. These actions are expected to generate cost savings of $20 million to $30 million in 2024 and approximately $100 million by 2026. The intention of this restructuring is to improve the near-term earnings of this business, but it also positions the business to be able to deliver mid-teens incremental margins on future growth. So let me summarize my financial remarks. Overall, we delivered a strong second quarter with sales performance better than market production. We delivered a very strong 10.4% margin, which was 30 basis points higher than 2023. And we generated $297 million in free cash flow, which was $267 million higher than 2023. And we did this despite declining market production in the quarter. I believe this once again demonstrates the resiliency of our technology focused portfolio that is positioned to outgrow market production and to deliver strong profitability and free cash flow in any type of end market environment. Last quarter, I shared three financial goals for BorgWarner for 2024 and beyond. I would like to give you my view of these goals as it relates to our 2024 outlook. First, we outperformed market production by approximately 350 basis points during the first half of the year. And despite anticipated weaker second half production environment, we expect to outperform the market by 350 to 450 basis points for the full year. This is a reflection of our leading-edge technology that we believe is positioned to outgrow a very volatile powertrain mix environment. Second, our margin profile remained extremely strong through the first half of the year. When combined with our continued focus on profitable growth, including our planned ePropulsion restructuring actions, this allowed us to increase our full year margin outlook by 30 basis points despite a challenging production environment. And lastly, we generated strong free cash flow during the second quarter, and we have strong liquidity, which supports our intention to repurchase 300 million of additional shares during the second half of the year. This means that we expect all of our 2024 free cash flow will be returned to shareholders through the combination of a consistent quarterly dividend and tenant share repurchases. The combination of our 2023 and intended 2024 share repurchases represents more than 7% of our outstanding shares post the finance spin-off. And we expect to do this while also continuing to invest in our business to support our focus on long-term profitable growth. As I look back at the first half of the year, I'm very proud with how we have performed, and I'm equally excited to see our results in the back half of the year. With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Pat. Patrick Nolan : Thank you, Craig. Bo, we're ready to open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll go first this morning to John Murphy with Bank of America. John Murphy : Good morning, guys. Just a main question here around the eProduct restructuring. One, why does why does include -- it not include Europe? Why is it only North America and China? And is this -- just in response to program cancellations or push-outs, meaning that the business is just not materializing the way you're expecting? And it appears, just given the very quick savings that some of these programs may have been loss-making for you, even if they come through. So maybe just kind of confirm that. So, why not Europe? Is it just program cancellations and push-outs? And were the programs loss-making to start with and maybe any other color around this? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : Yeah, John, from an engineering and I see no footprint perspective, this business unit is essentially tilted to North America and China. That's where the -- most of the restructuring will happen, because this is where we have the weight. But it also touches some parts of Europe. The restructuring is sized so that when PDS carries on launching so many products for major OEMs globally, we're converting mid-teens the way up, and that's how we sized. We sized the restructuring. We're focusing on launching the products that we've booked, and we've also focused on very defined programs for long-term product leadership and enhanced product efficiencies. John Murphy : Okay. And then maybe just a follow-up on the Seesaw on the ICE and potentially on the hybrid side. Are you seeing any benefits that might come to that side of the business where you're gaining a little bit of revenue that might come in at higher incrementals, that maybe it's this year or maybe it is we go through 2025 and 2026 through the course of this program? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : Yes. So the propulsion mix is volatile and unpredictable. And what we're doing at Borg is making sure that we are converting on the additional revenue wherever the revenue comes from. We're focusing on launching our new business that were booked, and this is what translates in the numbers and the updated guide. John Murphy : Okay. And just one just Bob, most of this, it sounds like it's head count on R&D. Is that a fair statement? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : It is head count and other types of spend. But it's more SC&O than any other things, overall. John Murphy : Got it. That's really helpful. All right. Thank you guys. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : Thank you, John. Operator : Thank you. We go next now to Colin Langan at Wells Fargo. Colin Langan : Thanks for taking my question and congrats on a great quarter. If I look at the midpoint of full year guidance, it does imply something like over a 30% decremental, if I go first half to second half on those lower sales, kind of at the higher end of conversion on lower sales. And on top of it, I think you mentioned there's actually a little bit of savings from the restructuring program into the second half. What is driving that? Is that just normal seasonality? How should we be thinking about first half, second half decremental? Craig Aaron : Yes. So when we think about first half, second half, I think actually, the better way to look at it is year-over-year. And when you think about our margin 9.3% to 9.6% in the second half of the year, when you look at the high end of our guide, we're incrementing in mid-teens. On the low end, we're decrementing in the low double digits. That's excluding the benefits of restructuring. So Colin, when you include restructuring, we're incrementing in the 30% range on the high end of our guide, and on the bottom end of the guide, we're holding flat. For us, I think that's really good underlying performance. And so that's how we're looking at it year-over-year. Colin Langan : Got it. And if I look at growth over market, I think it came down a little bit less than 100 basis points. It seems they're pretty small considering some of the issues. I mean, what is driving that site change? Is that all the EV delays? And is there any customer mix as other suppliers have reported? Or is that not an issue for you given your pretty strong position in China with domestic? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : Yes. Colin, the outgrowth for Q2 is 120 basis points. And this is essentially impacted by eProduct revenue at the low end of our guide. And also essentially the program in North America -- BEV program in North America that's not really not really performing well. I would look at a smooth out growth quarter-over-quarter as a good proxy. I think 300 basis points for the first half is where we want to be, and -- be around 400 basis points for the full year, which is also where we kind of want to be. Colin Langan : I was kind of referring to the full year guide, growth of a market that was implied. It seems like it's slightly lower. Is that also all EV-related? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : It is. Colin Langan : All right. Thanks for taking my questions. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We go next now to Chris McNally at Evercore. Chris McNally : Thanks so much team. Maybe if I step back for the impressive guide raise of 30 bps. I mean, basically, the way I think about it is essentially given the organic revenue reduction of a little bit less than $300 million, you probably would have lost 20 or 30 basis points on normal incremental. So if you add those two, it's about a 50 to 60 bps of operational sort of better-than-expected performance, and I think what we're all trying to work out is if you look at Q2 and a 10.4% margin, while you still have ePropulsion losses in the double digits. Can you just walk us through some of the contents why we can't propel out that 10% plus margin for 2025, 2026? Where obviously, where you've discussed lower what rolls off? Anything just qualitative, I know there's a lot of moving parts and one quarter doesn't make sort of a trend. But we're all trying to figure out if ICE is here for a little bit longer, what is the negative that trains that down? Because obviously, ePropulsion you will get better than this minus double-digit margins. It's a long question, but curious why we can't see more strength in the foundational business. Craig Aaron : Yeah, Chris, I'd say the way to look at it is when you look at Q2 we're at 10.4%. There was -- as I mentioned in my script, about $15 million benefit in the quarter with some items. So when you remove that, it's about 10% for Q2. As we move into the second half of the year, as mentioned, revenue is coming down about $200 million purely market, $75 million foreign exchange and the balances on the eProduct side of our portfolio. And ultimately, at the midpoint operating income is unchanged. And so I think your question is, how are we doing that? And I think it's coming from our strong first half performance and our restructuring benefits is offsetting the sales decline. I think it's really as simple as that. Chris McNally : And then this idea is obviously, we're going to see pure ICE, right, so ex plug-in, ex-hybrid, ex-EV volumes decline over the next couple of years. Should we assume that if we were to be able to isolate that margin of business that's coming down, meaning they'll see decrementals, because also often at the end of life of a lot of these programs, you actually see R&D also come down. So that's one of the things that we're trying to figure out. If we were to isolate specifically ICE foundational programs, will they see margin decline as units go down over the next couple of years? And, obviously, then the question will some of these programs may be extended or volumes may come down less. But just if we were to think about it, not how you report but should we see margins on a like-for-like basis on pure ICE coming down? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : Yeah. So I would say, first, a lot of our combustion products go into hybrids and are a key element of making the combustion side of hybrid lean and efficient. So I think I think when you think about BorgWarner, I don't think you should try and split combustion, hybrid and BEV. Because our combustion product goes on combustion and hybrid, our eProduct also a very versatile item go on EV and hybrid. Those are the same products. And so we have the portfolio to play in all three segments, if you call that segment. And outgrow the segment and convert on outgrowth. It is as simple as this. Chris McNally : No, that's helpful. I know that's a tough one to isolate. And I think as you -- as we also see in the four new segments, some of the margin progression, I think Fred that actually may be easier for the investment community to kind of see the trend segmented in these segments where we do get a little interplay of ICE, EV and Hybrid. Thanks so much. Really appreciate it. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We go next now to Joe Spak at UBS. Joe Spak : Thanks. Good morning. Just -- I think before you were looking for eR&D to be plus $40 million to $50 million for the year. Now with this restructuring, and it does sound like it's again, mostly people. Is that now like a $20 million year-over-year pace? Or is there some other sort of savings from the restructuring? Craig Aaron : Yes. Thanks, Joe, for the question. You're right. Yes, we said $40 million to $50 million starting the year. Now after this restructuring, it's going to be down to $20 million to $30 million. And how I look at it is our eProduct portfolio is still growing $0.5 billion. It's still going to be up about 25% year-over-year, and that $20 million to $30 million is supporting a lot of launches that are going to be happening in the future. It's really focused on application engineering, and that's really what that $20 million to $30 represents year-over-year. Joe Spak : So I guess just to follow on and more importantly, like how should we think about R&D there and capital investment on eProducts, given your new view of sort of how this market is going to evolve here? Craig Aaron : On that growth, we're going to continue to support those programs with R&D, and we're still focused, as always, on 15% return on invested capital on all new programs. Joe Spak : Okay. And then maybe just one more quick here on eProduct sort of the lower end here. Maybe -- apologies if I missed this, but -- is that -- is the battery ramp still on track? I think you're looking for that to be like $700 million to $800 million. So the reduction is really in some of those other products? Or was there a revision to the battery side as well? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : Yes. Back to your prior question, I just want to add that we're incrementing mid-teens, including the year-over-year additional $20 million eR&D spend. On battery, it's on track. Seneca is doing a great job, and they're now food in production. We are on track also for Europe. And the battery business performance is, of course, contributing positively to the incremental margins that we are delivering for the first half and also an important part of our guiding up for the full year. Joe Spak : Thank you. I\u2019ll pass it on. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll go next now to Dan Levy at Barclays. Dan Levy : Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. I wanted to start first with the question on the drivetrain and Battery Systems segment, which is another really strong quarter. So maybe you can help us disaggregate the margin strength. How much of this was on the core foundational piece versus the battery side? Where -- and you just talked to it a second ago, but that's obviously ramping. Craig Aaron : Yes. The quick answer is coming from both really, really strong growth in the quarter like you saw. It's coming from both sides of the portfolio on the Battery business and the Foundational business. And I think we're also -- so we're converting on that extra sales at the same time, really focused on cost, taking productivity actions supplier savings, restructuring, those are all the benefits that you're seeing come through our P&L. But the short answer, it's really coming from both sides of the business. Dan Levy : And the foundational side within drivetrain, is there one particular region or one particular product that's trending to them? I'm just trying to get a sense of how sustainable -- when I recognize the margin -- the segments are getting reshuffled, but how sustainable these drivetrain foundation results are? Craig Aaron : Yes, the drivetrain, the foundational side, we're seeing good strength out of Asia. Dan Levy : Got it. Maybe just as a follow-up, maybe you can help us understand on the forward assumptions on the end markets. We've obviously seen the negative revisions. But maybe what you're seeing in terms of a customer mix standpoint, how much conservatism you might be including because we've seen a number of reductions to the end market outlook, talk about production cuts, your views on customer mix and the conservatism schedules, please? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : Dan, our guide reflects what we see in the market, and we expect the market to be down 2%, 3% year-over-year, with the biggest reduction being in China, followed by North America and Europe. In China, we see a bit of a weaker consumer demand now impacting production rates. In North America, we're seeing some customers working to address their inventory level. And in Europe, there is also a bit of a weaker demand and depletion of backlog. But all that is embedded in our guide, both on the top line and bottom-line. Dan Levy : Great. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next now to Mark Delaney at Goldman Sachs. Mark Delaney : Yes, good morning and thanks very much for taking the question. Wondering, I was hoping to better understand was eProduct within China, and that's a market where EV sales have held up better than some of the other regions. And the company has spoken about some good design wins within eProduct with the domestic Chinese OEMs. So, maybe you could speak a little bit more around what you're seeing in the China market with the eProduct? And to what extent, if at all, are some of the incremental tariffs that the U.S. and Europe based on Chinese imports having an effect on your eProduct business for Chinese domestic OEMs? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : Hey Mark. So, remember, eProduct are -- go both into hybrids and BEVs and in China, NEVs encompasses both hybrid and BEV. The fastest growth is hybrids in China. We're launching a lot of new products in China, about 95% of our eProduct in China are made with a big Chinese carmakers. A lot of our products also are used for potential exports and also potential localization. So, we're very happy with our business in China. The impact of the tariff. I think it's a little early to anticipate. But China is certainly a part of the world where we are gaining scale, and that's very helpful when we go with those eProducts supporting the e side of Hybrids and BEV in other parts of the world. Mark Delaney : That's helpful. My other question was on capital allocation. And I understand that the plan for the balance of this year is for capital allocation to be prioritized for shareholder returns, and you spoke about the $300 million of share repurchases. As you think beyond 2024, can you help us better understand how you're thinking about allocating capital we've seen the company use tuck-in M&A in recent years to bolster the capabilities? Is that something you think may be part of the calculus going forward? Or would you think the preference for shareholder returns and buybacks will be more of the uses of capital as you're looking out into 2025? Thank you. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : Thanks. Yes, acquisition, together with organic product development has allowed us to create that very unique portfolio that we're growing organically. Acquisition may remain an important part of the strategy over the long term. But I can tell you that I would classify our approach as being even more stringent and prudent than in the past. And I don't see M&A highly likely to be announced over the next couple of 2, 3 quarters, thus our intention to repurchase $300 million of stock or pretty much giving back to shareholders 100% of our cash generation. That's what I would tell you Mark. Mark Delaney : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We go next now to Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanley. Adam Jonas : Thanks, Freddie and team, I just got a couple of questions. So BorgWarner ranks around 490 out of 500 companies in the S&P and PE multiple. It is by far the cheapest auto supplier, auto-related supplier, in the S&P 500, which is really astonishing given, in my opinion, I think in yours too Freddie, this is one of the most accomplished engineering firms in industry, maybe in the world. You have custom alloys and the tolerances and the pressures that your products are used. It's just -- it's very, very high-tech stuff. Why -- what -- in your opinion, your team's opinion, what is the market telling you about your capital allocation strategy? And I don't know what clues you're getting from today's share price reaction, for example, versus other -- it seems like the market is penalizing investments in E [ph] and then rewarding pulling back or rewarding capital return. I don't know if you agree with that message or you're in tune with that? Or do you have a different hypothesis? And then I have a follow-up. Thanks. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : Adam, I think we need to focus on what we can control. And what we can control is create a great product that is versatile across different production mix scenario. Outgrow the market, increment, generating cash and be smart about the cash utilization. As I mentioned before, in Mark's prior question, M&A was essential and helped us together with organic product development to create that very unique portfolio. Now, I think we have a great portfolio, and we're focusing on growing it organically and going back to the BorgWarner basics of outgrowing, converting generic in cash. Adam Jonas : Okay. That's great. My follow-up is a simple question, I guess. What is the logic for advertising the share buybacks? Why -- like to me, it's like going to someone and like you want to buy a house and you tell the owner, hey, I love your house. It's fantastic and then making a bid later. Why advertise the target, in this case, being your own stock in a way that might make you a hostage to your own fortune. I just don't understand the logic. Can you explain why you do that? Thanks. Craig Aaron : I think for us, it's about transparency to our shareholders. When you look at the second quarter, we were blacked out for the majority of the second quarter, and we wanted to provide clarity to the investment community that we wanted to allocate all of our free cash flow to shareholders. It was the right time given Fred's comments earlier about M&A. So we wanted to provide clarity and transparency. Adam Jonas : Okay. My only feedback is you can do that in real time and you don't always have to have the forward time horizon with the amount. But that's just feedback and you guys run the business. I appreciate you taking the time to answer the questions. Craig Aaron : Thank you Adam. Operator : Thank you. And we do have time for one final question, and that will come from James Picariello of BNP Paribas. James Picariello : Hi, everyone. Just as we think about eProduct sales, now trending towards $2.5 billion for the year. The first quarter finished at $500 million for your 10-Q filing. Can you confirm how the second quarter trended? So if you gain a sense for what's implied in the second half? And on AKASOL, specifically, another -- and I think a few other questions, we're getting at this another supplier this morning that is pretty decent commercial vehicle BEV exposure, just cut its commercially sales expectation for the year by a substantial clip. That supplier doesn't compete directly against Ford, but from an end market perspective, is this something that BorgWarner seeing at all in your Battery Systems business? Thanks. Craig Aaron : Okay. Thanks, James. And I'll confirm Q2 sales were $576 million. You'll see that in our 10-Q later today, and I'll turn it over to Fred on your other question. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : Yeah. I think our numbers in commercial vehicle have been adjusted a little bit in the prior quarter. The impact of eProduct is essentially linked to light vehicle at this point in time. I would just remind you that we're growing 25% year-over-year on eProducts from about $2 billion to about now about $2.5 billion, which is if you take a step back, in our growth versus what you see in powertrain electrification. James Picariello : Understood. And then just last, can you provide color on how Eldor losses are now slated to trend for this year? I believe the prior guidance, call it, the $45 million or so. And will your reproposing restructuring actions also include future efforts at Eldor? Thanks. Craig Aaron : Right now, Eldor is unchanged, and that's how you should think about it. Obviously, we're focused on the total business and targeting $100 million in cost savings by 2026. James Picariello : Thanks. Patrick Nolan : With that, I'd like to thank you all for your questions today. If the any follow-ups, feel free to reach out to me or my team. Bo, you can go ahead and conclude today's call. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Nolan, and again, ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today's BorgWarner second quarter earnings call. Again, thanks so much for joining us, everyone. We wish you all a great day. Goodbye.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BorgWarner 2024 Third Quarter Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Patrick Nolan, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Nolan, you may begin your conference. Patrick Nolan : Thank you, Connie, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. We issued our earnings release earlier this morning. It\u2019s posted on our website, borgwarner.com, both on our home page and on our Investor Relations home page. With regard to our Investor Relations calendar, we will be attending multiple conferences between now and our next earnings release. Please see the Events section of our Investor Relations home page for a full list. Before we begin, I need to inform you that during this call, we may make forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties as detailed in our 10-K. Our actual results may differ significantly from the matters discussed today. During today\u2019s presentation, we will highlight certain non-GAAP measures in order to provide a clearer picture of how the core business performed and for comparison purposes with prior periods. When you hear us say on a comparable basis, that means excluding the impact of FX, net M&A and other non-comparable items. When you hear us say adjusted, that means excluding non-comparable items. When you hear us say organic, that means excluding the impact of FX and net M&A. We will also refer to our incremental margin performance. Our incremental margin is defined as the organic change in our adjusted operating income divided by the organic change in our sales. Our all incremental includes our planned investment in ER&D, any impact from net inflationary items and other cost items. Lastly, we refer to our growth compared to our market. When you hear us say market, that means the change in light and commercial vehicle production weighted for our geographic exposure. Please note that we\u2019ve posted today\u2019s earnings call presentation to the IR page of our website. We encourage you to follow along with these slides during our discussion. With that, I\u2019m happy to turn the call over to Fred. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : Thank you, Pat, and good day, everyone. I\u2019m very pleased to share our results for the third quarter and provide an overall company update, starting on Slide 5. At more than $3.4 billion, our Q3 organic sales were down about 5% year-over-year, modestly outperforming a 6% decline in our market. Year-to-date, we have outgrown our market by about 270 basis points. This demonstrates the resiliency of our technology-focused portfolio that we believe is positioned to outgrow the market production. We secured multiple new product awards for both foundational and eProduct, which we believe further support our long-term profitable growth. Turning to our bottom line for the quarter. We delivered a very strong 10.1% margin which was 50 basis points higher than last year. We also delivered earnings per share of $1.09, which was $0.11 higher than prior year. This strong underlying operational performance was primarily driven by our focus on cost controls across the business. Our strong year-to-date margin and cash performance enabled us once again to increase our full year margin and earnings guidance, as Craig will detail later. Lastly, we remained focused on the efficient deployment of our capital and completed our planned 2024 repurchase of $400 million of BorgWarner stock. Now let\u2019s look at some new product awards on Slide 6. First, BorgWarner has furthered its business with a major North American OEM by securing the extensions on two transfer cases for full-size pickups. BorgWarner will supply two types of transfer cases to the OEM for use on three platforms. Start of production for two of the platforms are slated for 2027 with the third expected to begin in 2028. We have supplied this OEM with transfer cases for over 40 years. We believe this extension solidify our team\u2019s reputation and the proven architecture, field performance and quality of our products. Next, BorgWarner has secured three high-voltage coolant heater business wins in Asia, expanding our technological reach in the Asian electric vehicle markets. In China, our high-voltage coolant heater will be used in a leading domestic OEM\u2019s fully electric SUV with production expected to start in the second quarter of 2025. This partnership marks a significant step forward in our continued expansion in China\u2019s rapidly growing electric vehicle industry. In Korea, the product will be used in an electric pickup vehicle with production estimated to begin in March 2025. The heater will be critical in managing cabin temperatures, improving energy efficiency and enhancing the driving experience. In Japan, our high-voltage coolant heater has been chosen by a Japanese OEM for its small battery electric vehicle, with production expected to start in 2028. This marks the company\u2019s first heater program in the country. The compact heater design offers a perfect fit for smaller vehicle platforms, delivering superior performance and efficiency. These three important business wins demonstrate the strength of BorgWarner in this growing field and further solidify our presence in the Asia-Pacific region. And lastly, BorgWarner will deliver its turbochargers for use on GM\u2019s Corvette ZR1 sports car platform, marking the largest passenger car twin turbochargers to be released and produced to-date. We\u2019re proud to secure this contract and support General Motors in making the most powerful Corvette ever built. This technology has been in the works for some time now and to see it come to fruition is both exciting and fulfilling for our passionate teams. BorgWarner and General Motors have a long history of producing market-leading application across a wide range of segments, and we look forward to continuing to develop new technologies with them and push industry boundaries. Now let\u2019s turn to Slide 7, where I would like to share our net sales breakdown following our business unit realignment that was effective July 1. Our business units are now aligned with our externally reported segments. On the left side of the slide, you see that our turbos and thermal technologies and Drivetrain and Morse Systems segments, each represent approximately 40% of our net sales. These segments generate most of their net sales from our foundational products. They both enjoy a number one or number two positions in the different product market segments they serve. These are mature businesses with strong margin and cash flow profiles that we expect will continue to strive as the world looks for more efficient combustion and hybrid powertrains. The remaining 20% of our net sales is comprised of our Power Drive Systems business unit, which was previously reported as ePropulsion and our battery and charging systems business unit except for engine control products. All of these sales generated from these two segments, our eProducts for hybrid and battery electric vehicles. These segments are expected to be significant drivers of our future growth. As these businesses continue to scale, we expect to capitalize on their growth by converting at mid-teens, which is what we are seeing this year. I also want to highlight our regional and customer diversity shown on the right side of the slide. Regionally, Americas, Europe and Asia, Rest of the World, each represent approximately a third of BorgWarner\u2019s net sales. We are also strongly positioned in terms of exposure to various customer groups. For example, our sales to the Chinese local OEMs represents roughly 15% of our overall net sales so far this year. This is comparable to our net sales to the German OEMs in Europe and our North American sales to the Detroit 3. I think this chart clearly shows BorgWarner\u2019s sales resiliency and highlights the benefits of strong diversification across products, customers and regions. To summarize, the takeaways from today are, BorgWarner\u2019s third quarter results were strong. Sales performance was slightly better than market production. Our adjusted operating margin was over 10%, and our cash generation was very strong. This allowed us to accelerate our second half $300 million share repurchase plan, taking our full year repurchases to $400 million. We secured new foundational and eProduct business awards in the quarter, which we believe once again demonstrate our product leadership on both sides of our portfolio, further supporting our focus on profitable growth over market production. As we look forward, our formula for success is unchanged. We expect to continue to secure business opportunities that will allow us to continue to grow faster than market production. As I mentioned before, BorgWarner\u2019s DNA is to focus on propulsion efficiency, which includes both combustion fuel efficiency and electrons efficiency for hybrids or BEVs. I expect efficiency to remain an industry trend for years to come and strong drivers of BorgWarner\u2019s growth regardless of propulsion architecture. We continue to seek to appropriately manage our cost structure as industry volumes and propulsion mix outlooks change while continuing to preserve our long-term profitable growth and product leadership edge. We believe this focus will allow BorgWarner to continue to deliver sales performance through organic growth above market convert that growth into higher earnings and create long-term value for our shareholders. With that, let me turn the call over to Craig. Craig Aaron : Thank you, Fred, and good morning, everyone. Before I dive into the financials, I\u2019d like to provide a quick overview of our third quarter results. First, we reported just over $3.4 billion in sales, which was down approximately 5% versus prior year, excluding FX and M&A. This was slightly above market production in the quarter, which was down approximately 6%, so we saw modest sales outgrowth in the quarter of approximately 50 basis points, which was primarily driven by European battery growth. Second, we had strong margin performance in the quarter at 10.1%. This was driven by solid operational performance, the continued benefit of restructuring actions we announced in July, our continued focus on cost controls across the business and customer recoveries. Third, we had strong free cash flow in the quarter of $201 million, which allowed us to accelerate our second half $300 million share repurchase plan. Importantly, we delivered this result while also continuing to organically invest in our business to support our focus on long-term profitable growth. Now, let\u2019s turn to Slide 8 for a look at our year-over-year sales walk for Q3. Last year\u2019s Q3 sales from continuing operations were just over $3.6 billion. You can see that the weakening U.S. dollar drove a year-over-year increase in sales of $4 million. Then you can see a decrease in organic sales of approximately 5% which was 50 basis points above market production, primarily due to strong European battery growth. And finally, the acquisition of Eldor added $9 million of sales year-over-year. The sum of all this was just over $3.4 billion of sales in Q3. Turning to Slide 9, you can see our earnings and cash flow performance for the quarter. Our third quarter adjusted operating income was $350 million, equating to a strong 10.1% margin. That compares to adjusted operating income from continuing operations of $349 million or a 9.6% margin from a year ago. On a comparable basis, adjusted operating income increased $15 million and $186 million of lower sales. This is a great result and reflects our ability to deliver profitability despite a declining production environment. This performance was partially helped by $24 million of favorable items related to customer recoveries for eProduct program volume shortfalls and the benefit of our PowerDrive Systems restructuring that we announced in July. The net impact of Eldor was a $14 million drag on operating income year-over-year. Our adjusted EPS from continuing operations was up $0.11 compared to a year ago as a result of strong adjusted operating income, a decline in our effective tax rate and the impact of $300 million in share repurchases during the quarter. And finally, free cash flow from continuing operations was $201 million during the third quarter, which was up $165 million from a year ago, as a result of strong working capital and capital expenditure performance. Now, let\u2019s take a look at our full year outlook on Slide 10. We are projecting total 2024 sales in the range of $14.0 billion to $14.2 billion, which is a reduction from our prior guidance of $14.1 billion to $14.4 billion. This reduction is due to a lower market production outlook and modestly lower eProduct sales. Despite the sales reduction, we expect the company to outgrow market production by 200 basis points to 300 basis points, which once again demonstrates the resiliency of our technology-focused portfolio that we believe is positioned to outgrow market production. Starting with foreign currencies. Our guidance now assumes an expected full year sales headwind from weaker foreign currencies of $20 million compared to 2023. Within this guidance, our full year end market assumption has been reduced to down 3% to 3.5% versus down 2% to 3% previously. Finally, the Eldor and SSE acquisitions are expected to add approximately $30 million to 2024 sales. Based on our updated outlook, we expect our organic sales change to be flat to down 1.5% year-over-year or outgrowth above industry production of 200 basis points to 300 basis points. Now, let\u2019s switch to margin. We are increasing our full year margin outlook to 9.8% to 10.0% from our prior guidance of 9.6% to 9.8%. This is based on our year-to-date performance and continued benefits of our PowerDrive Systems restructuring that we announced in July. This expected margin increase demonstrates the resiliency of our technology-focused portfolio and our ability to drive profitability in very challenging end markets. Our implied fourth quarter outlook assumes that our boat [ph] business delivers a mid-teens decremental conversion compared to our average year-to-date results, excluding the benefits of third quarter volume-related eProduct customer recoveries and second quarter stock forfeitures related to a senior executive retirement. We view this mid-teens decremental conversion as strong underlying performance given the anticipated 5% to 7% year-over-year decline in market production during the fourth quarter of 2024. Based on the sales and margin outlook, we\u2019re expecting full year adjusted EPS in the range of $4.15 to $4.30 per diluted share. This 4% EPS increase compared to our prior outlook is being driven by the impact of our strong third quarter results, a lower share count due to the third quarter execution of our share repurchase plan and a reduction in our full year effective tax rate. We continue to expect full year free cash flow to be in a range of $475 million to $575 million. Our ability to increase our margin and EPS guidance during a challenging production environment demonstrates our focus on managing costs in order to hold our prior guidance absolute income dollars, and we\u2019re doing this despite a significant reduction in global industry volumes. Now, let\u2019s turn to Slide 11 and take a look at how we will deploy our expected $475 million to $575 million in 2024 free cash flow. As I just highlighted, we expect another strong year of free cash flow generation. At the midpoint of our guidance, we expect to generate $525 million in free cash flow. It is important to note that $475 million of this cash flow has already been deployed to shareholders with $400 million of shares repurchased and $75 million of dividends already paid through the end of the third quarter. If we assume that we will declare and pay our consistent quarterly dividend in the fourth quarter, almost all of our expected free cash flow will be deployed to shareholders in 2024. We believe our ability to return capital to shareholders while also investing in the business demonstrates the underlying strength of the company and the importance of maintaining a strong balance sheet that allows us to invest in our long-term profitable growth and follow a balanced capital allocation approach that reward shareholders. So let me summarize my financial remarks. Overall, we delivered a strong third quarter with sales outperformance compared to industry production. We delivered a very strong 10.1% margin, which was 50 basis points higher than 2023 and the second quarter in a row with a margin above 10%. Additionally, we generated $201 million in free cash flow, which allowed us to accelerate our second half $300 million share repurchase plan. And we did this despite challenging market production in the quarter. This once again shows the resiliency of our technology-focused portfolio that we believe is positioned to outgrow industry production and deliver strong profitability and free cash flow. We are proud to be increasing our margin and EPS outlook for the second time this year despite a declining industry volume [Technical Difficulty] Connie, can you hear us? Patrick Nolan : I apologize for the audio interruption. Connie, if you can hear us, we can open up the call up for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll take our first question from Colin Langan, Wells Fargo. Colin Langan : Oh, great. Thanks for taking my questions and I congrats on a good quarter in a pretty tough market. I wanted to ask, if we go back to the Investor Day in June of last year, you actually talked about a 10% margin in 2027. Now I think at the high end of your guidance, you could be there this year, which is pretty impressive since the world has actually been a bit worse over the last 1.5 years. How should we think about margins from here? Is there anything kind of that might prevent you from getting above that 10%. It sounds like you expect to convert EV or ICE at the same contribution, so that would imply if we have growth, if we could kind of beat that 2027 target already? Craig Aaron : Yes, thanks Colin for the question. Can you hear me okay? Colin Langan : Yes. Craig Aaron : Okay, great. Let\u2019s start with the quarter. Overall, the quarter, really strong operational performance. As I mentioned in my script, we benefited from restructuring actions, a real focus on cost controls across the business. And I mentioned that we also had a bit of a tailwind from PDS volume-related customer recovery. So really pleased with our performance in the quarter. As you look to the fourth quarter, I think how you should look at our performance really two ways to look at it. First, against our average performance for the full year. If you look at that at the midpoint of our guide, we\u2019re expecting revenue to be down, let\u2019s just call it roughly 3% and when you remove the onetime items in the second quarter and the third quarter that I mentioned in my script, we\u2019re decrementing in the mid-teens, which is what you would expect. That\u2019s one way to look at our fourth quarter performance. That gets us to 9.6% for the guidance. If you look at our year-over-year performance for the fourth quarter, again, revenue down about 2% year-over-year, and we\u2019re actually holding incomes flat. Again, that gets us to 9.6% at the midpoint. So either way you look at it from our perspective, good operational performance in the fourth quarter. And I think we\u2019re focused on delivering that guidance at the midpoint, again, right around 9.6%. Colin Langan : I guess a follow-up on the long-term 10% target, you\u2019re pretty close. Anything that we should be thinking about as we think about 2025, 2026 that would sort of prevent getting above that target because it seems like you\u2019re pretty awful close? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : It\u2019s Frederic. It\u2019s not the time to talk about longer term. We\u2019re focusing on 2024. We\u2019re focusing on controlling our incremental or decremental for that matter. And I think you can see it in our guide and we\u2019ve talked about 2025 in the Q4 call. Colin Langan : Got it. All right. Thanks for taking my questions. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : Thank you, Colin. Craig Aaron : Thank you, Colin. Operator : And your next question comes from Dan Levy, Barclays. Dan Levy : Hi. Good morning. Thank you. I wanted to just double-click on the margin in 3Q. Based on the revenue decline at a 20% decremental, that would have been call it, a $37 million EBIT hit but instead you were plus 15% on the year-over-year. So that\u2019s a $50 million plus swing. It\u2019s even more if you\u2019re adjusting for Eldor. So maybe you can just decompose that? I know you mentioned there was the $24 million benefit for ePropulsion, but there\u2019s still another gap. And then maybe on the $24 million, how much of that is sort of recurring \u2013 sort of the ongoing restructuring benefit versus maybe a onetime benefit? Craig Aaron : Yes. Overall, when you look at the quarter, like you said, it was just really strong operational performance. We\u2019re benefiting from the PDS restructuring that we announced in July. We\u2019re benefiting from our focus of cost controls productivity, restructuring savings, et cetera. To answer your question, the $24 million of volume-related PDS customer recoveries, that\u2019s a onetime item in the quarter. You should not expect that to repeat quarter-after -quarter. Dan Levy : And what\u2019s the ongoing restructuring benefit? Craig Aaron : The PDS restructuring, you said $20 million to $30 million for the full year. Dan Levy : Okay. Got it. Thank you. Second, I appreciate with the new segment structure, we can now better see the battery business. If you could maybe just double click on the growth there. How much of that is just strong demand versus getting new supply online. I think a lot of it is new supply. What type of growth profile we can expect for this business? And then interesting to see that it\u2019s near breakeven, should we just assume that this is going to increment that your mid- to high teens and working your way up as you continue to grow? Just a way to think about sort of the margin profile of that business over time? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : Dan, I\u2019ll start. Yes, on the battery and challenging for the quarter, it was a good incremental of about 36%, strong sales, especially in Europe. And I think for \u2013 when you look at the segments too, on the other segment, there was a very, very efficient decremental on the way there, right? So we\u2019re really focused on controlling what we can control, adjusting to the volatility of the market and driving margin performance. And I think you can see that in the guide. I don\u2019t see a reason why this business should not carry on incrementing at the meeting. Dan Levy : And the supply versus demand dynamics, how much of this is just sort of new supply hitting? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : I would say the supply versus demand dynamic is not a dynamic where we are, let\u2019s say, short of supply, we now have aligned capacity to demand in both regions, North America and Europe. So this is behind us. Dan Levy : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Joe Spak, UBS. Joe Spak : Thank you. I guess, maybe just to sort of follow on Dan\u2019s question there with some of the new segmentation like, we have seen pretty steady improvement in the margins in battery and charging. And I know I think your capacity is sort of fully built out by the end of this year, and you\u2019re going to sort of fill that up. So is getting to positive margins, just sort of the remaining \u2013 filling up that sort of remaining capacity? Or are there other actions in that segment? Craig Aaron : Yes, it\u2019s really at scale. We got to continue to scale the business. So you saw revenue in the quarter coming in right around $200 million as we continue to scale that business and increment in the mid-teens, then we\u2019ll get to breakeven and above. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on doing. Joe Spak : And the build-out is effectively done this quarter? Craig Aaron : It\u2019s complete. Joe Spak : And then just Craig, you sort of stressed, I think a couple of times, right, all the cash generation was redeployed to shareholders this year between the buyback and the dividend. I appreciate we\u2019re sort of not talking about 2025 yet. But I mean, is that a sort of similar paradigm that we should expect going forward here over the coming years? Craig Aaron : Yes. We\u2019ll comment on 2025 when we get to 2025. Really happy with the way that we\u2019ve deployed cash this year. Again, as you mentioned, we have line of sight [ph] to $525 million at the midpoint of our guide. We\u2019ll effectively apply all of that to shareholders. I\u2019m really pleased with the way that we\u2019ve allocated capital this year. Again, we\u2019ll give you insight into 2025 as we get into February. Joe Spak : Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Adam Jonas : Thanks, everybody. Joe just asked my question on the free cash flow paradigm and how much of that\u2019s returned. So just one left for me. I know you\u2019re saying the $24 million of recoveries is onetime, won\u2019t be repeated. But it does seem like the narrative from your customers is pushed out, written off, canceled at the margin, EV programs and some of them are quite sizable, including from the likes of Ford and some others. We suspect that will continue. So I didn\u2019t know if that was, again, not calling out in a specific quarter or the occurrence of onetime items. But is \u2013 am I right that if I\u2019m looking ahead 12 months, there is a possibility for more recoveries from OEMs, given what has been announced and what you\u2019re seeing in your discussion so far of cancellations of E product and EV-related products that you spend money on and may not be made at anywhere near the volumes which you expected or at all? Thanks. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : Thanks. And yes, each case is specific. I would say that this case is a little exceptional. What we\u2019re focusing on at BorgWarner is also bringing flexibility from a modular design standpoint, flexibility from a production standpoint, reusing the four walls and transforming our plants from combustion into electrification in a measured way. So we are with our customers for the long run. And I would say that each case is very specific, and we\u2019re going to manage the business going forward depending on what\u2019s happening. Adam Jonas : Thanks, Fred. Operator : Your next question comes from John Murphy from Bank of America. John Murphy : Good morning guys. Fred, I just wanted to ask on Slide 6, when you look at something like the transfer case extension, how much new capital needs to go into investing in sort of that next-gen product? Is it minimal? And as we see these extensions on the ICE side, could the profits and returns be significantly or margins and returns could be significantly better than they have been historically or even just a bit better? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : Yes. I won\u2019t comment specifically on this transfer case program. But what we see from a combustion standpoint is you have three elements happening in the marketplace. First is program extension, like the transfer case, where some capital maybe have to be put in place to go with the extension and sometimes less. So that\u2019s the first case. Second case is program prolongations where the combustion engine is going to be run for longer. And the third case is hybrids carrying over combustion gasoline engines for an hybrid [ph] application. And that\u2019s what\u2019s driving also the outgrowth of the combustion market in that specific case. John Murphy : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then just a second question. A lot of other suppliers are kind of alluding to the bidding process or the program bidding process being pushed out quite dramatically. But once again, on Slide 6, you\u2019re showing some pretty good wins. I just wonder if you could characterize your quoting activity right now and if you think it\u2019s very different than history or disrupted by EVs, I mean, what\u2019s your current take on that? And is there anything that\u2019s really shifted maybe in absolute terms or maybe just timing terms? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : John, so what we\u2019re seeing is that in the Western world, there is a bit of a slowdown in new quoting activities for electrified powertrains. And I think one of the key reasons is that we\u2019re all focused on launching including at BorgWarner. There are many, many electrified hybrid and BEV launches in Europe and North America. And again, that opens other opportunities for us on the combustion with what I alluded to before extensions that the transfer case, prolongations and/or carrying over combustion engines into hybrid powertrains. So that\u2019s the dynamic that we see in the marketplace. Unidentified Analyst : But would it be fair to say that, that does not have a significant impact on your mid- to long-term growth over market prospects? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : We expect to have a portfolio that is resilient on the various propulsion architecture, mix scenario and regional mix scenario, and we expect to carry on outgrowing our respective markets. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : And your next question comes from Luke Junk from Baird. Luke Junk : Good morning. First question, Fred, just hoping you could \u2013 building on the last response there, just comment on your hybrid pipeline, specifically in \u2013 I\u2019d just be interested if you\u2019re seeing any evolution more on a bigger picture standpoint, I guess, relative to the regulatory backdrop and how you solve for that, both in Europe in U.S. from a powertrain standpoint, and the real hybrid is going to play in that. Thank you. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : For us, it\u2019s fairly simple. Our combustion portfolio is fully fungible into hybrid powertrains. The most advanced and modern hybrid powertrains carry most of our combustion products. And on an eProduct standpoint, as we mentioned in the past, an inverter for BEV is the same as an inverter for hybrid. So I\u2019m over simplifying, but the gas are the same the motor is actually pretty much the same. And a P4 [ph] for hybrid can be an IDM [ph] for BEV, it\u2019s the same types of products. So we are in a position to serve our customers globally into wherever they want to go from a powertrain architecture standpoint going forward. So for us, I wouldn\u2019t say that it doesn\u2019t really matter, but this is why we think we can carry on outgrowing the market or the markets and convert on that outlook. Luke Junk : And then for my follow-up, Craig, just wondering if we could get some flavor for incremental cost controls productivity. Just help us understand some of the areas that you\u2019re leaning into and what might carry over into 2025 for the back half of this year? Craig Aaron : I think we\u2019re leaning into all of those things. We\u2019re real focused across the business on cost controls. Luke, the items that you mentioned were \u2013 helped us in the quarter, whether it\u2019s restructuring actions, whether its continued focus on savings, whether that\u2019s supply chain or productivity, we\u2019re leaning into all that across the business. And I think you can see that in our segment performance through the first nine months. We\u2019ll continue to have that focus, especially as the top line stays very volatile. Luke Junk : Understood. Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from James Picariello from BNP Paribas. James Picariello : Hi guys. Just on the LVP assumption for this year, you\u2019re signaling down 2% to 2.5%. Like there are other suppliers out there that are calling for down 4 now, right, which implies the fourth quarter precipitous down something close to 10%. Just curious on your thoughts there and the visibility in your own build schedules, in your own customer mix, on that point. Yes, that\u2019s my first question. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : Hey James, our view is the market will be down 3% to 3.5% year-over-year. Our biggest reductions North America, Europe are down 5% to 5.5% year-over-year and with a slight increase in China. That\u2019s what we see. And we are going to carry on managing our costs effectively and adjust to potential production environment changes. And I think this is evidenced in our dated guide too. James Picariello : Yes, I was referring to just the light vehicle component, but yes, still splitting hairs [ph], I suppose. My follow-up is just as we think about your foundational product suite and the potential for hybrids to run much stronger in demand. Between your turbos and Thermal segment versus the drivetrain and more systems, how do you view hybrid demand between those two segments, again, on the foundational side is one position then the other if there\u2019s some kind of ranking that you could share? Thanks. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve broken down that potential. I would say that it would touch both segments of the most advanced hybrids carry engine components that we have in motors, in turbos and other subsystems. It will also carry everything related to shift shifting mechanism between the eDrive and the combustion driver hybrid. So I would say that advanced hybrid powertrain will grow products from those two essentially foundational segments. James Picariello : Thanks. Operator : And your next question comes from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Mark Delaney : Yes. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. First, I believe you are now assuming growth over market of 200 to 300 basis points. And I think it had been 350 to 450, assume for 2024 previously. So maybe you can help us better understand what\u2019s changing in the growth of our market outlook for this year. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : So Mark, our growth has dropped off about $200 million and a half, probably coming from eProduct portfolio. The other half is coming from our foundational business, which is about $100 million out of $12 billion [ph], I would say it is not extremely material so and from a quarter-over-quarter, our growth, I would not really look at it. We are year-to-date at 270 basis points. And I think it\u2019s now always smooth quarter-to-quarter. Mark Delaney : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. My other question was just following up on John\u2019s question around the pace of bookings and understanding the Western OEM bookings activity has slowed. I\u2019m curious if you think post-U.S. election results, if there\u2019s the potential for award activity from Western OEMs to accelerate once they have a better sense on the likely path of CO2 requirements in the coming years? Thanks. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : I am not sure I can comment on this. Let\u2019s wait and see. At least at BorgWarner, we\u2019re already wherever the customers want to go. Mark Delaney : Understood. Thank you. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : Thank you. Operator : We have time for one final question, and that question comes from Emmanuel Rosner with Wolfe Research. Emmanuel Rosner : Great. Thank you so much. I was hoping you can help us put a finer point on the cost actions and how do you think about them? How should we think about the amount of structural cost reduction that you\u2019re taking out this year? How do they annualize like into next year? Like how much of it is left over from more recent actions? And generally speaking, the programs you\u2019ve announced or you have in place, how much cost is left to take out? Craig Aaron : Yes. Thanks for the question. So I\u2019ll point to the PDS restructuring because those are structural changes that we\u2019re making. What we indicated this year is $20 million to $30 million. We announced that in July. So if you annualize that $40 million to $60 million next year with a target of $100 million by 2026. Those are structural changes that we\u2019re making. As you think about our business as we move forward, even with these restructuring actions, what\u2019s our goal? Our goals are to grow over the market from a sales perspective, turn that growth into income in the mid-teens, regardless of the growth is on the foundational product side of the portfolio and to generate cash. So I think, ultimately, how you should think about our growth is incrementing in the mid-teens. That\u2019s a great way to model it. Emmanuel Rosner : Thank you for the color. And then I was hoping to hone in a little bit more again on the commercial vehicle battery business. Can you maybe talk to us about BorgWarner\u2019s competitive advantages in that business and then also the operating leverage on this business specifically. Obviously, very strong incrementals that we just saw, then I think your earlier comments spoke about no reason why you shouldn\u2019t stay in the mid-teens. That\u2019s obviously quite a big difference between 40% and the mid-teens. So maybe the longer-term question is, okay, what are BorgWarner\u2019s competitive advantages, but maybe shorter term is how do you think about the operating leverage, please? Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : So from a product perspective, Emmanuel, as you know, we are focused only on commercial vehicle trucks and buses. With this, we are pretty agnostic from a sales form perspective, in production within NMC and preparing production with LFP in the light of our association with FinDreams. We have capacity installed in both sides of the ponds in the U.S. and in Europe. And we are in charge of software, cybersecurity, assembly of the pack, testing of the pack and everything that goes around the pack, which I think is pretty differentiated. And we are one of the only one in the Western world building very impactful commercial vehicle trucks and buses as an independent supplier. Craig Aaron : Yes. And I\u2019ll comment on the margin profile. Obviously, really happy with the performance of that business. It grew quite significantly in the quarter, converted at a really high level, like you mentioned, about $0.35 on the dollar. As we move forward, I wouldn\u2019t say one quarter makes a trend. So we\u2019re focused on that business, incrementing in the mid-teens like all of our other businesses. That\u2019s how we\u2019ll measure success for the battery business in the charging business. Emmanuel Rosner : Thank you. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : Thank you. Patrick Nolan : With that, I\u2019d like to apologize for the audio issues that we had today, and thank you all for your great questions. If you have additional follow-ups, feel free to reach out to me or my team. With that, Connie, you can go ahead and conclude today\u2019s call. Operator : This does conclude the BorgWarner 2024 Third Quarter Results Conference Call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Nick, and I will be your conference specialist. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BorgWarner 2024 Fourth Quarter and Full Year Results Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Press star two. I would now like to turn the conference over to Patrick Nolan, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Nolan, you may begin your conference. Patrick Nolan : Thank you, Nick, and good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining us today. We issued our earnings release earlier this morning. It's posted on our website borgwarner.com, both on the homepage and on our investor relations homepage. With regard to our investor relations calendar, we will be attending multiple conferences. You can see the events section of our IR page for a full list. Before we begin, I need to inform you that during this call, we may make forward-looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties detailed in our 10-Ks. Our actual results may differ significantly from the matters discussed today. During today's presentation, we will highlight certain non-GAAP measures in order to provide a clearer picture of how the core business performed and for comparison purposes with prior periods. If you hear us say \"on a comparable basis,\" that means excluding the impact of FX, net M&A, and other non-comparable items. If you hear us say \"adjusted,\" that means excluding non-comparable items. When you hear us say \"organic,\" that means excluding the impact of FX and net M&A. We will also refer to our incremental margin performance. Our incremental margin is defined as the organic change in our adjusted operating income divided by the organic change in our sales. Our all-in incremental margin includes our planned investment in R&D, any impact from inflationary impacts, and other costs. Lastly, we will refer to our growth compared to our market. When you hear us say \"market,\" it is weighted for our geographic exposure. Please note that we have posted today's earnings call presentation to the IR page of our website. We encourage you to follow along with these slides during our discussion. With that, I'm happy to turn the call over to Fred. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lissalde : Thank you, Pat, and good day, everyone. We're pleased to share our results for 2024 and provide a company update starting on Slide five. We delivered approximately $14 billion in sales, which was relatively flat versus 2023. Our industry production for the full year was down approximately 3%. We saw a solid 2024 outgrowth of about 280 basis points. I'm pleased that the outgrowth is both on the foundational and on the e-product side of our portfolio. This demonstrates to me the resiliency of these portfolios and our ability to drive our growth in particularly challenging and volatile end markets. As Joe will detail, we finished the year by securing multiple new product awards for both foundational and e-products, which we believe further supports our long-term profitable growth. Our adjusted operating margin performance was strong, coming in above 10% and above the high end of our guide. This strong underlying operational performance was once again driven by our focus on cost control across the businesses. As a result, our full-year adjusted earnings per share grew by 15%. We delivered $729 million of free cash flow and also exceeded our full-year guidance. As Craig will detail, we remain well-positioned to continue to generate strong free cash flow in 2025. We will do this while also investing in our business to support our focus on long-term profitable growth in efficient powertrains. Today is my final earnings call with BorgWarner. Before I turn it over to Joe, I would like to share a few thoughts with you. I believe that BorgWarner is positioned to grow at the pace of the powertrain mix change. I also firmly believe that BorgWarner is well-equipped, thanks to its decentralized operating model, to excel in a more regionalized powertrain outlook. I have spent 26 years at BorgWarner. I'm proud of the work that was done. I'm proud of our very special combustion portfolio and of the portfolio enhancements that we have executed over the past ten years. We created what I believe is one of the most powerful propulsion portfolios in the world while still keeping at the same time our strong culture, maintaining a double-digit margin, and a free cash flow generation that is quite unique in our tier-one auto supplier world. I want to thank our board of directors, who have been a key sounding board for me with unwavering support for the implementation of our strategies. I want to thank my team members for their stewardship to BorgWarner, their resiliency, and their leadership. I, of course, want to thank all the BorgWarner employees around the world who are making a key difference each and every day. I've been working with Joe on the CEO transition over the past few months, and I've collaborated with Joe over the past 15 years. I have full confidence that Joe is the leader that BorgWarner needs. I also want to thank the analyst community. It's been a pleasure to interact with you over the past few years, interactions that have made me stronger and from which I have always learned. And finally, of course, I would like to thank the shareholders for their trust. With that, I'm excited to turn the call over to you, Joe. Joe Spak : Thank you, Fred. On behalf of the management team and all of our employees, I would just like to thank you for your leadership over the last 26 years and especially the last seven as CEO. I also want to personally thank you for your mentorship and friendship over the years. You've been an inspirational leader to me, and I believe you've clearly positioned the company well for our next phase of profitable growth. We wish you nothing but success as you move on to the next chapter and hope you enjoy your well-deserved retirement. Now let's turn to Slide six for what I view as the drivers of BorgWarner's value proposition. First and foremost, we have what I view as a strong product portfolio that is resilient to the varied pace of propulsion mix changes that we see across the world. Second, we have strong market share positions across our foundational portfolio, with several of our e-products also improving their market share position. Third, I view BorgWarner's financial strength as a key driver of our success. It allows us to continue to invest in our business regardless of near-term fluctuations in market volumes or mix. Our financial strength is also a differentiator when our customers award us new business. And our financial strength is a direct end result of the financial discipline ingrained into the company's culture. Fourth, the long-term relationships that we've established with our light vehicle and commercial vehicle customers around the world are also a very important driver of our success. These relationships allow us to partner with our consumers to meet their efficiency and value needs beyond just pursuing individual program awards. Lastly, I firmly believe that our decentralized operating model creates speed, accountability, and agility. The agility afforded by our operating model allows us to navigate these times of industry turmoil like we are currently experiencing. With that said, Craig is going to review our detailed 2025 outlook in a few moments. We expect another year of declining industry volumes combined with the uncertainty of tariff implications. As such, let's turn to Slide seven, which outlines our strategic focus areas for 2025 and beyond. First, we aim to outgrow industry production by leveraging our core competencies. BorgWarner's DNA remains focused on efficiency, which includes both fuel efficiency for combustion vehicles and electron efficiency for hybrids and BEVs. Our anticipated outgrowth reflects our customers' demand for efficient propulsion products around the world. In combination with our strong product portfolio and deep customer relationships, we plan to continue to help the world deliver innovative and sustainable mobility solutions for a clean, energy-efficient world, which we believe will drive industry outgrowth for years to come. Second, we must continue to build upon our existing product portfolio. We plan to achieve this by continuing to make thoughtful organic and inorganic investments where we see a strong business case that delivers value to shareholders. Organically, our focus will be to accelerate our scale and gain additional market share across our entire portfolio, and we need to stay focused on driving a product culture that nurtures innovation. Inorganically, we intend to explore opportunities to improve our current market share positions or product adjacencies where we can apply BorgWarner's core competencies. We believe there will be high-quality opportunities in front of us due to the turbulence in our industry. Lastly, we must continue to drive enhanced financial performance. To me, this means striving to expand margins and generating strong cash flow. We will do this through business excellence. We'll achieve this by continuing to actively manage our cost structure as we navigate volatile industry volumes, changing regional propulsion mix, and launching new businesses across the globe. We believe it will be important to balance all these factors in order to preserve BorgWarner's strong financial foundation and enhance our margin and cash flow generation as we grow profitably. Now let's look at some new product awards on Slide eight, which I believe are strong indicators of our future profitable growth. First, BorgWarner has secured an award to supply a state-of-the-art variable cam timing system to a major East Asian OEM for their next-generation hybrid and gasoline engines. BorgWarner's VCT system dynamically optimizes the timing of intake and exhaust valve events, improving combustion efficiency and reducing emissions. These advanced engines will power a range of the customer's hybrid and combustion vehicles, delivering improved fuel economy and reducing environmental impacts. Production of these engines is scheduled to commence in the first quarter of 2026. Second, BorgWarner is expanding our partnership with a major North American-based OEM by extending four wastegate turbocharger programs for i4 and V6 engine platforms. These turbocharger extensions will be deployed on several of the automaker's midsize and large SUVs, as well as truck applications, with the start of production set to begin in 2026. BorgWarner has a longstanding relationship with this OEM, having supplied them with our turbochargers over the last 20 years. We believe these platform extensions are a testament to the strong collaboration between our engineering teams, and we look forward to continuing our work together through the rest of this decade and beyond. Third, BorgWarner will supply two types of transfer cases to SAIC Maxus for use in export vehicles. Both products are designed by BorgWarner's China R&D team and will be manufactured in China, with mass production expected to begin in 2026. BorgWarner's relationship with SAIC Maxus spans more than a decade. Our transfer case technology not only supports SAIC Maxus in strengthening its position in the Chinese market but also empowers its expansion into overseas markets. Finally, BorgWarner has secured four e-motor awards with three major Chinese OEMs, used on plug-in hybrids, range-extended hybrids, and electric vehicle platforms. These programs are expected to launch in 2025 and 2026. We are pleased to secure this business in the Chinese market. We believe these awards further validate our innovative technology and manufacturing processes, delivering high-quality products and services to meet the evolving needs of the Chinese new energy vehicle market. To summarize, the takeaways from today are that BorgWarner ended 2024 with strong results. We delivered 2024 outgrowth of just under 3%. Our adjusted operating margin was over 10%, and our free cash flow generation was very strong. Over the course of the year, we secured new foundational and e-product business awards, which we believe once again demonstrate our product leadership on both sides of our portfolio. As we look forward, we are expecting to deliver another solid year in 2025 as we focus on what we can control. As Craig will detail, our guidance includes that we expect to outgrow industry production, deliver an adjusted operating margin above 10%, and continue to generate strong free cash flow. My priorities align with our 2025 outlooks as we will strive to secure new business awards that will allow us to continue to outgrow industry production. We will build upon our existing product portfolio by increasing our e-product scale and gaining market share. We plan to do this through fostering a culture of innovation, customer intimacy, and thoughtful portfolio investments that drive shareholder value. And finally, we continue to drive enhanced financial performance. It's this financial strength and discipline of this company that help differentiate us from our peers, and we intend to continue to focus on that strength as I take over as CEO. If we effectively execute these priorities, I believe we will be well-positioned to continue to grow the earnings power of BorgWarner, which we believe will drive long-term value for our shareholders for years to come. With that, I'll turn the call over to Craig. Craig Aaron : Thank you, Joe. Good morning, everyone. Before I dive into the financials, I'd like to provide a quick overview of our fourth-quarter results. First, we reported just over $3.4 billion in sales, which was down approximately 2% versus the prior year, excluding FX and M&A. Market production in the quarter was down approximately 4%, so we saw sales outgrowth in the quarter of approximately 220 basis points, which was slightly below our full-year outgrowth of 280 basis points. Second, we had strong adjusted operating margin performance in the quarter at 10.2%. This was driven by solid operational performance, a continued focus on cost controls across the business, and restructuring actions. This strong fourth-quarter performance allowed us to deliver a full-year adjusted operating margin above 10%, which was up 50 basis points from 2023. Third, we had strong free cash flow in the quarter, up $539 million, which allowed us to outperform our 2024 free cash flow guidance and deliver $729 million in free cash flow for the full year. Now let's turn to Slide nine for a look at our year-over-year sales walk for Q4. Last year's Q4 sales from continuing operations were just over $3.5 billion. You can see that the weakening U.S. Dollar drove a year-over-year decrease in sales of $32 million. Then you can see a decrease in organic sales of about 1.5%, which was 220 basis points above market production. This outgrowth was primarily due to strong e-product growth in Europe and Asia, as well as strong foundational growth in Europe, North America, and the rest of the world. In China, we saw challenges in the quarter due to lower volumes on an existing EV program, which we previously highlighted, and declining foundational sales. Finally, the acquisition of Eldor added $6 million of sales year over year. The sum of all this was just over $3.4 billion of sales in Q4. Turning to Slide ten, you can see our earnings and cash flow for the fourth quarter. Adjusted operating income was $352 million, equating to a strong 10.2% adjusted operating margin. That compares to adjusted operating income from continuing operations of $332 million or a 9.4% adjusted operating margin from a year ago. On a comparable basis, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and M&A, adjusted operating income increased $37 million on $57 million of lower sales. This is a great result and reflects our ability to deliver profitability despite a declining production environment. This performance was driven by the benefit of our PowerDrive systems restructuring that we announced in July, as well as our continued focus on cost controls across our business. The net impact of Eldor was a $12 million drag on operating income year over year. Our adjusted EPS from continuing operations was up $0.11 compared to a year ago as a result of strong adjusted operating income, lower net interest expense, and the impact of our share repurchases. This was partially offset by a higher effective tax rate due to various tax restructuring initiatives that we executed in the quarter. Free cash flow from continuing operations was $539 million during the fourth quarter, which was down $140 million from a year ago as a result of lower business activity compared to 2023 and the timing of customer payments. Our free cash flow for the full year was strong at $729 million. Finally, I'd like to briefly address the $646 million of goodwill and fixed asset impairment charges that we recorded during the fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter of each year, we perform an impairment test. The discounted cash flow analysis we perform requires us to make long-term estimates of our sales and operating income and compare that to the carrying value of each business unit. Due to the continuing delay of BEV adoption across the Western world, our discounted cash flow estimates for our PowerDrive system and Battery and Charging Systems business units from prior years had to be reduced and pushed out. As a result, the company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $577 million in the fourth quarter. We also recorded a charge of $69 million primarily related to certain property, plant, and equipment. It's important to note that these items are non-cash and have a minimal impact on the future earnings or margin profile of the company. In our opinion, the delay of BEV adoption in parts of the Western world is exactly why we have built a resilient technology-focused portfolio that we believe will provide strong results no matter the pace of regional propulsion adoption. If regional BEV adoption continues to be delayed, we believe our foundational portfolio will compensate with significant margin and free cash flow generation. Next on Slide eleven, I would like to review our perspective on global industry production for 2025. We expect our global weighted and light commercial vehicle markets to be down 1% to 3% this year. In 2024, this forecast includes potential industry volume headwinds of global tariffs. Looking at this by region from a light vehicle perspective, we're planning for our weighted North American markets to be down approximately 3% to 4%, primarily driven by inventory headwinds and potential inflation due to tariffs. In Europe, we expect our weighted market to be down approximately 4% to 6% year over year as we see signs of a lower backlog and economic headwinds. In China, we expect the overall market to be flat to down 1%. This is due to a tough comparison following last year's growth and the possible economic impact of tariffs. With that in mind, now let's take a look at our full-year outlook on Slide twelve. First, as I just highlighted, we have included some level of industry volume headwinds from tariffs in our market volume assumptions. However, we have not incorporated the net cost of tariffs in our financial guidance at this time since the impact to BorgWarner is influenced by multiple factors. These include, but are not limited to, the timing of implementation, any exemption on imported materials, and our ability to share the impact with our customers and suppliers. Now let's move to our outlook. We are projecting total 2025 sales in the range of $13.4 billion to $14 billion. Starting with foreign currencies, our guidance assumes an expected full-year sales headwind from weaker foreign currencies of $410 million compared to 2024. As I just highlighted, we expect our end markets to be down 1% to 3% for the year. However, we expect the company to outperform market production by 100 to 300 basis points, which once again demonstrates the resiliency of our portfolio that we believe is positioned to outgrow market production. It's important to note that our guidance includes a 30 basis point outgrowth headwind from lower battery cell prices, which we directly pass through to our customers. Based on our updated outlook, we expect our organic sales change to be down 2% to up 2% year over year. Now let's switch to margin. We expect our full-year adjusted operating margin to be in the range of 10.0% to 10.2% compared to our 2024 adjusted operating margin of 10.1%. The low end of our margin outlook contemplates the business delivering a full-year decremental conversion in the low double digits, while the high end of our outlook assumes an incremental conversion in the high teens. We view this as strong underlying performance building off of 2024 that well exceeded our expectations. Based on this sales and margin outlook, we're expecting full-year adjusted EPS in the range of $4.05 to $4.40 per diluted share. We expect full-year free cash flow to be in the range of $650 million to $750 million, with the 2025 midpoint being a decline versus 2024's strong result due to FX headwind. With that, that's our 2025 outlook. So let me summarize my financial remarks. Overall, we delivered solid 2024 results despite a difficult production environment. We delivered a very strong 10.1% margin, which was 50 basis points higher than 2023 and well ahead of the 9.2% to 9.6% margin reflected in our initial 2024 guidance. This great performance is a result of our focus on appropriately managing our costs across our business. We generated strong free cash flow of $729 million. Now as we look ahead to 2025, our outlook aligns with the priorities Joe highlighted earlier. First, we expect to continue to outperform market production with an expected full-year outgrowth of 100 to 300 basis points despite headwinds from battery cell pricing and BEV program delays. Second, we expect to once again deliver an adjusted operating margin above 10%. We believe this shows our ability to manage our cost structure effectively even in light of a declining production environment. Finally, we expect to have another year of strong free cash flow, which we believe, in combination with our investment-grade balance sheet, will allow us to continue to invest in our business while navigating a challenging and uncertain market backdrop. As I look back on our 2024 results and our 2025 outlook, I'm extremely proud of the BorgWarner team around the globe and their ability to deliver strong financial results during a challenging and volatile market backdrop. With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Pat. Patrick Nolan : Thank you, Craig. Nick, we're ready to open it up for questions. Operator : At this time, we will pause momentarily to assemble our Q&A roster. And your first question today will come from John Murphy with Bank of America ML. Please go ahead. John Murphy : Good morning, everybody, and Fred, congratulations. Look forward to visiting you in Burgundy. It'd be a lot of fun, hopefully. And, Joe, I apologize. You're gonna have to deal with us now. But thank you. First question, the portfolio that is well balanced almost in whichever direction powertrains go seems like a very good way to be positioned, and you're set there. Just curious as you look at sort of the short-term swings that we're seeing in programs, stuff like Ford canceling the three-row EV last year, when those shifts happen very quickly, how well do you think the portfolio is hedged? And do you think you pick up those lost sales with something like the Explorer, the ICE version, or something like that? How quickly did that get balanced out? And maybe sort of, with that, is that one of the key drivers of why we're seeing this $100 million variance in inorganic sales, or what else is driving that $600 million organic variance? Joe Spak : Yes. Hi, John. So you look at the RFQs outside of China, they have been slowing a little bit, and we've seen some delays or cancellations. On the other side, we see more RFQs for foundational products, and those usually result in higher volumes of our existing products we're serving a customer with, or it might be extensions because they've delayed an EV truck or SUV. So we're in a great position to take advantage of that and also be ready when they launch those new programs on EVs in the markets. John Murphy : Okay. And that $100 million organic variance in the 2025 outlook, is that being driven by deltas in volume or program shifts? What's the key driver of that variance? Joe Spak : So for the outlook, or let's say the 2024 results, as you know, we outgrew those markets in that 2% to 3% range. As we look forward, we continue to expect that outgrowth as Craig had mentioned, in 2025. John Murphy : Okay. And then just maybe one quick follow-up, if you could just remind us what your China exposure is right now with domestics versus international players and where you think that's gonna land in 2025 and how much it may shift towards the domestics in the next few years? Joe Spak : Specifically in China? John Murphy : In China specifically, yes. Joe Spak : Yes. So as you know, China is about 20% of our global sales. And in China, 75% of our total sales are with the Chinese OEMs. So we're very well positioned with them as they grow in their domestic market and in support of their strong export. One other thing I mentioned, 90% of that business is on NEV with those domestic OEMs. So we're in a great position. John Murphy : That's very helpful. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question today will come from Colin Langan with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Colin Langan : Oh, great. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats, Fred, on your retirement. It's been a pretty impressive pivot to e-powertrains under your leadership. On e-powertrains, any color on how e-products should perform this year? I noticed the battery side was a bit weaker sequentially, and I think there's some slowing in North America you've indicated. Should we start seeing help? I know Europe with regulations, there should be a light vehicle bounce there. Likely some increase in the US. Does that start showing up in maybe the second half? Or how should we think about that? Joe Spak : So Colin, we are growing year over year in the e-product business. It is softened a little bit mainly due to the battery business, which you referenced. The way we, I guess, you want to think about it is we are flat year over year in battery sales. When it comes to units, the revenue was down a little bit mainly due to cell pricing, which is bringing the overall revenue down. But overall, it's, you know, greater than a $600 million business. We really like that Akasol business we bought, and it's ahead of where we purchased it despite a lot of the turmoil and despite the lower cell pricing. Colin Langan : Got it. And then the guide for this year has 200 basis points growth over market. In the past, you've kind of talked about 4%. You've called out a couple of things. I mean, should we think about eventually getting back to something like a 4% or is this lower EV adoption just kind of holding that back for several years from now? Joe Spak : Yeah. The past few years, our outgrowth has been in that 2% to 3% range. So 2025 is close to this range. You know, my focus is really on outgrowing our markets. We think the portfolio is the right one. In the short term, the biggest driver in 2025 of the lower outgrowth is the delay of a North American EV program, which we previously disclosed. And as I mentioned, the cell pricing on the battery pack business. My focus is really to outgrow on both sides of the portfolio. So we want our foundational products to do what they can to expand market share, and we're in a great position because, as you know, on our foundational products, we're number one or number two in that side of the business. And then on the e-side, as new launches and RFQs start to come out, we're in a good position to also outgrow those markets. Colin Langan : Got it. Alright. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : And your next question today will come from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Ryan Brinkman : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just curious, with regard to the products that you manufacture and the extent to which they are installed on products in Mexico versus, you know, brought across the US border. And then what any preliminary conversations with automakers might look like in terms of the pass-through of any potential tariff costs. Thank you. Joe Spak : Yeah. Ryan, let me take that one. So I'll start by saying we generally produce in the same regions as our customers produce. But when we look at 2024, and the amount of imported material and value to the US, it was about $875 million. When you break that down, about half of it originated in Mexico, 10% of it originated in Canada, and 5% originated in China. Ultimately, there's a lot of news going on right now. We're going to continue to watch that. But ultimately, if there's an impact to BorgWarner, we're going to need to find a way to share that with our customers and our suppliers. That's how we're thinking about it. Ryan Brinkman : Great. Thanks much. Operator : Thank you. And your next question today will come from Luke Junk with Baird. Please go ahead. Luke Junk : Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions and my congratulations. Maybe starting with the outgrowth, hoping you could just help us understand at least directionally what that assumes for e-products and PowerDrive. I guess I'm looking specifically in Europe where you had a big launch here in 2024 and in China relative to what are, of course, continued tailwinds around NEV adoption overall? And I guess any offsets we should be thinking beyond what you've already mentioned in any distinct book of business in either Geo as well? Thank you. Joe Spak : Yeah. Hi, Luke. So we see EV adoption increasing year over year in all the markets. When we think about our segments, one of the things we did last July, as you recall, we organized into four operating segments to give better transparency in how each of those businesses are performing. So we think that's going to be a good indicator of how the businesses are performing in terms of outgrowth. Luke Junk : Got it. And then for my follow-up, I'm hoping you could just maybe expand on your comments around foundational awards. It's now been a couple of quarters in a row you've highlighted a good number of foundational awards. As you mentioned, you're seeing a reacceleration in RFQs. I just want to try to square how that might translate to outgrowth, not this year, but looking out 2026-2027. And especially, you know, it seems like there may have been a lull just given where the industry's focus was a few years ago in those awards. And how that might translate to some pickup in 2026 plus? Thank you. Joe Spak : Yeah. As you mentioned, we have highlighted awards on both sides of our portfolio and an increasing number on the foundational side. I think that speaks to the strength of our portfolio. And as customers are evolving their cycle plans, they're looking toward us since we're number one or number two in those foundational products to support them. Those often look like program extensions. In some cases, it may be some new programs that they're putting out for bid. But I think what's important here is we want to help grow across our entire portfolio. And those are great examples that we highlighted. You see wins in both the foundational and on the e-side. Luke Junk : Understood. Thank you. Operator : And your next question today will come from Joe Spak with UBS. Please go ahead. Joe Spak : Thanks. And, Fred, again, my congrats as well. Enjoy. Just maybe one on the guidance, just a little bit more color. I just want to understand, like, that is what you're saying that, you know, that North America weighted down 3% to 4%. I think if we look at some third parties, it's closer to down 2%. Is that delta sort of the, you know, I guess, conservatism you're sort of putting in for maybe some disruption as to what could happen if tariffs come in? I just want to be clear on that. And then I don't think I heard, I turned a little bit late, I don't think I heard sort of any, you know, e-products overall. I know you have the new segments, but any sort of e-products sort of expectations for this year? Is there any color you can provide there just so we could sort of, you know, track, I guess, performance relative to some of the underlying market dynamics? Joe Spak : Yeah. So starting with some color on the market, we formulate our industry forecast internally. And directionally for the last few years, we've been fairly accurate. You know, when we think about the global markets, maybe we can break it down a little bit. So that minus 1% to minus 3%, starting with North America, down 3% to 4%. As you know, there's a lot of inventory in the system. We've also baked in a little bit of headwinds pending tariffs that may come. In Europe, 4% to 6% down due to signs of both the backlog and economic headwinds that they're seeing. China is a brighter spot. They're flat to down 1%. So that's a little bit of color on your first question. Yeah. I'll jump in with sales. So I reported 2024 sales a little over $2.3 billion for e-products. As we move forward, you'll see disclosure in our 10-Qs breaking out e-products from foundational. And so you'll see that as we move forward. Joe Spak : But anything on e-products in relation to the overall guidance? We're not providing that outlook. As Joe indicated, our focus is outgrowth on both sides of our portfolio. Joe Spak : Okay. I heard the second question is thinking in some of your prepared remarks, you talked about building on your portfolio organically and inorganically. And I don't think that's a change from what you've talked about in the past as an organization. Right. You know, there had been some messaging or communication that, you know, inorganic has been paused. I guess I'm wondering, as you sort of take over here, how you think about that going forward, especially since we've seen some, you know, activity in M&A in the space, and I'd say I would even say sort of more broadly in the markets. Like, do you expect a little bit more focus on inorganic opportunities as we move forward from here? Joe Spak : Yeah. So we will continue to invest organically as our top priority. We have a terrific product portfolio, and we see lots of opportunities to keep building on that and growing that to outgrow the market. We will continue to look at acquisitions as it remains an important part of our strategy. So the industry turbulence that we're all witnessing right now actually provides a unique opportunity for BorgWarner given our financial strength. So as we execute them, if we execute them, it'll be in a very thoughtful way. And our focus is to create long-term shareholder value. Operator : Thank you. And your next question today will come from Edison Yu with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Edison Yu : Thank you for taking the questions and congrats, Fred. I wanted to ask about eRev. You've obviously had quite a bit of success in China with that. How are those conversations going in the US and Europe? And do you think the volumes there could, you know, in three or four years, be similar? Joe Spak : So we have seen some success on eRevs in China, as you mentioned. I would say the other regions are starting to look at eRevs as a way to, especially in the truck market, meet all the requirements for our customers, but also provide, you know, better overall fuel economy and emission reduction. So we don't see it in big volumes just yet, but we do see it as an emerging option architecture for the customers to meet their emission requirements. Edison Yu : Understood. And just one thing on the guidance for China. Are you assuming the scrappage incentives still continue? I think there's probably, to your point, you know, you mentioned some risk, but in terms of the upside, curious what kind of you're assuming there? Joe Spak : No. We're really looking at a China market that is flattish year over year. So we haven't factored that in at this point. Edison Yu : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question today will come from Emmanuel Rosner with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Emmanuel Rosner : Thank you. My first question is on the CapEx outlook. Can you provide a little more context around the lower CapEx budget and to what extent this extra free cash flow would go, you know, towards buybacks versus something else? Joe Spak : Yes. So let me address CapEx. When you go back a few years, our CapEx was in kind of the mid-5s as a percent of sales, 5.5%, 5.4%. We saw this year come down to below 5%. Our guidance as we look at it this year is maintaining that around the high 4s, low 5s as a percentage of sales. So that's how you should think about it. From a buyback perspective, we have not announced any specific plans. So I wanted to address that a little bit. You know, when we step back and think about buybacks as a company, we've deployed a lot of cash to shareholders, about $3.4 billion since 2020. So we've deployed a lot of cash to our shareholders. I want to step back and talk about our goal. Our goal as a company is to really focus on earnings and cash flow, grow earnings and cash flow over time. And as we think about buybacks for this year, we're going to use the full power of BorgWarner to focus on earnings growth, to focus on full cash and cash flow growth. As we continue throughout the year, we'll look at this lever as an item to pull, and we'll look at it appropriately as we move forward. That's how we're thinking about buybacks this year. Emmanuel Rosner : Got it. That's helpful. And then how are you thinking about the growth outlook this year and also beyond for EV products in China, specifically given very competitive market dynamics? Joe Spak : Yes. So, I mean, more broadly speaking, 20% of our total business is in China. And as we mentioned, we're very strong with the Chinese OEMs. In fact, the Chinese OEMs have over 90% of the market share on EVs, and they are 75% of our business. So we feel very well positioned with the Chinese, whether they're serving the domestic market or, as we've seen in the last few years, exporting those vehicles. Operator : We have time for one final question, and that question comes from Dan Levy with Barclays. Please go ahead. Dan Levy : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking questions, and Fred, congratulations to you. Wanted to first just start with a follow-up on that last question there. PowerDrive was disappointing or soft in 2024. Maybe you can give us a flavor for what turns around in that business. And maybe you could just comment or remind us why Asia, in PowerDrive, was as soft as it was despite EV in China doing as well as it did. Joe Spak : Yeah. Maybe I'll start on the year-over-year performance. So we were down a little over $200 million in sales. When you think about that, that was really on the foundational side of their portfolio as a customer program. When you look at the e-side of the portfolio, it was actually relatively flat. There was just volatility in the market. I'll let Joe comment on going forward. Joe Spak : Right. So as we look forward in 2025, we're in the middle of launching a number of new products and platforms. So that's what's really bringing the additional growth on the PowerDrive side of the business. Dan Levy : And how much of that is China? Joe Spak : Yes, we don't break out specifically China, but let's say that they're a strong, they've got a strong position in the overall market. Let Pat maybe cover that in a follow-up. Dan Levy : Okay. Thank you. And then as a follow-up, wanted to just understand the EBIT bridge. And maybe we could just compare versus 2024 because on organic revenue, flat or down slightly, you still had EBIT up some $60 million. Now in 2025, you know, you've talked about restructuring benefits for e-product. And I would presume there's going to be some pricing benefits for programs that you've tooled for, but the volume is never appreciated. So why aren't we seeing maybe a little more margin benefit given these? Joe Spak : Yeah. So let me walk through the guide. When you start with last year's sales of $14.1 billion, the midpoint of our guide is $13.7 billion. And when you look at the difference and exclude foreign exchange, again, that $410 million, we're basically slightly up about 40 basis points against the market backdrop that we expect is down 2%. So that's where you get about our 250 basis points of outgrowth. As you look at our EBIT line, we're maintaining 10.1% on that relatively flat sales. As we look at the low end of the guide, we're basically decrementing at 10%. At the high end, in the mid-teens. So we feel really good about the performance that you're seeing in the guide. That's how we're thinking about it. It does incorporate the savings year over year from our e-product restructuring. Dan Levy : And what was unique in 2024 that is not repeating in 2025 that you had such strong incrementals? Joe Spak : I think when you look at our performance in 2024, we really focused on restructuring savings. We focused on cost controls across the business, including GSM and productivity. And we're maintaining that as we look into this year. And so we feel really good with where we landed in 2024 and this outlook for 2025. We're going to keep our focus on cost controls as we move forward. Dan Levy : Okay. Thank you. Patrick Nolan : Thank you all for your great questions today. If you have additional follow-ups, feel free to reach out to me or my team. With that, Nick, you can go ahead and conclude today's call. Operator : Thank you. This concludes the BorgWarner 2024 Fourth Quarter and Full Year Results Conference Call. You may now disconnect.",
